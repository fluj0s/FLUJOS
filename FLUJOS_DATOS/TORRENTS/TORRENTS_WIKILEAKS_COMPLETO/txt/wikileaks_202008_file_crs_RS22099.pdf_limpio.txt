sellers borrow shares from broker sell th em and make profit if the share price subsequently drops allowing them to buy b ack the same number of shares for less money in other words short selling is bet that the price of stock will fall short sellers have always b een unpopular on wall street li ke skeletons at the feast they seem to stand against rising share valu expanding wealth nd general prosperity however most market participants recognize that they provide valuable service to the extent that they identify companies and industr ies that are overvalued by investors in the grip of irrational exuberance by bringing such valuations down to earth short selling can prevent economically wasteful overallocation of resources to those firms and sectorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22099crs2

shortermanipulation by short sellers another persistent complaint against short sellers is that they cause artificial price volatility form of manipulation common in the 19th century was the bear raid gang of speculators would sell stock shor t causing the price to drop they would follow with another wave of s hort sales depressing the price still further and so on until the stocks price was driven to the floor in the 1930s the securities and exchange commission sec adopted regulation to prevent bear raiding the uptick rule1 stated that short sale may occur only if the last price movement in stocks price wa s upward this prevents short sellers from piling onto fa lling stock and setting off downward price spiral in the words of standard securities law textbook the tick test and related rule s seem pretty well to have taken the caffeine out of the short sale2 in 2007 the sec concluded that growth in the market made the rule unnece ssary and it was repealed3 however in recent years complaints about manipulative short selling have reappeared many shareholders and officer s of smaller firms have identified naked short selling as source of price manipulati on and have criticized the secs enforcement record at the same time the sec has identified short sellin g in connection with spreading rumors as an abuse that may raise fears about the solvency of the target firm and cut off its access to credit potentially leading to the destruction of the firm as was the case with bear stearns in march 2008 naked shorting short sale always involves the sale of shares that the seller does not own the buyer however expects to receive real shares where do those shares come from normally they are borrowed by the broker from another investor or from brokerages own account this is usually not difficult to do if the shares are issued by large company where millions of shares change hands daily and where many shares are not registered to the actual owners but are held in street name that is in the brokers account with smaller corpora tions however the number of sh ares in circulation may be limited and brokers may find it difficult to locate shares to deliver to the buyer in short sale transaction when shares are not located to cover short sale the short position is said to be naked if shares are not found by the time the transaction must be settled there is failure to deliver shares to the buyer if it occurs sporadically and on small scale naked short selling does not raise serious manipulation concerns however when the number of shares sold short represents si gnificant fraction of all shares outstanding there may be strong impact on the share price in such cases when naked short sellinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22099crs3 4 release 3448709 short sales proposed rule october 28 2003 5 market makers are dealers who stand ready to buy or sell stock at any time and who publish the prices at which they are willing to trade they are the key intermediaries on the nasdaq on the new york stock exchange they are called specialists 6 the uptick rule does not apply to otcbb stockscreates virtually unlimited quantity of shar market based on supply and demand can be seriously distorted the sec notes that naked short sellers enjoy greater leverage than if they were required to borrow securities and deliver within reasonable time period and they may use this additional leve rage to engage in trading activities that deliberately depress the price of security4 the case against naked short selling has been that by permitting short sales to occur when there is possibility of actually delivering shares to the buyers brokers and dealers accommodate manipulation when naked short selling drives prices down holders of the stock understandably feel cheated they do not believe the stock is overvalued they are not selling but the price drops anyway it is important to note that naked short selling is not always evidence of intent to manipulate prices under certain circumstances market maker5 may engage in naked short selling to stabilize the market for exampl assume that there is sudden flurry of buy orders for stock the market maker ma judge the buying interest to be temporary and not justified by any real news about the companys prospects it may be the result of questionable press release or rumor in an internet chat room the market maker may choose to sell short to avoid what in its view would be an unjustifie d runup in the stocks price in this situation naked short lling by the market maker may protect investors against manipulation it is also worth noting that while restrictions on short selling discourage certain forms of manipulation they may encourage or facilitate others manipulations that involve artificially infl ating stock prices are probably mo re common than techniques like naked shorting that seek to depress them rumors false press releases and unexpected purchases may all cause sudden runups of stock prices wh ich may be followed in the classic pumpanddump fraud by sudden collapse as the manipulators sell their shares to the unwary without short selling as counterweight the magn itude and duration of such fraudulent runups are likely to be greater until july 2008 the sec viewed the problem of naked shorting as largely confined to smaller firms particularly smallcapitalization penny stocks listed on the nasdaq bulletin board market otcbb6 in these companies the bulk of outstanding shares may be owned by corporate insiders or by securities dealers who act as market makers so that relatively few shares are available for purchase on the open market this means that transactions have proportionate ly greater impact on the stock price than do trades of the same size in the shares of larger company making manipulation easier in addition to otcbb stocks however smaller companies listed on the exchanges or the nasdaq national market may also be vulnerable to short selling abusehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22099crs4 7 release 3450103 short sales fina l rule july 28 2004 available at httpwwwsecgovrulesfinal3450103htm 8 of stocks and socks senator bennett bores in on secs

sho7 took effect on january 3 2005 the new regulation replaced existing exchange and nasdaq rules with uniform national standard under regulation sho broker may not accept short sale order from customer or effect short sa for its own account unless it has either borrowed the security or made bona fide arrangement to borrow it or has reasonable grounds to believe that it can locate the security borrow it and deliver it to the buyer by the date delivery is due and has documented compliance with the above the appearance of stock on an exchan ges easy to borrow list constituted reasonable grounds for believing that the stock can be located stocks on such lists tend to be highly capitalized with large numbers of shares in circulation if broker executes short sale and then fails to deliver shares to the purchaser further restrictions on short selling may come into force if the fail to deliver position is 10000 shares or more for five consecu tive trading days and the position amounts to at least 05 of total shares outstanding the stock becomes threshold security the exchanges and nasdaq are now required to publish daily lists of threshold securities regulation sho specifies that if fail to deliver position in threshold security persists for 13 trading days the broker or the broke rs clearing house must close the short position by purchasing secur ities of like kind nd quantity after the 13 days have elapsed the broker may not accept any more s hort sale orders until the fail to deliver position is closed by purchasing securities the rules include exemptions for market makers engaged in bona fide market making activities and for certain transactions between brokers effects of regulation sho the adoption of regulation sho has not put an end to investor complaints about naked short selling complaints are heard that the sec is not enforcing the rules vigorously enough that short selling continue s and that some brokers evade the 13day requirement by

the markets9 nevertheless some furthe r amendments to regulati on sho were considered in july 2006 the sec proposed rules to close two loopholes in regulation sho which it called responsible for th persistence of fail to deliver positions in certain stocks under the proposed rules the current exem ption for options market makers would be restricted second grandf ather provision in the original rule which exempted short positions that had been established before stock was placed on the threshold securities list from the requirement that fail to deliver positions be closed out after 13 consecutive trading days would be eliminated in august 2007 the sec adopted the proposed rule abolishing the grandfather provision when stock goes onto the threshol d list all short positions in the stock will be subject to the 13day closeout require ment the sec did not adopt the proposal relating to options market makers the 2008 emergency orders as financial companies came under pressure from tight credit markets in late 2007 and 2008 concerns emerged bout manipulative short sellers spreading rumors about firms creditworthiness and liquidity despite regulators assurances that bear stearns leading investment bank had adequate capital and liquidity reserves the firm was destroyed in march 2008 by the quivalent of bank run mark et participants fearing that the firm might not be able to meet its obligations refused to extend credit the federal reserve was forced to arrange hasty merger with jp morgan chase which acquired bear stearns on condition that the fed purch ase 29 billion of risky mortgage assets all large financial firms finance their opera tions by issuing shortterm debt which must be continually refinan ced or rolled over thus th ey are vulnerable to nonbank runs they cannot survive long if mark ets lose confidence and become unwilling to provide new funds in july 2008 share prices of fannie mae and freddie mac the two giant governmentsponsored enterprises th at hold about 15 trillion in mortgagebacked assets plunged and fears arose that they might go the way of bear stearns on july 15 the sec issued an emergency order banning naked short sales of the shares of fannie freddie and 17 other large financial institutions10 under the terms of the order short sale of the stock of any of the 19 listed firms may occur unless the seller has actually borrowe d or arranged to borrow the stock and delivers the stock to the buyer on the regular settlement date the sec explained the rationa for its unusual action httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22099crs6 11 ibid 12

secgovrulesfinal20083458773pdffalse rumors can lead to loss of confiden ce in our markets such loss of confidence can lead to panic selling which may be fu rther exacerbated by naked short selling as result the prices of securities ma artificially and unnecessarily decline well below the price level that would have resulted from the normal price discovery process if significant financial instituti ons are involved this chain of events can threaten disruption of our markets the events preceding the sale of the bear stearns companies inc are illustrative of the market impact of rumors during the week of march 10 2008 rumors spread about liquidity problems at bear stearns which eroded investor confidence in the firm as bear stearns stock price fell its counterparties became concerned and crisis of confidence occurred late in the week in particular counterparties to bear stearns were unwilling to make secured funding available to bear stearns on customary terms in light of the potentially systemic consequences of failure of bear stearns the federal reserve took emergency action11 the secs intervention has been criticized by some who believe that financial stocks have been battered not by false rumors but by realistic assessments of firms underlying financial weakness short selling in this view is simply market discipline at work one view is that the secs objective of raising financial stock prices itself amounts to market manipulation12 the secs original order issued on ju ly 15 was extended through august 12 2008 on september 18 2008 as fina ncial stocks plunged the sec issued another much more sweeping emergency order all short selling naked or not of the shares of more than 700 financial firms was ba nned the rationale was the sa as for the earlier action whatever benefits short selling might provide in terms of price efficiency were far outweighed by the possible damage to the financial system and the economy if major firms were swept away by panic th emergency order expired october 8 2008 on october 1 2008 in addition to exte nding the short sa ban announced on september 18 the sec adopted rule that in effect banned naked short selling in all stocks13 this order in the form of an interim final rule requires that when failure to deliver shares within the normal threeday settlement period occurs the sellers broker must immediately purchase or borrow securities and close out the fail to deliver position by later than the beginning of trading on the next business day failure to comply means that the broker cannot sell that stoc k short either for its own account or for customers unless the shares are not only located but also preborrowed the sec also adopted rule 10b21 nake d short selling antifraud rule covering short sellers who deceive brok erdealers or any other market participants about their intention or ability to deliver securities in time for settlement the rule makes clear that such persons are violating the law when they fail to deliver
