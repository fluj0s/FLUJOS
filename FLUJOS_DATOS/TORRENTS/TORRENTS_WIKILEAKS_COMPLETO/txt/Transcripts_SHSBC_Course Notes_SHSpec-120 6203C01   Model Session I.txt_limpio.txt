6203c01 shspec120 model session i model session was instituted because auditors were varying patter to degree that session was hardly recognizable and because as early as 1954 scientologists were arguing about the proper way to do auditing there was need for standard way to do it also it was found that if all sessions were on the same pattern subsequent sessions tended to run out earlier sessions this has considerable value there is predictability because of the application and auditing thereby becomes better communication the rudiments value became extreme at the moment auditors began having difficulties finding goals and terminals rudiments in present form are less than four to five months old ruds began in 1955 having them in can make the difference between auditing and noauditing model session is tailored against clearing it is not tailored so much for prepchecking the ruds are vital for assessment since prepchecking takes up lot of the things found in the ruds there could be confusion between prepchecking and ruds rudiments can be used by the pc to throw the session if you use any form cf ow in the rudiments because the pc can now get into whole new channel of overts while you had some previouslystarted chains you wanted to get handled rudiments are vital to session they get and hold pc in session however they can throw pc out of session as well as into session if they are used to prevent pc from communicating with the auditor if the pc comes in with all the answers to yesterdays prepcheck questions he is already in session the process of checking rudiments can create an arc break if the pc is already in session the emeter wont tell you if the pc is in session since the process of checking to see if the pc is ready can throw the pc out of session also the emeter will not register when the pc is so arc broken that the auditor has command value over him the pc must be way south very arc broken for this to be the case so before you start model session ask if it is all right for you to start the session if you get answer or you can tell that you will get reads on ruds pay attention to the pc get what is wrong before you expect to get much on the meter if the pc will talk to you pretty easily the meter will read if he wont it wont if the auditor rejects the pcs data that he is arc broken because the meter didnt read the pc will get arc broken with the meter the reason you start the session is to be sure the pc knows he is on specialized section of track that what is going to happen is not social relationship but that there is special auditor pc relationship to ensure that the special auditorpc relationship is in existence ask the pc if the session has started for him if he says give start of session again and ask again if he says again assume that it has started anyway and that the pc has an arc break with life somewhere the beginning rudiments are designed for the order of logical progress for session if you put ptp first you would be running session without goals havingness clearing the auditor etc for model session patter of this time period see hcob 21dec61 model session script revised the order of actions in model session tends to clear out the other things ie starting with goals tends to put him in session by putting his attention on his case having can clean up arc breaks etc you can put pc in session by clever use of goals in ruds if your definition of goals is broad enough the pc has some goal some hopeful postulate for the future which one has recognized or acknowledged even if the pcs goal is to die if you acknowledge it and grant him the beingness of having it he can then change it if the pc isnt giving any goals explore some future possibilities with him one way or the other find such things as what the pc is sure is going to happen in the session and sort out the goal involved with that dont go overboard as far as number of goals is concerned but get the pc to make some this presupposes of course that the pc doesnt come in already in session telling you something he really wants to tell you goals for life or livingness are there to differentiate from session goals this is not very vital and you never check up on it it is there to expose ptps of long duration if the same life or beingness goal keeps recurring you will know that there is ptp to take up if they dont contain problems fine this shows the pc that you are interested in him the next step havingness is easy to audit and beneficial for all concerned the pc will usually run it too matter what else he may or may not run finding the havingness process can take awhile but it is easy enough if you find one early in the pcs auditing it will be changed before too long so watch it closely the more complex processes will work better early on it is especially useful to find the havingness process early on if the pc arc breaks easily the havingness of the pc in the session is directly proportional to the smoothness of the auditing it is arc breaks that reduce havingness whether created by the auditor the environment or whatever when using havingness to heal an arc break be sure to flatten it run it for half an hour or an hour not doing it this way is why auditors dont have reality on the fact that havingness clears up arc breaks they dont see that it is working stopping it prematurely can give the pc quite jolt dont cause arc breaks with havingness process for gods sake make it part of the process to inquire how he is doing during the process so it doesnt become signal that you are about to end the process an intelligent use of havingness would be to use it when there is shadow of dropped interest on the part of the pc less comm etc but it should not be used to interrupt the pcs insessionness the stable rule is not that you run havingness whenever the pc dopes off you can get the same read during assessment whether the pc is conscious or not so there it is not necessary you use it to help the pc get better into session
