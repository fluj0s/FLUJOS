richard f grimmett specialist in national defense foreign affairs and national defense summary this report provides an overview of the defense export loan guarantee program delg which became operational on november 8 1996 it discusses the major features of the program which is aimed at assisting prospective foreign purchasers of us defense equipment finance those purchases through private sector loans this report will be revised only as notable events relating to the program warrant introduction the defense export loan guarantee delg program originated with section 3201 of pl 104106 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1996 this provision of law directed the secretary of defense to establish loan guarantee program for the sale or longterm lease of defense articles and services circumstances that gave rise to the delg program were concerns by us weapons producers that they were at competitive disadvantage in marketing their products internationally representatives of the us defense industry argued that having us loan guarantee program that could induce private lending institutions to make loans to lesswealthy nations for purchases of armaments would enhance the ability of american companies to compete effectively for prospective weapons contracts abroad critics of such loan program argued that the united states should not expend funds to help underwrite loans for weapons purchases by developing nations that already lacked sufficient resources to pay for major domestic social services other critics of this loan program argued that the united states should not provide loan guarantees to nations that were poor credit risks and might default on the loans underwritten by the united states the delg program that was enacted is legislative amalgam that reflects the wishes of those who wished to create new defense loan program to support us defense exports but also is structured in such way to address the policy and fiscal concerns of those in congress critical of the program and its purposes on november 8 1996 the defense department implemented p l 104106 by publishing in the federal register the basic framework and elements of this new congressional research service the library of congress crs2 program1 the stated purpose of the delg program is to meet national security objectives by encouraging standardization and interoperability of defense systems with us allies lowering purchase costs of defense items to dod preserving critical defense skills and maintaining the stability of the industrial base by facilitating the export of americanmade products the secretary of defense assigned oversight responsibility for the program to the deputy under secretary of defense international and commercial programs2 delg program structure the delg program issues comprehensive guarantees to private sector lenders against losses of principal or interest or both for loans to certain sovereign nations the delg guarantee commits the full faith and credit of the us government and covers 100 percent of the risk of nonpayment of covered principal and interest the defense department guarantees defense exports loans for up to 85 of the contract value or 100 of us content whichever is less the borrower must accept the loan as sovereign debt and make cash payment of at least 15 percent of the contract price guarantees are available for the sale or longterm lease of us defense articles services or design and construction services as defined in the arms export control act aeca 22 usc 2751 et seq final commitment for delg guarantee will be issued only if the products are licensed for export under the aeca procedures if the us export contains foreignmade components only the us content will be supported by delg guarantee the us portion of the production cost of the items exported must be greater than 50 in order to qualify for delg guarantee the delg program will cover eligible transactions under dods foreign military sales program as well as commercial sales licensed by the us state department current authority limits the us governments contingent liability to 15 billion under the delg program the secretary of defense reserves the right to limit the loan amount guaranteed for any one country the delg program functions much as the us exportimport bank exim bank functions to support exports of us nondefense commercial goods and services the department of defense will not guarantee loan to country that is ineligible for guarantees from the exim bank by law the delg program may not offer loan guarantees with terms and conditions more favorable than those offered by exim bank there are however notable differences between the delg program procedures and those of the exim bank first the delg program by statute must charge fees sufficient to cover all expected current and future program costs the program is not subsidized with funds appropriated to the defense department second the legislation which led to establishment of the delg requires that the exposure fee paid by the borrower to cover the risk associated 1 federal register november 8 1996 vol 61 218 pp
