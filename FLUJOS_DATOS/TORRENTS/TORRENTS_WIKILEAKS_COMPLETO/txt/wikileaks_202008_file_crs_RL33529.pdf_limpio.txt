influence of growing and relatively wealthy indianamerican community of more than two million is reflected in congresss largest countryspecific caucus further us interest in south asia focuses on ongoing tensions between india and pakistan rooted in unfinished business from the 1947 partition competing claims to the kashmir region and in more recent years crossborder terrorism in both kashmir and major indian cities in the interests of regional stability the united states strongly encourages an ongoing indiapakistan peace initiative and remains concerned about the potential for conflict over kashmiri sovereignty to cause open hostilities between these two nucleararmed countries the united states seeks to curtail the proliferation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in south asia both india and pakistan have resisted external pressure to sign the major nonproliferation treaties in 1998 the two countries conducted nuclear tests that evoked international condemnation proliferation related restrictions on us aid were triggered then later lifted through congressionalexecutive cooperation from 1998 to 2000 remaining sanctions on india and pakistan were removed in late 2001 india is in the midst of major and rapid economic expansion many us business interests view india as lucrative market and candidate for foreign investment the united states supports indias efforts to transform its once quasisocialist economy through fiscal reform and market opening since 1991 india has taken major steps in this direction and coalition governments have kept the country on general path of reform yet there is us concern that such movement is slow and inconsistent india is the worlds fourthlargest emitter of greenhouse gases congress also continues to have concerns about abuses of human rights including caste and genderbased discrimination and religious freedoms in india moreover the spread of hivaids in india has been identified as serious development see also

were long hampered by domestic political resistance in india but are again underway in mid2008 in major policy shift by the united states july 2005 usindia joint statement notably asserted that as responsible state with advanced nuclear technology india should acquire the same benefits and advantages as other such states and president bush vowed to work on achieving full civilian nuclear energy cooperation with india as reversal of three decades of us nonproliferation policy such proposed cooperation stirred controversy and required changes in both us law and in international guidelines enabling us legislation became public law in december 2006 pl 109401 or the hyde act for nearly one year from mid2007 to mid2008 however indias united progressive alliance upa coalition government led by the congre ss party of prime minister manmohan singh was unable to overcome persistent and unrelenting resistance to the pact from communist party leaders who provide the ruling coalition with crucial parliamentary support by threatening to withdraw such support if the upa went forward w ith the initiative the left front obstructed its potential consummation leading many analysts to conclude that planned cooperation would not take place in the foreseeable future july 2008 political realignment in new delhi however freed the upa to continue its pursuit of the deal on august 1 the international atomic energy agency iaea board of governors approved the safeguards accord with india on august 21 the 45member nuclear suppliers group nsg is set to meet to discuss adjusting its guidelines to permit nuclear trade with india if this step is taken usindia civil nuclear cooperation can commence only after congress approves joint resolution of approval the text of the 123 agreement must be submitted for 30 days of continuous congressional session before any vote can take place thus by nearly all accounts the us congressional calendar presents major obstacle to the deals consummation in 2008 3 g20g142g140g142g151g157g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 in july 2007 the united states and india announced having concluded negotiations on peaceful nuclear cooperation or 123 agreement thenunder secretary of state for political affairs nicholas burns the lead us negotiator called the deal perhaps the single most important initiative that india and the united states have agreed to in the 60 years of our relationship and the symbolic centerpiece of growing gl obal partnership between our two countries4 us 2 see also crs report rl33016 us nuclear cooperation with india issues for congress by paul k kerr and next steps in strategic partnership and beyond section below 3 congress may not pass usindia nuclear pact washington post july 9 2008 according to section 123b of the atomic energy act the president is to submit the text to the senate foreign relations committee and the house committee on foreign affairs the president is then to consu lt with the committees for period of not less than thirty days of continuous session according to section 123d the two committees shall after that time each hold hearings on the proposed agreement for cooperation and submit report to their respective bodies recommending whether it should be approved or disapproved therefore the minimum amount of time that must elapse before congress can vote on joint resolution of approval is 30 days of continuous session in addition to the amount of time congress would take to hold hearings 4 see httpwwwstategovpusrm200789559htm

steps to consummation of the pact these included finalizing arrangements for iaea inspections of indias civilian nuclear facilities and winning the endorsement of the nsg for nuclear trade following these steps the 123 agreement can become operative only through joint resolution of approval from congress there have been significant apparent contradictions between the expectations of and public statements by us and indian officials on this issue5 many independent indian commentators approved of the pact seeing in it an end to nuclear apartheid that likely will go down as one of the finest achievements of indian diplomacy6 there also is evidence that the indian business community supports the deal as means of contributing to indias rise as major power and of bolstering the countrys energy security in november 2007 23 former indian military chiefs senior bureaucrats and scientists signed an open letter to parliament urging approval of the pact so as to remove the crippling constraints india suffers due to international regimes that deny it hightechnology goods 7 with multiple admonitions from senior us government officials in 2008 that the time needed to consummate the deal was growing short many indian commenta tors joined in pressing their government to avoid an uncertain future by moving quickly to finalize the pact some see indias nuclear power industry in dire need of uranium supplies that can only come from the international market uranium shortages appear to be hampering india nuclear power sector which is running at or below half capacity8 in new delhi where the executive can enter international agreements without parliamentary approval prime minister singhs congress partydominated cabinet endorsed the agreement text immediately upon its finalization his upa coalition government then set about assuring domestic skeptics that the autonomy of the countrys nuclear weapons program would be maintained and that all key commitments previously made to parliament were being adhered to including those related to plutonium reprocessing and nuclear weapons testing rights as well as assured and uninterrupted supplies of nuclear fuel even if the agreement is terminated 9 later in response to continued controversy over whether or not indias freedom to conduct future nuclear weapons tests is restricted by the agreement external affairs minister pranab mukherjee told parliament there is nothing in the bilateral agreement that would tie the hands of future government or legally constrain its options 10 despite such assurances ensuing debate over the deal divided the new delhi establishment as much as any issue in the countrys history pr ime minister singh may have underestimated the degree of antiamericanism and antiimperialism held by his coalitions communist left front allies who provided his ruling coalition with crucial parliamentary support in august 2007 senior leaders of the main opposition bharatiya

on indias nuclear weapons program yet indias communist parties went much further in their criticisms issuing joint statement which called the 123 agreement flawed and claiming that it must be seen as crucial step to lock india into the us global strategic designs their view is not limited to those with communist sentiments one former indian national security advisor asserted that while vast majority of the countrys rising urban middle class firmly favors closer indiaus ties it will not tolerate subservient relationship and retains significant differences in approaches to third parties such as iran and pakistan 11 the political squabbling in new delhi put th nuclear deal on lengthy hold in october 2007 prime minister singh informed president bush that certain difficulties have arisen with respect to the operationalization of the deal12 hopes for consummation were revived in november when the left front allowed the indian government to begin talks with the iaea yet by years end the communist leadership was again threatening to withdraw support for the ruling coalition unless talks were halted december negotiations with the iaea reportedly were hampered by technical glitches related to indias demand for unconditional guarantees of fuel supplies in perpetuity external affairs minister mukherjee insisted in the first days of 2008 that new delhi had not given up on the deal and was continuing with its efforts to resolve the faceoff with the left front13 nonproliferation experts have been consistent in their opposition to the nuclear deal believing it will significantly damage the global nonproliferation regime and facilitate an asian nuclear arms race some have asserted that the text of the 123 agreement disregards the legislative intent of the hyde act especially in the area of continued supplies of nuclear fuel to india even if that country tests nuclear weapons and the agreement is term inated others warn th at nsg endorsement of an exception for india will virtually ensure the demise of global nuclear export restraints14 january 2008 letter to nsg officials endorsed by more than 130 nonproliferation experts and nongovernmental organizations argued that indias commitments thus far did not justify making farreaching exceptions to international nonproliferation rules and norms the document asked that nsg members consider the potential costs of granting to india any special safeguards exceptions and urged the body to make clear that all nuclear trade with india would cease upon that countrys resumption of nuclear testing for any reason 15 opponents warn that the already weakened international nonproliferation regime may be mortally damaged by the proposed alteration of international norms particular criticism arises in the area of future nuclear testing which nonproliferation advocates say is likely to be facilitated by the deal16 at least one nonproliferation advocate in congress concluded that the 123 agreement is not consistent with congressional requirements and restrictions and would deeply damage the 11 indian communists reject us nuclear pact reuters august 7 2007 brajesh mishra to subservient relations

affairs committee hfac that the us government will support india in the nsg only if any resulting exemptions are fully consistent with the provisions of the hyde act nonproliferation advocates say secretary rices pledge will require shift in us policy in particular by placing conditions on indias ability to engage in global nuclear trade 18 representative howard berman the hfac chairman and supporter of the initiative finds it incomprehensible that the administration would seek or accept an nsg exemption that omits many of the conditions contained in the hyde act he says such an exemption would be inconsis tent with us law be harmful to us business interests and undermine us nonproliferation objectives in line with previous administration assurances to congress he expects us

nuclear facilities they saw prime minister singh following timeline set by the bush administration at the expense of indias national interests and they threatened to withdraw support for the upa

overly favoring of india see little reason for the us government to move precipitously in finalizing it24 on august 1 the iaea board of governors approved the safeguards accord with india the iaea secretarygeneral insisted that the accord met all of the bodys legal requirements and was of indefinite duration25 the next major step toward consummation is obtaining an adjustment of nsg guidelines so as to allow india to purchase nuclear fuel and technologies on the international market representatives from all 45 nsg member states are scheduled to gather in vienna on august 21 new delhi has been firm in demanding clean and unconditional exemption from the nsg one that would waive all guidelines normally applied to nonnuclear weapons states under the npt 26 yet unconditional nsg approval may not be given as some member states may be hesitant to endorse nuclear trade with country that is not signatory to the npt and that has tested nuclear weapons japan for example recently has

regardless of the status of fuel supply 27 the text of draft us proposal for the nsg circulated on august 6 has come under fire from nonproliferation advocates for its alleged weakening of nsg credibility and its failure to include clear statements that would end all cooperation in the event of future indian nuclear weapons test prohibit the transfer to india of sensitive processing enrichment or heavy water technologies and call upon india to stop producing fissile materials according to one analysis the us draft contains language contrary to the 2006 hyde act 28 while top us

third round of foreign secretarylevel talks when foreign secretary shiv shankar menon hosted new delhi visit by his pakistani counterpart in late 2006 progress came on outstanding territorial disputes

an agreement to reduce the risk of accidental nuclear war the new indiapakistan antiterrorism mechanism met for the first time in march 2007 and produced joint statement in which both govern ments agreed to use the forum for exchanging information about investigations of andor efforts to prevent terrorist acts on either side of the shared border and to meet quarterly while immediately conveying urgent information hopes that the samjhauta train bombing would provide fitting test case apparently were dashed however when india declined to share relevant investigative information with pakistan moreover indian officials were unhappy with islamabads insistence that the freedom struggle underway in kashmir should not be treated as terrorism under this framework still the continuing engagement even after major terrorist attack was widely viewed as evidence that the bilateral peace process had gained sturdy momentum fourth round of the composite dialogue also was launched in march 2007 when the two foreign ministers met again in islamabad new agreements were reached but both officials lauded improved bilateral relations and held the most sustained and intensive dialogue ever on the kashmir problem 65 fourth round of bilateral talks on economic and commercial cooperation held in august 2007 ended with agreements to facilitate importation of cement from pakistan and tea from india

observers attributed the poor showing to number of factors including the failure of congress to make strong preelection alliances as had the bjp and perceptions that party leader sonia gandhi lacked the experience to lead the country support for the congress which dominated indian politics for decades had been in fairly steady decline following the 1984 assassination of prime minister indira gandhi and the 1991 assassination of her prime minister rajiv gandhi sonia gandhi rajivs italianbor n catholic widow refrained from active politics until the 1998 elections she later made efforts to revitalize the party by phasing out older leaders and attracting more women and lower castesefforts that appear to have paid off in 2004 today congress again occupies more parliamentary seats 145 than any other party and through unprecedented alliances with powerful regional parties it again leads indias government under the upa coalition as party chief and upa chair gandhi is seen to wield considerable influence over the coalitions policy making process her foreign origins have presented an obstacle and likely were major factor in her may 2004 decision to decline the prime ministership

rapidly increased its parliamentary strength during the 1980s in 1993 the partys image was tarnished among some burnished for others by its alleged complicity in serious communal violence in bombay

this as key to nation building while leading national coalition from 19982004 the bjp workedwith only limited success to change its image from rightwing hindu fundamentalist to conservative and

2007 the first time the bjp has held power in southern india in preparing for new round of national elections the party may adhere to its core hindutva philosophy it has nominated hardliner advani to be its next prime ministerial candidate and may continue efforts to demonize indias muslim minority as part of long standing electoral strategy 118 some observers however believe the party is looking

benefits of the nuclear initiative are being oversold indeed centuries of indian anticolonial sentiments and oftentimes prickly independent foreign policy choices are unlikely to be set aside in the

almost immediately upon the release of the july 2005 joint statement key indian political figures and members of the countrys insular nuclear scientific community issued strong criticisms of the bilateral civil nuclear initiative some such criticisms continue to this day former prime minister vajpayee along with many leading figures in his opposition bjp party insisted that the deal as envisioned would place unreasonable and unduly expensive demands on india particularly with regard to the separation of nuclear facilities in reaction to the us congresss passage of enabling legislation in late 2006 the bjp listed numerous continuing objections and went so far as to call the deal unacceptable and aimed at capping rolling back and eventually eliminating indias nuclear weapons capability 139 many analysts view the bjps opposition as political rather than substantive especially in light of the fact that the 2004 nssp initiative was launched during the bjps tenure140 some indian analysts wary of us intentions in pursuing bilateral civil nuclear cooperation believe the initiative may be cover for broader effort to cement indias cooperation in number of nonenergyrelated areas such as defense trad and new delhis relations with iran from this perspective the us government repeatedly shi fted the goalposts to forward its own veiled nonproliferation goals141 indias influential communist parties whose left front provides crucial support to the congressled ruling coalition in new delhi have focused their ire on geopolitical aspects of the civil nuclear initiative in late 2006 the leader of indias main communist party declared the usindia civil nuclear deal not acceptable as it would seriously undermine indias independent foreign policy previously the left front had called indias two iaea votes on iran capitulation to us pressure142 indian leftists thus have been at the forefront of political resistance to indias becoming junior partner of the united states equally stinging and perhaps more substantive criticism came from several key indian scientists whose perspectives on the technical details of the civil nuclear initiative are considered highly credible indias nuclear scientific community mostly barred from collaboration with international civil nuclear enterprises as well as direct access to key technologies has worked for decades in relative isolation making its members both proud of their singular accomplishments and sensitive to any signs of foreign interference many viewed the enabling legislation passed by the us congress as being more about nonproliferation and less about energy cooperation they considered it both intrusive on and preclusive of their activities the major criticisms of existing plans for usindia civil nuclear cooperation made by indian commentators and at times by the indian government are summarized as follows 139 see press statement of the bjp on the indous nuclear deal december 10

technologies warranted under full cooperation india was not being given prior authorization to reprocess spent fuel india was not being given assurances that it will receive uninterrupted fuel

policies or affected new delhis independen ce on matters of national interest within this context however singh expressed concern about some of the points listed above144 regardless of the legally binding or nonbinding nature of certain controversial sections of the us legislation new delhi found many of them to be either prescriptive in ways incompatible with the provisions of the july 2005

negotiations on peaceful nuclear cooperation 123 agreement calling it historic milestone in the bilateral strategic partnership the announcement came one week after fifth round of formal bilateral negotiations had ended in washington where highlevel indian delegation led by national security advisor mk narayanan had met with numerous top us officials including vice president cheney and secretary of state rice under secretary of state burns the lead us negotiator called the deal perhaps the single most important initiative that india and the united states have agreed to in the 60 years of our relationship and the symbolic centerpiece of growing global partnership between our two countries 146 us officials urged new delhi to move rapidly toward completing remaining steps to

would launch immediate bilateral consultations to consider carefully the circumstances and take into account whether the circumstances resulted from serious concern about changed security environment or as response to similar actions by other states which could impact national security while the us president would have right to demand the return of all ussupplied nuclear equipment and material in such circumstance the text recognizes that exercising the right of return would have profound implications for bilateral relations and calls for both parties to take into account the potential negative consequences of any termination of ongoing cooperation india is given assurances that supplies of fuel for its civilian reactors will not be interruptedeven if the united states terminates the 123 agreementthrough us commitments to work with friends and allies to create the necessary conditions for india to obtain full access to the international fuel market and to support an indian effort to develop strategic reserve of nuclear fuel 147 press reports had indicated that us granting of unambiguous reprocessing rights along with an indian insistence on us guarantees of an uninterrupted fuel supply for all imported reactors had become central obstacle in the leadup to the talks and that indian negotiators had taken uncompromising positions in both areas subsequent reports suggested that us negotiators made considerable concessions to indian demands and that the agreement could face resistance in congress if its legal stipulations are seen to deviate from those found in the hyde act 148 in early 2008 external affairs minister mukherjee reassured the indian parliament of his governments view that the hyde act is relevant only to interaction between the legislative and executive branches of the us government and that only the provisions of the 123 agreement will be binding upon new delhi this distinction was ech oed by assistant secretary of state

pursuant to pl 10679 during the 1990s the us security focus in south asia sought to minimize damage to the nonproliferation regime prevent escalation of an arms race and promote indopakistani

countries nuclear tests these included signing and ratifying the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ctbt halting all further production of fissile material and participating in fissile material cutoff treaty negotiations limiting development and deployment of wmd delivery vehicles and implementing strict export controls on sensitive wmd materials and technologies progress in each of these areas has been limited at best and the bush administration quickly set aside the benchmark framework along with security concerns the governments of both india and pakistan face the prestige factor

kashmiri separatist groups rejected the proposal as an abandonment of islamabads longheld policy but indian leaders welcomed musharrafs statements in february 2007 prime minister singh said the pakistani government was saying the right thing in rejecting armed militancy as solution to the kashmir problem still lack of consensus among kashmiri leaders and political parties has hampered
