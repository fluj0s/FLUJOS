unhcr operations in egypt the audit covered activities with total expenditure of us 52 mill ion in 2004 and 2005 draft of the report was shared with the director of the bureau for mena and the representative in january 2007 on which comments were received by february 2007 the director and representative have accepted most of the recommendations and are in the process of implementing them overall assessment oios assessed the unhcr operation in egypt as avera ge it was adequately run but although the majority of key controls were being applied th application of certain important controls lacked consistency or effectiveness in order not t compromise the overall system of internal control timely corrective action by management is required programme management for the two partners reviewed reasonable assurance could be obtained that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accord ance with the subproject agreements caritas made loans to and from unhcr subprojects without adequately disclosing them and without unhcrs knowledge and prior agreement the balance of the loan owed to caritas or to unhcr was unknown as it had not been calculated for several years the regional representation informed that system woul d be established with caritas so that transactions to and from the bank account can be pr operly accounted for balance of over us 140000 was still available i n caritas bank account after the submission of the final 2005 spmr that showed an spent balance of only us 268 in oios view considering that caritas had separate bank account for unhcr funds and by deducting 2006 remittances and disbursements in the account there should not have been difference between the two balances caritas stated that the balance of us 140000 represented various loans made over several years t prefinance unhcr activities that had not been recovered from the unhcr bank account oios recommended that review be conducted to establish whether or not these funds b elong to unhcr or caritas the regional representation will closely monitor the ba lances in the unhcr special bank account oios assessed that programme financial monitoring w as regularly and satisfactorily carried out with monitoring reports available for all partners use of unvs despite the fact that the regional representation h ad been handling what has been considered as the largest urban refugee population in the wor ld the office has lacked over the past several years the necessary regular unhcr protect ion staff to carry out the work effectively as result they have had to heavily rely on natio nal unvs to deliver essential core protection activities most of the national unvs had prior work experience and were hired from universities to occupy sensitive and responsible po sitions for years the number of national unvs represented from 75 to over 85 per cent of the staff in the protection section oios recommended that the bureau and the regional repres entation reassess the number of unvs used in the operation with the aim of replacing the m with regular unhcr staff the regional representation has been experiencing high turnover rate of its national unvs over 65 per cent in 2005 this has had negative impact on the daytoday administration of the office with up to 40 per cent of the time spen t by the administration section devoted to unv staffing issues not to mention the loss of ind uction programme costs the regional representation stressed that the issue of the use and management of consistently high numbers of unvs over several years is an issue larger than unhcr cairo the regional representation informed that over the past years hcr cairo has in all its submissions for postcreations in the cops requested the creation f general service posts to decrease the over reliance on national unvs the number of unvs has gradually reduced to 20 at the beginning of 2007 but the workload still exceeds t he capacity of regular posts procurement unhcr procurement procedures were generally complie d with there was need however to reassess the competitiveness of the current securi ty company which was selected ten years back as well as other services action would be taken once the regional representat ion moves to its new offices security and safety according to the undpfield safety officer the off ice of the regional representation was not moss compliant oios notes however that the pro posed new building would be classed as moss compliant once all the recommendations for sec urity enhancements made in the senior field security advisors mission report of july 200 6 have been implemented administration in the areas of administration and finance the off ice of the regional representation in egypt generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review the areas brought to the attention of the regional representation are being addressed

unhcr operations in egypt the audit was conducted in ac cordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing oios reviewed the activities of the unhcr regional representation in egypt and two of i ts implementing partners 2 oios previous audit of unhcr in egypt was conducte d in february 2001 that review focused on the 1999 and 2000 programme activ ities covering expenditure of us 44 million the main audit issues raised were the need to review the policy on urban refugees for the continual payment of financial assistance and ssistance to vulnerable irregular movers to redesign the then programme strategy and to shift the responsibility for refugee status determination rsd to the government of egypt reception registration and refugee status determination activities are still performed today by unhcr due to the unwillingness of the government to take over these responsibiliti unhcr has still not finalized its urban refugee policy oios continues to monitor the stat us of this policy 3 in egypt unhcr provides protection and basic human itarian assistance to the largest urban refugee population in the middle east some 2 0000 refugees originating mainly from sudan 78 per cent and somalia 17 per cent ove r the past decades difficulties continued to persist in the government of egypts willingness and ability to put in place the necessary arrangements for the reception and registration of refugee applicants and the determination of their refugee status unhcr has therefore been pro viding the necessary protection to refugees under its mandate by carrying out registra tion and rsd and coordinating with the relevant authorities 4 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the audited activitie s during the exit conference held on 3 december 2006 draft of the report was shared w ith the director of the bureau for mena and the representative in january 2007 on whi ch comments were received by february 2007 the director and representative have accepted most of the recommendations and are in the process of implementing them ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to evaluate t he adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subproject agreements iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on the 2004 and 2005 programme ac tivities under projects 0405abarels401 with expenditure of us 42 mil lion our review concentrated on the activities implemented by caritas expenditure of us 29 million and catholic relief services crs expenditure of us 09 mill ion oios also reviewed activities directly implemented by unhcr with expenditure of u s 03 million 2 7 the audit reviewed the administration of the office of the regional representation in egypt with administrative expenditure totalling us 1 million for the years 2004 and 2005 and assets with acquisition costs totalling us 460 000 and current value of us 107000 the number of staff working for the unhcr operation in egypt was 46 this included staff on regular posts and united nations volunteers the re were 4 vacant posts 8 the audit activities included review and assessme nt of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of data and revie w of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners and programme monit oring 9 for the two partners reviewed reasonable assurance could be obtained that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreements 10 audit certificates for 2004 and 2005 were available for all partners with unqualified opinions expressed caritas 11 caritas continued to run two general accounting sys tems in parallel one manual system the other automated this was despite pre vious recommendation from their external auditors that only one system should be used both systems generated the same information for the preparation of unhcr financial reports and were operated by the same employee while the final spmrs were satisfactorily reconcile d to caritas ledgers oios was of the view that maintaining two systems was labourintens ive and not cost effective and draws unnecessarily on scarce resources that could have b een used for other tasks caritas indicated that it preferred keeping the two systems running in parallel as it helped them ensure the integrity of financial information whil also adhering to local requirements to maintain manual system 12 caritas did not comply with the budgetary provision s according to the sub project agreement budgetary transfers by caritas w ere authorized at the item level which meant that such transfers should not change t he total amount under the relevant sector activity level under sector c however caritas s pent 105486 us 18500 over the budget authorization was sought from unhcr for this overrun the representation informed that the budgetary overruns were known an d were result of the emergency that arose in late 2005 due to administrative and other reasons the representation was unable to revise the budget the representation assured oios that there would be regular followup to ensure budget amounts are adhered to or the budget is revised in timely manner 13 in 2005 and in previous years caritas borrowed fu nds from unhcr projects to prefinance its own projects andor loaned its fun ds to unhcr subprojects these loans however were not clearly reflected in the ledgers and had never been reconciled to the loans paid out hence it was very difficult even impos sible to determine the net balance owed to either party according to the assistant director caritas had thought of doing this in the past but never had the time to do it but indicated that reconciliation would be carried out by 3 the end of 2006 upon our request caritas calculat ed using their main office accounting system that for 2005 alone it owed 237161 us 41600 to unhcr and unhcr owed 287123 us 50370 to caritas these cal culations were not evidenced by adequate supporting documentation 14 similarly special unhcr bank account maintained by caritas and operated on jointsignatory basis showed net credit balanc of 806120 us 141420 in its bank statement dated 31 march 2006 after deducting the 2006 instalments and the relevant 2006 project disbursements the final 2005 spmr showed an unspent balance of only 1533 us 268 these two amounts should have been equa l since funds other than unhcr instalments were deposited into the account carit as explained that the money represented various loans made to unhcr over the past 15 years which had never been recovered from the unhcr bank account they further indicated tha t they would draw cheque for the full balance on the unhcr account to reimburse caritas recommendations head2right the unhcr regional representation in egypt should r equest caritas to ensure that all loans made to and from u nhcr subprojects are clearly recorded in the accounting system are well documented and all refunds are made in timel manner to reflect zerobalance if such accounting cann ot be implemented the practice should be discontinued r ec 01 head2right the unhcr regional representation in egypt should c losely monitor balances in the unhcr special bank account and ensure that funds totalling us 140000 genuinely belong t caritas rec 02 15 for recommendation 01 above the regional represent ation informed that it agreed to the practice as caritas has three offices involv ed in the implementation of unhcr projects assistance programmes in cairo and alexan dria and caritass headquarters caritas egypt advances all expenses during the year and they are refunded at the end of each year the regional representation stated that system would be setup with caritas to ensure loans are clearly recorded and all refund s are made on timely basis if such an accounting system cannot be established caritas wi ll be requested to discontinue the practice oios takes note of the proposed action and will k eep the recommendation open pending confirmation that unhcr funds can be proper ly tracked and monitored 16 for recommendation 02 above the regional represent ation will closely monitor the balances in the unhcr special bank account and wil l ensure that funds deposited genuinely belong to unhcr oios takes note of the action taken and will mainta in the recommendation pending confirmation that these fund s totalling us 140000 belong to caritas 17 despite the fact that the payments of bimonthly lowances to refugees were made through the bank caritas kept petty cash on an imp rest basis at ceiling of 100000 us 17540 caritas explained that the petty cas h was to pay vulnerable refugees and those refugees who were not able to present themsel ves to the bank the petty cash balance carries insurance coverage of up to 100000 us 17540 in case of theft 4 18 oios noted that the cashbook used to record cash mo vements did not show any carrying running balance following the posting of receipt or disbursement of cash the cash on hand was only calculated at monthend and inclu ded cheques on hand instead of cash only given that the cash disbursements were ofte n recorded in bulk for given period it was not possible to determine whether the petty cas h ceiling was complied with moreover there was evidence of any cash verification exc ept for few unannounced cash counts oios recommended that the regional representation r equest caritas to maintain adequate cashbooks showing runningavailable bala nce following each cash transaction cash verifications should also be periodically cond ucted with evidence kept on file oios was informed that in november 2006 caritas changed its cash recording system showing the cash balance at the end of each day oios takes note of the enhancements made the new procedures as documented are satisfactory to enable the daily cash balance to be established oios is of the opinion however that ach cash transaction should be separately recorded in accordance with good accounting practic b catholic relief services 19 oios assessed that the internal controls and financ ial records at crs were satisfactory the activities were mainly focused on one line item relating to the provision of education grants to refugee children at primary lev and lower secondary level the spmrs were satisfactorily reconciled to crs ledgers th expenditure was adequately supported and had been appropriately reviewed and authorized prior to payment b other programme issues 20 oios assessed that project financial monitoring and implementation were regularly and satisfactorily carried out with monitoring reports available for all partners however at the regional representation there was need to address various programme and protection issues use of national united nations volunteers nunvs 21 volunteers have served very useful role at the regional representation over the past several years it appears though that ry to the original spirit for the use of unvs the consistently high numbers hired by the regional representation suggest they have been deployed as substitutes for regular staff on long term basis this is contrary to unhcrs policy on the use of unvs where it states that unvs should not be deployed as substitutes for regular staff on long termbasis 22 oios acknowledges and appreciates that due to the f act that regular posts for staff have not been established the regional representat ion does not have many options but to hire unvs nonetheless alternatives need to be mor seriously considered and in the short term there are number of issues in the areas of r ecruitment and management of unvs that should be addressed experience and contractual arrangements of unvs 23 the availability of large pool of experts is supp osed to be one of the advantages linked to the use of unvs at unhcr oios noted ho wever that the vast majority of the national unvs hired for unhcr in egypt were univers ity students without any work experience thus requiring intensive training prior to taking up their assignment according to the unv guidance note bonn march 1998 there are two main national unv categories 5 national unv specialist with minimum experience of five years or more and national unv field workers with two years minimum relevant wor king experience this prerequisite working experience which would qualify them as pro viders of much needed technical expertise in given field had not been adequately taken into consideration when recruiting unvs to work with unhcr in cairo 24 oios met undpunv officer in cairo who expressed strong reservations on the actual use of unvs by the regional representation and the abnormally significant turnover rate of unvs for example young inexperienced nat ional unvs with professional maturity were tasked to perform key functions suc h as visiting persons in prisons and conducting interviews there during the events of cember 2005 undpunv in cairo explained that they were not human resource offic for unhcr and the unv programme is not designed to address the staffing shortage ex perienced by the regional representation unvs should not be seen as substitute staff partic ularly in such high numbers undpunv also stated that they did not have the staffing res ources to deal with the administrative procedures of the high number of unvs required by u nhcr as well as the high turnover of unvs experienced by the regional representation dpunv also pointed out that the unv programme and the nature of the positions held by unvs at the regional representation such as registration are different from and unusual compared with the activities normally undertaken by unvs 25 oios found that since the beginning of 2006 unhcr had completely taken over the responsibility for the labourintensive recruitment process from undp except for advertising the post and the issuance of contracts despite hcr absorbing most of the administrative work unhcr continued to pay 10 per cent overhead cost to undp this was estimated at about us 16000 in 2006 oios noted that the new rrangement and responsibilities by the regional representation had not been formalized in any written official document such an informal arrangement is not in accordance with the terms of the mou between unhcr and undp it clearly states in paragraph 36 in the event that unhcr carry out the programme and administrative activities on behalf of unvundp the extent of such activities must be agreed upon between unhcr and unvundp and reduced level of overhead charges to unhcr should become applicable based upo n an agreement of the partners the present agreement if it continue s to be the only alternative needs to be formalized and reduced overhead rate agreed oio s is not in accord with such an arrangement whereby the regional representation tinues to take on board additional administrative activities oios agrees that the reg ional representation should make the final decision on the individual unvs to be hired but dpunvs responsibilities should be extended beyond advertising the vacancies and issui ng contracts it should include identifying suitable candidates and in setting up interview pan els although unhcr staff member could be on the panel the regional representation s responsibility should be limited to providing undpunv with the required number of nati onal unvs and the relevant terms of reference 26 oios noted that the procedures for the recruitment of unvs by the regional representation had not been formalized while dr aft sop for the recruitment of unv was recently developed this had still not been fin alized by the time of the audit under the terms of the draft undpunv was not required to pa rticipate in the interview panel according to the programmeadministrative officer from her arrival in june 2006 up to november 2006 she had conducted four recruitments of unvs and only in one instance did undp send someone to attend this in oios opinion is not correct and requirement should be made in the sop that undp are systematica lly involved 6 recommendations head2right the unhcr bureau for north africa and the middle ea st in conjunction with the regional representation in egy pt should reassess the number of unvs used in the operations with the aim of replacing them with staff on regular unhcr c ontracts rec03 head2right the unhcr regional representation in egypt should in their 2007 letter of understanding with undpunv clarify the respective roles and responsibilities of undpunv nd unhcr in the recruitment process of national unvs the labourintensive recruitment process should remain the responsibility of undp and not unhcr rec 04 27 the regional representation stressed that the issue of the use and management of consistently high numbers of unvs over several year s is an issue larger than unhcr cairo reference was also made to the total number of unvs engaged in unhcr and that this had arisen due to the noncreation of regular posts an d the phase out of project staff oios is aware of the number of unvs engaged in unhcr and th particular constraints certain operations have had in obtaining the level of regul ar staff required to implement the activities effectively 28 for recommendation 03 above the regional represent ation informed that over the past years unhcr cairo has in all its submissions f or postcreations in the cops requested the creation of gs posts to decrease the over reli ance on national unvs while the number of unvs has gradually reduced from 27 in 2004 to 22 in 2006 and 20 at the beginning of 2007 it remains fact that the workload exceeds t he capacity of regular posts oios takes note that the number of unvs has decreased in recen t years oios also appreciates that unhcrs budgetary constraints can result in represe ntations seeking alternative staffing arrangements nonetheless oios is still of the op inion that the operation in egypt is too reliant on the services of unvs oios will keep the recommendation open pending confirmation that the number of unv as assessed by the bureau has been reduced to reasonable and manageable level 29 for recommendation 04 above the regional represent ation clarified that they worked in close collaboration with undpunv but d taken extra steps to ensure transparency fairness and objectivity in the nomin ation process the representation took note of oios observation that undpunv was general ly not present during the interview but interview reports were shared and the final sel ection of candidates was done in consultation with unv cairo the regional represent ation undertook however to include clear definition of the respective roles and respon sibilities of undpunv in the recruitment process in the lou the planned date for implementa tion of this recommendation is april 2007 oios takes note of the comments and will keep the r ecommendation open pending confirmation that the letter of understanding with undpunv clarifies the respective roles and responsibilities of undpunv and unhcr in the r ecruitment process breaking of existing unv contracts 30 unvs serving at the regional representation were so metimes offered regular staff appointment despite the fact that they were still u nder undpunv contract for example 7 for one person her last unv contract ran from 1 ja nuary through to 31 december 2004 but was subsequently hired by the regional representati on at the gs level starting on 1 july 2004 another person whose last contract was from 1 january through to 31 december 2005 was offered fixed term appointment contract with unhcr starting on 1 september 2005 while oios appreciated that the selection of those serving unvs might have been made because of their inhouse experience and training by the regional representation the practice did not comply with the mou between unhcr and undpunv paragraphs 44 and 45 states unvs shall not normally be appointe d to regular unhcr posts prior to completion of their contracts with unv in circums tances where unhcr may wish to consider serving unv for appointment to regular unhcr post the parties agree intra alia that there shall be foreshortening of an effec tive contract for the purposes of appointing unv as regular unhcr staff member w ithout prior agreement between unv and unhcr oios did not obtain any evidence t hat such agreement was reached with undp oios recommended that the regional repre sentation comply with the terms of the mou with undpunv and refrain as much as possib from foreshortening unvs contracts to hire them as regular staff the regional representation justified its position with regard to the hiring of unvs as regular staff and stated that in as much as possible they try to avoid to foreshorten national unv contracts also the recruitment does not take place without prior consultation with and agreement by dpunv cairo high turnover rates of national united nations volu nteers 31 oios noted that the regional representation had bee n experiencing significantly high turnover rate of unvs this had negative imp act on the daytoday administration of the office as well as on key protection activities for example the turnover rate staff leaving and replaced by new staff was 64 per cent in 2005 and 32 per cent by october 2006 this resulted in the waste of training costs and time t wo weeks paid orientation programme and increased recruitment costs new interviews cts etc according to the protection officer the high turnover rate some unvs leave af ter only two weeks has been taking between 30 and 40 per cent of her time which has b een devoted to dealing with departurehiring issues following up with undp et c it takes between one to two months to finalize the hiring of new unvs also according t the administrativeprogramme officer about 10 to 15 per cent of her time has been for ch activities not to mention some 5 per cent of the programme assistants time for the same purpose this level of involvement is not acceptable and could be detrimental to the effectiv eness of the operations in egypt if not resolved 32 in their letter dated 22 february 2006 undpunv in formed the regional representation that in 2005 alone it had contribut ed over us 18000 in staff time and that the high turnover rates experienced by the regional representation over the past years had resulted in significant increase in staff time nd administrative transactions to support the operation of unvs in unhcr consequently undpun v requested unv bonn to send an evaluation mission to assess the unv programme i n unhcr cairo 33 according to mission report issued by the joint ssessment team in august 2006 one of the main reasons for the high turnover rate was that unvs after their traininginduction programme become sought after b other operations including unhcrs personal reasons such as securing permanent employ ment family issues furthering studies etc were also considered factors contributing to the high turnover the team also established that unhcr developed an expectation of employment f rom unvs when it appointed national unvs to regular local positions resulting in the foreshortening of unv contracts 8 34 with regard to unvs expectation to secure permanen t employment with unhcr oios noted that in at least one instance unv had served for eight years from 1997 to 2005 at the regional representation and exercised functions not in line with the purpose of unvs such as senior secretary telecommunication perator etc these were clerical andor purely administrative support functions and should not have been tasked to unvs under the unv programme mandate this situation so contravenes unhcrs policy that unvs should not be deployed as substitutes for regu lar staff on longterm basis maximum incumbency is four years recommendation head2right the unhcr regional representation in egypt should based on the conclusions of the joint assessment mission and in conjunction with undpunv and the unv focal point t headquarters explore new waysalternatives with view to reducing the high turnover rate of unvs the region representation should also through proper inductio n briefings to national unvs ensure that false expectations are raised for future preferential career prospects with unhcr rec 05 35 the regional representation informed that action s already been initiated to implement the assessment missions recommendations aimed at reducing the high turnover rate also as recommended by oios in the framework of the induction training briefings will be given to ensure that false expectations are not raised for future preferential career prospects with unhcr oios takes note of the action taken and will keep t he recommendation open pending confirmation that the r ecommendations made by the joint assessment mission have been fully implemented to t he satisfaction of the parties involved key protection functions vested on unvs 36 oios noted that some unvs had been exercising certain functions confirmed by their terms of reference normally performed exclus ively by unhcrs regular staff for example the rsd team leader was an international u nv and was responsible to co ordinate and supervise the work of eligibility assi stants carrying out rsd and to approve the recommendations on rsd made by eligibility assi stants she explained that only more complicated issues if any were referred to her pervisor the senior protection officer in our view the responsibility of approving rsd recom mendations by unv is not in line with unhcrs policy that states the final signing off for decisions on rsd must be taken by unhcr staff members moreover the national unvs w ere working under the supervision of the international unv and not directly under the supervision of unhcr staff member this contravenes the relevant unhcrs policies on t he use of unvs which states that unvs irrespective of their professional competenc ies and qualifications or the functions assigned to them must work under the direct superv ision of unhcr we appreciate that the rsd team leader reports in turn to unhcr inte rnational staff member however the policy requires that unvs should be directly superv ised by regular unhcr staff and not by another unv oios recommended that the regional re presentation ensure that unvs work is performed under the direct supervision of unhcr regular staff the regional representation stated that as of 1 january 2007 gi ven the recent creation of further noa protection post the teamleader of the refugee sta determination team is regular unhcr staff member thereby eliminating situation in which unvs are not directly supervised by regular unhcr staff 9 creation of unv pilot project 37 to address the various unv issues and shortcomings undpunv has proposed together with unhcr to establish pilot unv projec t paralegal programme titled building capacity among young committed graduates on human rights and refugee law in egypt aiming to build the capacity of up to 20 ung committed graduates in egypt roster of unvs would then be established to serve u nhcr operations in egypt the project would entail the appointment of an international v titled human resources specialist whose post would be located at the regional represe ntation though the position would be financed by undpunv the international unv would be tasked with the recruitment management and follow up of unvs including the est ablishment of the roster of unvs 38 oios was concerned however that in substance the project was not much different from the present unv arrangement and that it is rely the result of undpunv trying to shifttransfer its administrative responsibilities relating to national unvs onto the regional representation one of the objectives of the projec t is to create pool of human resources 20 unvs in our view maintaining pool or ro ster of 20 national unvs does not in anyway guarantee that they would be available to rve at unhcr when need be it is our understanding that in fact these national unvs wo uld already be working at the regional representation under the same conditions as at pres ent hence oios did not see how the creation of this project could address the issue of high turnover other than having the advantage of clarity and transparency in the actual use of national unvs in oios view this looks very much like project staff arrangement that was phasedout some few years back b refugee status determination rsd 39 rsd for sudanese nationals was suspended in june 20 04 following the peace accord in sudan it was initially limited to six months and then extended number of times during which the number of asylumseekers had drastically increased with an estimated figure of 13000 sudanese to date the regional representation informed that decisions on the continuation of suspension of automatic rsd for sud anese nationals have been taken in close consultation with headquarters in our view given the current staffing level it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to carry ou t fullyfledged rsd except for limited vulnerable cases oios witnessed some of the daily influx of asylumseekers an average of 200 individuals per day according to the regional r epresentation oios understands that it takes four to five months from the distribution of the registration forms to actual registration of asylumseekers in our view this is too long delay given that the delivery of residence permit by the egyptian authorities is dependant upo n beneficiaries producing yellow or blue cards the regional representation explained that this was mainly due to the lack of adequate reception facilities and security it is xpected that this waiting period will be significantly reduced with the facilities at the pr oposed new building the deputy representative further pointed out that most likely unhcr would not resume automatic and general individual rsd for sudanese asylumseekers registered with unhcr in egypt given that they possess particular legal status under t he four freedoms agreement signed between the arab republic of egypt and sudan in 200 4 asylumseekers yellow cards enjoy the same protection as bluecard holders refoul ement allowing each of the two groups to have renewable residence permits of six months only in cases of sudanese asylumseekers with special needs or protection concerns in egypt is full rsd conducted 10 c supply management procurement 40 oios assessed that the regional representations pr ocurement procedures were generally satisfactory local committee on cts had been established to deal with cases above us 20000 and local purchase commit tee to deal with small purchases from us 1500 up to us 20000 oios would question th cost effectiveness of having local purchasing committee whereby purchases between us 1500 and us 20000 are submitted and approved 41 there was need to reassess the competitiveness f the current security company that was selected about 10 years ago the service cts for security had not been reviewed for years evidence of review since 1996 this was also the case for cleaning services maintenance of photocopy machines etc the regional representation explained that it was planning to retender most of the services currentl provided once it moves to the new office premises 42 oios noted that procurement procedures by the imple menting partner caritas were not always evidenced for example under paym ent voucher 1320 caritas procured two computers and printer for 18900 us 3315 from local supplier there was document evidencing the bidding process car itas explained that it had been instructed by their regional office to procure fr om specified supplier global brands caritas indicated that in 2004 it had also been in structed by unhcr to purchase photocopying machine from particular supplier oi appreciates that the regional representation may have determined through its proc edures the best suppliers however instructing partners to use specific suppliers blur s the distinction between direct implementation and implementation by partners if the regional representation was of the opinion that caritas did not have the capacity to c arry out transparent competitive bidding process then the items should have been di rectly procured by the regional representation and handed over to the partner fo r the computers procured oios noted that caritas had paid vat 10 per cent which could hav been saved had unhcr made the procurement directly oios recommended that the re gional representation in egypt refrain from instructing implementing partners to make thei r procurement from any particular supplier the regional representation accepted oios recommen dation and implemented it immediately oios appreciates the positive action taken b asset management 43 assettrak was generally well maintained and uptod ate though there was need to barcode some items for example two of the office vehicles volvo 940 and volvo s60 and tv and video equipment had not been properly re gistered corrective action for the motor vehicles was taken by the end of the audit 44 the regional representation informed oios that nu mber of pieces of office furniture at the current office premises actually b elonged to the landlord and that the office was unable to determine which ones this is because not only were records taken of the furniture available in the building prior to moving in but also the lease agreement had made reference to any furniture belonging to the land lord making it even more difficult to identify on reliable basis oios understands that unhcr is using the landlords records of his furniture to establish what furniture belongs t unhcr handwritten list is being 11 compiled and so far 227 items have been identified as belonging to unhcr the items belonging to the landlord have yet to be documented and cleared with him oios recommended that although the new building to which unhcr will move in februarymarch 2006 is leased unfurnished the regi onal representation should ensure that assets presently owned by unhcr are fully accounted for d security and safety 45 the regional representation was not moss compliant however it was expected that the proposed new building to which unhcr will move in februarymarch 2007 would be moss compliant once all the recommendations for security enhancements in the senior field security advisors sfsa mission report date d 10 july 2006 have been implemented the new location has been securitycleared by undss security advisor in light of events that led to the refugee demonstrations and shortcom ings associated with the existing security arrangements at the current premises the regional representation should ensure that the recommendations made by the sfsa are duly implement ed at the new premises administration 46 in the areas of administration and finance the reg ional representation generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under revie w management system renewal project msrp 47 the msrp system was rolled out to the regional rep resentation in october 2006 oios was informed that there were number of probl ems encountered in moving from fmis to the new msrp system although many of them were resolved nonetheless the office was still experiencing number of recurring problems this may be due to misunderstanding by the staff responsible or limitations of the system for example the finance assistant complained about the need to select and print each and every voucher one at time when under fmis as many vouchers as needed could be sel ected and printed in one go given the number of payments vouchers pvs that have signifi cantly increased in 2006 up to 30 pvs per week for the repatriation only the process s proved very timeconsuming and inefficient one another example while pvs were b eing processed on sunday which was working day in egypt problem occurred in the system despite request of assistance made to headquarters the msrp emergency unit infor med the regional representation that it would need to wait until monday working day in geneva to sort out the problem the regional representative explained that headquarters is planning for 2007 to outpost three regional msrp posts in cairo and it is expected th at most of the current problems experienced with msrp will be resolved 48 the regional representation informed oios that reso urces have been stretched with the implementation of msrp for example for the vo luntary repatriation project sudanese caseload the regional representation currently pr ocesses 30 payment vouchers and cheques per week from only 10 pvs per week with fmis the regional representative indicated that he currently signs as many as 55 cheques and v ouchers each day oios took note of this and suggested that such tasks could in part be dele gated to another international staff member with designated authority when necessary oios was also of the opinion that as far as payments to refugees are concerned and given that there are many it is not practical to issue payment voucher and cheque for each of them i nstead single cheque could be issued to 12 professional staff member as an operational advan ce recorded in suspense account for onward distribution and accounting for this advance once payments have been effected appropriately evidenced on cash payment sheets dis charged by the beneficiaries this has been the practice in many other unhcr operations nd if sound internal controls are in place it should reduce the administrative burden of the office the regional representation informed that the new arrangement has impacted posi tively on the workload and efficiency of the process and that in fact the endeavours to fin d an alternative solution had started as early as in november 2006 in consultations with the finance section at headquarters and that confirmation by oios that the practice could b implemented was appreciated 49 for several years the regional representation has been consistently experiencing problems with its present bank as evidenced by the significant number of complaint letters sent to the bank oios had previously raised this issue in its 2001 audit report ar200130102 refers and had recommended that the regional representation conduct bank survey with view to obtaining better service oios noted that while survey was conducted report outlining the assessment and r ecommendations could be found and that the same bank has continued to be used 50 the situation has not improved over the years with for example the bank not complying with proper cut off dates errors consist ently made in the computation of charges andor interest and late issuance of bank statemen ts in light of these persistent problems oios could not understand why the same bank was sti ll being used especially given that the regional representation was informed that the main agencies including undp unicef and who were all using another bank in our view serious steps should be taken to discontinue the use of the present bank market s urvey should be conducted including consultation with other agencies and change b considered taking into consideration the plan to move the current office premises from d owntown cairo to the new location some 40 km away recommendation head2right the unhcr regional representation in egypt should c onduct market survey and consult with other agencies in cairo with the aim of improving its bank services taking into sideration the move to the new office premises rec 06 51 the regional representation informed that survey was conducted in january 2007 and another relevant survey to identify the major b anks near the new location of unhcrs premises the invitation to bid invitation was sent out to six major and decision is expected by april 2007 oios is pleased to note the positive action taken nd will keep the recommendation open pending confirmation that new bank has been selected 52 there was dormant bank account maintained in cal currency at misr international bank with current balance of 30 000 us 6000 the account had been opened in 2002 and was for the receipt of donations from fundraising activities these funds relate to donations received in 2003 since then t here had been movement recorded on the bank account except for debits pertaining to bank commissions etc oios recommended that the regional representation reassess the need to m aintain its bank account at misr international bank based on activities in the fores eeable future if fundraising activities are planned the account should be closed with d ecision taken on how the balance of us 6000 could be used the regional representation informed that the arriv of the senior 13 regional global pui officer will result in renewed impetus and efforts in local fundraising this may mean that the bank account will become aga in operational meanwhile the regional representation will seek headquarters auth orization to use the current available balance of approximately usd 6000 oios takes not of the comments made and is confident that appropriate action will be taken 53 the deadlines in 2004 for the submission of monthly accounts were in most cases not complied with while in 2005 and 2006 none of the s ubmissions were made by the required date of the 10 th day of the following month oios appreciates that with the introduction of msrp this should longer be an issue as monthly accounts are now online oios noted that bank reconciliations were often prepared after much delay attributed to the late receipt of bank statements for example the monthly accounts together with the bank reconciliations for march 2006 were only submitted in early may 200 6 in line with the recommendation to conduct market survey of identifying more suita ble bank the regional representation should ensure that one of the criteria to be consid ered is the obtaining of bank statements on timely basis v acknowledgement 54 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistanc and cooperation
