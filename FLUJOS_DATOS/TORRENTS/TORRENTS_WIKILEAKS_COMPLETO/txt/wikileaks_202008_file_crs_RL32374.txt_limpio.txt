institutions updated july 7 2004 danielle langton analyst in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress anticorruption standards of the international financial institutions summary the international financial institutions ifis all have procedures to prevent identify and punish corruption within their organizations the world bank appears to have the most extensive and detailed process for addressing corruption issues but the other multilateral development banks mdbs have or are establishing similar procedures the international monetary fund imf does not make loans for specific projects all its loans go directly to the central bank or finance ministry of the borrower country nevertheless it also has procedures for preventing investigating and punishing unethical or corrupt practices organizations may achieve more effective anticorruption programs by implementing complementary measures to counter corruption at many levels these include scrutiny of the ifis lending procedures their systems for the procurement of goods and services staff conduct oversight and management of their operations and the education of staff on policies and procedures major procedures for controlling corruption include the establishment of an independent corruption unit an oversight committee mandatory staff financial disclosure procedures and corruption reporting hotline the world bank is the only ifi that has adopted procedures in all four areas most of the others excepting the african development bank afdb and the international fund for agricultural development ifad have procedures in three of these areas the afdb requires mandatory staff financial disclosure and is considering possible action in the other areas ifads anti corruption unit is organized differently than the other ifis in that anticorruption responsibilities are carried out by its office of internal audit but it functions similarly to anticorruption units at the other ifis also ifad is still in the process of implementing mandatory staff financial disclosure this report provides on sidebyside basis comparisons of the anticorruption procedures in the mdbs and the imf it also provides detailed description of the institutional arrangements each ifi has adopted to address corruption issues this report will be updated if significant changes are made in the systems and procedures it describes contents corruption and the ifis 1 anticorruption measures in the mdbs 4 the world bank 4 the international monetary fund 5 international fund for agricultural development 6 african development bank 7 asian development bank 8 european bank for reconstruction and development 9 the interamerican development bank 10 list of tables table 1 ifi anticorruption features at glance 3 table 2 comparison of the ifis anticorruption mechanisms 11 anticorruption standards of the international financial institutions corruption and the ifis corruption is broadly defined as the abuse of public or private office for personal gain this includes but is not limited to taking bribes granting contract or choosing project in order to make profit or to allow someone else to make profit or coercing someone else to act in corrupt manner most of the multilateral development banks mdbs define corruption and state their policies relating to it in their codes of conduct for staff procurement guidelines and other public documents this report is based on information provided by the international financial institutions themselves through publicly available information on their websites and correspondence with members of their staff it compares on sidebyside basis the international financial institutions ifis procedures and policies for preventing and punishing corruption in their operations it does not attempt to evaluate the extent to which the ifis adhere to these standards and guidelines1 the anticorruption measures at the mdbs are new and in some cases notably in the african development bank are still being implemented the need for anti corruption policies became evident in the late 1990s when scandals involving corruption became public and the activities of the mdbs were more closely scrutinized development specialists recognized the importance of combating corruption to achieve economic development and in response the mdbs began to provide technical assistance in corruption prevention and governance to member countries they recognized that improving the anticorruption mechanisms within their own organizations would complement governance activities in developing countries and increase development effectiveness as well as improve their own credibility on governance issues the united states and the international community have been influential in the increased attention to anticorruption standards the g8 finance ministers and central bankers issued statement at their meeting in rome in july 2001 that recognized the recent improvements in the internal governance of the mdbs but added that further improvements were still needed at the june 2004 g8 summit at sea island georgia the g8 issued statement on fighting corruption in developing countries announcing that the imf agreed to publish its program documents and surveillance reports effective july 2004 the interamerican 1 jonathan sanford specialist in international political economy assisted in the final preparation of this report for publication crs2 development bank idb also agreed to an improved disclosure policy at the summit furthermore the g8 pledged to encourage developing countries to meet the high disclosure standards set by the ifis the g8 recognizes that corruption is detrimental to economic development and fighting corruption requires cooperation between the ifis and member countries on transparency and disclosure policies2 in 2003 congress instructed the us executive directors to seek changes in each of the mdbs that would make their procedures for controlling corruption clearer and more transparent3 for procedural reasons the imf was not included within the scope of the act congress specified that they shall use the voice and vote of the united states in each mdb to ensure that by june 30 2005 each institution 1 posts an annual report on its website containing statistical summaries and case studies of the fraud and corruption cases pursued by its investigations unit 2 establishes plan for conducting regular independent audits of internal management controls including fraud prevention and making reports publicly available and 3 establishes an effective procedure for the receipt retention and treatment of complaints received by the bank regarding fraud and other matters of internal control the secretary of the treasury is required to report to congress by september 1 2004 on the actions taken by each mdb to achieve these goals experts say measures for countering corruption at the mdbs must be implemented on many levels to be effective these include bank lending and operations procurement of goods and services staff conduct independent internal reporting mechanisms to address allegations of misconduct oversight and management of bank operations and educating staff on policies and procedures the establishment of effective internal controls is presumptively deterrent reducing the number of corruption cases that the system handles internal controls that aim to ensure the efficiency of the organization as whole such as internal audit procedures to ascertain that organizational policies and procedures are being followed complement explicit anticorruption procedures high level of transparency and accountability in all operations helps to combat corruption in addition to specific anticorruption measures taken 2 sea island g8 summit 2004 summit documents available online at httpwwwg8usagovd_061004ehtm accessed july 6 2004 3

international fund for agricultural development b ebrd european bank for reconstruction and development c idb interamerican development bank d ifad does not have unit dedicated to anticorruption activities however the office of internal audit oa is independent and has anticorruption responsibilities in addition to other audit and investigation responsibilities sanctions are an important aspect of internal control but they are only as effective as the mechanisms for detecting and investigating corrupt behavior each of the ifis consider similar sanctions for misbehavior such as demotions and dismissals of staff members blacklisting firms and the cancellation of loans for borrowers despite the efforts by the mdbs to implement internal controls and prevent corruption it is impossible to completely eliminate the possibility that mdb resources will be used toward corrupt ends it is possible for mdbs to ensure that the actual loans are used legitimately but in corrupt country they may be used to free up resources for less legitimate purposes furthermore there is distinction between the operations of the mdb management and the decisions made by the executive board the executive board is composed of representatives of member countries with political interests and it is these board members who make the decisions about whether to make loan or grant the conditionality for that assistance and whether borrowers have sufficiently met the conditionality requirements anti corruption efforts are focused on the activities of management not the decisions of the executive board in the most airtight organization it may still be possible for corruption to occur however the consistent implementation of internal controls can crs4 send clear message that corruption is not tolerated within the organization and this could have positive impact on the organizations experience with corruption the world bank took the lead among the international financial institutions ifis in implementing its anticorruption system in 1997 the regional mdbs have moved since to set up basically similar systems with organizational variations the mdbs have made substantial changes in their internal controls over the last five years which are aimed at bolstering their effectiveness however there are still concerns about inadequate effectiveness and insufficient independence of these controls the mdbs communicate with each other on issues of transparency and accountability through the evaluation cooperation group ecg an organization of evaluation departments of mdbs all of the institutions listed below are members of the ecg with the exception of the international fund for agricultural development ifad the european investment bank eib component of the european union eu is also member of the ecg the united states is not member of the eib anticorruption measures in the mdbs the world bank the world banks internal audit department iad began working in anti corruption issues in 1997 special unit the department of institutional integrity int was created in 1998 hiring specialists from outside the bank as well as employees from within iad4 in may 1998 the bank established the oversight committee on fraud and corruption ocfc to oversee the banks anticorruption system the ocfc is composed of high level bank officials from administrative offices at the world bank in addition the bank established sanctions committee to review findings of investigations related to fraud and corruption by contractors further the bank established 24hour free telephone hotline and post office box hotline to receive allegations of fraud and corruption available for use by bank staff and the public the hotline is managed by an outside firm and observes strict confidentiality users of the hotline may remain anonymous reports of fraud or corruption from the hotline are sent to the ocfc after an initial review the ocfc determines whether the allegations warrant an investigation and whether the investigation will be carried out by the investigations unit of iad the office of professional ethics or by external specialized investigative resources at the completion of the investigation the ocfc reviews the case and refers the case either to senior management or the sanctions committee for further action or to the appropriate authorities for criminal prosecution or civil action 4 for description of the ints procedures and discussion of one instance where it investigated allegations of corruption see crs report rs21501 world bank bujagali hydropower project by jonathan sanford crs5 the world banks efforts to fight corruption also encompass the procurement process the bank disburses billions of dollars annually to finance purchases necessary for the implementation of projects the bank has standards and guidelines aimed at ensuring that procurement funds are spent on their intended uses and that staff members or contractors abuse the procurement process one difficulty is that the borrower not the bank has control over the procurement process however the bank has taken steps to monitor compliance over the last two years the bank has hired independent firms to audit more than 50 bankfunded projects they found instances of misprocurement in 40 contracts out of about 45000 that were included in the audit5 the sanctions committee may blacklist contractors and consultants who are found to be involved in corrupt activities either for stated period of time or indefinitely the bank maintains list of such firms ineligible for bank contracts on its public website the audits are also used to develop plans with the borrower to build capacity to avoid future fraud and corruption separate from specific anticorruption efforts the world bank group has an operations evaluations department oed an independent evaluation unit which reports directly to the executive directors the oed rates the performance and development impact of bank lending operations it also evaluates the effectiveness of the banks general policies and procedures its mandate is not directly related to anticorruption but it adds to accountability at the bank and thus complements anti corruption efforts the bank also as an independent inspection panel which also reports directly to the executive board composed of three outside experts plus small secretariat the panel receives complaints from the public and assesses whether the bank has complied with its own rules and procedural guidelines in the design and implementation of bankfunded projects or programs again this is not specific control against financial corruption but it is measure to insure that the banks operational rules or policies are not inappropriately breached the international monetary fund the imf is different from the mdbs in that it does not fund projects rather it provides balance of payments finance that typically involves boosting the reserves of the central bank as money in the central bank can be fungible it is difficult to track specific uses of imf resources nonetheless the imf has instituted safeguards framework that aims to verify that the central bank has the proper control and auditing systems in place to manage its resources including fund disbursements key element is requirement that countries publish annual central bank financial statements that are independently audited in accordance with internationallyaccepted standards the centerpiece of the imfs internal controls is its code of conduct for staff which is supported by financial disclosure requirements for senior staff to prevent financial conflicts of interest and an ethics officer the ethics officer position was 5 these are not necessarily instances of corruption but they are cases of noncompliance with the banks procurement rules crs6 established in february 2000 to investigate alleged violations of the code of conduct and of other imf rules and regulations the ethics officer is appointed by the managing director and is intended to be an impartial person having former employment with the imf however there is prohibition on future employment with the fund and the ethics officers term may be extended by the managing director the ethics officer conducts investigations at the direction of the managing director or the director of human resources hrd or heshe initiates investigations with the approval of the oversight committee oc the oc is composed of three senior imf officials with the director of hrd as chair the oc also rules in the event of staff appeal and determines if an investigation should be begun as well as whether one should be continued the independent evaluation office ieo was established in july 2001 to support the board in institutional governance and oversight responsibilities it reports directly to the executive board and its purpose is to evaluate imf advice operations and policies the ieo staff is hired from both outside and from within the imf the imf has made efforts in recent years to make its policies and operations more transparent and open to public scrutiny the fund publishes all article iv staff reports for the public as matter of policy unless an individual country does not consent to having its report published countries have right under the articles of agreement to block any ifi disclosures about their internal economic conditions countries that block such disclosure can be readily identified however and potential investors or lenders may note that there may be information about its internal economic situation which the country does not wish to release to the public the imf also releases fund policy papers the minutes of executive board meetings details of loan programs and annual evaluations international fund for agricultural development the international fund for agricultural development ifad is specialized agency of the united nations it seeks to prevent corruption by prescreening potential recipients of grant financing and through structured financial reporting and audit requirements for loan and grant recipients grant recipients must follow procurement guidelines acceptable to ifad to ensure transparency the procurement guidelines have recently been amended to specifically address fraud and corruption and they were presented to the executive board in april 2004 for approval after they are reviewed by the audit committee ifad is different than the other ifis in that it is specialized agency of the and it conducts investigations in manner consistent with the rules of the united nations ifad set up its oversight committee oc in may 2000 to coordinate investigations into irregular practices either within ifad or in connection with operations and contracts financed by ifad the oc is similar to investigations units in the mdbs but it operates on higher level as it is composed of the vice president the general counsel and the chief of internal audit it decides whether an investigation is warranted determines who should be involved in the investigation and reports the facts emerging from the investigation to the president if external agencies such as national authorities are involved in an investigation the oc determines ifads role in that investigation external agencies report the findings crs7 of their investigations to the oc which then reports to the president the president makes decisions about sanctions independent of the oc the office of internal audit oa reviews operations of ifad for efficiency and integrity and participates in investigations of fraud and corruption it is an independent unit with only review responsibilities and involvement in sanctions the head of oa reports to the president african development bank as part of the banks zero tolerance policy staff members of the african development bank afdb are required to submit financial disclosures and they are required to comply with the staff code of conduct in the recent past allegations were investigated by the internal audit department iad or by an adhoc team including the general counsel the banks procurement review committee prc receives the findings and conclusions of investigations and decides on plan of action including sanctions both against the borrower cancellation of loans or the contractorconsultants who have been declared ineligible to participate in bank funded operations for minimum period of five years the afdb has established guidelines and procedures for preventing and combating fraud and corruption in bank group operations efforts are also underway to establish specific unit within the existing internal audit department iad to conduct internal investigations and to provide protection for whistle blowers in the form of hotline for complaints of misconduct it is also considering proposal for the establishment of senior management oversight committee to combat fraud and corruption much like the oversight committees at some of the other mdbs additionally the management of the bank has submitted final proposals to the afdb for the establishment of an independent compliance review and mediation unit crmu the crmu would focus on issues of noncompliance by the bank group with regard to operational policies and procedures in the design implementation or supervision of bankfinanced project under this plan third parties would be able to submit complaints of harm from bank activities to the crmu the crmu would not be directly involved in fraud or corruption investigations but would complement the anticorruption activities of the bank by adding to accountability there are units within the bank that work in similar ways to the proposed crmu the iad investigates compliance with bank rules but it does not have the capacity to respond to complaints from third parties meanwhile the operations policy and review department oprd reviews all bank projects and programs for compliance with afdb operating policies and procedures as they enter the financing pipeline the 2002 presidential directive on the bank operation evaluation department opev allows the department to carry out its functions independently opev was established to provide comprehensive and objective assessment of the development effectiveness of the bank groups strategies policies operations processes and procedures it undertakes independently of the banks operational units performance crs8 evaluation of completed and selected ongoing projects and examines their development impact it reports directly to the board of directors which supervises the departments work through its committee on operations and development effectiveness code the reporting relationship of opev and its director is reportedly materially similar to that of the world banks evaluation department asian development bank at the asian development bank adb an anticorruption unit oaga within the office of the auditor general oag is responsible for implementing the adbs anticorruption policies with oversight from the oversight committee on corruption in addition to investigating allegations of corruption the oaga provides training to adb staff and member countries in anticorruption procurement and investigative techniques it provided extensive training to staff members on the revisions to the code of conduct involving corruption oaga receives reports of corruption and screens them to determine whether they warrant further investigation its decisions are reviewed by the oversight committee on anticorruption which is comprised of three voting members and three alternates who are nominated by the auditor general and approved by the president oaga coordinates investigations which it may conduct by itself or with the help of external auditors investigators or other experts selected by oaga or designated by the oversight committee at the conclusion of an investigation oaga submits its findings to the oversight committee which then determines whether the alleged violation took place whether there is need for further inquiry and ultimately what sanction or remedial action adb should impose appeals of oversight committee decisions are brought to the review committee which is composed of adb vice presidents adb may declare firm or individual ineligible to participate in adbfinanced projects and activities for specified time period or indefinitely firms declared ineligible are notified and are listed on the adb website only if adb is unable to contact them or if they attempt to participate in an adb activity during their period of ineligibility if adb consistently encounters problems with particular executing agency or sector it has the flexibility to change its programming mix to avoid working in that area likewise adb can focus its lending and technical assistance on strengthening government institutions to facilitate greater transparency and accountability the asian bank has an operations evaluation department whose head reports to the adb executive board through the bank president the adb has established new inspection mechanism to reinforce accountability and address in fair and objective way the concerns of persons affected by adbassisted projects special project facilitator will focus on informal problemsolving and an independent three member compliance review panel will investigate alleged violations of the adbs operational policies and procedures crs9 european bank for reconstruction and development at the european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd the chief compliance officer cco is responsible for ensuring professional integrity the cco identifies relevant standards and best practices in this area and promotes them in the bank enhances staff awareness of the banks commitment to such standards conducts investigations of allegations in accordance with the procedures for reporting and investigating suspected misconduct prism and monitors the banks hotline and follows up as appropriate complaints related to fraud or corruption are directed by the cco to the appropriate office within the bank the cco is independent of bank project operations the hotline is reportedly available to report allegations of fraud or corruption from all countries on the part of bank officials employees consultants or bank financed projects the banks procurement policy states that all entities involved in bank projects must adhere to high ethical standards and it defines corruption the bank may reject proposal cancel financing or blacklist firm for reasons of corruption in bank related activities the bank will maintain list of blacklisted firms on its website although currently firms are blacklisted from participating in bankfinanced activities to prevent corruption through increased accountability and transparency the ebrd has public information policy governing disclosure to the public an environmental policy and an independent recourse mechanism irm to receive complaints from groups adversely affected by bankfinanced projects the irm was approved by the board in april 2003 and was implemented shortly thereafter complaints to the irm must not be related to fraud or corruption those are directed to the hotline and the cco the ebrd has project evaluation department ped that reports to the president via the secretary generals office and is independent of banking operations the ped evaluates both projects and technical assistance programs for compliance with the banks mandate by comparing actual with expected outcomes it makes note of the lessons learned and disseminates them within the bank the ped also conducts sector studies and has pilot program to evaluate country strategies this form of project review may add to accountability and transparency at the bank the broader or operational review functions are performed by the board of directors or one of the three board committees one such committee is the boards audit committee which has the responsibility to ensure that ped and other related functions such as compliance and internal audit are able to perform their duties independently the audit committee also aims to ensure that these functions are performing needed role within the bank have adequate resources and institutional capacity to perform their roles and their performance meets expectations the audit committee recently recommended adopting an internal controls framework that aims to assure compliance with bank policies and the board accepted this recommendation crs10 the interamerican development bank in june 2001 the interamerican development bank idb created an oversight committee on fraud and corruption ocfc the ocfc does not actually conduct investigations but it oversees investigations of fraud and corruption that are conducted by the office of institutional integrity oii the ocfc may impose appropriate remedies oversee their implementation and determine when matters should be referred to national authorities the ocfc is composed of members of senior management of the bank and reports directly to the president the oii was created in october 2003 and it is an independent office that reports directly to the bank president it is responsible for receiving allegations of fraud and corruption and it submits reports of completed investigations to the ocfc for final decision issues not involving fraud or corruption are referred to the proper authority within the bank oii also aims to prevent corruption by promoting and disseminating the banks policies on fraud and corruption to bank staff and by leveraging the results of investigations in order to improve preventative measures the oii also reportedly serves as the secretariat to the ocfc the ethics committee and the conduct review committee statistics on fraud and corruption cases at the idb are available on its website from its inception in april 2002 to april 2004 ocfc and later oii have received 183 allegations averaging about 7 per month the ocfcoii have opened 92 investigations during the past two years including investigations that have been concluded and those still in progress allegations can be reported to the oii through tollfree hotline number secure email fax surface mail in person or via the banks website the idb has also recently adopted rule providing protection for whistleblowers strictly prohibiting retaliation against bank staff for reporting an allegation of fraud or corruption or violation of law rule or regulation of the bank the ocfc classifies allegations in accordance with the operating guidelines and regulations for the oversight committee allegations relating to fraud and corruption that appear to be credible are sent to the auditor generals office ago which determines whether an investigation should be initiated the ago conducts the investigation if required with ocfc oversight the ago submits the report of the completed investigation to the ocfc for decision issues not involving fraud or corruption are referred to the proper authority within the bank there are other mechanisms at the idb that aim to enhance accountability and efficiency the banks ethics committee reviews allegations of unethical behavior on the part of bank staff as described in the code of ethics in 2003 the banks board of executive directors adopted its own code of ethics which will regulate board members own behavior as distinct from the code of ethics for bank management the bank requires external audits of financial statements for project executing entities and the projects themselves throughout the execution period of the project until all funds have been disbursed the banks procurement committee oversees the banks procurement policies it resolves major procurementrelated issues during project implementation including awards to bidders not evaluated as the lowest and all protests by bidders submitted during the procurement process the independent crs11 investigation mechanism iim investigates formal complaints from groups alleging that they have been negatively affected by bankfinanced project due to the bank not having complied with its own operational policies the idbs independent evaluation office is the office of evaluation and oversight ove which evaluates project performance and the effectiveness of idb policy and programs the ove reports to the executive board and it has an independent budget approved by the board its findings are publicized through the new information
