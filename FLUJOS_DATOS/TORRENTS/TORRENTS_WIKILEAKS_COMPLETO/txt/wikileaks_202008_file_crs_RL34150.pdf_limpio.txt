divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34150climate change and the eu emissions trading scheme ets kyoto and beyond summary the european unions eu emissions trading scheme ets is cornerstone of the eus efforts to meet its obligati on under the kyoto protocol it covers more than 1000 energy intensive facilities acro ss the 27 eu member countries covered entities emit about 45 of the eus carbon di oxide emissions phase 1 trading period began january 1 2005 second phase 2 trading period began in 2008 covering the period of the kyoto prot ocol with phase 3 proposed for 2013 several positives resulting from the phase 1 learning by doing exercise assisted the ets in making the phase 2 process run more smoothly including 1 greatly improving emissions data 2 encouraging development of the kyoto protocols projectbased mechanisms clean development mechanism cdm and joint implementation ji and 3 influencin g corporate behavior to begin pricing in the value of allowances in decisionmaking particularly in the electric utility sector however several issues that arose durin g the first phase were not resolved as the ets moved into phase 2 including llocation schemes shutdown credits and new entrant reserves and others in ddition the expansion of the eu and the implementation of the directives linking the ets to the kyoto protocol projectbased mechanisms created new issues to which phase 2 had to respond more comprehensive response to these i ssues is envisioned for phase 3 the united states is not party to kyot however almost four years of carbon emissions trading has given the eu valuab experience in designing and operating greenhouse gas trading system this ex perience may provide some insight into capandtrade design issues currently being debated in the united states the us requires only elec tric utilities to monitor co2 the euets experience suggests that expanding similar requirements to all facilities covered under capandtrade scheme would be pivotal for developing allocation systems reduction targets and enforcement provisions in the us debate on comprehensive versus sectorspecific reduction programs the euets experience suggest s that adding sectors to trading scheme once established may be slow contentious process as with most eu industries most us industry groups either oppose auctions outright or want them to be supplemental to base free allocation the euets experience suggests congress may want to consider specifying any auction requi rement if it wishes to incorporate market economics more fully into compliance decisions euets analysis suggests the most important variables in determining phase 1 allowance price changes were oil and natural gas price changes this apparent linkage raises possible market manipulation issues particularly with the inclusion of fina ncial instruments such as options and futures contracts congress may cons ider whether the government needs enhanced regulatory and oversight authority over such instruments

pricing in the value of allowances into their daily operations and 87 into future marginal pricing decisions all industries stated that it was fact or in longterm decisionmaking11 however several issues that arose durin g the first phase remain contentious as the ets implements phase 2 including allo cation including use of auctions and reliance on model projections shutdown credits and new

emissions reductions it is unclear to what degree the first phase of the ets ach ieved real emissions reductions emissions are dynamic over time product of countrys population economic activity and gr eenhouse gas intensity13 to capture these dynamics the member states of the eu develop emi ssions baselines from models that project future trends in countrys emissions ba sed on these and other factors such as anticipated energy and greenhouse gas policies14 during the first phase the emissions goal was to put the eu on th path to kyoto compliance not actually comply with the protocol which wasn t necessary until the 20082012 time period thus countries developed business as usual baselines based on projected growth in emissions such projected baseline ffers from two sources of uncertainty data uncertainties and forecasting uncertainties on data phase 1 suffered from uncertainties with respect to data collection and coverage in monitoring methods for historic data and data verification on projecting future emissions phase 1 faced uncertainties with respect to economic or sectorbased growth rates fueled in many cases by overoptimistic economic growth assumptions these uncertainties increased the probability of inflated business as usual baselines15 the combination of these factors and modest reduction re quirements resulted in the emissions allocations for the 20052007 trading period being higher than actua1 2005 emissions16 this result has raised ques tions about how much reductions achieved during phase 1 were real as opposed to being merely paper

profits as stated by ellerman and buchner first and most importantly the persistently high price for euas eu emissions allowances in market characterized by sufficient liquidity and sophisticated players must be considered as creating presumption of abatement it would be startling if power companies did not in corporate eua prices into dispatch decisions that would have shifted generation to less emitting plants there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that this was the case and the prominent charges of windfall profits assume that the opportunity cost of freely allocated allowances was being passed on without ting the implications for abatement similarly it would be surprising if there were changes in production processes that could be made by the operators of industrial plants17 however eu emissions allowances euas during phase 1 did not maintain value phase 1 euas were basically wort hless during the final six months of 2007 this decline in eua prices at least par tially

permitting the use of kyoto mechanisms for compliance including the linking directive has had beneficial effects on the development of ji and cdm markets nd more generally on co2 reduction projects in the developing world29 this emerging jicdm supply has the pot ential to largely compensate for the projected eu15 shortfall in meetin g the kyoto protocol requirements30 according to the world bank the estimated aggregate shor tfall distance to target for the eu 15 for phase 2 ranges from 900 1500 million metric tonnes of co2e co2 equivalent with an average estimate of 1250 million this represents an 810 further reduction from projected levels and is in line with the eu estimated shortfall discussed above31 the world bank cites estima tes that 10001200 million metric tonnes of co2e credits from cdm and ji projects are likely to be imported into the euets put in perspective it means that installations using credits from cdm and ji could be in balanced position or marg inally short one in the latter case fuel switching would help bridge the gap32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34150crs11 33 ibid p 16however potential barrier to this scenario is the supplementarity requirements of the kyoto pr otocol which is embodied in criterion 12 of the ec nap approval process supplemen tarity requires that devel oped countries such as most eu countries ensure that their use of ji cdm credits is supplemental to their own domestic control efforts in defining s upplementarity for phase 2 the ec used 10 of countrys allowance allocation as ru of thumb in approving naps with greater limit possible based on countrys dom estic efforts to reduce emissions as indicated in table 2 this process resulted in some significant reductions in some countries proposed limits eg ireland pola nd spain but some increase in others eg italy latvia lithuania althoug h these reductions appear substantial in individual cases most analysts agree that they do not represent major barrier to the costeffective use of jicdm as stated by the world bank the commission assessed naps for imports of carbon assets including planned and substantiated governmental purchases ostensibly with view to limit imports to more than 50 of the expected distance to target for each member state according to the vast majority of analysts this does not place any practical constraints on the demand for cdmji

banking is better safety valve for cost concerns than price cap as suggested in some us legislation as stated by the world bank flexibility is key to ensuring that there is builtin safety valve for compliance without resort to market distortion thr ough price caps it would be appropriate to recall here that flexibility is not the go of climate policy rather it is tool to help achieve the most stringent target s in this regard the use of flexibility mechanisms in phase ii coupled with much stronger reductions in phase iii and the unilateral european target announced for 2020 should be at stringent enough levels that can help stimulate low carbon clean investment future setting an arbitrary price cap distorts the leve l of innovation required to meet the compliance target and dilutes the ability to meet the environment target footnote omitted36 in contrast some envir onmental groups are concerned that widespread use of cdm and ji will prevent the investment in domestic efforts that the kyoto protocol envisioned and that will be necessary as emission caps become more stringent and more countries participate37 in addition to concerns about the volume of outside credits that may be used in the ets there are issues over the quality of the credits particularly with respect to additionality the requirement in the kyoto protocol that project credits represent reductions th at would not have occurred in the absence of the cdm program in expressing c oncern about cdm not being additional to current policies wwfuk states it is important to remember that cdm projects do not themselves reduce net global greenhous gas emissions they merely allow the project investor to pollute more at hom ensuring that projects are additional is therefore crucial to maintaining the envir onmental integrity of the whole system as breach of this means that global emissions actually increase38 such concerns may prevent full exploitation of cdm opportunities for some

auctioned the full 5 the political difficulty in instituting significant auctioning into ets allowance allocations is the almost universal agreement by covered entities in favor of free allocation of allowan ces and opposition to auctions41 free allocation of allowances represents onetime transfer of wealth to the entities receiving them from the government issuing them42 the resulting transfer of wealth has been described by several analys ts as windfall profits43 as summarized by ellerman and buchner allocation in the eu et s provides one more example that notwithstanding the advice of economists th free allocation of allowances is not to be easily set aside44 despite concerns about windfall profits and economic distor tions resulting from the free allocation of allowances there is little change in basic allocation philosophy for phase 2 country proposed auctioning the maximum percentage of allowances allowed 10 most do not include auctions at all45 the unwillingness of

these concerns economic analys is provides several arguments in favor of auctions in general and in the case of the eu ets in particular general arguments in favor of auctions include47 purest embodiment of the polluter pays principle reduces distributional distorti ons that free allocation and accompanying windfall profits can create creates level playing field for existing and new covered entities gives the potential for reducing the impact of compliance on the economy as whole if auction re venues are used to reduce more distorting taxes on investment ie double dividend and can improve emission market liquidity and transparency in the case of the euets the use of free allocations rather than auctions has created some perverse incentives for c overed entities and unnece ssary complexity to the ets as discussed later in more detail providing allowances free to existing entities can encourage the continued use of inefficient plant and reduce the incentive for investing in efficiency improvements the degree to which this occurs depends on the specific allocation approach taken in contrast an auction can help create price floor particularly if coupled with reserve price that courages development of new technologies and efficiency improvements in existing plant free allocation scheme generally has to make some provision for new entrants in addition to allocating allowances to existing entities it also raises issues with respect to existing sources that later decide to shutdown this added complexity to the ets is discussed next new entrant reserves unlike

fair to allocate allowances free to existing entities while requiring new entrants to purchase them and 2 the eu doesnt want to put member states at disadvantage in competing for new investments49

allowances are retained by the company based on the assumption that new power plant will be built to replace the clos ed one for most countries in the ets closure policy is directly linked to the new entrant reserve allowances allocated to existing sources that shut down are fed into the entrant reserve to be allocated to new sources thus free allowances to existing facilities are tied to continued operation of that facility one reason for this appr oach may be the multiple country aspect of the ets and the political fear that owners of facilities could shut down plants in one country

it continues to operate consequently the firm will not maximize its profits only with respect to the cost of production including res ource cost and the opportunity cost of allowances in addition it

view although more competition in the electricity and gas sectors could ce teris paribus lead to reduction in prices this will probably be more than outweighed in the medium term by rising commodity

phase 2 when aviation will be included the eu is attempting to expand its coverage with phase 3 but the ets will still cover fewer sect ors emitting greenhouse gases than provided under most us proposals httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34150crs27 88 for an overview of capandtrade proposals under the 110th congress see crs report rl33846 greenhouse gas reduction capandtrade bills in the 110th

john blodgett 89 unlike carbon tax which uses the existing currency system to control emissions be it euro or dollarsus capandtrade proposals generally fall into one of two categories88 most bills are more comprehensive than the ets covering 80 to 100 of the countrys greenhouse gas emissions at minimum they include the electric utility transportation and industria l sectors disagreement among the bills center on the agricultural sector and smaller commercial and residential sources in some cases discretion is provided epa to exempt sour ces if serious data economic or other considerations dictat such resolution second category of bills focuses on th electric utility industry representing about 33 of us greenhouse gases and th erefore less comprehensive than the ets sometimes including additiona l controls on nongreenhouse gas pollutants such as mercury these bills focus on the sources with the most experience with emission trading and the best emissions data other sources coul d be added as circumstances dictate as noted the eus experience with the ets suggests that adding sectors to an emission trading scheme can be slow and contentious pr ocess if one believes that the electric utility sector is costeffective place to st art addressing greenhouse gas emissions and that there is sufficien t time to do the necessary groundwork to eventually add other sectors then phase din approach may be reasonable if one believes that the economy as whole needs to begin ad justing to carbon constrained environment to meet long rm goals then more comprehensive approach may be justified the ets experience suggests the process doesnt necessarily get any easier if you wait allocation schemes setting up tradeable allowance system is lot like setting up new currency89 allocating allowances is essentially allocating money with the marketplacedetermining the exchange rate as noted above the free alloca tion scheme used in the ets has resulted in windfall profits being received by allowance recipients as stated quite forcefully by deutsche bank research the most striking market outcome of em issions trading to date has been the power industrys windfall prof its which have sparked controversy we are all familiar with the background emissions allowances were handed out free of charge to those plant operators particip ating in the emissions trading scheme nevertheless in particular the producers of electricity succeeded in marking up the market price of electricity to include the opportunitycost value of the allowances this is correct from an accounting point of view since thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34150crs28 90 deutsche bank research eu emission trading allocation battles intensifying march 6 2007 p 2allowances do have value and could ot herwise be sold moreover emissions trading cannot work without price signals90 the free allocation of allowances in the ets incorporates two other mechanisms that create perverse incentives and significant distortions in the emissions markets new entrant reserves and closure policy combined with an uncoordinated and spotty benchmarking approach for both new and existing sources the result is greenhouse gas reduction scheme that is influenced as much or more by national policy than by the emissions marketplace the proposed expansion of auctions fo r phase 3 of the ets could simplify allocations and permit market forces to influence compliance strategies more fully most countries did not employ auctions at all during ph ase 1 and auctions continue to be limited under phase 2 country combin ed an auction with reserve price to encourage development of new technology the ec limited the amount of auctioned allowances to 10 in phase 2 limit c ountry chose to meet efforts to expand auctions met opposition from industry groups but attracted support from environmental groups and economists the ec proposed increase of auctioning to twothirds of total allowances for phase 3 would represent major development for the scheme currently all us capandtrade proposal s have some provisions for auctions although the amount involved is sometimes ft to epa discretion most specify schedule that provides increasing use of auctions from 2012 through the mid2030s with final target of 66100 of total allowances auctioned funds would be used for variety of purposes including progra ms to encourage new technologies couple of proposals include reserve price on some auctions to create price floor for new technology like the situation in the ets most u s industry groups either oppose auctions outright or want them to be supplemen tal to base free allocation given the experience with the ets where the ec and individual governments have been unwilling or unable to move away from fr ee allocation the congress like the ec may ultimately be asked to consider specifying any auction requirement if it wishes to incorporate market economics more fully into compliance decisions flexibility and price volatility despite eu rhetoric during the kyoto pr otocol negotiations it moved into phase 2 without significant restriction on the us of cdm and ji credits this embracing of project credits will significantly increas the flexibility facilities have in meeting their reduction targets in addition phase 2 includes the use of banking to increase flexibility across time by allowing banked allowances to be used in phase 3 each of these market mechanisms is projected to reduce both the eus kyoto compliance costs and allowance price volatility as further defense against

allowance markets by mark jickling and larry parkereuropean emission exchanges are creating fi nancial instruments such as futures contracts and options to permit entities to hedge against price changes unfortunately phase 1 experience with the ets does not provide much useful information on the value of market mechanisms or financial instruments in reducing costs or price volatility the combination of poor emissions i nventories nonuse of project credits and timelimited allowances with effectively banking resulted in extreme price volatility in spring 2006 and virtually worthless allowances by mid 2007 the real test for the mechanisms employed by the ets to create stable allowance market is phase 2 initial indications are that mature market for allowances appears to be developing like the ets us capandtrade propos als would employ combination of devices to create stable allowance market and encourage flexible costeffective compliance strategies by participating entities all include banking all include use of offsets although some would place subs tantial restrictions on their use one proposal incorporates s afety valve that would ffectively place ceiling on allowance prices other proposals would create carbon market efficiency board to observe the allowance market and implement costrelief measures if necessary some see this as more flexible re sponse with the potential for avoiding or mitigating the environmental impacts of safety valve ie increased emissions additionally concern has been expre ssed in the united states about the regulation of allowance markets and instru ments based on experience with the ets the potential for speculation and manipul ation could extend beyond the emission markets analysis of ets allowance prices during phase 1 suggests the most important variables in determining allowance price changes were oil and natural gas price changes91 this apparent linkage between allowance price changes and price changes in two commodities markets raises the possibility of market manipulation particularly with the inclusion of financial instruments such as options and futures contracts congress may ultimately be asked to consider whether the securities and exchange commission federal energy regulatory commission the commodities futures trading commission or other body should have enhanced regulatory and oversight authority over such instruments92
