all us wind energy faci lities are based on nd however multiple offshore projects have been proposed and are moving through the permitting process it is clear that the united states has the authority to permit and regulate offshore wind energy development within the zones of the oceans under its jurisdiction the federal government and coasta l states each have roles in the permitting process the extent of which depends on whether the project is located in state or federal waters currently single federal agency s exclusive responsibility for permitting activities on submerged lands in federal waters authority is instead allocated among various agencies based on the nature of th resource to be exploited and the type of impacts incidental to such exploitation like wise in the wind energy context several federal agencies will have role to play in permitting development and operation activities the army corps of engineers corps has exercised jurisdiction over proposed offshore wind energy facilities under the ri vers and harbors act and the outer continental shelf lands act this regulatory authority was challenged in alliance to protect nantucket sound v unite d states department of the army in that case the us court of appeals for the first ci rcuit upheld the corps authority to permit preliminary data collection tower in federal waters the reasoning behind this decision might have been applied to the permitting of largerscale wind energy projects although arguments against an expansive reading of corps authority remained viable to address these lega l uncertainties cong ress passed section 388 of the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 this provision retains the role played by the corps in permitting under the rivers and harbors act but grants ultimate authority over offshore wind energy development to the secretary of the interior the provision also contains vari ous exemptions from the regulatory regime it establishes for projects that have receive d certain permits prior to the enactment of the energy policy act of 2005 regulations implementing this new grant of statutory authority are likely forthcoming and could bring additional and significant nuance to the regulatory process this report will discuss the disputes over corps jurisdiction prior to enactment of the energy policy act of 2005 as well as the current law applicable

federal laws14 thus it would seem that generally othe r nations could not interfere with us legal authority to permit wind energy project s within the full range of its territorial sea contiguous zone and eez the relative jurisdiction of the federal government with respect to individual states is also of importance the submerged lands act of 195315 assured coastal states title to the lands beneath coastal waters in an area stretching in general three geographical miles from the shore16 thus states subject to federal regulation for commerce navigation national defense and international affairs and the power of the federal government to preempt state law may regulate the coastal waters within this area17 the remaining outer portions of waters over which the united states exercises jurisdiction are federal waters18 in sum it would seem relatively clear that the federal government would have permitting authority supported by intern ational law for offshore wind farms however federal authority would be limited by the internationally recognized right of free passage and by the jurisdiction gr anted to the states under the submerged lands act the attributes of existing permitting regimes at both the state and federal level are of course limited by the confines of current law discussed belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32658crs4 19 16 usc 14511464 20 coastal us states

federallypermitted activities comply with state programs24 responding to supreme court decision that excluded ocs oil and gas leasing fro m state review under the czma congress amended the consistency review provision to include the impacts on state coastal zone from federal actions in federal waters25 thus states have some authority to demand that federallypermitted projects in federal waters will not result in violation of state coastal zone management regulation in addition to consistency review project s to be constructed in state waters including any cables that would be necessary to transmit power back to shore are subject to all state regulation or permitting requirements coastal zone regulation varies significantly among the states the czma itself establishes three generally

several states such as new jersey california and rhode island centralize authority fo r their programs in one agency27 in new jersey for instance the state department of nvironmental protection through the coastal management office within the commissione rs office of policy planning and science is the lead agency for coastal zone management under several state laws28 the majority of states however operate coastal zone manage ment programs under networks of parallel agencies with va rious roles defined by policy guidance and memoranda of understanding mous29 based on series of mous each agency is obligated to issue and apply state regulations and permits consistently with the states coastal zone management program30 thus depending on the state with jurisdiction offshore wind energy proj ects can be subject to comprehensive regulation with permitting authority located within multiple state and local level agencies federal permitting for onshore wind projects on federal public lands the department of the interior doi through the bureau of land management has created regulatory program under the federal land policy and mana gement act31 but federal statute expressly governing offshore wind energy development was not enacted until august 2005 as part of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 epact before enactment of the 2005 epact some permitting in support of

thus pursuant to the rha and nepa the corps may have examined most of the salient issues present in an offshore wind energy proposal controversy arose however with respect to two primary issues that were litigated in alliance to protect nantucket sound v united states department of the army 36 first it was unclear whether corps jurisdiction pursuant to the rha and the ocsla extended to all offshore st ructures or only to those otherwise permitted for energy or mineral development pursuant to other ocsla provisions on the basis of the language of the statutes at issue their legislative history and corps regulations and guidance federal di strict court and the first circuit court of appeals held that the corps is authorized to exercise rha section 10 authority for any offshore structure regardless of purpose in state or federal waters37httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32658crs7 38 several federal laws would appear to indica that congress intends the ocs to be used only when

property disputes prior to issuing rha permit alliance i 288 fsupp 2d at 7778 despite the army corps regulation additiona l laws do require the corps to consider property rights in granting rha permits in termining if issuance of rha permit is in continuedthe second issue in the alliance case was whether section 10 rha permit was sufficient to authorize the siting construction and operation of an offshore wind energy facility use of federal and federally controlled lands including the ocs requires some form of permission such as rightofway easement or license38 thus because any wind turbines would be ttached to the seabed of the ocs some authorization to occupy the submerged nds of the ocs would be required before construction could legally take place39 use or occupancy of the ocs without such authorization arguably may constitute common law trespass40 questions over the type of authorization section 10 permit encompasses spring in part from corps regulations which state the following da department of the army permit does not convey any property rights either in real estate or material or an exclusive privileges furthermore da permit does not authorize any injury to property or invasion of rights or any infringement of federal state or local laws or regulations the applicants signature on an application is an affirm ation that the applicant possesses or will possess the requisite property interest to undertake the activity proposed in the application the district engineer will not enter into disputes but will remind the applicant of the above the dispute ov er property ownership will not be factor in the corps public interest decision41 although issues tangentially related to ocs property interests were addressed in the alliance case the reviewing courts left the matter substantially unsettled42httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32658crs8 42 continued the public interest the corps under its own regu lations is obligated to consider the effects of the proposed work ie offs hore structure on the outer tinental rights of the united states 33 cfr 3204f in addressing this requirement in the alliance case the first circuit court of appeals held th at the corps satisfied this re quirement with respect to the preliminary data tower stating it is incon ceivable to us that permission to erect single temporary scientific device like this which gives the federal government information it requires could be an infringement on any fede ral property ownership interest in the ocs alliance ii 398 f3d at 114 43 other energyrelated developments on the

for wind energy purposes43 epact 2005 addresses this issue by au thorizing offshore wind energy project permitting without completely abrogating th corps authority under the rha this new legal authority and how it relates to earlier law are discussed below the energy policy act of 2005 section 388 of the epact 2005 seeks to ddress the issues raised in litigation related to offshore wind energy developm ent by specifically establishing legal authority for federal review and approval of various offs hore energy related projects the provision amends the ocsla by adding new subsection that authorizes the secretary of the interior in consultation with other federal agencies to grant leases easements or rightsofway on the ocs for certain activities wind energy development among them not author ized by other ocsla provisions the deepwater port act the ocean thermal ener gy conversion act or other applicable law44httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32658crs9 45 id 1337p9 for additional

authority under other federal laws retain their jurisdic tion despite enactment of this subsection45 thus the corps consistent with the alliance case will continue to permit offshore development pursuant to the rha and othe r federal agencies with jurisdiction over issues related to energy development such as species impacts will be similarly unaffected the law does not specify which agency will take the lead role in coordinating federal permitting and responsibility for preparing nepa analysis however several provisions within section 388 of the 2005 epact may indicate that doi is charged with primary responsib ility the law directs the secretary of the interior to consult with other agencies as part of its leasing easement and rightof way granting process46 doi is also responsible fo r ensuring that activities carried out pursuant to its new authority provide for coordination with relevant federal agencies 47 the precise division of res ponsibilities however will depend upon the regulations that doi eventually i ssues and any memoranda of understanding negotiated by the stakeholders with regard to relative roles in the permitting process on december 30 2005 the minerals manageme nt service within doi issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comments on the development of regulations to implement section 388 and proposed regula tions are likely forthcoming48 although section 388 provides doi with significant latitude in crafting regulatory regime for offshore wind ener gy development the law does address certain aspects of the property interest gran ting process expressly first the law directs that leases easements and rightsofway are to be issued on competitive basis subject to some exceptions described infra at pp 111249 the secretary is further authorized to provide for the dura tion of any property in terest granted under this subsection and to provide for suspen sion and cancellation of any lease easement or rightofway50 the law directs the secretary to establish system of royalties fees rentals bonuses or othe r payments that will ensure fair return to the united states for any property intere st granted under this provision51 beyond this general guidance however the agency would seem to be free to determine what constitutes fair return and to require whatever payment systems it deems appropriate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32658crs10 52 id 1337p2b 53 id 54 id 55 71 fed reg 127 january 3 2006 56 43 usc 1337p4 the minerals manage ment service also appears to have adopted this interpretation stating mms interprets the authority granted in section 388a of the energy policy act of 2005 to issue leases easements or rightsofway as also providing mms authority to regulate or permit the activities that occur on those leases easements or rightsofway if those activities are energy related 70 fed reg 77345 77346 december 30 2005 57 43 usc 1337p6the law also provides that 27 percent of the revenues collected by the federal government under this program from any proj ect located wholly or partially within the area extending three nautical miles from state submerged lands are to be paid out among coastal states located within 15 miles of the projects geographic center52 the distribution is to be done in an quitable manner based on the states proximity to the project53 more than one state may be eligible to receive portion of these revenues depending upon the location of project the division of payments among states is to be based upon formula that equitably distributes revenues based on the proximity of the project to the affected states offshore boundaries the law establishes that states that have coastline that is located within 15 miles of the geographic center of the project are entitled to revenue share54 this may prove controversial in some instances to the extent that there have not been determinative offshor boundaries between states the minerals management service has prepared adminis trative boundaries for use in variety of circumstances including the determination of affected stat status under the coastal zone management act and the ocs lands act and to help define appropriate consultation and info rmation sharing with states55 the notice informing the public that these boundaries ve been established does not appear to specifically state that they will be determinative in questions over revenue sharing under section 388 however these boundarie s could form the basis for making determinations as to proximity to state waters and therefore could affect the distribution of revenues in addition the law appears to author ize considerable regulation of impacts associated with offshore development by requiring the secretary to ensure that any activity under this subsection be carried out in manner that ad equately addresses specified issues including environmenta l protection safety protection of us national security and protection of the ri ghts of others to use the ocs and its resources56 in addition specific financial secur ity requirements are also established by this subsection the law requires the holder of section 388 property interest to provide for the restoration of the lease easement or rightofway and to furnish surety bond or other form of security l eaving the amount and the exact purposes to which any forfeited sums will be applied to the secretarys discretion57 further in conjunction with the authority to require some form of financial assurance the secretary is empowered to impose such other requirements as the secretaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32658crs11 58 id 59 id 1337p7 60 epact 2005 pl 10958 388e august 8 2005 61 id 62 id 388d 63 idconsiders necessary to protect the interests of the public and the united states58 thus the secretary depending on how these authorities are exercised may potentially regulate many aspects of any i ndustry that is permitte d to operate on the ocs under this subsection of the ocsla the 2005 epact also contai ns provision expressly providing for state consultative role in the per mitting process section 388 re quires the secretary of the interior to provide for coor dination and consultation with states governor or the executive of any local government that may be affected by lease easement or right ofway granted under this new authority59 in addition the law makes clear that it does not affect any states claim to jurisdiction over or any right title or interest in any submerged lands60 thus states will remain primary in those areas comprising state offshore wate rs and should state dispute the extent of its offshore territory such claims are unaffected by th secretarys new grant of authority under this law 2005 epact exemptions as described above secti on 388 of the epact 2005 sets forth procedures for granting lease easement or rightofw ay in federal waters when the property interest will be used for certain specified purposes including wind energy production61 however subsection d exempts certain actions from specific section 388 requirements this savings provision states that the law does not require the resubmittal of any document that was previously subm itted or the reauthorization of any action that was previously authorized with respect to project for which before the date of enactment of this act 1 an offshore test facility has been constructed or 2 request for proposal has been issued by public authority62 thus where project has resulted from public entitys request for proposals or where project is associated with an existing offshore test facility previously submitted documents do not need to be resubmitted and previously authorized actions do not need to be reauthorized essentially maintaining the status quo with respect to these projects63 this provision does not seem to exempt unauthorized actions associated with the exempted actions or indeed any other aspect of the related project from requirement to comply with the property interest acquisition provisions of section 388 thus siting and construction of an offshore data tower such as cape winds data tower in nantucket sound woul d not have to be reauthorized however any activity that had not been authorized before august 8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32658crs12 64 id 65 id 66 id 67 43 usc 1337p9 68 these entities may request cooperating agency status pursuant to nepa implementing regulations and thereby contribute to the environmental analysis process2005 such as the construction of additional facilities would appear to be subject to the requirements of section 388 section 388 also contains two exceptions to the general requirement that property interest issued under this provisi on be granted on competitive basis 1 if the secretary of the interior determines that there is competitive interest or 2 if the project meets the criteria establis hed by the savings provision in subsection d64 the first exemption requi ring finding of competitive interest is relatively straightforward although additional details may be provided at the administrative level the second exemption proves more co mplex in that it may apply more broadly than the savings provision itself as the text of the law indicates projects that meet the criteria established under section 388d are exempted from competitive property interest acquisition65 it is not clear that the projects referenced are limited to the actions such as data tower c onstructed at the time of the 2005 epacts enactment previously authorized subsecti on d appears to use the term project more broadly such that project for which an offshore st facility has been constructed might enco mpass all future offshore development that would be supported by or is in some way re lated to qualifyi ng test facility66 it is also possible that project for which test facility has been constructed could be interpreted more narrowly such that th term project would include only those actions authorized in conjunction with the test facility itself in short because there is definition provided for project in the law it would seem likely that the administering agency would be responsib for providing definition that is reasonably supportable by the law additional regulation under existing law in addition to the regulatory regime authorized by section 388 it is also noteworthy that variety of laws pr edating the enactment of the 2005 epact remain applicable to offshore wind ener gy development indeed the 2005 epact makes clear that the enactment of sec tion 388 does not affect the jurisdiction responsibility or authority of any federa l or state agency operating under other federal law67 thus it would seem clear that th state role provided for by the czma and the corps permitting authority provide d by the rha both described above remain intact other federal laws that are likely to be relevant in the permitting

disclose the envir onmental consequences of their actions in general nepa and its implementing regulations require various levels of environmental analysis dependi ng on the circumstances and the type of federal action contemplated certain actions that have been determined to have little or environmental effect are exempted from preparation of nepa documents entirely and are commonly referred to as categorical exclusions70 in situations where categorical exclusion does not apply an intermediate level of review an environmental assessment ea may be re quired if on the basis of the ea the agency finds that an action will not have significant effect on the environment the agency issues finding of significant impact fonsi thus terminating the nepa review process on the other nd major federal actions that are found to significantly affect the environment requi re the preparation of an environmental impact statement eis document containing detailed analysis of the project as proposed as well as other options including taking action at all nepa does not direct an agency to choose any particular course of action the only purpose of an eis is to ensure that environmental conseque nces are considered thus in practice nepa review will likely provide information on wind energy projects including impacts to existing resources of the final alternative sites in terms of physical oceanography and geology wildlife avian shellfish finfish and benthic habitat aesthetics cultural resources socioeconomic conditions and air and water quality human uses such as boating and fishing will also be described71 in addition to the role interested pa rties and cooperating agencies may play under nepa certain federal agencies have independent sources of jurisdiction over specific ocean resources thus they woul d also likely be involved in the permitting of offshore wind energy facilities some of the most relevant authorities are the endangered species act esa72 the marine mammal protection act mmpa73 and the migratory bird treaty act mbta74httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32658crs14 75 under the species are listed as either endangered or threatened based on the risk of their

the action79 if the acting federal agency determines that project may adversely affect listed species or critical habitat formal consultation and preparation of biological opinion is required80 the biological opinion c ontains detailed analysis of the effects of the agency action and contains the final determination as to whether the proposed action is likely to jeopardize th species or destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat81 if review results in jeopardy or adverse modification determination the biological opinion mu st identify any reasonable and prudent alternatives that could allow the project to proceed82 projects that will result in level of injury to species or habitat that will fall short of jeopardizing survival may still be approved subject to certain terms83 the

research reasons reasons of human concern for individual birds or other compelling justification95 it does not appear that fws has promulga ted regulations specific to the sort of unintentional harm caused by the rotating rbines of wind energy projects thus it is not clear that the permitting process provided for under current regulations is immediately applicable to wind energy projects96 the service has however adopted voluntary interim guidelines for minimizing the wildlife impacts from wind energy turbines97 as these guidelines indicate co mpliance does not shield company from prosecution for mbta violations however the office of law enforcement and department of justice have used enforcem ent and prosecutorial discretion in the past regarding individuals companies or agen cies who have made good faith efforts to avoid the take of migratory birds98 conclusion interest in developing offshore wind ergy resources continues to grow and projects are already in the initial stages of development it would seem clear that the united states visavis other nations would have the right to permit offshore development in its territorial sea and on the outer continental shelf subject to state authority over offshore areas under the subm erged lands act the energy policy act of 2005 provides the department of the inte rior with authority to grant offshore property interests for the purpose of wind ergy development and appears to grant the secretary of the interior the authority to regulate activities resulting from such development additional laws that predate the enactment of the energy policy act of 2005 continue in force and also appear likely to remain source of regulation despite the apparent primary authority granted to the department of the interior further states also may claim role in the permitting of offshore wind energy development pursuant to authorities granted under existing federal law
