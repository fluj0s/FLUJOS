deterring and minimizing damage from possi ble terrorist act s 1214 is concerned with deterring terrorism but also with reducing drug smuggling cargo theft trade fraud and illegal alien smuggling s

and thus contains reference to it hr 3983 is posttsa and calls upon the agency to collect passenger and crew manifest data and to develop and maintain an antiterrorism identificati on tracking and screening system for sea containers levels of funding the funding provisions in s 1214 are dir ected more toward specific areas than those in hr 3983 the seaport commissi on estimated before september 11 that enhancing security at us ports woul d cost between 10 to 50 million per port s 1214 would add new title xiv to th merchant marine act of 1936 to authorize and provide loan guarantees and grants for port security infrastructure improvements the loan guarantee regulations would be similar to those that exist under the existing title xi loan guarantee program for shipbuilding and shipyards security infrastructure improvements coul d include gates fences and lighting surveillance and video systems the bill makes available to the department of transportation dot subject to

of agriculture and the coast guard for inspecting cargo containers additional funding is provided for blishing local port security committees training maritime security professionals conducting t vulnerability assessments developing technology for detectin g criminal activity and other items s 1214 would extend through fiscal ear 2006 the increase in vessel tonnage duties that was enacted in

million in grants to sea ports for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2005 like the grants provided in s 1214 the federal grant would not exceed 75httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31424crs3 of the total cost of project unless the dot determines that th is requirement should be waved for particular project fo r projects costing less than 25000 there are matching requirements in either bill both bills require grant applicants to provide the same information to the dot for eval uating grant proposals hr 3983 includes authorization of appropriations for the coast guard see crs report rs20924 homeland security coast guard legislation in the 107th congress for further information plans and programs for coordinating seaport security jurisdiction over us ports is shared by federal state and local governments the federal agencies with the greatest pr esence at us ports are the coast guard customs service immigration and naturalization service and the department of agriculture these agencies are included in the presidents proposal for new department of homeland security major point of discussion in enhancing seaport security is coordinating the activities of all levels of government as well as the private sector to prevent conflict and overlap of responsibilities while improving information sharing among agencies both bills call for security plans to be developed at the national local and port facility level both bills also require vulnerability assessments be conducted at th port level s 1214 requires the secretary of trans portation to establish national maritime security advisory committee this committee would have up to 21 members appointed by the secretary nd made up of individuals from other departments and agencies in the federal state or local government including law enforcement the committee would be charged with coordinating seaport security enhancement among local port authorities keeping them informed of developments in security issues and providing guidance for awarding loans and grants for security improvements the committee w ould disband on september 30 2005 at the local level s 1214 calls for the establishment of local port security committees which would comprise federal state and local government officials law enforcement personnel fro m all levels of governme nt port authority personnel representatives from port labor organizati ons and representatives from the private sector the coast guards existing captainoftheport would be charged with establishing these committees at hisher port of jurisdiction the secretary of transportation would be required to deve lop standards and procedures for conducting t vulnerability assessments at each port that the secretary deems appropriate the secretary could accept security evaluations already completed during the previous five years the local port security committee would review and comment on the port vulnerability assessment the local port security committee would also be consulted in the development of maritime f acility security plans these plans would be submitted by each port authority or waterfront facility operator to the secretary for approval the plan would indicate how the overall physical security of the port would be maintainedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31424crs4 how access would be controlled to the port and its facilities the procedures for processing cargo passengers and crew and create evacuation plans in case of an emergency s 1214 also calls for the creation of national maritime transportation security plan area maritime security plans and vessel security plans the plans would prescribe procedures for preventin g and responding to maritime crimes and terrorism these plans are very similar to the plans in hr 3983 which are described below hr 3983 calls for national maritime transportation antiterrorism plan that is intended to deter and minimize damage from terrorist act the plan would assign duties and res ponsibilitie s among federal state and local government agencies and establish system of surveillance to safeguard against and provide the earliest possible notice of terrorist act at the local level hr 3983 calls for area maritime transportation antiterrorism plans that are intended to deter terrorist acts within the area covered by the plan the plan would describe the area covered incl uding populated areas or areas with special economic environm ental or national security importance these plans would be developed by coast guard official designated as the federal maritime antiterrorism coordinator and reviewed and approved by the dot hr 3983 calls for vulnerability assessments to be conducted at each port the dot believes have high risk of catastrophic emergency hr 3983 also calls for vessel and fac ility antiterrorism plans these plans would be prepared by ocean carriers and port facility operators the plans would describe the training drills and antiterrorism actions of vessel or f acility personnel to deter terrorism the plans would identify the individual responsible for implementing antiterrorism actions and the individual who would serve as the point of contact with federal officials provisions to increase foreign seaport security some maritime security ex perts have advocated greater focus on country of origin security rather than limiting security concerns just to us ports of unloading they view maritime commerce as global transportation system which can best be secured by preventing suspicious container from entering the system at the point of origin they assert that it is too to discover dirty nuclear bomb in sea container when it reaches us port of unloading pushing the borders back is challenge because most countries including the united states have fewer systems in place to examine export cargo than import cargo both bills include provisions that would identify foreign ports with us trade ties that have inadequate security and provisions to enhance the scrutiny of ships and cargo arriving from those ports s 1214 calls upon the secretary of transpor tation after consultation with the secretary of the treasury to prohibit or pr escribe conditions for vessels arriving from foreign port it has identified as not secure in addition the president can deny entryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31424crs5 2 more information available at

security of passengers and cargo traveling to or from those ports the bill also instructs the secretary of transportation to report annually to congress ll foreign flag vessels that have arrived in the united states whose vessel registration ma be suspect hr 3983 like the senate bill also calls upon the dot to identify foreign ports that pose security risk to the united states specifically it charges the dot to identify foreign ports that pose high risk of introducing terrorism to maritime commerce based on the foreign ports cargo screening capability the foreign ports restrictions on access to certain areas and the ports certification of compliance with security standards if the dot finds foreign ports security measures are inadequate it will inform the foreign government and recommend steps to improve security if the foreign port fails to take corrective action within 90 days the dot can prescribe conditions for ships and cargo entering the united states from those ports the bill does not specify what th conditions could include the dot can deny entry if its conditions are not met cargo security provisions provisions to improve the timeliness and accuracy of cargo information submitted by shippers and to improve the physical security of containers themselves are included in both bills sea containers have been primary focus of discussions on port security about seven million containers arrive at us ports per year the customs service reviews manifest inform ation for anomalies and targets specific containers for physical inspection it physically inspects about 2 of imported containers the dot is also concerned with the security of sea containers the dot created task force to examine marine c ontainer security issues in october 2001 in february 2002 the task force submitted cl assified report that according to dot press release made recommendations for improving the quality and timeliness of cargo information that is transmitted to federal agencies and to improve the physical security of the container itself the dot inspector generals office announced in february 2002 that it was conducting an audit of the coast guards hazardous materials container inspection program2 s 1214 would amend the tariff act of 1930 to require carrier to provide cargo manifest information by electronic transmission in advance of port entry or clearance and in such manner time and form as the secretary of the treasury prescribes the bill also requires the customs service to be notified of any improperly documented cargo remaining in port for more than 48 hour s customs is authorized to seize and search such cargo the bill would require prearrival electronic transmission of the consignor consignee country of origin and classification code of goods for cargo moving under the inbond system the s ecretaries of transportation and treasury would be required to establish task force to develop system for tracking containers possibly through the use of gl obal positioning system gps technology and develop standards for container seal s and locks to prevent cargo tamperinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31424crs6 3 more information is available at httpwwwtsadotgovvessels entering us waters would be required to submit prearrival messages to the coast guard in sufficient time for the coast guard to review the information for security and safety reasons hr 3983 contains provisions specifically dir ected towards sea containers the bill requires the transportation security administration to develop an antiterrorism cargo identification and screening system for containerized cargo tsa must also develop standards to improve the physical security of the containers themselves including standards for seals and locks the bill requires ocean carriers to provide tsa with crew and passenger manifests in advance of vessels arrival in the united states cargo information must be submitted to the customs service in advance of port entry the customs service would consu lt with other federal agencies in issuing regulations on submitting cargo information and would share cargo information with appropriate federa l departments limiting access to areas within port s 1214 and hr 3983 include provisions limiting access to areas within port hr 3983 specifically mentions developmen t of security cards the tsa is
