legislative process government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548the legislative process on the senate floor an introduction summary the standing rules of the senate promote deliberation by permitting senators to debate at length and by precluding simple majority from ending debate when they are prepared to vote to approve bill or other matter this right of extended debate permits fili busters that can be brought to an end if the senate invokes cloture usually by vote of threefifths of ll senators even then consideration can continue under cloture for an additional th irty hours the possibility of filibusters encourages the senate to seek consensu s whenever possible and to conduct business under the terms of unanimous consent agr eements that limit the time available for debate and amending except when the senate is considering appropriations budget and certain other measures senators also may propose floor amendments that are not germane to the subject or purpose of the bill being debated this permits individual senators to raise issues and have the senate vote on them ev if they have not been studied and evaluated by the appropriate standing committees similarly senators can bypass the committee system by introducing measures nd having them placed directly on the calendar of business wit hout having been referred to committee at all these characteristics of senate rules make the senates daily floor schedule potentially unpredictable unle ss all senators agree by unanimous consent to accept limits on their right to debate and offer non germane amendments to bill also to promote predictability and order senators traditionally have agreed to give certain procedural privileges to the majority leader the majority leader enjoys priority in being recognized to speak and the majority leader or senator acting at his behest alone proposes what bills and resolu tions the senate should consider thus the legislative process on the sena floor reflects balance between the rights guaranteed to senators under the st anding rules and the willingness of senators to forego exercising some of these rights in order to expedite the conduct of businesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548contents introduction 1 t h r i g h t t d b t 2f i l i b u s t r s n d c l t u r e3r s t r i n t n d d l 4s c h d u l i n g l g i s l t i v b u s i n s s 5 routine

this report was originally written by stan ley bach former senior specialist in the legislative process at crs the report has been updated by the listed author who is available to respond to inquiries on the subjectthe legislative process on the senate floor an introduction introduction1 the legislative process on the senate floor is governed by set of standing rules body of precedents created by rulings of presiding officers or by votes of the senate variety of establis hed and customary practices nd ad hoc arrangements the senate makes to meet specific parliamentary and political circumstances knowledge of the senates formal rule s is not sufficient to understand senate procedures and senate pr actices cannot be understood without knowing the rules to which the practices relate the essential characteristic of the senates rules and the characteristic that most clearly distinguishes its procedures from those of the house of representatives is their emphasis on the rights and prerogativ of individual senators like any legislative institution the senate is both deliberative and decisionmaking body its procedures must embody some balan ce between the opportunity to deliberate or debate and the need to decide characteristically the senates rules give greater weight to the value of full and free deliberation than they give to the value of expeditious decisions put differently legi slative rules also must strike balance between minority rights and majority prer ogatives the senates standing rules place greater emphasis on the rights of individual senators and therefore of minorities within the senate than on the powers of the majority the senates legislative agenda and its policy decisi ons are influenced not merely by the preferences of its members but also by the intensity of their preferences precisely because of the nature of its st anding rules the senate cannot rely on them exclusively if all senators took fu ll advantage of their rights under the rules whenever it might be in their immediate interests the senate would have great difficulty reaching timely decisions theref ore the senate has developed variety of practices by which senato rs set aside some of their prerogatives under the rules to expedite the conduct of its business or to accommodate th needs and interests of its members some of these practices ve become wellestablished by precedent others are arranged to suit the particular circumstances the senate confronts from day to day and from issue to issue in most cases these alternative arrangements require the unanimous consent of the senate the explicit or implicit concurrence of each of the one hundred senators the senate relies on unanimous consent agreements every day for many purposes purposes gr eat and small important and routinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548crs2 however senators can protect their rights under senate rules s imply by objecting to unanimous consent request to wa ive one or more of the rules generally the senate can act more efficiently and expeditiously when its members agree by unanimous consent to operate outside of its standing rules generally also senators insist that the rules be enforced strictly only when the questions before it are divisive and c ontroversial compromise and accommodation normally prevail senators exercise great selfrestraint by not taking full advantage of their rights and opportunities under the st anding rules and often by agreeing to unanimous consent requests for arrangements that may not promote their individual legislative interests the standing rules remain available however for senators to invoke when in their judgment the costs of compromise and accommodation become too great thus the legislative procedures on the senate floor reflect balance and sometimes an uneasy balance between the operation of its rules and the principles they embody on the one hand and pragmatic arrangements to expedite the conduct of business on the other the interpla between the principles of the senates standing rules and the pragmatism of its daily practices will be theme running throughout the following sections of this report the right to debate the standing rule that is probably most pivotal for shaping what does and does not occur on the senate floor is paragraph 1a of rule xix which governs debate when senator desires to speak he sha ll rise and address the presiding officer and shall not proceed until he is recognized and the presiding officer shall recognize the senator who shall first address him senator shall interrupt another senator in debate without his consent and to obtain such consent he shall first address the presiding officer and senator shall speak more than twice upon any one question in debate on the same legislative day without leave of the senate which shall be determined without debate emphasis added the presiding officer of the senate unlike the speaker of the house may not use the power to recognize only certain nators in order to control the flow of business if senator holds the floor any senator seeking recognition has right to be recognized moreover once sena tor has been recognized he or she may make any motion that senate rules permit including motions affecting what bills the senate will consider though senator loses the floor when he or she makes motion offers an amendment or takes one of many other actions in practice however the senate has modified the effect of this rule by precedent and custom by precedent the majority and minority leaders are recognized first if either leader and another senator are seeking recognition at the same time in addition by custom only the majority leader or another sena tor acting at his behest makes motions or requests affecting when the senate will meet and what legislation it will consider in these respects senators relinquish th eir equal right to recognition and their right to make certain motions and they do so in order to lend some order andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548crs3 predictability to the senates proceedings otherwise it would be nearly impossible for any senator to predict with assurance when the senate will be in session and what legislation it will consider for example durin g debate on one bill any senator could move that the senate turn to another bill instead this would make it very difficult for the senate to conduct its busin ess in an orderly fashion and it would be equally difficult for senators to plan their own schedules with any confidence thus senate precedents and practices modify the operation of this rule as it affects recognition in the interests of the senate as an instituti on and in the interests of its members individually even more important is what paragraph 1a of rule xix sa ys and does not say about the length of debate the rule imposes limit of two speeches per senator per question per day but it imposes limit at all on the number of senators who may make those two speeches nor on the length of the speeches in fact there are few senate rules that limit the right to debate and rules that permit simple majority of the senate to end debate whenever it is ready to vote for bill amendment or other question that is being considered when senators are recognized by the presiding officer the rules normally permit them to speak for as long as they wish and questions generally cannot be put to vote so long as there are senators who still wish to make the speeches they ar permitted to make under rule xix the house of representatives may bring question to vote if simple majority agrees to motion to order the previous question when meeting in committee of the whole majority of repres entatives also can move to close debate on pending amendment or sometimes on bill and all amendments to it such motions are possible in the senate as re sult majority of senators does not have nearly the same control over the pace nd timing of their deliberations as does majority of the house there is one partial exception to this ge neralization the nate often disposes of an amendment by agreeing to motion to lay the amendment on the table when senator who has been recognized makes this motion it cannot be debated except by unanimous consent of course if the senate agrees to this motion to table the amendment is rejected to table is to kill on the other hand if the senate defeats the motion debate on the amendment may resume the senate only has determined that it is not prepared at that time to reject the amendment thus tabling motion can be used to stop debate even if there still are senators wishing to speak but only by defeating the amendment at issue alt hough the effect of the motion is essentially negative it frequently is test vote on senate support for an amendment if the motion fails the senate may agree to the amendment shortly thereafter but this is reflection of political reality not requi rement of senate rules or precedents filibusters and cloture the dearth of debate limitations in senate rules creates the possibility of filibusters individual senators or nority groups of senators who adamantly oppose bill or amendment may speak agai nst it at great length in the hope of changing their colleagues minds winning support for amendments that address theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548crs4 objections or convincing the senate to withdraw the b ill or amendment from further consideration on the floor opposing senators also can delay final floor action by offering numerous amendments and motions insisting that amendments be read in full demanding roll call votes on amendmen ts and motions and by using variety of other devices the only formal procedure that senate rules provide for breaking filibusters is to invoke cloture under the provisions of graph 2 of rule xxii under the rules however cloture cannot be voted until tw days after it is proposed and simple majority of the nate is insufficient to invoke cloture cloture requires the support of threefift hs of the senators duly chosen and sworn or minimum of 60 votes if there are vacancies unless the matter being considered changes the standing rules in which case cloture requires vote of twothirds of the senators present and voting for this reason alone cloture can be difficult to invoke and almost always require s some bipartisan support in addition some senators are reluctant to vote for clot ure even if they support the legislation being jeopardized by the filibuster precisely because the right of extended debate is such an integral element of senate history and procedure even if the senate does invoke cloture on bill or anything else the result is not an immediate vote on passing the bill the cloture rule permits maximum of thirty additional hours for c onsidering the bill during which each senator may speak for one hour the time consumed by roll call votes and quorum calls is deducted from the thirty hour total as result each senator does not have an opportunity to speak for full hour although he or she is gu aranteed at least n minutes for debate thus cloture does not stop bate immediately it only ensures that debate cannot continue indefinitely even the thirty hours allowed under cloture is quite long time for the senate to devote to any one bill especially since senators may not be willing to invoke cloture until the bill already has been debated at considerable length restraint and delay any senator can filibuster almost an legislative proposal the senate is considering the only bills that cannot be filibustered are the relatively few which are considered under provisions of law that limit the time available for debating them for example secti on 305b1 of the budget ac t of 1974 restricts debate on budget resolution and all amendments th ereto and debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith to not more than fifty hours if such provision applies senators can prolong the debate indefinitely on any bill or amendment as well as on many motions subject only to tabling motions or cloture although there may be many bills to which some senators may be adamantly opposed filibusters are not daily events one reason is that conducting filibuster is physically demanding but there are more compelling reasons for selfrestraint if senators filibustered every bill they oppos ed the senate as an institution would suffer it could not meet its constituti onal responsibilities in timely fashion and it could not respond effectively to pressing national needs public support for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548crs5 senate as an institution and for its memb ers as individuals would be undermined furthermore all senators ve legislation they want to promote they appreciate that if they used the filibuster regularl against bills they oppose othe r senators would be likely to do the same and every senators legislative objectives would be jeopardized in short sena tors resort to filibusters only on matters of the greatest importance to them because this practice serves the longterm interests of the senate and all senators alike nonetheless the right to debate at length remains and the possibility of filibusters affects much of what happens on the senate floor many of the ways in which the senate agrees to set aside its sta nding rules are designed in response to the possibility of filibusters simply threatening to filibuster can give senators great influence over whether the senate considers bill when it considers it and how it may be amended if majority of senators support bill that is being filibustered they may be able to pass it eventually if they are committed and patient nough and especially if they are able to invoke cloture even if cloture is not invoked devices such as latenight sessions can strain the enduran ce and determination of the filibustering senators the potency of filibusters doe s not depend however solely on senators ability to prolong the debate indefinitely from the right to debate flows the ability to delay and the prospect of delay alone can often be sufficient to influence the senates agenda and decisions the legislative process is laborious and timeconsuming and the time available for senate floor action each year is limited every day devoted to one bill is day denied for consideration of other legisla tion and there are not enough days to act on all the bills that senators and senate committees wish to see enacted naturally the time pressures become even greater with the approach of deadlines such as the date for adjournment and the end of the fiscal year so for all but the most important bills even the threat of filibuster can be potent weapon before bill reaches the floor or while it is being bated its supporters often s eek ways to accommodate the concerns of opponents preferring an amended bill that can be passed without protracted debate to the time effort and risks involved in confronting filibuster scheduling legislative business routine agenda setting one way in which the possibility of extended debate affects the senates procedures is in how the senate determin its legislative agenda the order in which it decides to consider bills and other business on the floor when one or more of the senates standing committees reports bill back to the senate for floor debate and passage the bill is placed on the nates calendar of business under the heading of general orders the senate gives its major ity leader the primary responsibility for deciding the order in which bills on the calendar should come to the floor for action thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548crs6 majority leaders right to preferential recognition already has been mentioned as has senators willingness to relinqui sh to him the right to make the motion provided for in the standing rules for deciding the order of legislative business namely the motion that the senate proceed to th consideration of particular bill whenever possible however bills reach the senate floor not by motion but by unanimous consent the motion to pro ceed to bill usually is debatable and therefore subject to filibuster even be fore the bill can reach the floor and perhaps face filibuster there may be extended deba on the question of whether or not the senate should even cons ider the bill at all it is to avoid this possibility that the majority leader attempts to get all senators to agree by unanimous consent to take up the bill he wishes to have debated if senators withhold their consent they ar implicitly threatenin g extended debate on the question of considering the bill sena tors may do so because they oppose that bill or because they wish to delay considerati on of one measure in the hope of influencing the fate of some other possibly unrelated measure senators can even place hold on bill by which they ask their partys floor leader to object on their behalf to any unanimous consent request to consider the bill at least until they have been consulted the practice of holds is not recognized in senate rules or precedents though recent change in public law has tablished guidelines for their use more often than not however the majority leader will not even make such unanimous consent request if there is hold on bill in attempting to devise schedule for the senate floor the majority leader seeks to promote the legislative program of his party and perhaps the president as he also tries to ensure that the senate considers necessary legislation in timely fashion when the majority leader is confronted with two bills one of which can be brought up by unanimous consent and the other of which cannot he is naturally inclined to ask the senate to take up the bill that can be considered without objection time is limited and the majority leader is concerned to use that time with reasonable efficiency some bills of course are too important to be delayed only because some senators object to considering them most are not however especially if the objections can be met through negotiation and compromise thus the possibility of extended debate affects decisions for scheduling legislation in two ways by discouraging the majority leader and the senate from attempting to take up bills to which some senators object and by encouraging negotiations over substantive changes in the bills in order to meet these objections the right of senators to debate at length is not the only way in which they can influence the senates legisl ative agenda the standing rules of the senate give its members at least two other opportunities to influence the matters that reach the senate floor for debate nd decision one opportunity affects the prerogatives of senate committees the other affects the am endments that senators may propose on the floorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548crs7 committee referral and rule xiv the senates standing committees play an essential part in the legislative process as they select the small percentage of the bills introduced each congress which in their judgment deserve the attenti on of the senate as whole and as they recommend amendments to these bills based on their expert knowledge and experience most bills are routinely referred to the committee with appropriate jurisdiction as soon as they are introduced however if senator plans to introduce bill and believes that the committee to which it would be referred will be unsympathetic rule xiv paragraph 4 permits the senator to bypass the standing committee system altogether and have th bill placed directly on the calendar of business with exactly the same formal status the bill would have if it had been the subject of extensive hearings and exhaustive markup meetings in committee by the same token if committee fails to act on bill that was referred to it while this may mean the bill will die for lack of action the proposal it embodies may not the senator sponsoring the bill may introduce new bill with exactly the same provisions as the first and have the sec ond bill placed directly on the calendar in either event the committee that has been circumvented may oppose bringing the bill from the calendar to the floor by unanimous consent or by motion but now the fate of the bill can be decided by the senate as whole not only by one of its committees senators generally view this use of rule xiv as last resort both because it undermines the committee system as w hole and because they do not wish to encourage practice that can be used against their own committees in recent practice the majority leader sometimes so uses this method to put measure directly on the calendar ofte n to expedite consideration of complicated or high profile bill that has been drafted outside of the committee process nongermane amendments an even more important opportunity for individual senators is result of the absence in the standing rules of any genera l requirement that the amendments offered by senators on the floor must be germane or relevant to the bill being considered the rules impose germaneness require ment only on amendments to general appropriations and budget meas ures and to matters bein g considered under cloture and various statutes impose such requi rement on limited numbe r of other bills the senate generally interprets germaneness strictly to preclude amendments that expand the scope of bill or introduce speci fic additional topic in all other cases senators are free to propose whatever ame ndments they choose on whatever subjects to whatever bill the senate happens to be considering the right to offer nongermane amendm ents is extraordinarily important because it permits senators to present issues to the sena for debate and decision without regard to the judgments of th senates committees or the scheduling decisions and preferences of its majority leader again consider the position of senator whose bill is not being acted on by the committee to which it was referred instead of introducing an identical bill nd having it placed directly on the calendar he or she has second and usua lly more attractive option to offer the text of the billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548crs8 as floor amendment to another bill that has reached the floor and that can serve as useful legislative vehicle the existence of this opportunity can ma ke it extremely difficult to anticipate what will happen to bill when it reaches the floor and how much of the senates time it will consume the party leaders nd the floor managers of the bill may know what amendments on the subject of the bill will be offered but th ey cannot be certain that there will be other perhaps far more controve rsial nongermane amendments in fact it is not unusual fo r one or more nongermane amendments to occupy far more of the senates attention than the subject the bill itself addresses time agreements the nature of time agreements just as the right of extended debate encourages senate committee and party leaders to bring up bills for consideration by unanimous consent the right to debate combined with the right to offer nonge rmane amendments courages the same leaders to seek unanimous consent agreements limiting or foreclosing the exercise of these rights while bill is being consid ered without such an agreement the bill could be debated for as long as senators wish as could each amendment whether germane or not unless the senate votes to table it these are the essential conditions under which the senate considers bill if it adhe res to its standing rules it is precisely to avoid these conditions that the senate ofte n debates amends and passes bills under very different sets of parlia mentary ground rules ground rules that are far more restrictive but that require unanimous consent to be imposed one of the frequent purposes of these unanimous consent agreements is to limit the time available for debate and thereby ensure that there will be filibuster complex unanimous consent agreements of this special kind are frequently called time agreements in addition before taking up bill or after the senate has begun debating it senators often reach unanimous consent agreements to govern consideration of individual amendments that have been or will be offered less often today the senate reaches an encompassing agr eement limiting debate on bill and all amendments to it before or at the time the bill is called up for floor action the following example illustrates such comprehensive time agreement in the usual form ordered that when the senate proceeds to the consideration of s 1651 order 636 the veterans dioxin and radi ation exposure compensation standards act debate on any amendment in the first degree shall be limited to 1 hour to be equally divided and controlled by the mover of such and the manager of the bill and debate on any amendment in the second degree debatable motion appeal or point of order which is submitted or on which the chair entertains debate shall be limited to 30 minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the mover of such and the manager of the bill provided that in the event thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548crs9 manager of the bill is in favor of any such amendment or motion the time in opposition thereto shall be controlled by the minority leader or his designee provided further that amendment that is not germane to the provisions of the said bill shall be received ordered further that on the question of final passage of the said bill debate shall be limited to 4 hours to be equally divided and controlled by the majority leader and the minority leader or their designees provided that the said senators or either of them may from the time under their control on the passage of the said bill allot additional time to any senator during the consideration of any amendment debatable moti on appeal or point of order before discussing the effect of this agreement some of its terms require definition first degree amendment is an amendment that proposes to change or add to the text of the bill while s econd degree amendment proposes to change or replace the text of first degree amendmen t that has been proposed but not yet voted on the manager of the bill usually is th chair of the standing committee that had considered and reported it although it may be the chai r of one of the committees subcommittees instead finally debate on the question of final passage is debate on the bill as whole not on any amendment or motion affecting the bill this debate may occur throughout the time th senate considers the bill the two essential features of this and comparable time agreements are 1 prohibition against nongermane amendmen ts and 2 strict limitations on the time available for debating the bill and every question that may arise during its consideration under the terms of this agr eement for example th senate as whole may debate each first degree amendment fo r more than one hour moreover only very few senators have right to speak during that hour other senators may speak only if one of their colleagues agrees to yi eld them part of the time that he or she controls senators still may offer as many amendments as they wish but they have lost their valued right of unlimited debate there are also even more stringent time limits for debate on second degree amendments and other questions as well as limit on time for debating the bill itself the differences between considering bill under the terms of the senates standing rules and consider ing it under this kind of time agreement are so great and so fundamental that they bear repeating under the standing rules senators may offer whatever nongermane amendments they want under the time agreement nongermane amendments at all are permitte d under the standing rules senators may debate the bill each amendment and variety of other ques tions for as long as they want under the time agreement on each question only two senators may speak as matter of right and all time for debate is severely limited the differences could hardly be more dramatic it must be emphasized however that time agreements are unanimous consent agreements they cannot be imposed on the senate by any vote of the senate they require the concurrence or acquiescence of each and every senatorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548crs10 negotiating time agreements negotiating these complex unanimous cons ent agreements can be difficult and timeconsuming process the responsibility fo r which falls primar ily on the majority and minority leaders and the leaders of the committee that reported the bill at issue they consult interested sena tors but it would be impracti cal to consult every senator about every bill scheduled for floor action for this reason individual senators and their staffs take the initiative to protect their own interests by advising the leaders of their preferences and intentions negotia tions sometimes take place on the floor and on the public record but at least the preliminary discussions and consultations usually occur in meetings during quorum calls or off the floor senators prefer to expedite the c onduct of legislative business whenever possible and so normally c ooperate in reaching time agreements however when senators have special concerns for instance when they are intent on offering particular amendments or guaranteeing themselves ample time for debate their interests must be accommodated any senator who is dissatisfied with the terms of proposed time agreement has only to obj ect when it is propounded on the floor so long as any one senator objects the standing rules remain in force with all the rights and opportunities they provide as resu lt time agreements may include exceptions to their general provisions in order to sa tisfy individual senators for example comprehensive agreement that genera lly limits debate on each first degree amendment to an hour and prohibits non germane amendments may identify one or more specific amendments that are exempted from the germaneness requirement and also may provide different am ounts of time for debating them in these ways time agreements can be less restrictive than the one quoted earlier there may be agreement at all if one or more senators decide to fully preserve their rights to debate and offer amendments on other occasions however agreements have been even more restrictive for example by prohibiting all amendments to bill except for few that are identified specifically in the agreement itself and perhaps also prohibiting amendments to those amendments if the senate does accept unanimous consent agreement whatever its terms it may be changed at later time only by unanimous consent other unanimous consent agreements in current practice the senate usually be gins consideration of most bills without first having reached time limitation agreemen t in some cases the floor managers expect few amendments and relatively little debate making an elaborate agreement unnecessary in other cases the majority leader and committee chairman seek an agreement unsuccessfully but proceed with the bill anyway because of its timeliness and importance after th senate has debated such bill and controversial amendments for many hours or even days the leaders often renew their attempts to reach an overall agreement limiting debate on each remain ing amendment or setting time for the senate to vote on passage of the bill in the absence of time agreement covering all amendments and other questions the majority leader and the majority floor manager often try to arrangehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548crs11 unanimous consent agreements for more limited purposes while the senate is debating bill during consideration of controversial amendment either senator may propose to limit by unanimous consent further debate on it senators also may agree to time limits on individual amendments before offering them by unanimous consent the sena may set aside one amendment temporarily in order to consider another one other agreements may define the orde r in which senators will offer their amendments postpone roll call votes until later time that is more convenient for senators or even set s upermajority threshold for the adoption of particular amendment these examples only begin to illustrate the many ways in which the senate relies every day on unanimous consent arrangements from routine requests to end quorum call or waive the reading of an amendment to extr emely elaborate and complicated procedural treaties the nate depends on unanimous consent requests and the willingness of senators to agree to them the daily order of business the extent to which the senate uses unanimous consent arrangements to supplement or supplant operation of its sta nding rules makes it difficult to predict with confidence what will actually take place on the senate floor each day this report already has mentioned some of the problems that can arise in scheduling legislation and in anticipating the time that will be consumed and the amendments that senators will offer during consid eration of each bill in additi on the other proceedings that occur each day also depend on whether the senate decides to operate under or outside of its rules the time at which the senate convenes each day is set by resolution the senate adopts at the beginning of each congress but that time is often changed from day to day by unanimous consent at the request of the majority leader to suit changing circumstances when the nate does convene nd after the opening prayer and the pledge of allegiance brief period of leader time is set aside for the majority leader and for the minor ity leader under standing order also established at the beginning of the congress during this time the two party leaders may discuss the legislative schedule as we ll as their views on policy issues and they also may conduct noncont roversial business by unanimous consent what happens thereafter depends on whet her the senate is beginning new legislative day legislative day be gins when the senate convenes after an adjournment and it continues until the next adjournment when the senate recesses at the end of day as it often does legislative day continues for two or more calendar days standing rules vii and viii prescribe what the senate s hould do at the beginning of each new legislative day and one of the reasons the senate frequently recesses from day to day is to set aside the requirements imposed by these rules under the two standing rules the first two hours of session on each new legislative day are called the morning hour they are period for conducting routinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548crs12 business at predictable time each day that does not interfere with the consideration of major legislation the morning hour begins with the transaction of morning business which includes the introduction of bills and joint resolutions and the submission of senate and concurrent resolutions and committee reports during the remainder of the morning hour the senate can act on bills on the calendar of business and may even vote to consider them by nondebatable motions to proceed at the end of the morning hour the senate resumes considerati on of the unfinished business whatever bill if any was the pending business when the senate adjourned in practice the senate very often recesses at the end of the day so there is morning hour on the following day of sessi on instead the majority leader usually arranges by unanimous consent that period for transacting routine morning business follow leader time senators make brief statements on whatever subjects they like during this period the length of which can change from day to day depending on the legislative schedule so by unanimous consent there may be other periods for transacting morning bu siness during the course of the day when time is available and senators wish to speak on subjects unrelated to the pending bill after the morning hour or the period for transacting routine morning business the senate normally resumes consideration of the bill that is either the unfinished business if the senate had adjourned on the preceding day or the pending business if the senate had recessed instead however this bill may be set aside temporarily or indefinitely in favor of other legislative or executive business if the senate agrees to motions or unanimous c onsent requests made for that purpose by the majority leader before the end of the day the majority leader also makes arrangements for the following day establishing meeting time by unanimous consent and commenting on the expected legislative program the amending process the amending process is at the heart of the senates floor liberations if the senate reaches final vote on passing or feating bill the bill is very likely to pass it is through the amending pro cess that senators have an opportunity to influence the content of the bill before the vote on final passage occurs this is an especially important opportunity for sena tors who do not serve on the committee that marked up the bill and reported it when bill is called up for floor consid eration opening statements usually are made by the two floor managers the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee or sometimes the subcommittee that reported the bill and often by other senators as well these statem ents lay the groundwork for the debate that follows describing the purposes and provisions of the bill the state of current law and the developments that ma ke new legislation desirable or necessary and the major points of controversy these opening stat ements are matter of custom and practice however the bill is open to amendment as soon as it is before the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548crs13 the first amendments to be considered are those recommended by the committee reporting the bill and so designated in the printed version of the bill as reported as each committee amendment is being debated nators may propose amendments to it and to the part of the bill the committee amendment would change the senate votes on any such amendments before it votes on the committee amendment itself thereafter senators ma offer amendments in any order to any part of the bill that has not already been amended the order in which amendments are offered depends largely on the conveni ence of the senators proposing them not on requirements imposed by standing rules or precedents as general rule senator cannot propose an amendment to bill while first degree and possibly second degree amendments to the bill are pending it is not unusual however for the senate to agree by unanimous c onsent to lay aside pending amendments temporarily in order to cons ider another amendment that senator wishes to offer at that time after senator offers an amendment it must be read unless the senate dispenses with the reading by unanimous consent the senate then debates the amendment and may dispose of it either by voting up or down on the amendment itself or by voting to table it however the amending process can become far more complicated bills are amendable in two degrees so before the senate votes on first degree amendment it is subject to second degree amendments that propose to change its text after voting on any sec ond degree amendments the senate votes on the first degree amendment as it may have been amended third degree amendments amendments to second degree amendments are not in order additional complications are possible depending on whether the first degree amendment proposes 1 to insert add itional language in the bill without altering anything already in the bill 2 to strike out language from the bill without inserting anything in its place 3 to strike out language from the bill and insert different language instead or 4 to strike out the entire text of the bill everything after the enacting or resolving clause at the very beginning of the measure and replace it with different text in the case of motion to insert for example senators can offer as many as three first and second degree ame ndments before the senate votes on any of them in the case of an amendment that is complete substitute for the text of the bill senators can propose six or more fi rst and second degree amendments to the substitute and to the original text of the bill before any votes must occur these possibilities depend on several principles of precedence among amendments principles governing the amendments that may be offered while other amendments are pending and also governing the order in which the senate votes on the amendments that have been offered complicated amendment situations do not arise very often but they are most likely to occur when the policy and political stakes are high once senator has offered an amendmen t the conditions for debating it depend on whether or not there is time limitation for considering that particular amendment or all amendments to the bill if ther is such limitation each senator may debate the amendment for as long as he or sh pleases subject only to the rule limiting each senator to two speeches on question during each legislative day however any senator who has been recognized may move to table the amendment and that motionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548crs14 is not debatable if there is time limitation the time provided is both minimum and maximum senators ma not make motions or point s of order propose other amendments or move to table until all the time for debating the amendment has been used or until all remaining time has been yielded back after the time has expired on the other hand the amendment can be debated further only by unanimous consent or if the senators controlling time for debating the bill as whole choose to yield part of that time number of general principles govern th amending process for example an amendment that has been defeated may not be offered again without substantive change an amendment should not make ch anges in two or more different places in the bill nor may it propose only to amend part of the bill that already has been amended if an amendment consists of tw or more parts that could each stand as separate and indepe ndent propositions any senator ma demand that the amendment be divided and each division treated as if it were separate amendment except that motion to strike out and insert is not di visible generally sp eaking senators may not propose amendments to their own amendm ents but they can modify or withdraw their amendments instead if the senate takes some action on an amendment such as ordering the yeas and nays on it th senator who offered the amendment loses his right to modify it but now gains the righ t to offer an amendment to his or her own amendment as mentioned before floor amendments to most bills need not be germane unless germaneness requirement is part of the unanimous consent agreement under which particular bill is being considered alternatively the senate may by unanimous consent require that amendments to bill be relevant to it relevancy is somewhat less restrictive standard that seeks to ensure that unrelated issues will not be raised in the form of amendments the amending process continues until senators have other amendments they wish to offer or until the entire bill has been changed by amendments at either point the senate orders the bill engrossed and read third time formal stage that precludes further amendments nd then votes on final passage quorum calls and rollcall votes the constitution requires that quorum th at is majority of all senators be present to conduct business on the floor even though senators have many responsibilities that frequently keep them from the floor the senate presumes that quorum is present unless quorum call demonstrates that it is not senator who has been recognized may suggest the absence of quorum at almost any time clerk then begins to call the roll of senators senators may not debate or conduct business wh ile quorum call is in prog ress if majority of senators do not appear and respond to thei r names the senate can only adjourn or recess or attempt to secure the attendance of additiona l senators however quorum calls usually are ended by unanimous consent before the clerk completes the call ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96548crs15 the roll and the absence of quorum is demonstrated the reason is that most quorum calls are not really intended to determine if quorum is present the purpose of quorum call usually is to suspend floor activity temporarily if senator is coming to the floor to speak colleague may suggest the absence of quorum until the expected nator arrives if the senate finds itself confronted with unexpected procedural complications if the majority leader needs to meet with several senators on the floor about possible unanimous cons ent agreement or if the floor manager of bill wants to discuss compromise alternative to an amendment another senator has offered for any of these or many other reasons senator may suggest the absence of quorum to pe rmit time for informal consultations the time consumed by many quorum calls pe rmits intensive and productive discussions that would be far more difficult to hold under the rules of form senate debate the constitution also provides that onefifth of the senators on the floor assuming that quorum is present can mand rollcall vote since the smallest possible quorum is 51 senators the suppor t of at least 11 senators is required to order rollcall vote senator who has b een recognized can ask for the yeas and nays at any time that the senate is cons idering motion amendment bill or other question agreement to this request does not terminate debate instead if rollcall is ordered that is how the senate will vote on the question whenever the time for the vote arrives thus the senate may orde r rollcall vote on an amendment as soon as it is offered but the vote itself may not take place for several hours or more when senators longer wish to debate the amendment the alternative to rollcall vote usually is voice vote in which the senators favoring the bill or amendment or whatever question is to be decided vote aye in unison followed by those voting although voice vote does not create public record of how each senator voted it is an equally valid and conclusive way for the senate to reach decision sources of additional information the standing rules of the senate are pub lished periodically in separate senate document and in the senate manual which contains other re lated documents as well the most recent compilation of the senates precedents is the riddicks senate procedure named in honor of floyd m riddi ck parliamentaria n
