and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33449military retirement concurrent receipt and related major legislative issues summary the military retirement system includes benefits for retirement after an active or reserve military career disability retirement and survivor benefits for eligible survivors of deceased retirees the change to the system that has generated the most recent legislative activity involves whether some or all military retirees should be allowed to receive both military retired pay and any va disability compensation to which they are otherwise entitled this is referred to as concurre nt receipt until 2004 the law provided that military retired pay had to be reduced by the amount of va disability compensation some maintained this was inequitable and unfair it wa s defended on grounds of cost and of the need to avoid setting precedent for concurrent receipt of numerous other federal benefits starting in 1999 fy2000 provisions in each years annual national defense authorization act ndaa authorized paym ents to comparatively small groups in the tens of thousands of milita ry retirees in lieu of concu rrent receipt the program enacted in 2002 in the fy2003 ndaa pl 107314 is known as combat related special compensation crsc although it applies also to those people injured in military operations and training generally as distinct from those whose injuries are unrelated to military service but incurred while in service crsc provides for payments that are the financial equivalent of concurrent receipt the fy2004 ndaa pl 108136 november 24 2003 for the first time provided the concurrent receipt or its practical and financial equivalence to large numbers of military retirees the law ffective january 1 2004 1 authorized the payment of crsc to all otherwise eligible military retirees regardless of their percentage of disability 2 authorized 10year phasein of concurrent receipt for all military retirees whose disability is 50 or

congress begins its second ssion ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan combined with recruiting challenges and great deal of interest among military retirees and those working on their behalf will probably continue to highlight military retirement and concurrent receipt issues however with the recruiting and rete ntion challenges being faced by the military it is anticipated that military personne l benefits to incl ude retirement will continue to be advanced and advocated by the department of defense dod and veterans organizations it is further an ticipated that concurrent receipt eligibility will remain an issue for the second session of the 110th congress key elements and issues conceptual and political setting congress confronts both constituent concerns and budgetary constraints in considering military retirement issues the approximately 21 million military retirees and survivor benefit recipients and their roughly 6 million to 8 million family members have been and continue to be an articulate and welleducated constituent group familiar with the legi slative process and represented by associations staffed with military retirees who have long experience in working with congress in recent years the longsta nding efforts by military retirees and their associations to secure more benefits for their members have been buttressed by 1 the outpouring of nationwide nostalgia and support for th past heroism and current oldage needs of the greatest generation of world war iiera veterans whether retirees or not 2 concern over problems the military services were having in recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personne l which have been exacerbated by ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan and the extent to which actual or perceived inadequacies in retirement benefits may have been contributing to these problems 3 the impression by many current or former military personnel that the clinton administration was not favorably disposed toward the military as an institution leading to effort s to portray increased retirement benefits as palliative and 4 in reversal of the attit udes toward the clinton administration efforts to obtain more benefits from the bush administration because it is perceived as being pro military and since september 11 2001 there has been predictably dramatic increase in public and congre ssional support for the armed forceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33449crs2 in addition it can be posited that the policy choices posed by recentlyenacted increased benefits for military retirees are an integral part of larger debate in the united states over the distribution of pens iontype resources among younger workers and older retirees in the defense context it may take the form of tensions between dod and current active duty and reserve military personnel with the responsibility of defending the united states in the pr esent and retired military personnel many of whom feel that they are losing benef its to which they assumed they would always have access some assert that rapidly increasing retireerelate d benefits although they reward those whose patriotic servi ce is unquestionable are crowding out defense resources that could go to ma intaining and improving current defense capabilities on the other hand it can be ar gued that in defense budget of about 550 billion yearly these benefits are not si gnificant enough to really detract from current defense capability and that near ly 14 trillion gdp is more than adequate to finance both benefits for military retirees and current defense requirements if the political will to do so is present in general since the late 1990s congre ss has been more aggressive than the executive branch in responding to the stated concerns of retirees about their benefits dod and other executive branch agencies have over time tende d to regard military retirement benefits as place where subs tantial budgetary savi ngs could be made for instance as noted below congress took the initiative in 1999 to repeal the redux cuts in future military retired pa that was originally enacted in 1986 and congress has enacted major increases in military health care benefits for retirees tricare for life and authorized partial concurrent receipt of military retired pay and va disability compensation both over dod objections program summary in fy2007 total federal budget outlays for military retirement were 435 billion and dod budget outlays were 144billion the differing figures for total federal and dod outlays result from the us of the accrual method in accounting for the costs of military retirement see the section below on budgeting and costs for discussion of accrual accounting these numbers taken from table 2 also differ slightly from those in table 1 for purely technical reasons without policy significance table 1 shows the estimated numbers of retirees and the costs to the

member who retires from active duty is paid an immediate monthly annuity based on percentage of his or her retired pay computation base for persons who entered military service be fore september 8 1980 the retired pay computation base is final monthly basic pa being received at the time of retirement for those who entered service on or af ter september 8 1980 the computation base is the average of the highest three years 36 months of basic pay2 basic pay comprises approximately 70 of the total for all retirement eligibles 75 for 30 year retirees and 66 for 20year retirees thus the 20year retiree may get 50 of retired pay computation ba upon retirement but only 33 of rmc the 30year retiree will receive 75 of the computation base but only 56 of rmc nor do any of these calculations include any of the many special pays bonuses or other cash compensation to which many military members are entitled retired pay computation formula military personnel who first entere d the service before august 1 1986 all military pers onnel who first entered military service before august 1 1986 have their retired pay computed at the rate of 25 of the retired pay computation base for each year of servi ce the minimum amount of retired pay to which member entitled to compute his or her retired pay under this formula is therefore 50 of the retired pay computati on base 20 years of service x 25 25year retiree receives 625 of the comput ation base 25 years of service x 25 the maximum reached at the 30year mark is 75 of the computation base 30 years of service x 25 however the fy2007 national defens authorization act extended the previous pay table to 40 years allowed additional longevity raises3 and provided additional retirement credit for service bey ond 30 years at the rate of 25 per year4 as result servicemember who retires with 40 years of service will qualify for 100 of basic pay in their retirement military personnel who first entere d the service on or after august 1 1986 personnel who first enter service on or after august 1 1986 in accordance with the provisions of the fy2000 national defense authorization act are required to select one of two options in calcula ting their retired pay within 180 days of reaching 15 years of service option 1 preredux they can opt to have their retired pay computed in accordance with the preredux formula described above but with slightlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33449crs5 modified cost of living adjustment cola formula which is less generous than that of the preredux formula see below under colas option 2 redux they can opt to have their retired pay computed in accordance with the redux formula and receive an immediate 30000 cash bonus called career status bonus which can actually be paid in several annual installments if the recipient so wishes for tax purposes the redux formula under age 62 retirees redux is different from the previous formula in two major ways firs t for retirees under age 62 retired pay will be computed at the rate of 20 of the re tired pay computation base for each year of service through 20 and 35 for each year of service from 2130 under this new formula therefore 20year retiree will receive 40 of his or her retired pay computation base upon retiremen t 20 years of service x 20 and 25year retiree will receive 575 of the com putation base 20 years of service x 20 5 years of service x 35 30year retiree howev er will continue to receive 75 of the retired pay computation base 20 years of service x 20 10 years of service x 35 the changed formula therefore is skewed much more sharply in favor of the longerserving military careerist theoretically providing an incentive to remain on active duty longer before retiring the redux formula retirees 62 and older second when retiree reaches age 62 his or her retired pay will be recomputed based on the old formula straight 25 of the retired pay computati on base for each year of service thus beginning at 62 the 20year retiree receiving 40 of the computation base for retired pay according to the new formula will begin receiving 50 of his or her original computation base the 25year retirees nnuity will jump from 575 of the original computation base to 625 nd the 30year retirees annuity already at 75 of the original computation base under both the old and new formulas will not change note this change is an

since 1982 some cola modifications always with the aim of reducing costs and hence the payments to retirees have been at least discussed therefore it is probably inadvisable to assume at any time that

will have their colas computed as follows annual colas will be held to one percentage point below the actual inflation rate for retirees under age 62 retirees covered by this new cola formula would thus receive 20 increase rather than 30 in their military retired pay under the hypothetical example described in the above paragraph when retiree reaches age 62 there will be onetime r ecomputation of his or her annuity to make up for the lost purchasing power caused by the holding of colas to the inflation rate minus one percentage point this recomputation will be applied to the old generally more liberal retired pay computation formula on which retirees 62 or older will have their annuities computed see the above subsection entitled retired pay computation formula compounding for most

and benefits of the two retirement alternatives an analysis of the economic effects for hypothetical retirees indicates that in almost all cases opting for the preredux formula will pay the individual much more over time report of the center for naval analyses states that the more liberal retired pay computation formula and cola formula of preredux far outweighs the shortterm benefits of 30000 pretax cash bonus the report did say that it might be possible for an individual investor to beat th negative aspects of the bonus by wise investment decisions but that it would be difficult5 naturally study can know what an individuals financial situation is at first only fairly small percentage of personnel opted for the 30000 lump sum6 however the number appears to have been rising

this interest funds the retir ed pay to which persons currently in the armed forces during that fiscal year and who ultimately retire will be entitled in the future these estimated future retirement costs are arrived at by making projections based on the past rates at which active duty military personne l stayed in the service until retirement and on assumptions rega rding the overall us economy such as interest rates inflation ra tes and military pay levels these dod budget outlays for retirement are computed as percentage of fiscal years total military pay costs for each military service approximately 35 40 of military basic pay costs must be added to the dod personnel budget each fiscal year to cover the future retirement costs of those personnel who u ltimately retire from the military dod budget outlays in each fiscal year that pay for the estimated cost of future retirees are transferred in paper trans action to military retirement fund located in the income security function of the federal budget the military retirement fund also receives paper transfers from the general fund of the treasury to fund the initial unfunded liability of the military retirement system this is the total future cost of military retired pay that will result from military service performed prior to the implementation of accrua l accounting in fy1985 money is disbursed from this military retirement fund to cu rrent retirees individual re tirees continue to receive their retired pay from dod finance centers technically however because this money paid to individuals comes not from the dod budget but from the fund it is paid out by the income security function of the federal budget actual payments to current retirees thus show up in the fede ral budget as outlays from the federal budget as whole but not from dod under accr ual accounting theref ore total federal outlays for each fiscal year continue to reflect only costs of payments to military members who have already retired as wa s the case before accrual accounting began accrual accounting only changes the manner in which the federal government accounts for military retired pay it does not ffect actual payments to individuals in any way unfunded liability current debates over both federal civilian and military retirement have included some discussion of the unfunded liability of both as noted above the military retirement systems unfunded liability consists of future retired pay costs incurred before the creation of the military re tirement fund in fy1985 these obligations are being liquidated by the payment to the fund each year of an amount from the general fund of the treasury and will be fully paid ba sed on current calculations by fy2033 the unfunded liability at th end of fy2003 was 6283 billion the estimated liability for fy2004 was 6483 billion for fy2005 6661 billion and for fy2006 6842 billion8 these figures are between 83 and 92 billion higher than the estimated unfunded liability for the same years at the end of fy2003 this increase is due almost entirely to the enactment of concurrent receiptrelatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33449crs9 retirement benefits both actual concurrent receipt and combatrelated special compensation crsc discussed below some concerns have been voiced bout the amount of unfunded liability however 1 the hundreds of billions of do llars of unfunded liab ility is cumulative amount to be paid to retirees over the next 50 years not all at once 2 by the time some persons first become eligible fo r retired pay under the preaccrual accounting system many others will have died and 3 unlike the private sector there is way for employees to claim immediate payment of their future benefits an analogy would be that most homeowners cannot affo rd to pay cash for house so they get mortgage if the mortgage had to be paid in full almost homeowners could afford to do so however spread out ove r 30 years the payments are affordable similarly the unfunded liability of federal retirement progra ms is deemed affordable when federal retirement outlays are spread over many decades military retirement cost trends because military retirement is an entitle ment rather than discretionary program its costs to the total federal budget payments to current retirees and survivors always rise modestly each year due to predictable slow rise in the number of retirees and survivors the cost to dod estimated future retirement costs of current personnel declined after fy 1989 the beginning of the postcold war drawdown as the size of the force nd therefore the number of people who will retire from it in the future declined however as the drawdown stabilized so did the dod budget costs of retirement table 2 indicates the costs of military

increaseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33449crs10 the cost of concurrent receipt of military retired pa and va disability compensation discussed immediately below is frequently cited in the context of other benefits to retired military personnel and their familie s that have been created or expanded since the late 1990s dod and others have argued that such retiree benefits are becoming increasingly costly and do not leverage readiness by applying directly to active duty or rese rve military personnel and their families they suggest that the money being used for thes purposes should be channeled into active duty or reserve benefits that directly relate to recruitment or career retention not retiree compensation whose relationship to actual or potential personnel shortages is tenuous and difficult to establish the two benefits most often included in this category are concurrent receipt and crsc and tricare for life extending to medicareeligible military retirees dod health care insurance for care obtained from civilian sources others would include in this list repeal of the redux cuts in military retirement discussed above in addition concerns have been voiced bout retiree benefit incr eases that have not been enacted but that ar under active debate and c onsideration in congress including lowering the age at which reserve retirees can first receive retired pay from 60 to 55 the arguments in favor of these benef it increases have been equally strong proponents suggest that even if they do not directly affect active duty or reserve military personnel by strengthening the broa d range of benefits available to military retirees they provide strong career retention incentive in particular they argue that although most of the us army and substan tial part of the marine corps is at war in iraq and afghanistan and repetitive tours of duty in those two theaters of combat operations are likely prospect for activ duty personnel and re serve personnel now is the time to be buttressing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow the benefits available to milita ry personnel who are willing to undergo the hardships of military career in return for liberal retirement benefits after 20 years of service concurrent receipt of military retired pay and va disability compensation military retired pay and va disability compensation overview most people familiar with military retirement would probably agree that the most controversial military retirement issue that is currently the object of intense congressional interest is that involving c oncurrent receipt of military retired pay and department of veterans affairs va disability co mpensation until 2004 the law required that military retired pay be re duced by the amount of any va disability compensation received for many years so military retirees had sought change in law to permit receipt of ll or some of both and legisl ation to allow this has been introduced during the past several congre sses frequently having cosponsors well above half of both the house and the senate this issue is referred to as concurrent receipt because it would involve the simulta neous receipt of two types of benefits the fy2003 national defense authoriza tion act ndaa enacted in 2002 createdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33449crs11 benefit known as combatrelated speci compensation or crsc crsc

receiving va disability compensati on can ask for medical reexamination at any time or veteran who does not receive disability compensation upon separation from service can be reexamined later all va disability compensation is taxfree which makes receipt of va compensation desirable even with the operation of the offset interaction of dod and va disability benefits military retirees can also apply to the va for disability compensation this can be advantageous to retirees who have dod disability rating because although offset the va compensation is totally taxfree also retiree may 1 apply for va compensation any time after leaving the service and 2 have his or her degree of disability changed by the va as the result of later medical reevaluation as noted above many retirees seek benefits from the va years after retirement for condition that may have been incurred during military service but that does not manifest itself until many years later the dod and va disability rating systems have mu ch in common as well as significant differences dod makes dete rmination of eligibility fo r disability retirement only once at the time the individual is sepa rating from the service although dod uses the va schedule of types of disabilities to determine the percentage of disability dod measures disability or lack thereof ag ainst the extent to which the individual can or cannot perform military duties rather than his or her ability to perform post service civilian work military retiree regardless of his or her dod disability status immediately upon retirement can appl for va disability compensation at any time after leaving active military duty military disability retired pay is usually taxable unless related to combat disability for further discussion of these and other

crsc enacted in 2002 and expanded in 2003 the fy2003 ndaa section 636 pl 107 314 116 stat 2458 as amended by the fy2004 ndaa section 642 pl 108136 117 stat 13 92 authorized combat related special compensation crsc military retirees with at least 20 years of service and who meet either of the following two criteria are eligible for crsc disability that is attributable to an injury for which the member was awarded the purple heart nd is not rated as less than 10 disability by dod or the va or disability rating from either dod or the va incurred due to involvement in arme d conflict hazardous service duty simulating war and through an instrumentality of war this appears in lay terms to encompass combat with any kind of hostile force hazardous duty such as di ving parachuting using dangerous materials such as explosives and the like individual training and unit training and exercises and maneuvers in the field and instrumentalities of war such as accidents in combat vehicles or if due to trainingrelated activities aboard naval vessels or military aircraft and accidental injuries due to occurrences such as munitions explosions injuries from gases or vapors related to training for combat and the like the 2003 legislation limited the latter criterion to retirees with at least 60 disability the 2004 legislation repealed the 60 limit crsc payments will be equal to the amount of va disability compensation to which the retiree is entitled but the new legislation does not end the requirement that the retirees military retired pay be reduced by whatever va compensation to which the retiree is entitled therefor crsc beneficiaries will r eceive the financial equivalence of concurrent receipt but in legal and statutory terms it will not constitute concurrent receipt and the stat ute also states that it explicitly is not retired pay per for online applications and information see httpswwwdodmil prhomemppcrschtml retir ees may also phone the retir ement services offices of their service for the necessary information crsc for military disability retirees servicemembers with permanent disability rating of 30 or gr eater may be retired and receive retired pay prior to completing 20 years of service these retirees are generally referred to as chapter 61 retirees reference to chapter 61 title 10 which governs their retirement the original concurrent receipt legislation excluded those who retired with less than 20 years of service however the fy2008 ndaa pl110181 expanded combat related special compensation crsc to include chap ter 61 retirees effective january 1 2008 eligibility is not based on minimum number of years of service or minimum disability rating other than the 30 noted above for disability retirement excludedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33449crs13 from eligibility are those former servicemembers who were medically retired due to serviceconnected disabilities the fy2008 ndaa also includes almost ll reserve disability retirees except those retired under 10 usc 12731b speci provision which allows reservists with physical disability not incurred in the line of duty to retire with between 15 and 19 creditable years of service crsc for reserve retirees the crsc statute in the fy2004 ndaa clearly states that personnel who qualify for reserve retirement by having at least 20 years of duty creditable for reserve retirement purposes are eligible for crsc when crsc was enacted in 2002 dod interpreted th law as requiring reserve retirees to have at least 7200 reserve retir ement points to be eligib for crsc reservist receives certain number of retirement point s for varying levels of participation in the reserves or active duty military rvice the 7200 point figure was extraordinarily high in fact it could only have been attained by reservist who had at least 20 years of active duty military service hence the dod interpretation of the law effectively denied crsc to reservists concurrent receipt for re tirees with 50 or greater disability also know as concurrent receipt disability payments the fy2004 ndaa section 641 authorized for the first time actual concurrent receipt for retirees with at least 50 disability regardless of the cause of disability however the amount of concu rrent receipt will be phased in over 10year period from 20042013 except for 100 disabled retirees w ho will be entitled to immediate concurrent receipt effective january 1 2005 this provision was added in the fy2005 ndaa see below depending on the degree of disability the initial amount of retired pay that the retiree could receive would va ry from 100 to 750 per month or the actual amount whichever is less by 2014 the decrease in retired pay will be totally eliminated as with the revised crsc this c oncurrent receipt benef it is also available to those reservists with at least 20 years of service creditable for reserve retirement purposes and who are receiving retired pay eligibility begins at age 60 the actual operation of the new concurre nt receipt benefit is complicated due to its progressive implement ation over several years as required by law 10 usc 1414 c as enacted by subsection 641a pl 108136 november 24 2003 117 stat 1511 it uses both dollar amounts and percentage amounts and varies in accordance with the degree of disability and by calendar year not fiscal year as follows 2004 in calendar year 2004 military retirees entitled to va disability compensation were entitled to r eceive in addition to that part of their military retired pay which is greater than the total va compensation to which they are entitled the following additional am ounts of retired payhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33449crs14 100 disability up to 750 per month additional retired pay 90 disability up to 500 per month additional retired pay 80 disability up to 350 per month additional retired pay 70 disability up to 250 per month additional retired pay 60 disability up to 125 per month additional retired pay 50 disability up to 100 per month additional retired pay example assume that in 2004 retiree with 100 disability ie up to 750 per month as described above had been entitled to 1500 per month in military retired pay and 1000 per month in va disability compensation before the 2003 legislation authorizing concurrent receipt the retiree could have received only 500 per month in military retired pay because the remaining 1000 per month of retired pay would have been offset by the retirees 1000 in va compensati on however in 2004 this hypothetical retirees military retired pay would have increased to 1250 per month the 500 unaffected by the va compensation and an additional 750 per month for total of 1250 however 250 of the 1000 in m onthly va compensation would still have been offset 2005 in calendar year 2005 with the exception of 100 disabled retirees military retirees entitled to va disability compensation were entitled to any such amounts received in 2004 as noted above and an additional 10 of the offset that remained in 2004 however beginni ng on january 1 2005 and thereafter 100 disabled retirees are entitled to all of their military retired pay in addition to all of their va disability compensation 2006 in calendar year 2006 the same procedure as in 2005 applied but the retirees affected got an additional 20 of their remaining offset from 2004 full concurrent receipt for 100 disabled retirees continued 2007 in 2007 the same procedure applies but with affected retirees receiving an additional 30 of their remaining offs et from 2004 full concurrent receipt for 100 disabled retir ees will continue 2008 in 2008 the same procedure applies but with affected retirees receiving an additional 40 of their remaining offs et from 2004 full concurrent receipt for 100 disabled retirees will conti nue on january 1 2008 those former servicemembers who were medically retired due to combatrelated disabilities become eligible for combatrelated special compensation crsc in addition those retirees rated as 100 unemployab by the va become eligible for concurrent receipt retroac tive to december 31 2004 20092014 full concurrent receipt for 100 disabled retirees will continue 2009 an additional 50 of their remaining offset from 2004 2010 an additional 60 of their remaining offset from 20042011 an additional 70 of their remaining offset from 20042012 an additional 80 of their remaining offset from 20042013 an additional 90 of their remaining offset from 20042014 all offsets would end m ilitary retirees with at least 50 disability would be allowed to receive their entire military re tired pay and va disability compensationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33449crs15 for those retirees who retire after 2004 their initial amounts will be the dollar amount prescribed for each percentage of di sability the range listed above in the section on calendar year 2004 between 100 and 750 depending on degree of disability plus the additiona l percentage of that dollar amount for that year thus retiree who first retires in say 2006 w ith an 80 disability will begin receiving an additional 420 monthly of his or her re tired pay the 350 that an 80 disabled retiree is entitled to as noted above pl us the additional 20 of 350 or 70 specified for 2006 because of the high initial amounts provide d to severely disabled retirees this new concurrent receipt benefit is frontloaded that is most retirees will be able to concurrently receive most of their milita ry retired pay within few years of enactment of the law retiree cannot receive both crsc and crd p benefits the retiree may choose whichever is most financially advantageous to him or her and may move back and forth between either benefit to maximize the payments recei ved as often as desired concurrent receipt for those rated 100 unemployable after the enactment of the fy2005 ndaa in late 2004 an issue arose about whether the authorization of full concu rrent receipt effective january 1 2005 for 100 disabled retirees applied to retirees with disa bility rating of less than 100 but with what the va terms an individual unemployability iu rating of 100 the language in subsection 642a of the fy2005 ndaa states that the immediate payment of full concurrent receipt will apply to retirees r eceiving ve terans disability compensation for disability rated at 100 percent that is the law does not mention the iu concept according to individuals familiar with the issue during the conference on the fy2005 ndaa in 2004 language explicitly including the 100 unemployables with less than 100 di sability rating was kept out of the final legislation on cost grounds the fy2006 ndaa pl 109163 contained partial step toward inclusion of the 100 unemployables by authorizin g full concurrent receipt beginning on october 1 2009 over four years earlier than the date of january 1 2014 that is in current law the date of full concurrent receipt for all retirees regardless of their disability rating the issue of concurrent receipt for 100 unemployables was addressed in the fy2008 ndaa pl 110181 this provision ex tended eligibility to all who have been rated as 100 unemployable regardle ss of their disability rating by the va and made their eligibility for concurrent r eceipt retroactive to december 31 2004 however this new benefit will not begin until october 1 2008 at that time monthly payments will begin and will include lump sum payment for the retroactive benefit service contact information the services have each established
