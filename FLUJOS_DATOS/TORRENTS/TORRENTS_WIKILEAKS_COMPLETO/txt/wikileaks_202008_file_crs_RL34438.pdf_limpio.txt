increasingly recognized international violence against women v aw as significant human rights and global health issue v aw which can include both random acts of violence as well as sustained abuse over time can be physical psychological or sexual in nature studies have found that v aw occurs in all geographic regions countries cultures and economic classes with some surveys showing that women in developing countries experience higher rates of violence than those in developed countries many experts view v aw as symptom of the historically unequal power relationship between men and women and argue that over time this imbalance has led to pervasive cultural stereotypes and attitudes that perpetuate cycle of violence us policymakers have generally focused on specific types or circumstances of v aw rather than view it as standalone issue congress has aut horized and appropriated funds for international programs that address v aw including human trafficking and female genital cutting in addition past and current administrations have supported efforts to reduce international levels of v aw though many of these activities are implemented as components of broader foreign aid initiatives there is us governmentwide coordination of antiv aw efforts most agencies and departments do not track the cost or number of programs with v aw components therefore it is unclear how much money the us government or individual agencies spend annually on v aw related programs some experts have suggested that the us government should reexamine and perhaps enhance current us antiv aw activities they argue that v aw should not only be treated as standalone human rights issue but also be integrated into us assistance and foreign policy mechanisms other observers are concerned with perceived lack of coordination among us government agencies and departments that address international violence against women this report addresses causes prevalence and consequences of violence against women it provides examples of us activities that address v aw directly or include antiv aw components it outlines possible policy considerations for the 111 th congress including the scope and effectiveness of

decades the us government and international community have increasingly recognized violence against women hereinafter v aw as human rights problem with far reaching consequences1 prior to the 1970s many in the international community viewed v aw as private matter to be dealt with among individuals and not public matter that merited national or international response2 in the late 1970s and 1980s however the international community began to focus on v aw as global health problem and violation of human rights this shift was driven in part by an increasingly effective and wellorganized grassroots movement of local national and international womens nongovernmental organizations ngos that brought international attention to the plight of v aw victims and created more public forum for discussion of the issue3 us policymakers have generally addressed v aw as component of other international development efforts rather than as standalone issue congress has authorized and appropriated funds for international programs that address types of v aw including trafficking in persons and female genital cutting fgc members of congre ss have also addressed v aw in the context of issues such as hivaids prevention and democracy promotion similarly in the last decade past and current administrations have supported initiatives to reduce specific types and circumstances of international vaw through programs addressing humanitarian assistance and healthcare the lack of us governmentwide coordination or overarching framework for addressing international v aw however has led some to suggest that us efforts to address v aw while important take piecemeal approach to addressing the problem further some argue that the united states should reexamine and possibly enhance current efforts to combat violence against women this report identifies types of v aw and the direct and indirect consequences of these acts of violence it provides examples of us govern ment programs thatin whole or in partwork to reduce or eliminate international violence against women it does not assess the scope of individual programs or programs success in achieving its goal the report also outlines possible policy considerations for the 111th congress including the scope and effectiveness of current us programs further integrating v aw prevention and treatment into us foreign assistance programs and coordinating among us executive branch agencies and departments4 1 this report discusses us efforts to address international vaw on global level it does not address vaw in particular regions or countries for an overview of domestic efforts and programs to combat vaw see crs report rl30871 violence against women act history and federal funding by garrine p laney 2 international efforts to

the elimination of violence against women devaw the declaration which was supported by the us government describes v aw as any act of genderbased violence that results in or is likely to result in physical sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women including threats of such acts coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty whether occurring in public or private life5 the dev aw definition of v aw is broad encompassing both physical and psychological harm it is used in this report because it is one of the most inclusive and widely agreed to international definitions in some contexts v aw may be used synonymously with genderbased violence gbv which describes violence perpetrated against an individual regardless of sex because of his or her gender6 despite the international adoption of dev aw governments organizations and cultures continue to define v aw in number of ways taking in to account unique factors and circumstances how v aw is defined has implications for policymakers because the definition affects the types of violence that are measured and addressed some law enforcement organizations and national criminal codes for instance do not consider psychological abuse to be form v aw because while harmful in many cases it is legal others however advocate for broader definition of v aw contending that physical and psychological harm cannot be separated and that psychological abuse can be as devastating as physical abuse 7 g21g140g152g153g142g561g138g151g141g561g5g152g151g157g142g161g157g561 v aw occurs in all geographic regions countries cultures and economic classes many experts view v aw as symptom of the historically unequal power relationship between men and women and argue that over time this imbalance has led to pervasive cultural stereotypes and attitudes that perpetuate cycle of violence 8 though the specific causes of v aw vary on casebycase basis some researchers have identified community and individual risk factors that may increase rates of violence against women community factors can include cultural norms that support male superiority high crime levels poor economic conditions and lack of political and legal protection from governments individual factors that may lead to high risk of becoming victim of v aw include living in poverty and previous history of abuse 9 5 document ares48104 december 20 1993 devaw was adopted without vote at the 48th session of the general assembly 6 the term genderbased violence is broader than vaw because it can include violence perpetrated against men and boys in addition to women and girls 7 for further discussions on vaw definitions see ending violence against women challenge for development and humanitarian work by francine pickup oxfam gb

consequences of violence against women in many societies women provide emotional and financial support for families and communities studies have shown that violence and the social stigma of violence negatively affect the ability of women and girls to participate fully in and contribute to their communities research has also found that women who experience violence are less likely to hold jobs and are more likely to live in poverty than those who do not experience violence 10 violence and the fear of violence may cause some women to avoid public places such as schools and the workplace some research has also found that women may also be less likely to participate in political activities or development projects because of the threat of physical violence11 moreover some studies have found that harassment and sexual abuse contributes to low female enrollment rates and high dropout rates from secondary schools 12 the health consequences of vaw are significant with many victims suffering from severe physical and mental health consequencesbot h immediate and longterm numerous studies have found that women and girls who experience violence have an increased risk of poor physical and reproductive health13 the physical health impacts of v aw can be divided into two categoriesimmediate and functional immediate consequences directly result from acts of violence and may include fractures gunshot wounds bruises and lacerations and death functional consequences also referred to as functional disorders 14 include longterm health consequences researchers have linked these functional impacts to longterm physical or sexual abuse they include gastrointestinal disorders chronic pain including pelvic pain chronic urinary tract infections and irritable bowel sy ndrome for

experiences rape or attempted rape during her lifetime17 surveys in some asian and subsaharan african countries have found high female mortality rates due to female infanticide and nutritional neglect of young girls18 many incidences of violence are not reported because of the shame and fear associated with being victim experts generally agree that current levels of violence reported through studies and national and local law enforcement records represent minimum of actual v aw cases rates of sex trafficking sexual violence in armed conflict situations female infanticide and violence in schools and the workplace for example are thought to be significantly underdocumented particularly in developing countries 19 underreporting may occur because victims view violence as normal or expected behavior additionally in certain circumstances it is difficult for researchers to collect data on v aw prevalence in conflict situations for example potentially dangerous and fluid conditions may affect the ability of researchers to gain access or create conditions conducive to victims coming forward in addition some communities particularly those in developing countries lack adequate law enforcement infrastructure and reporting services which may discourage women from reporting abuse 20 v aw can occur in the home as well as in public and private institutions including the workplace schools universities and state institutions custodial v aw which includes violence in prisons immigration detention centers social welfare institutions and jails is reported in many areas of the worldthough there is not enough to data to quantify its prevalence globally 21 moreover v aw in schools which can be perpetrated by teachers administrators and students is prevalent in developing countries particularly those in africa the middle east south asia and latin america22 in ecuador for example world bank study found that approximately 22 of women reported being sexually abused in school23 qualitative study in ethiopia found that harassment and sexual abuse contributed to low female enrollment rates and high dropout rates from secondary school24 continued see summary report who

marriage which is particularly prevalent in parts of the middle east and africa to be form of violence against women in such cases girls as young as 10 and 12 years old may be married to older men

socially acceptable in some cases they are encouraged by family members and the community many experts maintain that some of these practices are damaging to women they argue that these harmful traditional practices including fgc intimate partner violence and child marriage perpetuate unbalanced sex stereotypes and cycle of violence what constitutes harmful traditional practice however is matter of perspective in some cultures for instance both men and women may view violence as legitimate punishment for female disobedience and as traditional part of male female relationships 33 moreover some women may not view forced marital sex as rape or may endure frequent beatings from their husbands fathers sons or boyfriends because of cultural or familial legacies in addition some do not view child marriage as harmful traditional practice instead they see it as cultural tradition that should be respected in recent years some international advocates have increasingly argued that harmful traditional practices should be addressed through antiv aw programs34 they maintain that antiv aw efforts should focus not only on treatment and services for victims of violence but also on eliminating harmful traditional practices because some of these practices are often part of communitys culture however programs that introduce treatment and services may meet resistance some experts argue that harmful traditional practices cannot be significantly altered without sustained longterm efforts on the local level with national and international support finding the most appropriate balance and means of intervention is challenge that highlights broader debate with human rights and individual freedom on the one hand and the right to preserve culture group identity and tradition on the other 30 eliminating female genital mutilation an interagency statement world health organization 2008 p 4 available at httpwwwwhointreproductivehealthpublica tionsfgmfgm_statement_2008pdf for

partnership initiative mepi other bush administration initiatives with v aw components included the womens justice and empowerment initiative wjei and an initiative to respond to ongoing and widespread violence agai nst women and girls in darfur sudan37 most agencies do not track the cost or number of current antiv aw programs therefore it is unclear how much money the us government or

or the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases including hivaids women who become pregnant as result of rape may be more likely to undergo unsafe abortions attempt suicide or be beaten or killed by their partner 47 in some cultures an unmarried womans unintended pregnancy may trigger social isolation from family and friends women may also be killed by their spouses or other family membersthough there is limited data on the frequency of this phenomenon48 moreover when young girls are forced to marry and become sexually active and pregnant often through coercion they may experience complications during pregnancy that can result in death or longterm health problems such as obstetric fistula 49 v aw can cause psychological issues that may manifest physically women who are abused are more likely to use drugs and alcohol attempt suicide and suffer from nervous system disorders and posttraumatic stress syndrome50 2007 study found that 59 of women who were abused in the previous year suffered from psychological problems compared with 20 of women who did not experience any abuse51 moreover victims of rape intimate partner violence and child sex abuse were found to experience higher level of posttraumatic stress than victims of other types of violence 52 according to the population fund unfpa rape victims were nine times more likely to attempt suicide than nonvictims53 47 it has been suggested that womans fear of experiencing violence at the hand of her sexual partner may make her less likely to discuss or request contraceptives study in colombia f ound

have sex often unprotected with large numbers of partners and to work unsustainably long hours studies have found that trafficking occurs in every country and disproportionately affects women and girls the international labor organization ilo estimates women and girls account for 56 of victims in forced economic exploitation such as domestic service agricultural work and manufacturingand 98 of victims in forced commercial sexual exploitation 89 the vulnerability of women and girls is due to number of factors in source transit and destination countries90 many experts conclude that country is

and communities must strengthen the capacity of their political legal and law enforcement institutions in some countries for example legal and political institutions may hinder rather than help women seeking information assistance and protection from violence many experts maintain that addressing possible weaknesses in these institutions is especially crucial in some developing countries where national government infrastructures may be weakened by poverty corruption or other factors some have increasingly advocated the value of providing women with education and training to prevent and address violence and gender discrimination in both public and private life g20g142g149g138g157g142g141g561g23g495g21g495g561g3g140g157g146g159g146g157g146g142g156g561 the us government supports

short in duration and often not renewedmaking it challenge for programs to have substantive longterm impact some experts also suggest that when highlighting us efforts to combat v aw the us government places too much emphasis on prog rams with v aw components as opposed to programs solely addressing the issue this may create the appearance that the us government commits significant resources to

expressed concern that the us government does not adequately coordinate its antiv aw efforts many argue that in order to effectively combat v aw the us government should actively track its antiv aw programs and establish mechanisms that will identify potential gaps and weaknesses in us approaches some observers have reportedly found it difficult to assess the adequacy of us efforts in this area because of the lack of antiv aw program data collection coordination and analysis some have proposed that the government establish discrete office or coordinating body to address us efforts to address

contend that providing financial and technical support to international organizations that address v aw is particularly effective use of us resources they maintain that such cooperation benefits the united states because it allows the us government to share antiv aw related costs and resources with other governments and organizations opponents argue that the us government should focus on its own antiv aw initiatives and emphasize that activities addressing v aw for example may not always align with us priorities were congress to opt to use mechanisms to combat v aw there are number of programs and options that might be considered the united nations and its specialized agencies support range of programs to eliminate violence against women unifem for example administers the trust fund in support of actions to eliminate discrimination against women an interagency mechanism to fund and promote actions on violence against women in recent years some policymakers have recognized

political legislative and financial infrastructures to establish and maintain policies and programs to eliminate violence against women121 study on v aw for example found that 102 of the 192 member states lack domestic legal provisions addressing intimate partner violence such countries which may face other challenges such as poverty health epidemics and political unrest may not view combating v aw as policy priorityeither because they do not view it as significant problem or lack the resources to address it moreover in some cases national governments may pass laws that support antiv aw policies but ineffective legal political or law enforcement infrastructures may hinder their ability to implement and enforce laws and provide the necessary support services to be effective

of consensus may pose challenge for policymakers who determine funding levels for and implementation of antiv aw programs there is debate for example over where to draw the line between the need to protect womens rights and to preserve their freedom of choice122 moreover in the past some experts have disagreed on how to most effectively allocate scarce resources for antiv aw programs some maintained that antiv aw programs should focus on providing treatment services for v aw victims while others contended that programs should focus on prevention and the root causes of violence many experts have concluded however that the most effective antiv aw approaches address both prevention and treatment g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561g7g159g138g149g158g138g157g146g152g151g561 local national and international governments and ngos implement thousands of antivaw programs annually but few of these programs are evaluated for their effectiveness many anti v aw programs tend to be short in duration one to two years and have small budgets which some fear may leave little time and financial resources for evaluations123 consequently some argue experts and policymakers may have difficulty gauging programs effectiveness some believe that this may lead to scarce resources being allocated to programs with limited impact in recent years some analysts have increasingly recognized the importance of program evaluation and are taking steps to improve data collection instruments share existing best practices and improve coordination among funding and impl ementing organizations some experts have advocated for program donors and members of the policy community to provide additional funding for program evaluations when funding antiv aw projects and programs or providing technical assistance 124 121 document a61122add1 july 6 2007 p 23 122 drawn from document a61122add1 july 6 2007 p 24 paragraph 59 123 small program budgets may also not allow for collection of baseline data that is needed for comparative purposes furthermore there is generic evaluation method for vaw programs some experts maintain that programs addressing specific types of violence should have their own context and therefore be evaluated using different criteria 124 presentation by mary ellsberg path overview of evaluation and gbv promising practices in monitoring and evaluation of

different sampling techniques methodologies and criteria for defining v aw and conducting surveyswhich may lead to inconsistent and varied findings the lack of comparable data may present challenge to policymakers attempting to identify the scope of the problem and implement programs to address the issue some researchers and policymakers have recognized this and are actively working to streamline

many experts and policymakers have increasingly focused on the role of men and boys in preventing violence against women some ngos and governments have developed school curricula services and public

violence are more likely to contract hiv than those who are not leading some experts to conclude that there may be correlation between rates of hiv in women and violence130 reportedly women who experience or fear violence appear to be less likely to request or insist on using condoms during sexual encounters increasing their risk of hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases women who are raped are also more susceptible to contracting hiv due to vaginal and anal tearing g6g146g156g140g155g146g150g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g24g146g152g149g142g151g140g142g561 some experts have linked v aw to discrimination many in the international community view violence as form of discrimination against women and maintain that discrimination also causes violence131 to successfully combat v aw they contend equal attention should be paid to the causes and impacts of female discrimination women who are discriminated against because of their sex may not receive formal education or have access to healthcare in many societies women may not own property or have inheritance rights some analysts argue that these factors may contribute to an unequal power relationshi p

undertaken studies to determine the economic costs of violence against women though the results vary because of differing methodologies the studies generally found that the cost to society may be significant 132 canadian researchers for example estimated that the cost of damage incurred by v aw in canada is over 4 billion canadian dollars133 most studies analyze both longterm and shortterm cost variables such as treatment and services for women victims of violence including healthcare and legal costs and reduced employment and productivity levels because of violence against female employees some studies also address the economic impact of pain and suffering inflicted on women by violence though estimating the costs of such intangibles can present challenge to researchers 134 moreover many experts generally agree that because of v aws complex and wideranging impact on society it is likely that existing research underestimates the economic consequences of violence continued
