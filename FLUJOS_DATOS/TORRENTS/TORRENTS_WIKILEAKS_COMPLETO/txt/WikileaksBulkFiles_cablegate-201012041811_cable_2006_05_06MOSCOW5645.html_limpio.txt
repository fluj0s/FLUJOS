previous classified by ambassador william j burns reason 14 b d 1 c introduction chechnya has been less in the glare of constant international attention in recent years however the chechnya conflict remains unresolved and the suffering of the chechen people and the threat of instability throughout the region remain this message reinterprets the history of the chechen wars as means of better understanding the current dynamics the challenges facing russia the way in which the kremlin perceives those challenges and the factors limiting the kremlins ability to respond it draws on close observation on the ground and conversations with many participants in and observers of the conflict from the moment of chechnyas declaration of independence in 1991 we intend this message to spur thinking on new approaches to tragedy that persists as an issue within russia and between russia and the us europe and the islamic world summary 2 c president putin has pursued twopronged strategy to extricate russia from the war in chechnya and establish viable longterm modus vivendi preserving moscows role as the ultimate arbiter of chechen affairs the first prong was to gain control of the russian military deployed there which had long operated without real central control and was intent on staying as long as its officers could profit from the war the second prong was chechenization which in effect means turning chechnya over to former nationalist separatists willing to profess loyalty to russia there are two difficulties with putins strategy first while chechenization has been successful in suppressing nationalist separatists within chechnya it has not been as effective against the jihadist militants who have broadened their focus and are gaining strength throughout the north caucasus second as long as former separatist warlords run chechnya russian forces will have to stay in numbers sufficient to ensure that the exseparatists remain ex more broadly the suffering of an abused and victimized population will continue and with it the alienation that feeds the insurgency 3 c to deal effectively with chechnya in the long term putin needs to increase his control over the russian power ministries and reduce opportunities for them to profit from war corruption he needs to strengthen russian civilian engagement reinforcing the role of his plenipotentiary representative he needs to take broad approach to combat the spread of jihadism and not rely primarily on suppression by force in this context there is only limited role for the us but we and our allies can help by expressing our concerns to putin directing assistance to areas where our programs can slow the spread of jihadism and working with russias southern neighbors to minimize the effects of instability end summary the starting point problems of the russianized conflict 4 c chechnya was only one of the conflicts that broke out in the former soviet union at the time of the countrys collapse territorial conflicts most of them separatist erupted in nagornokarabakh transnistria south ossetia north ossetiaingushetia abkhazia and tajikistan russian troops were involved in combat in all of those conflicts sometimes clandestinely in all except nagornokarabakh russian troops remain today as peacekeepers russia doggedly insists on this presence and resists pulling its forces out its diplomatic efforts have served to keep the conflicts frozen with russian troops remaining in place 5 c why is this the charge is often made that russias motive for keeping the conflicts frozen is geostrategic or neoimperialism or fear of nato or revenge against georgia and moldova or quest to preserve leverage indeed the continued deployments may satisfy those russians who think in such terms and expand the domestic consensus for sending troops throughout the cis however while one or another of those factors may have been the original impulse each of the conflicts has gone through phases in which the conflicts perceived uses for the russian state have changed one of these factors has been continuous over the life of any of the conflicts 6 c we would propose an additional factor the determination of russias senior officer corps to remain deployed in those countries to engage in lucrative activity outside their official military tasks sometimes that moscow 00005645 002 of 010 activity has been as mercenaries for instance russian activeduty soldiers fought on both sides in the nagornokarabakh conflict from 199192 sometimes it has involved narcotics smuggling as in tajikistan selling arms to all sides has been longstanding tradition and sometimes it has meant collaborating with the mafias of both sides in conflict to facilitate contraband trade across the lines as in abkhazia and south ossetia the officers and their generals formed powerful bloc in favor of all the deployments especially under yeltsin 7 c this militaryentrepreneurial bloc soon formed an autonomous institution in some respects outside the governments control there are many illustrations of its autonomy for instance in 1993 yeltsin reached an agreement with georgia on peacekeeping in abkhazia when the georgian delegation arrived in sochi in september of that year to hammer out the details with russias generals they found the deal had changed when they protested that yeltsin had agreed to other terms russian general replied let the president sit in moscow drink vodka and chase women thats his business we are here and we have our work to do the secret history of the chechen war 8 c the lack of central control over the military as well as officers cupidity may have been prime cause of the first chechnya war immediately after the collapse of the soviet union energy prices in the ruble zone were 3 percent of world market prices government officials and their partners bought oil at ruble prices diverted it abroad and sold it on the world market the military joined in this arbitrage pavel grachev then defense minister reportedly diverted oil to western group of forces commander burlakov who sold it in germany 9 c chechnya was major entrepot for laundering oil for this arbitrage it appears to have been used both by the military including grachev and the khasbulatovrutskoy axis in the duma dudayev had declared independence but remained part of the russian elite chechnyas independence oilfields refineries and pipelines made chechnya perfect for laundering oil planes trains buses and roads and pipelines to chechnya were functioning allowing anyone and anything to transit except auditors in the early 1990s millions of tons of russian oil entered chechnya and were magically transformed into chechen oil to be sold on the world market at world prices some of the proceeds went to buy the chechens weaponry most of it from the russian military and another lucrative trade developed dudayev took much of his cut of the proceeds in weapons the groznyy bazaar was notorious in the early 1990s for the quantity and variety of arms for sale including heavy weaponry 10 c chechnya was the home of ruslan khasbulatov and served various purposes for his faction of the russian elite he took advantage of the armys independence from yeltsins control an informed source believes that it was khasbulatov not the official russian government who facilitated the transfer of shamil basayev and his heavilyarmed fighters from chechnya into abkhazia in 1992 and who ordered the russian air force to bomb sukhumi when shevardnadze went there to take personal command of the georgians last stand in july 1993 the yeltsin government always denied that it bombed sukhumi despite western eyewitness accounts confirming the bombing and the insignia on the planes given the confusion of those years it could well be that the order originated in the duma not the kremlin 11 c after khasbulatov and rutskoy were written out of the russian equation in october 1993 so was dudayev clandestine russian support for the chechen political and military opposition to dudayev began in the spring of 1994 according to participants when that proved ineffective russian bombing was deployed one dudayev opponent recounted that in 1994 russian pilot was given mission to fire missile into one of the topfloor corners of groznyys presidency building at time when dudayev was scheduled to hold cabinet meeting there not knowing groznyy the pilot asked which building to bomb and was told the tallest one he bombed residential apartment building when air power too proved ineffective russian troops were secretly sent in to reinforce the armed opposition dudayevs forces captured about dozen and put them on television and the russian invasion began shortly thereafter 12 c given the gangsterish background of the war it is surprise that the military conducted the war itself as profitmaking enterprise especially after the capture of moscow 00005645 003 of 010 groznyy by may 1995 an antidudayev chechen could lament when we invited the russian army in we expected an army not this band of marauders contraband trade in oil weapons including direct sales from russian military stores to the insurgents drugs and liquor plus protection for legitimate trade made military service in chechnya lucrative for those not on the front lines this profitability ended only with the august 1996 defeat of russian forces in groznyy at the hands of the insurgents and the subsequent russian withdrawal defeat made possible because the russian forces were hollowed out by their officers corruption and pursuit of economic profit 13 c before they lost this cashcow to their enemies russian officers went to great lengths to keep their friends from interfering with their profits on july 30 1995 the russians and the chechen insurgents signed ceasefire agreement mediated by the osce it would have meant the gradual withdrawal of russian forces enforcing the ceasefire was joint observation commission snk the head of the snk was general anatoliy romanov competent and upright officer very much rarity in chechnya after two months at this assignment he was severely injured by mine inside groznyy and has been hospitalized ever since informed observers believe romanovs own colleagues in the russian forces carried out this murder attempt the ceasefire never enforced broke down 14 c when the second war began in september 1999 russian forces again started profiteering from trade in contraband oil western eyewitnesses reported convoys of russian army trucks carrying oil leaving groznyy under cover of night eventually the russian forces reached an understanding with the insurgent fighters seeing one such convoy western reporter asked his guerrilla hosts whether the fighters ever attacked such convoys the leader replied they leave us alone and we leave them alone exit for putin 15 c sometime between one and two years after russian forces were unleashed for second time on chechnya putin appears to have realized that they were not going to deliver neat victory that failure would make putin look weak at home the human rights violations would estrange the west and the drain on the russian treasury would be punishing this was before the dramatic rise in energy prices putin could not negotiate peace with maskhadov he had already rejected that course and could not back down without appearing weak the khasavyurt accords that ended the first war were the result of defeat new set of accords would be seen as new defeat in any case the history of the war and the fate of general romanov made clear that negotiations without the subordination of the military were physical impossibility 16 c putin thus found himself without winning strategy and had to develop one he has taken twopronged approach one prong was subordinating the military the appointment of sergey ivanov as defense minister appears to have been aimed at subjecting the military to the control of the security services series of reassignments and firings is the surface evidence of the struggle to subordinate the military in chechnya southern military district commander troshev who led the 1999 invasion refused outright the first orders transferring him to siberia in november 2002 and went on television to publicize his mutiny he was finally removed in february 2003 chief of the defense staff kvashnin who had held the southern district command during the first chechen war hung on in combative relationship with ivanov for three years until he too was replaced in 2004 and also sent to siberia as the presidential representative in novosibirsk the spring 2005 dismissal of general viktor kazantsev putins plenipotentiary representative in the southern federal district was reportedly the final link in the chain military corruption and feeding at the trough of chechnya has not ended but the corruption has reportedly been institutionalized and more closely regulated in kremlincontrolled channels chechenization ahmadhaji kadyrov and the salafists 17 c the second prong of putins strategy was to hand the fighting over to chechens chechenization differs from vietnamization or iraqification in those strategies loyalist force is strengthened to the point at which it can carry on the fight itself chechenization in contrast has meant handing chechnya over to the guerrillas in exchange for their professions of loyalty the formal retention of chechnya within the russian federation and an uneasy moscow 00005645 004 of 010 cooperation with federal authorities that in practice is constantly renegotiated 18 c chechenization is associated with ahmadhaji kadyrov the insurgent commander and chief mufti of separatist chechnya after he defected to the russians putin put him in charge of the new russianinstalled chechen administration chechenization was reportedly agreed between kadyrov and putin personally but the seeds of the policy were sown by split in the insurgent ranks dating to the first war that split that took the form of religious dispute though it masked power struggle among warlords the split is the direct result of the introduction of new element arab forces espousing panislamic jihadist religious ideology 19 c the traditional islam of dagestan chechnya and ingushetia is based on sufism or islamic mysticism though nominally the sufi orders were the same as those predominant in central asia and kurdistan naqshbandi and qadiri sufism in the northeast caucasus took on unique form in the 18th19th century struggle against russian encroachment it is usually called muridism murids were armed acolytes of hieratic commander the murshid shaykh shamil the naqshbandi murshid who led the mountaineers resistance to the russians until his capture in 1859 was both spiritual guide and military commander he also exercised government powers the largest sufi branch vird in chechnya is the kuntahaji vird of the qadiris founded and led by the charismatic chechen missionary kuntahaji kishiyev until his exile by the russians in 1864 although the historical kuntahaji died two years later his followers believe that kuntahaji lives on in occultation like the shia twelfth imam 20 c when arab fighters joined the chechen conflict in 1995 they brought with them salafist doctrine that attempts to emulate the fundamental pure islam of the prophet muhammad and his immediate successors especially umar the second caliph it holds that mysticism is one of the impurities that crept into islam after the first four caliphs and considers sufis to be heretics and idolaters the idea that kuntahaji adepts could believe their founder is still alive and that they worship the grave of his mother is an abomination to salafis who believe that marked graves are form of pagan ancestor worship muhammads grave in arabia is not marked 21 c wahhabismbased forms of islam started appearing in chechnya by 1991 as chechens were able to travel and some went to saudi arabia for religious study but the true influx of salafis usually lumped together with wahhabis in russia came during the first chechen war in february 1995 fathi ali alshishani jordanian of chechen descent arrived in chechnya veteran of the war in afghanistan he was now too old to be combatant but was missionary for salafism he recruited another afghan veteran the saudi alkhattab to come to chechnya and lead group of arab fighters 22 c alkhattabs fighters were never major military factor during the war but they were the key to gulf money which financed power struggles in the interwar years alkhattab forged close links with shamil basayev the most famous chechen field commander basayev himself was from qadiri family but he was too sovietized to view islam as anything more than part of the chechen and caucasus identity in his early interviews basayev showed himself to be motivated by chechen nationalism not religion though he paid lipservice eg proclaiming sharia law in vedeno in early 1995 to attract gulf donors basayevs initial interest in alkhattab as indeed with other jihadists starting even before the first war was purely financial 23 c after the first war alkhattab set up camp in serzhenyurt baza kavkaz for military and religious indoctrination it provided one of the few employment opportunities for demobilized chechen fighters between the wars young chechens had traditionally engaged in seasonal migrant construction work throughout the soviet union but after the first war that was longer open to them the closed international borders also precluded smuggling another prewar source of employment and income the fighters had money jobs education skills save with their guns and prospects alkhattabs offer of food shelter and work was inviting as result between the wars salafism spread quickly in chechnya alkhattab also invited missionaries and facilitators who set up shop in chechnya dagestan and georgias pankisi gorge whose kist residents are close relatives of the chechens battle lines in peacetime moscow 00005645 005 of 010 24 c chechen society is distinguished by its propensity to unite in war and fragment in peace it is based on opposing dichotomies the vaynakh peoples are divided into chechens and ingush the chechens are divided into highlanders lameroi and lowlanders nokhchi and these are further divided into tribal confederations and exogamous tribes teyp and their subdivisions each unit will unite with its opposite to combat threat from outside two lowland teyps for example will drop quarrels and unite against an intruding highland teyp but left to themselves they will quarrel and split after the khasavyurt accords when russia left the chechens alone the wartime alliance between maskhadov and basayev split and the two became enemies other warlords lined up on one side or the other the yamadayev brothers of gudermes for example fighting pitched battle against basayev in 1999 but the rise of basayev and alkhattab undermined maskhadovs authority and prevented him from exercising any real power 25 c this power struggle took on religious expression since basayev was associated with alkhattab and salafism maskhadov positioned himself as champion of traditional sufism he surrounded himself with sufi shaykhs and appointed ahmadhaji kadyrov strong adherent of kuntahaji sufism as chechnyas mufti kadyrov had spent six years in uzbekistan allegedly at religious seminaries in tashkent and bukhara and seems to have developed links to other enemies of basayev including the yamadayevs 26 c the religious division dictated certain policies to each side the sufi tradition of maskhadov and kadyrov had been associated for over two centuries with nationalist resistance basayev with his newfound commitment to alkhattabs salafism adopted the salafi stress on panislamic community umma fighting worldwide jihad notionally without regard for ethnic or national boundaries alkhattab and basayev invaded dagestan in august 1999 avowedly in pursuit of caucasuswide revolt against the russians they brought on russian invasion that threw maskhadov out of groznyy chechenization begins 27 c the second russian invasion did not unite the chechens as previous pressure had perhaps the influence of alkhattab and his salafists as well as the devastation of the first war had rent the fabric of chechen society too much to restore traditional unity in the face of the outside threat we should also remember that unity is relative only small percentage of the chechens actually fought in the first war and many supported the russians out of disgust with dudayev kadyrov and the yamadayevs separately broke with maskhadov and defected to the russians kadyrov began to recruit from the insurgency nonsalafist nationalist fighters who were highly demoralized and disoriented by the disastrous retreat from groznyy in late 1999 kadyrov began to preach what kuntahaji had preached after the russian victory over imam shamil in 1859 to survive the chechens needed tactically to accept russian rule his message struck chord and fighters began to defect to his side 28 c putin appears to have stumbled upon kadyrov and their alliance seems to have grown out of chance as much as design but they were able to forge deal along the following lines kadyrov would declare loyalty to russia and deliver loyalty to putin he would take over maskhadovs place at the head of the russianblessed government of chechnya he would try to win over maskhadovs fighters to whom he could promise immunity he would govern chechnya with full autonomy without interference from russian officials below putins level and he would try to exterminate basayev and alkhattab 29 c if the objective of chechenization was to win over fighters who would carry on the fight against basayev and the arab successors to khattab who was poisoned in april 2002 it has to be judged success the real fighting has for several years been carried out by chechen forces who fight the war they want to fight not the one the russian military wants them to and who appear happy to kill russians when they get in the way the russian military is just trying to survive as one officer put it not all the promoscow chechen units are composed of former guerrillas saidmagomed kakiyev commander of the grucontrolled west battalion has been fighting dudayev and his successors since 1993 but at the heart of the promoscow effort are fighters who defected from the antimoscow insurgency the military overstays its welcome moscow 00005645 006 of 010 30 c the development of kadyrovs fighting force along with that of the yamadayev brothers left the stage clear for drawdown of russian troops certainly by early 2004 leaving aside permanent garrison presence but those troops still not fully responsive to fsb control did not want to leave especially now that chechens had taken over increasing parts of the security portfolio the russian officers were free to concentrate on their economic activities and in particular oil smuggling 31 c kadyrov could not be fully autonomous until he not the russians controlled chechnyas oil he therefore demanded the creation of chechen oil company under his jurisdiction that would have severely limited the ability of federal forces to divert and smuggle oil on may 9 2004 kadyrov was assassinated by an enormous bomb planted under his seat at the annual ve day celebration the killing was officially ascribed to chechen rebels but many believe it was the russian armys way of rejecting kadyrovs demand under the circumstances one cannot exclude that both versions are true in the reign of ramzan 32 c kadyrovs passing left power in the hands of his ramzan who was officially made deputy prime minister the president alu alkhanov was figurehead put in place because ramzan was underage the prime minister sergey abramov was tasked with interfacing between kadyrov and moscow below the level of putin 33 c ramzan kadyrov has none of the religious or personal prestige that his father had he is warlord pure and simple one of several like the yamadayev family of warlords he is lucky however in that his father left him sufficient fighting force of exrebels though they may have been lured away from the insurgency for variety of reasons it is money that keeps them kadyrov feels little need for ideological or religious prestige though he makes an occasional statement designed to appeal to muslims and makes point of supporting the pilgrimage to the tomb of kuntahajis mother in gunoy near vedeno though that is in part to show he is stronger than basayev whose home and power base are in the vedeno region kadyrov must only satisfy his troops who on occasion have shown that if offended or not given enough they are willing to desert along with their kinsmen and return to the mountains to fight against him he must also guard against the possibility as some charge that some of the fighters who went over to federal forces did so under orders from guerrilla commanders for whom they are still working 34 c kadyrov is also fortunate in that the fsb with whom he has close ties has by this time emasculated the military as prong one of putins strategy kadyrov has slowly but surely also taken over most of the spigots of money that once fed the army and like his father he has started agitating for overt control over chechnyas oil while prudently ensuring that others take the lead on that in public kadyrov is at least as corrupt as the military but the money he expropriates for himself from moscows subsidies is accepted as his payoff for keeping things quiet and indeed kadyrov and the other warlords are capable of maintaining certain degree of security in chechnya the showy reconstruction developments they have built in groznyy and their home towns demonstrate that the guerrillas cannot or at least do not halt construction and economic activity moreover there is enough security to end putins worries about secessionist victory that has allowed putin to demonstrate new willingness to be increasingly overt in support of separatism in other conflicts eg abkhazia transnistria when that advances russian interests 35 c despite its successes to date however putins strategy is far from completed he still needs to keep forces in the region as constant reminder to kadyrov not to backtrack on his professed loyalty to the kremlin ideally that force would be small but capable of intervening effectively in chechen internal affairs that is unrealistic at present the current forces reportedly over 25000 are bunkered and corrupt when they venture on patrol they are routinely attacked one attempt to redress this is to position russian forces close but over the horizon in dagestan where major military base is under construction at botlikh however that may only add to the instability of dagestan duma deputy from the region told us that locals are vehemently opposed to the new military base despite the economic opportunities it represents on grounds that the soldiers will corrupt the morals of their children moscow 00005645 007 of 010 36 c another approach is the chechenization of the federal forces themselves recently north and south battalions of ethnically chechen special forces drawn from kadyrovs militia were created to supplement the east and west battalions of sulim yamadayev and saidmagomed kakiyev those formations are officially part of the russian army the kremlin strategy appears to be to check kadyrov by promoting warlords he cannot control and to check the fsb from becoming too clientized by allowing the mod to retain sphere of influence in chechnya that is recipe for open fighting we saw one small instance of that on april 25 when bodyguards of kadyrov and chechen president alkhanov got into firefight according to one insider the clash originated in kadyrovs desire to get rid of alkhanov who now has close ties with yamadayev what can we expect in the future 37 c the chechen population is the great loser in this game it bears an ever heavier burden in shakedowns opportunity costs from misappropriation of reconstruction funds and the constant trauma of victimization and abuse including abduction torture and murder by the armed thugs who run chechnya reftels security under those circumstances is fragile veneer and stability an illusion the insurgency can continue indefinitely at low level and without prospects of success but significant enough to serve as pretext for the continued rule of thuggery 38 c the insurgency will remain split between those who want to carry on maskhadovs nonsalafist struggle for national independence and those who follow the salafiinfluenced basayev in his pursuit of caucasuswide caliphate but the nationalists have been undercut by kadyrov despite sadullayevs efforts the insurgency inside chechnya is not likely to meet with success and will continue to become more salafist in tone 39 c prospects would be poor for the nationalists even if kadyrov andor yamadayev were assassinated and there is much speculation that one will succeed in killing the other goaded on by the fsb which supports kadyrov and the gru which supports yamadayev the thousands of guerrillas who have joined those two militias have by now lost all ideological incentive since they already run the country they feel themselves not the russians to be the masters and are not responsive to sadullayevs nationalist calls basayevs salafist message has even less appeal to them even if their current leaders are eliminated all they will need is new warlord easily generated from within their organizations and they can continue on their current paths 40 c we expect that salafism will continue to grow the insurgents even inside chechnya are reportedly becoming predominantly salafist as opposition on narrowly nationalist basis offers less hope of success salafis will come both from inside chechnya where militia excesses outrage the population and from elsewhere in the caucasus where radicalization is proceeding rapidly as result of the repressive policies of russias regional satraps there are numerous eyewitness accounts from both dagestan and kabardinobalkaria that elite young adults and university students are joining salafist groups in one case terrorist killed in dagestan was found recently to have defended his doctoral dissertation at moscow state university on wahhabism in the north caucasus these young adults denied economic opportunities turn to religion as an outlet they find however that representatives of the traditional religious establishments in these republics long isolated under the thumb of soviet restrictions are illeducated and illprepared to deal with the sophisticated theological arguments developed by generations of salafists in the middle east most of those who join fundamentalist jamaats do not of course become terrorists but percentage do and with that steady source of recruits the major battlefield could shift to outside chechnya with armed clashes in other parts of the north caucasus and continuation of sporadic but spectacular terrorist acts in moscow and other parts of russia 41 c outside chechnya the most likely venue for clashes with authorities is dagestan putins imposition of power vertical there has upset the delicate clan and ethnic balance that offered shaky stability since the collapse of soviet power he installed president the weak mukhu aliyev in place of 14member multiethnic presidential council aliyev will be unable to prevent ruthless struggle among the elite the local way of elaborating new balance of power this is already happening with assassinations of provincial chiefs since aliyev took over moscow 00005645 008 of 010 in one province in the south of the republic an uprising against the chief appointed by aliyevs predecessor was suppressed by gunfire four demonstrators were shot dead initiating cycle of blood revenge in may in two dagestani cities security force operations against terrorists resulted in major shootouts with victims among the bystanders and whole apartment houses rendered uninhabitable after hits from the security forces heavy weaponry it is not clear whether the terrorists were really religious activists whenever they want to eliminate someone they call him wahhabi the mp from makhachkala told us but the populace seeing the deadly overreaction of the security forces is feeling sympathy for their victims so much so that aliyev has had to make public condemnations of the actions of the security forces if this chaos deepens as appears likely the jihadist groups jamaats may grow drift further in basayevs direction and feel the need to respond to attacks from the local government 42 c local forces are unreliable in such cases for clan and bloodfeud reasons wahhabist jamaats flourished in the strategic ethnically dargin districts of karamakhi and chabanmakhi in the mid1990s but dagestans rulers left them alone because moving against them meant altering the delicate ethnic balance between dargins and avars only when the jamaats themselves became expansive during the basayevkhattab invasion from chechnya in the summer of 1999 did the makhachkala authorities take action and then only with the assistance of federal forces ultimately if clashes break out on wide scale in dagestan moscow would have to send in the federal army deploying the army to combat destabilization in dagestan however could jeopardize putins hardwon control over it unleashing the army against terrorist threat is just that allowing the army off its new leash largescale army deployments to dagestan would be especially attractive to the officers since the border with azerbaijan offers lucrative opportunities for contraband trade the armys presence in turn would further destabilize dagestan and all but guarantee chaos 43 c indeed destabilization is the most likely prospect we see when we look further down the road to the next decade chechenization allows bellicose chechen leaders to throw their weight around in the north caucasus even more than an independent chechnya would case in point is the call on april 24 by chechen parliament speaker dukvakha abdurakhmanov for unification of chechnya ingushetia and dagestan implicitly under chechen domination the one million chechens would constitute plurality in the new republic of 45 million the call soured slowly normalizing relations between chechnya and ingushetia according to chechen official in moscow though the dagestanis treated the proposal as joke what should putin be doing 44 c right now putins policy towards chechnya is channeled through kadyrov and yamadayev putins plenipotentiary representative polpred for the southern federal district dmitriy kozak appears to have little influence he was not even invited when putin addressed the new parliament in groznyy last december putin needs to stop taking kadyrovs phone calls and start working more through his polpred and the governments special services he also needs to increase moscows civilian engagement with chechnya 45 c putin should continue to reform the military and the other power ministries having asserted control through sergey ivanov putin has denied the military certain limited areas in which it had pursued criminal activity but left most of its criminal enterprises untouched he has done little if anything to form the discipline of modern army deployable to impose order in unstable regions such as the north caucasus recent hazing incidents show that discipline is still equated with sadism and brutality the ministry of internal affairs mvd has undergone even less reform the chechenization of the security services despite its obvious drawbacks has shown that locals can carry out security tasks more effectively than russian troops 46 c lastly putin should realize that his current policy course is not preventing the growth of militant armed jihadism rather every time his subordinates try to douse the flames the fire grows hotter and spreads farther putin needs to check the firehose he may find they are spraying the fire with gasoline he needs to work out credible strategy employing economic and cultural levers to deal with the issue of armed jihadism some russians do get it an advisor to kozak gave lecture recently that showed he understands in great detail the issues surrounding the growth moscow 00005645 009 of 010 of militant jihadism kozak himself made clear in recent conversation with the ambassador that he appreciates clearly the deep social and economic roots of russias problems in the north caucasus and the need to employ more than just security measures to solve them we have not however seen evidence that consciousness of the true problem has yet made its way to moscow from kozaks office in rostovondon 47 c we need also to be aware that putins strategy is generating backlash in moscow ramzan kadyrovs excesses his putingiven immunity from federal influence and the special laws that apply to chechnya alone such as the exemption of chechens from military service elsewhere in russia are leading to charges by some moscow observers that putin has allowed chechnya facto to secede putin is strong enough to weather such criticism but the ability of successor to do so is less clear is there role for the us 48 c russia does not consider the us friend in the caucasus and our capacity to influence russia whether by pressure persuasion or assistance is small what we can do is continue to try to push the senior tier of russian officials towards the realization that current policies are conducive to jihadism which threatens broader stability as well and that shifting the responsibility for victimizing and looting the people from corrupt brutal military to corrupt brutal locals is not longterm solution 49 c making headway with putin or his successor will require close cooperation with our european allies they like the russians tend to view the issue through strictly counterterrorism lens the british for example link their dialogue with islam closely with their counterterrorist effort on which they liaise with the russians reinforcing the conception of monolithic muslim identity predisposed to terrorism that reinforces the russian view that the problem of the north caucasus can be consigned to the terrorism basket and that finding solution means in the first instance finding better way to kill terrorists 50 c we and the europeans need to put our proposals of assistance to the north caucasus in different context one that recognizes the role of religion in north caucasus cultures but also emphasizes our interest in and support for the nonreligious aspects of north caucasus society including civil society this last will need exceptional delicacy as the russians and the local authorities are convinced that the us uses civil society to foment color revolutions and antirussian regimes there is danger that our civil society partners could become what churchill called the inopportune missionary who despite impeccable intentions sets back the larger effort that need not be the case 51 c our interests call for an understanding of the context and positive emphasis we cannot expect the russians to react well if we limit our statements to condemnations of kadyrov butcher though he may be we need to find targeted areas in which we can work with the russians to get effective aid into chechnya at the same time we need to be on our guard that our efforts do not appear to constitute us support for kremlin or local policies that abuse human rights we must also avoid shift that endorses the kremlin assertion that there is longer humanitarian crisis in chechnya which goes handinhand with the russian request that the and its donors end humanitarian assistance to the region and increase technical and recovery assistance we and other donors need to maintain balance between humanitarian and recovery assistance 52 c aside from the political optic rush to cut humanitarian assistance before recovery programs are fully up and running would leave vacuum into which jihadist influences would leap the european commission humanitarian organization the largest provider of aid shows signs of rushing to stress recovery over humanitarian assistance we should not follow suit humanitarian assistance has been effective in relieving the plight of chechen idps in ingushetia it has been less effective inside chechnya where the gor and kadyrov regime built temporary accommodation centers for returning idps but have not passed on enough resources to secure reasonable standard of living international organizations are hampered by limited access to chechnya out of security concerns but where they are able to operate freely they have made great difference eg whos immunization program 53 c resources aimed at chechnya often wind up in private pockets though international assistance has better record moscow 00005645 010 of 010 than russian assistance and is more closely monitored we must also be wary of assistance that lends itself to massive corruption and statesponsored banditry in chechnya too much of the money loaned in microfinance program there for example would be expropriated by militias presidential advisor aslakhanov told us last december that kadyrov expropriates for himself one third off the top of all assistance therefore while we continue wellmonitored humanitarian assistance inside chechnya we should broaden our efforts for recovery to other parts of the region that are threatened by jihadism dagestan kabardinobalkaria ingushetia and possibly karachayevocherkessia among these we need to try to steer our assistance 115 million for fy 2006 to regional officials such as president kanokov of kabardinobalkaria who have shown that they are willing to introduce local reforms and get rid of the brutal security officials whose repressive acts feed the jihadist movement 54 c we also need to coordinate closely with kozak or his successor both to strengthen his position visvis the warlords and to ensure that everything we do is perceived by the russians as transparent and not aimed at challenging the gors hold on troubled region the present opposite perception by the gor may be behind its reluctance to cooperate with donors the and ifis on longterm strategic engagement in the region for example the gor has delayed for months 20millioneuro tacis program designed with gor input 55 c the interagency paper us policy in the north caucasus the way forward provides number of important principles for positive engagement we need to emphasize programs in accordance with those principles which are most practical under current and likely future conditions and which can be most effective in targeting the most vulnerable where federal and local governments lack the will and capacity to assist and in combating the spread of jihadism both inside chechnya and throughout the north caucasus region there are areas for example health care and child welfare in which assistance fits neatly with russian priorities containing both humanitarian and recovery components 56 c we can also emphasize programs that help create jobs and job opportunities microfinance where feasible credit cooperatives and small business development and educational exchanges us sponsored training programs for credit cooperatives and government budgeting functions have been very popular exchanges through the ivp program and community connections are an especially effective way of exposing future leaders to the world beyond the narrow propaganda they have received and to generate multiplier effect in enterprise in addition to the effects the programs themselves can have in providing alternatives to religious extremism such assistance can also have demonstration effect showing the russians that improved governance and delivery of services can be more effective in stabilizing the region than attempts to impose order by force 57 c lastly we need to look ahead in our relations with azerbaijan and georgia to ensure that they become more active and effective players in helping to contain instability in the north caucasus that will serve their own security interests as well salafis need connections to their worldwide network strengthening border forces is more important than ever azerbaijan especially is well placed to trade with dagestan and chechnya the ethnic azeris lezghis and avars living on both sides of the azerbaijandagestan border and friendly relations between russia and azerbaijan are tools for promoting stability conclusion 58 c the situation in the north caucasus is trending towards destabilization despite the increase in security inside chechnya the steps we believe putin must take are those needed to reverse that trend and the efforts we have outlined for ourselves are premised on desire to promote lasting stabilization built on improved governance more active civil society and steps towards democratization but we must be realistic about russias willingness and ability to take the necessary steps with or without our assistance real stabilization remains low probability sound policy on chechnya is likely to continue to founder in the swamp of corruption kremlin infighting and succession politics much more probable is new phase of instability that will be felt throughout the north caucasus and have effects beyond burns
