restrictions including within the cuban american community the president maintained that such restrictions would prevent the regime from exploiting hard currency of tourists and remittances to cubans to prop up their repressive regime 5 supporters of the tightened restrictions argued that both educational and family travel to cuba had become fronts for tourist travel tightening up on such travel th ey argued would deny the regime with dollars that help maintain its repressive control according to the commission for assistance for free cuba some 125000 family visits to cuba in 2003 resulted in about 96 million in hard currency for the government 6 another argument made by some supporters of the tightened restrictions is that the limiting of family travel to once every three years helps ensure that such travel is limited to family emergencies along these lines some argue that limiting family travel makes travelers more sensitive to political repression on the island and highlights that cuban americans are political refugees not economic immigrants some supporters of the additional remittance restrictions argue that the bush administration demonstrated continuation of the compassionate policy of supporting the cuban people by not cutting the level of remittances allowed 300 per quarter they emphasize that the administration only took action to ensure that the remittances would be restricted to immediate family member s and not benefit certain members of the cuban government and cuban communist party opponents of the tightened travel and remittance restrictions make number of policy arguments they maintain the restrictions are antifamily and threaten the basic principle of family reunification some in the cuban american community argue that the policy of restricting family visits is inhumane and will only result in more suffering for cuban families they especially oppose the additional restrictions that do not allow travel to visit cousins aunts uncles and more distant relatives another argument opposing restrictions on travel and private remittances is that the steps will have effect on reducing repression in cuba or weakening the governments instruments of repression opponents of the tightened restrictions maintain that the new restrictions are opposed by several prominent cuban dissidents including oswaldo paya of the varela project and elizardo sanchez of the c uban commission for human rights and national reconciliation miriam leiva one of the founders of the ladies in white human rights group maintains that the policy

what we need is to create space for dialogue8 there were also concerns that the new restrictions were drafted without considering the full consequences of their implementation for example the

has increased considerably under the bush administration the major agencies involved in enforcing the travel restrictions include the treasury departments ofac which in addition to licensing travelers and licensing and monitoring travelservice providers also investigates suspected travel violations and imposes civil fines the department of homeland security s customs and border protection cbp which inspects passengers to and from cuba and screens passengers on other international flights for compliance with us travel restrictions and the department of justice which prosecutes criminal violations

president noted the importance of upholding and enforcing the law in order to prevent among other things unlicensed and excessive travel and to ensure that humanitarian and cultural exchanges actually reach prodemocracy activists in cuba 24 on october 10 2003 president bush instructed the department of homeland security to enforce the trade and travel embargo more strictly as result the cbps

large religious organizations which solicited participation in trips to cuba beyond their own organizations as result ofac implemented new policy of more tightly restricting the licenses of larger national religious organizations previously these organizations were licensed under section 515566a of the cacr without restriction on the number of trav elers or the frequency of trips under the new policy larger religious organizations are now required to obtain license under the more restrictive section 515566b of the cacr which as of march 31 2005 limits trips to four per year one per quarter each of which are limited to 25 individuals smaller religious organizations such as individual churches and congregational units may continue to apply for specific license under section 515566a which does not limit the number of travelers or trips under the license more than 100 members of congress sent letter to the treasury department in march 2006 questioning ofacs actions that further restricted religious travel to cuba church groups such as church world service the national council on churches american baptist churches usa the alliance for baptists and the presbyterian church have

that the secretary of homeland security direct cbp to reevaluate its level of resources dedicated to inspecting passengers from cuba at the miami international airport and 2 that the treasury

who argue in favor of lifting restrictions on travel to cuba contend that the travel ban hinders us efforts to influence political and economic conditions in cuba supporters of change in cuba travel policy argue that us support for democracy in latin america has been augmented by persontoperson contact and exchanges the exception to democracy in the region is cuba where the united states continues to maintain policy of isolation they argue that the best way to realize change in cuba is to lift restrictions allowing flood of us citizens to travel and engage in conversations with average cubans they point to the influence of personto person contact in russia and eastern european nations which they argue ultimately helped lead to the fall of communism in the soviet bloc they maintain that restricting travel by ordinary americans prevents interaction and information ex changes with ordinary cubans exchanges that can help break down the cuban governments tight control and manipulation of news that the current travel ban actually supports the cuban government in its efforts to restrict information provided to the cuban people and that it in effect supports castros totalitarian control over cuba second argument made by those who want to lift travel restrictions is that the ban abridges the rights of ordinary americans to travel they argue that the us government should not be requiring cuban americans to apply for license to travel more than once year to visit sick or dying family members they contend that such restrictions on the right to travel subvert the first amendment right of free speech those in favor of lifting the travel ban also argue that us citizens can travel to other communist or authoritarian governments around the world such as the peoples republic of china vietnam burma and iran they point out that americans could travel to the soviet union before its breakup supporters of changing travel policy towa rd cuba argue that their proposals would still allow the president to prohibit such travel in times of war or armed hostilities or if there were imminent danger to the health or safety of americans they argue that these conditions do not exist with regard to cuba and point to may 1998 defense intelligence agency report that concluded that cuba does not pose significant military threat to the us or to other countries in the region 33 those arguing for lifting travel restrictions also point to human rights activists in cuba who themselves argue for the lifting of such sanctions according to the prominent cuban human rights activist elizardo sanchez the more americans on the streets of cuban cities the better for the cause of more open society in cuba34 supporters of lifting the travel ban maintain that such move would not lift the underlying us embargo on trade and financial transactions with cuba they point to the 197782 period when the travel ban was essentially lifted but the overall embargo remained in place finally some supporters of lifting the travel restrictions argue that the us economy would benefit from increased demand for air and cruise travel which reportedly would expand us economic output according to report prepared for the center for international policy policy 33 defense intelligence agency report on cuban threat to us national security may 6 1998 34 congressional record july

those favoring the continuation of current restrictions on travel to cuba point out that there are already significant provisions in us law perm itting americans to travel there for legitimate reasons that support the cuban people and not the cuban government they point out that thousands of americans travel to cuba legally under the various provisions of the cuban embargo regulations many of whom are cuban american s visiting family members other categories of travel allowed include students journalists researchers artists musicians and athletes second argument made for maintaining current restrictions on travel to cuba is that lifting the travel ban entirely will open the floodgates to american tourist travel that will support castros rule by providing his government with millions in tourist receipts advocates of restricting travel oppose any loosening that could prolong the cast ro regime by propping it up with increased income in contrast to those supporting tourist travel they believe that continued travel restrictions will help influence cubas policy they argue that since the collapse of the soviet union and the loss of soviet subsidies to cuba the travel and embargo regulations have contributed to castros decision to cut the militarys size and budget by half since 1989 and to introduce limited economic reforms lifting travel restrictions they argue would eliminate the us leverage on cuba to enact further reforms those favoring the maintenance of current travel restrictions argue that the reality of the human rights situation dispels the notion that american tourists would be engaging in exchanges with ordinary cubans they maintain that the thousand s of european canadian and other tourists who travel to cuba each year largely stay in tourist hotels that are off limits to most cubans and thus have discernable effect on the human rights situation in cuba some opposed to lifting travel restrictions argue that there should be tourist travel as long as cuba provides refuge to violent criminals who have escaped us justice the state department maintains that more than 70 fugitives from us justice are hiding out in cuba including convicted murderer joanne chesimard who killed new jersey state trooper in 1973 finally many opponents of legislation to lift the cu ba travel restrictions argue that the authority to impose such restrictions is an important fore ign policy tool for the president they point out that the president has the authority to restrict travel when it is in the national security or foreign policy interests of the united states and has utiliz ed that policy tool when needed they point to past instances of restricting travel to libya vietnam and north korea with regard to cuba they point to the 1984 supreme court decision in the case of regan v wald that upheld restrictions on travel to cuba imposed by the reagan administration 35 the impact on the us economy of lifting restrictions on travel to cuba the

the housesenate conference on the bill hrept 107253 during senate floor debate senator byron dorgan noted that he had intended to offer an amendment on the issue but that he decided not to because he did not want to slow passage of the bill he indicated that he would support the house provision during conference but ultimately however the housesenate conference report on the bill did not include the cuba provision in light of the changed congressional priorities in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks on new york and washington conference negotiators reportedly did not want to slow

cuba sanctions amendments including one on the easing of travel restrictions offered by representative jeff flake the house approved the flake travel amendment hamdt 552 by vote of 262167 that would provide that funds could be used to administer or enforce the treasury department regulations with respect to travel to cuba the flake amendment would not prevent the issuance of general or specific licenses for travel to cuba some observers raised the question of whether the effect of this amendment would be limited since the underlying embargo regulations restricting travel would remain unchanged enforcement action against violations of the relevant embargo regulations could potentially take place in future years when the treasury department appropriations measure did not include the funding limitations on enforcing the travel restrictions 42 during consideration of hr 5120 the house so rejected two cuba amendments rangel amendment hamdt 555 rejected by vote of 204226 would have prevented any funds in the bill from being used to implement administer or enforce the overall economic embargo of cuba which includes travel goss amendment hamdt 551 rejected by vote of 182247 would

congress that certain conditions were met regarding biological weapons and terrorism 43 the rule for the bills consideration hres 488 hrept 107585 had provided that the goss amendment would not be

department ap propriations measure s 2740 as reported by the senate committee on appropriations on july 17 2002 srept 107212 included provision in section 516 that was similar although not identical to the flake amendment described above it provided that funds may be used to enforce the treasury department regulations with respect to any travel or travel related transactions but would not prevent ofac from issuing general and specific licenses for travel to cuba in addition section 124 of the senate bill stipulated that treasury department funds for departmental offices salaries and expenses may be used by ofac until ofac has certain procedures in place to expedite license applications for travel to cuba congress did not complete action on the fy2003 treasury department appropriations

completed by the 106th congress relating to cuba tr avel involved tightening of travel restrictions the final version of the fy2001 agriculture appropriations measure pl 106 387 title ix trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 included provision that restricts travel to cuba to those categories of nontourist travel already allowed by the treasury department regulations section 910 of the law provides that neither general nor specific licenses for travel to cuba can be provided for activities that do not fit into the 12 categories expressly authorized in the cuban assets control regulations section 515560 of title 31 cfr paragraphs 1 through 12 as noted in the law the secretary of the treasury may not authorize travelrelated transactions for travel to from or within cuba for tourist activities which are defined as any activity that is not expressly authorized in the 12 categories of the regulations the provision prevents the administration from loosening the travel restrict ions to allow tourist travel this in effect strengthens restrictions on travel to cuba and somewhat circumscribes the authority of ofac to issue specific travel licenses on casebycase basis under section 515560 b of title 31 cfr ofac in the past has utilized that section to provide specific licenses for activities that do not fit neatly within the categories of travel set forth in 515560 including such travel for medical evacuations of americans legally in cuba and for us contractors servicing the needs of the us interests section regulations implementing the provision of the law were issued by ofac on july 12 2001
