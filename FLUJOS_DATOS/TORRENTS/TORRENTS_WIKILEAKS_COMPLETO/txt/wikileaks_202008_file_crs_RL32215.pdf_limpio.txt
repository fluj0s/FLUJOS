issue of overtime pay in the 108th congress numerous bills were introduced that would have altered the current system of overtime pay protec tion administrative rulemaking in this area by the department of labor dol also sparked legislative initiatives this report briefly examines the various proposals legislative and administrative and tracks their status in general the flsa enacted in 1938 nd variously modified through the years requires that employers pay workers 1½ times their regular rate of pay timeanda half for hours worked in excess of 40 pe r week the act imposes ceiling upon the number of hours an employee can be required to work but for those hours worked in excess of 40 per week rate of timeandahalf must be paid within single workweek any arrangement of wor khours is permitted including flexible and compressed scheduling and shifting wo rkhours from one day to another penalty is imposed unless the total number of hours worked exceeds 40 in single week through the years the overtime pay requirement of the flsa has been contentious some employers seeking to keep labor costs to minimum have resisted payment of overtime rates and of minimum wage s also required under the flsa proposals to alter the overtime pa requirement at least during recent years have often been pres ented in terms of flexibility of modernization of an old and dated statute and family friendly workplace supporters of overtime pay point to humane concerns the opportunity for employees to rest learn rear familie s and participate in the democratic process to the hazard s of long hours of work that may endanger both individual workers and the general public and to the need to spread available work during periods of economic downturn workers also benefit from the higher earnings resulting from the overtime pay penalty imposed on employers the general requirements of the flsa are modified by seri of exemptions proposal by dol to restructure the s ection 13a1 exemption

continued the workweek on an 80 hour biweekly basis and b flexible credit hours program banking of overtime hours workedintroduction the flsa is an umbrella statute that deals with series of labor standards issues these fall roughly into three categories first minimum wage section 6 of the act second overtime pay s ection 7 and third child labor section 12 section 3 of the act defines the concepts used throughout the statute and thereby limits or qualifies its wage hour and child labor provisions section 13 provides body of exemp tions andor special wagehour treatment for segments of industry andor groups of workers while the act is often treated as an integrated unit it can also be approached in terms of its th ree major components or subunits of each under the flsa congress has establis hed basic workweek generally 40 hours and has mandated payment of overtime rates 1½ times workers regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week for flsa purposes each workweek is treated as separate selfcontained unit within that unit any arrangement of hours is pe rmitted with the employe rs permission workhours arrangements can be mandated unilaterally or the decision can be shared either informally or through collective bargaining but the decision rests with the employer taking into consideration the requirements of the work to be performed many questions have been raised with respect to overtime pay how should the overtime pay requirements of the act be structured under current law are such requirements sufficiently flexible s hould workhours regulati on and overtime pay requirements be in effect core labor standard associated with employment protecting employees from overwork and abuse and if the overtime pay penalty levied against employers is intended to discourage overwork and abuse should workers classified as executive adminis trative or professional be exempt from such protection how ought such concepts as executive administrative andor professional be defined to what extent should the overtime pay requirement be modified by economic considerations within particular industrie s when calculating workers regular rate for overtime pay purposes eg 1½ times workers regular rate should only the base rate be taken into account how should bonuses or incentive pay be treated for such calculations such issues have been the focus of recent legislative proposals this report deals only with overtime pay unless another aspect of the act notably minimum wage is joined with the overtime pay requirement other components of the flsa are described nd analyzed in separate crs products evolution of workhours regulation where workers are covered under flsa overtime pay provisi ons section 7 of the act an employer must pay his employee 1½

example worker with employer pe rmission can take off 2 hours on tuesday and work 2 hours extra on friday what the work er normally cannot do is move hours of work from one week to another flexibility is within the context of the 40hour work week 5 state laws may and often do provide somewhat different standards normally the higher standard that most beneficial to the worke r takes precedence further higher wage and hour overtime pay standards may result from collective bargaining agreements however the requirements of the flsa may not be reduced through collective bargaining 6 for general overview see marion c cahill shorter hours study of the movement since the civil war new york columbia university press 1932 7 the rationale for workhours regulation is disc ussed in shorter hour s for men as public continuedtimeandahalf for hours worked in exce ss of weekly standard now 40 hours exceptions have been built into the act responding both to economics and to public policy concerns when considering the overtime pay requirements of the act several elements ought to be kept in mind first there is daily limitation under the flsa upon the number of hours that can be worked by an employee just weekly standard3 second there is legal cap on the number of hours person can work within week so long as the worker is paid at least timeandahalf for those hours worked in excess of 40 third the act allows flexibility within the context of 40 hour workweek any daily arrangement of workhour s is permitted ie five days of 8 hours each four days of 10 hours each two days of 20 hour s each etc and if the employer allows it worker can make use of comp time option within the context of 40hour workweek4 the alternative work hoursflexibility option rests with the employer5 in most

achieved through restraints upon the hours of work eg overtime pay requirements seem more desirable various legislative initiatives daily hours restrictions 30 hour workweek etc were urged until in 1938 congress adopted the fair labor st andards act under the flsa congress dropped the concept of daily hours restraints and opted instead for what would become 40hour standard workweek8 by the end of world war ii the 40hour workweek had largely become the norm periodically organized labor suggested further reduction but change was effecte d in the late 1970s final campaign for shorter workweek was initiated but following three days of hearings by the house subcommittee on labor standards in 1979 the campaign gradually ended9 with the passage of time fewer persons were employed who had directly experienced the economic turmoil of the gr eat depression for younger workers the wagehour protections afforded by the flsa came increasingly to be taken as given they had become standard and

through the 105th congress by william g whittaker archived report available from the author 77759been commenced for humanization of the worldofwork and for flexibility 10 in legislative form the initiative was twofold alternative work scheduling for federal employees and workhours flexibility for empl oyees of state and local governments in the private sector significant number of employers instituted flexible and compressed scheduling both as benefit for their employees and because it seemed useful tool for structuring work in 1978 congress passed legislation that provided for increasing parttime work opportunities in the federal sector an op tion thought to be favored by working mothers and separately llowed flexible and compre ssed workhours in federal agencies these meas ures permitted wide variati on in workhours structuring and flexibility but they did so within the c ontext of federal civ il service law and under the general oversight of the congress11 beginning in 1966 state and local gove rnment employees had gradually been brought under the flsa but these extensions of coverage had been litigated and it was not until the supreme courts decision in garcia v san antonio metropolitan transit authority 469 us 528 1985 that the issue was decided like some private sector employers state and local governments had resist ed coverage and had argued that if the statute were applied without modification th public agencies and by extension the public would suffer fina ncially thus in late 1985 after the garcia decision congress adopted special legisla tion allowing state and local government employers to utilize comp time opti on congress also set forth detailed conditions under which the option might be imp lemented as in the case of federal workers the implementing agencies were normally permanent entities were governed by civil service regulations and were under genera l oversight of legislative body12 policy and structure some viewed the movement for alternative work scheduling as an erosion of labor standards that had been developed through years of bargaining and legislative effort others however argued that the changing character of work and of the workforce had rendered the wagehour ws of the 1930s obsolete that the requirements of 1930s legisl ation should longer be regarded as inviolate flexibility became the new byword and almo st immediately the question washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32215crs8 13 some have argued that public and private work environments are essentially different the former are stable for the most part and employees work within the context of civil service rules and under legislative oversight in the private sector employeremployee relations are diverse in some cases employment is stable work patterns carefully structured and trade union influence may be str ong but in others employee turnover may be high employers may easily move in and out of business and the general context may be determinedly nonunionraised if flexibility is appropriate for federal and state and local public employees why not extend it to workers in the private sector13 in the context of the flsa overtime pay requirements were viewed by congress as penalty that imposed cost upon empl oyers in order to encourage them not to schedule workhours in excess of 40 per week they were intended to have cost for employers the require ment or penalty wa s not considered mechanism to raise the wages of workers though it may have had that effect where employers have found it opport une to pay timeandahalf rather than to hire additional workers for some workers who are able conveniently to work more than 40 hours week overtime pay ma be economically advantag eous for others whose personal lives may be less flexible paren ts with small children persons responsible for eldercare students with rigid academic schedules extended hours of work even with extra pay may not be welcome some may simply value free time more highly than additional income nd extended hours even in modern work environments may increase the risk of accident or workrelated impairment and endanger clients or the public through the years many employers have opposed overtime pay requirements cost is one obvious reason absent an overtime pay requireme nt many employers would be able to engage workers through any number of hours at straight time wages but there is another side to the issue where fringe benefits are large share of total compensation payment of ove rtime rates may be cheaper than hiring additional workers this has led some to argue that an increase in the overtime rate to double time or higher may now be required if the penalty is to be effective further employers have been concerned with c ontrol of their establishments ie managements right to manage work scheduling traditionally has been an employer prerogative and some view gislated wagehour requirements as an intrusion upon that right speaking generally and with many exceptions employers and employees have been split on the issue of overtime pay re gulation workers ve often urged an expansion of coverage and strengthenin g of protections conversely employers have often called for less public restraint upon their right to manage to run their business as they deem best allowing them the opportunity to maximize

13a1 provides that the minimum wage and overtime pay requirements of the flsa will not apply to 1 any employee employed in bona fide executive administrative or professional capacity including any employee employed in the capacity of academic administrative personnel or teacher in elementary or secondary schools or in the capacity of outside salesman as such terms are defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the secretary emphasis added congress had offered the secretary little guidance the essential concepts were not defined in the statute and were little discussed during the 19371938 hearings and floor debates on october 19 1938 wa ge and hour administrator elmer f andrews released the regulation governing the executive administrative and professional eap exemption the regula tions consisted of two columns in the federal register including introductory and explanatory comment14 through the years dol has expande d upon the andrews regulation and the concept of bona fide would come to include essentially two tests first was the earnings or salary threshold was the targeted executive administrative or professional eap employee paid at level that one might equate with executive administrative or professional status second did the employee perform duties that were consistent with work one might associate with an executive administrator or professional and as an ad junct question did he or she perform such duties as his or her primary responsibility through the ma jor part of his or her hours of work other refinements and or qualifying factors were gradually added up until the 1970s the earni ngs threshold had been increased periodically to take into account changes in the economy in 1975 dol set the thresholds on an interim basis at 155 per week 8060 per year for an executive or administrator 170 per week 8840 for professional they had not been raised since even though the federal minimum wage would gra dually rise to an annualized figure of 10712 the eap thresholds had become esse ntially irrelevant but as the value of the threshold declined an ever increasing segment of the workforce could behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32215crs10

section 13a1 the proposal had double thrust it raised th earnings thresholds and created new upper threshold for highly compensated workers15 the latter if they engaged in any work that could be classified as executive administrative or professional would be presumptively exempt at the same time the administration s proposal redefined the concepts of executive administrative and professional in terms of the duties each was expected to perform in order to be deemed exempt precisely how many workers would have been affected by the proposed rule was unclear estimates rest upon ones assumptions and analytical methodology16 for employers generally low compensation th reshold could be viewed as preferable it would allow employers on that basis at least to exempt greater number of workers from minimum wage and overtime pay but others have questioned whether low threshold would unjustif iably expand the eap exemption and whether it would it be consistent with the purposes of the flsa and the concepts of executive administrative and professional while some argued that the definitions incorporated within the proposed rule were vague and permissive of range of interpretations

licensed funeral directors and licensed embalmers as professional workers the depa rtment has demurred although the act provides genera l exemption for employers of bona fide professionals congress

tion of four academic years of pre professional and professional study in cluding graduation from college of mortuary science accredited by the american board of funeral service education generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption52 as set forth the educational requirement is restrictive however another section of the final rule may dilute that restri ction subsection 541301d states that an exemption is also available to employees in such professions who have substantially the same knowledge level and perform substantially the same work as the degreed employees but who attained the advanc ed knowledge through combination of work experience and intellectual instruction53 exemption of certain co mputer services workers during the 1980s the computer industry sought to classify certain of its employees as professionals under section 13a1 of th flsa eliminating their regular minimum wage and overtime pay protections as in the case of the funeral industry the definition of professional presented problem in the rapidly evolving computer technology field marked by fluctuating educati onal standards and responsibilities often only obliquely asso ciated with specific job titles the department found it difficult to determine who was professional for purposes of flsa exemption and who was just very highly skilled technician during consideration of body of fl sa amendments in 1989 language was proposed that would have allowed wage hour exemption sp ecial treatment of certain computer services workers as professionals 54 the initial minimum wage legislation to which the computer serv ices exemption had been appended was vetoed by president george h w bush and when subsequent measure was passed and signed the computer rvices exemption had been dropped the following year however the exemption combined with nother unrelated amendment to the flsa was passed and signed pl 10158355 the amendment directed that the secretary within 90 days of

personnel would have risen to 3348 per hour but instead the rate now dr opped to the equivalent of 54 times the minimum wage subsequent changes in the minimum wage rate will not alter the qualifying rate for computer services personnel i the statutory 2763 which would equal 57470 per year if the worker were employed full time 57 see hr 3038 of the 106th congress 58 see hr 3081 lazio of the 106th

basis they shall be exempt only if their hourly rate of pay is at least 6½ times greater than the applicable minimum wage bolding added thus congress avoided the sec tion 13a1 issue defining professional in terms of education and duties by closely setting forth the manner in which the department should approach the issue the department proceeded as directed but its actions were not sufficient to resolve the issue in 1996 the matter was revisited the 1996 flsaminimum wage amendments were taken up as floor ame ndment to tax legislation reported from the committee on ways and means there had been hearing on the computer services exemption and the provision sparke d little floor discussion the restructured exemption pl 104188 moved in three direc tions first it added new paragraph 17 to section 13a thus the problem of defining professional for section 13a1 purposes was resolved the co mputer services workers or computer industry employers as the case may be now had their own cat egorical exemption second to be exempt computer servi ces workers would need to earn if paid hourly not less than 2763 an hour wh ile 2763 an hour was the equivalent of 6½ times the minimum wage prior to the 1996 flsa amendments the linkage between the hourly rate for computer rvices workers and the minimum wage rate had been severed56 third congress refined and expanded the definition of the body of workers who would now find themselves exempt under the new section 13a17 the computer services exemption in the 106th congress the issue resurfaced representative robert

outside sales personne l some argued had greater flexibility in that they could vis it with personally with clients during hours that made sense to the latter whereas in side sales people were desk or counter bound and worked on more or less fixed sche dules it would be an expansion of opportunity it was argued to free inside sales staff from flsa restrictions allowing them to work longer hours w

previously covered inside sales personnel it was not clear they stated that elimination of wagehour protections would make inside sales personnel any more efficient or expand their capacity to sell

final rule governing section 13a 1 discussed above appears to move toward an administrative revision which could result in exemption of at least some inside sales workers under the administrative exemption from wage and hour protection through the rulemaking pr ocess subsection 541203b provides employees in the financial services industry generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption if their duties include work such as collecting and analyzing information re garding the customers income assets investments or debts determining which financial products best meet the customers needs and financial circumstan ces advising the customer regarding the advantages and disadvantages of different financial products and marketing services or promoting the employers financial products however an employee whose primary duty is selling financial products does not qualify for the administrative exemption 70 italics added what constitutes the financial services industry may not be immediately clear and is not defined in the rule but appears to have potential for broad interpretation71 the concept of primary duty is defined but the rule states the term primary duty means the principal main major or most important duty that the employee performs the rule adds time alone is not the sole test since the final rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32215crs26 72

factor with respect to performance of exempt duties ie the amount of time devoted to such activity an employee may spend small portion of his or her working hours at task which his or her employer

experienced dol wage and hour division investigator now retired explained in some detail how an inside customer services representative could become under the final rule an exem pt employee so long as the employer did not designate sales as the workers primary duty it is loophole she suggested that has removed the distinc tion between inside sales traditionally nonexempt and outside sales t raditionally exempt at the least she stated the provision could be confusion to employ ers and could encour age more litigation73 conversely labor secretary elaine chao speaking gene rally of the final rule affirmed that it is clear straightforward and fair and will end much of the confusion about these exemptions74 time may be the final judge clarifying the concept of regular rate under the

which he is paid ie timeandahalf although the concept of regular rate is set forth in section 7e of the act questions have continued to aris for example under section 7e the regular rate shall be deemed to include all re muneration for employment paid to or on behalf of the employee but then perhaps not quite all section 7e also includes paragraphs enumerating what the regular rate shall not be deemed to include italics added these exceptions include but are not limited to such things as sums paid as gifts payment s made for occasional periods when work is performed due to vacation holiday illne ss etc the inventory is extensive but it still leaves open an opportunity for confusi on with respect to the specific definition of regular rate 75 in the 106th congress representative

many employers he added believe that performancebased incentives are the most productive way to motivate and reward at both the individual and group levels they would also make companies more competitive while employees would have predictable rewards for achieving specified goals79 the industryoriented labor policy ssociation lpa which endorsed hr 1602 presented somewhat different perspec tive incentive plans it affirmed have been around almost since the industrial ag first began an employee might earn bonus if he or she worked more quickly than the time the employer had allotted for the task the quicker the employee wo rked the faster his or her pay increased over the base rate for the job toda ys incentive plans the lpa noted are significantly different it explained these programs are focused on achieving important business goals when the goals are reached lpa stated the employees receive financial bonus which is usually part of the amounts the company saved by achieving the business goals it dubbed bonus and gainsharing plans winwin proposition for employees and employers because they increase employee pay while improving pr oductivity and workplace relations80 others dissented while employers would generally still have to pay the minimum wage the legislation would enc ourage them to convert all additional compensation into bonuses protested re presentative owens overtime pay the regular rate would be calculated on the basis of the base rate any bonus income would be outside of that calculation t hus he suggested the employer could pay lower wages and enjoy reduced rate when workers were asked to work overtime hours hr 1602 he argued could lead to wage rate mani pulation and undermine the overtime pay requirements of the act81 there was also concern that the process would result in speedup in which the faster bonusi nspired rate would gradually become the norm michael leibig representing the aflcio concurred with representative owens he pointed to five major objections to hr 1602 first it would fundamentally undermine th flsa and its encouragement of the 40hour work week second it would reduce the take home pay of hundreds of thousands of workers third it would reduce the compensation of all americans who work overtime hours fourth it would encourage the present lengthening of the work week and lead to additional forced overtime fifth it would shift the pay structure to increase the proportion of income from bonus while reducing th level of regular wages leibig concluded that the legi slation was simply unnecessary
