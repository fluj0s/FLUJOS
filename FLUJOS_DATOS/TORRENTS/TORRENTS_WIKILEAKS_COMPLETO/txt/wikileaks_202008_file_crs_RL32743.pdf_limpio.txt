korea including the passage of the north korea human rights act pl 108333 background1 us policy toward north korea preceding october 2002 shortly after president bush took ffice in january 2001 the administration declared its intent to undertake full re view of us policy towards north korea distancing itself from the clinton engagement policy that culminated in madeleine albrights october 2000 visit to pyongyang for talks to curtail north koreas missile program2 the reformulated policy announ ced in june 2001 outlined further lifting of us sanctions3 increased assistance to north korea and other political steps if the north agreed to 1 start to take serious verifiable steps to reduce the conventional weapons threat to the sout h 2 undertake impr oved implementation of the 1994 agreed framework and 3 low verifiable constraints on north koreas missile exports formal nego tiations between washington and pyongyang did not occur however during 2001 followi ng the 911 attacks bush linked north korea to the war on terrorism by including it in the axis of evil along with iraq and iran in his january 2002 state of the uni on address the administration insistedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32743crs2 however that its stated policy of resuming dialogue with the north koreans any time any place remained in effect scheduled bilateral talk s were postponed in mmer 2002 due to naval skirmish between the north and south koreans during this delay us intelligence building on evidence dating back to 1998 reportedly indicated that the north koreans were secretly developing highly enriched uranium program prospects for successful talks were derailed when assistant secretary of state james kelly reportedly presented the north koreans with evidence of the program during visit to pyongyang in october 2002 north kor ea reportedly confirme d the allegations the bush administration maintained that the suspected uranium program constituted breach of pyongyangs international ob ligations under the 1994 agreed framework and the nuclear nonproliferation treaty n pt with this confrontation already uneasy relations abruptly shifted to more hostile stance the agreed framework the 1994 agreed framework negotiated be tween the united states and north korea outlined the us commitment to provide north korea with package of economic diplomatic and ergyrelated benef its and north koreas consent to halt its nuclear program specifically th agreement provided for the shutdown of north koreas plutonium facilities to be monitored by the international atomic energy agency iaea in exchange for the annual delivery to north korea of 500000 tons of heavy oil and the constructi on in north korea of two light water nuclear reactors separate protocol signed in 1995 by the united states south korea and japan established the korean peninsula development organization kedo to implement the agreed framework the european union later joined the agreed framework unravels after the confrontation became pub lic the agreed framework quickly unraveled at us urging kedos execu tive board decided to halt the heavy fuel oil shipments in november 2002 this prompt ed series of angry and consequential responses from the north koreans shrill nouncements of the us failure to live up to its obligations under the agreement the removal of iaea monitors from the yongbyon plant the expelling of iaea in spectors from the country the removal of fuel rods from the storage pond and withdr awal from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt the sixparty talks take shape the bush administration maintained that serious flaw of the clinton approach during the agreed framework talks in the 1990s was the willingness to engage pyongyang in direct bilateral relations instead of relying on more multilateral process to pressure the north into comp liance as the 1994 agreement faltered the administration stood by its conviction that the previous arrangem ent rewarded north korea for bad behavior and failed to engage regional powers particularly china in enforcement pyongyang meanwhile insisted that direct talks with washingtonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32743crs3 were the only way to reach resolution together with the chinese the administration set the stage for multilateral forum to address the north korean nuclear issue in april 2003 round of th reeparty talks was held in beijing among the united states north korea also known as the democratic peoples republic of korea or the dprk and china als known as the peoples republic of china or the prc in the month that followed president bush met with south korean president roh moohyun and ja panese prime minister j unichiro koizumi pledging to include both countries in future talks north korea rejected the arrangement at the asean regional forum arf in midjune china also called for japan and south korea also known as the republic of korea or the rok to join the efforts and pyongyang relented four mont hs after the threeparty talks the first round of six party talks convened in beijin g also including former north korean patron russia china emerges as key player central to the administrations initiative of multilateral talks was the involvement of china the norths last ma jor ally china earlier had been reluctant to engage in multilateral efforts to deal with north korea and did not play direct role in the 1994 agreed framework because china is thought to be north koreas top trading partner and source of aid be ijings cooperation was considered crucial to any attempts by the international community to put economic pressure on the pyongyang regime president bush cultivat ed chinese cooperation by addressing the nuclear issue when chinese president jiang zemin visited crawford texas in october 2002 and later calling jiang directly to request his help in resolving the escalating crisis on both occasions jiang stated chinas commitment to non nuclear korean peninsula chinas ne w activism in diplomacy continued under jiangs successor hu jintao who officia lly assumed the presidency in march 2003 chinese leadership pushed firmly for th formation of the sixparty talks and according to reports shut down an oil pipeline to north korea for three days early in 2003 demonstrating its resolve to pyong yang beijing also reportedly gave the north koreans substantial amounts of m oney oil and food in exchange for attendance at the sixparty meetings beijing reportedly fears the profoundly destabilizing eff ects of either robust nucleararmed north korea which could t off an arms race in the region or the collapse of the regime whic h could send thousands of re fugees over the border into china china has struggled to deal with tens of thousands of north koreans who are believed to be living in and traveling to and from china some observers have noted the limitation of depending on china which prioritizes stability on the korean peninsula above all while some members of the bush administration reportedly favor regime change in pyongyang slow progress in sixparty talks three rounds of talks

the s econd round of talks wa s also criticized as slowing the process by detracting attenti on from the higherlevel plenary sessions many observers faulted the perceived struggle within the administration for severely limiting lead us negotiator kellys freedom to work out compromises the united states did not put forward detailed negotiatin g proposal until june 2004 despite requests from chinese ja panese and south korean leaders according to reports an influential coalition in the administration consisted of the offices of the secretary of defense and the vice presid ent and nonproliferation specialists in the state department and the national security council this group reportedly opposed direct nego tiations with and concessions to north korea favored the issuance of demands for unilateral north korean concessions on military issues and advocated an overall us strategy of isolating nort h korea diplomatically and economically officials within this group ex pressed hope andor expectations of collapse of the north korean regime second faction mainly in the state department and nsc was co mposed of officials with experience on east asian and korean issues this faction believed that the administration should attempt negotiations before adopting more coercive measures in order to build coalitions among the other parties and they reporte dly doubted the effectiveness of strategy to bring about north korean collapse4 major proposals and rejections despite regular denunc iations of the talks north korea set forward series of vaguelyworded proposals prior to the second round of talks north korea indicated that it may be willing to nd its nuclear program if th united states issued non aggression pact or security guarantee president bush indicated in statement in october 2003 that he would support multilateral security guarantee5 separate plan advanced by the north koreans in december 2003 included freezeof its weapons program in exchange for list of us concessions including lifting economic sanctions and energy assistance the united stat rejected this proposal insisting on complete dismantlement of north koreas nuclear programs before entering into other negotiations the us eventually countered with proposal at the june 2004 talks which was loosely modeled on libyas decision to abandon its nuclear weapons program in december 2003 freeze of north koreas wea pons program followed by series of measures to ensure complete dismantlement and eventually permanent security guarantee and discussions on return to normal relations in the interim japan and s outh korea would provide heavy oil the proposal closely resembled one presented by south korea earlier in the talks after some mixed reactions the north koreans u ltimately

korea on its own sout h korea russia and china favoring more conciliatory approach of offering incentives to north korea and more emphasis on nuclear freeze instead of dismantlement and japan and the united states preferring mix of dialogue and pressure on pyongyang after the first two rounds of talks failed to produce breakthroughs indications of frustration with the us approach appeared among the other parties in june 2004 chinas puty prime minister asserted that the us had not convinced beijing that north korea was pursuing uranium program suggestion echoe d by officials in south korea6 at the g8 summit in sea island the same month prime minister koizumi urged president bush to open up productive dialogue with north korea stressing kim jongils readiness to find resolution some speculated that this pressure led to the us proposal at the june 2004 talks china and russia also reportedly voiced some support for allowing north korea to use nuclear technology for peaceful civilian purposes while the united states insisted that all nuclear pr ograms should be dismantled following the june meeting the talks came to stands till in the runup to the us presidential election
