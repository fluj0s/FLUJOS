built on an infrastructure of analog technology that does not support many of the features that most americans expect are part of an emergency response efforts to splice newer digital technologies onto this aging infrastructure have created points of failure where call can be dropped or misdirected sometimes with tragic consequences callers to 911 however generally assume that the newer technologies they are using to place call are matched by the same level of technology at the 911 call center this is not the case for example except for some workaround solutions public safety answer ing points psapsthe call centerscannot receive text messages delays in moving calls from digital to analog mode add lifethreatening seconds to the completion of 911 call information about callers location may not be accurate especially in the case of wireless calls technology to supply accurate location information for wireless calls is useless unless the systems receiving and processing the call have matching capability modernizing the system to provide the quality of service that approaches the expectations of its users will require investments in new technologies the general consensus is that these new technologies collectively referred to as next generation 911 or ng911 should incorporate internet protocol ip standards an ipbased emergency communications network that supports 911 will facilitate interoperability and system resilience improve connections between 911 call centersprovide more robust capacity and offer flexibility in receiving calls recognizing the importance of providing effectiv 911 service congress has passed three major bills supporting improvements in the handling of 911 emergency calls the most recent of thesethe net 911 improvement act of 2008 pl 110283requires the preparation of national plan for migrating to an ipenabled emergency network the plan is to be prepared by the e911 implementation coordination office ico created to meet requirements of an earlier law the enhance 911 act of 2004 pl 108494 ico is coadministered by the national telecommunications and information administration and the national highway traffic safety administration of the us depart ment of transportation dot the ico is scheduled to terminate on october 1 2009 although congress has required that the national plan be completed in april 2009 this leaves little time to implement recommendations other goals set for the ico by congress will likely not be met the national plan could guide policies to strengthen the nations 911 system if there is an agency or organization to provide the needed leadership to implement the plans recommendations and other policy decisions to assure continuity of leadership congress may choose to reauthorize the ico it could also consider other means to coordinate congressional policy and monitor progress toward the fundamental policy goal of creating an ipenabled emergency communications network other types of citizenactivated emergency calls are handled in call centers increasingly many calls for assistance are placed by dialing 211 the number has been provisionally designated for community information and referrals service levels and response times for 211 calls would benefit from transition to ipenabled networks and in many cases could share infrastructure with 911 networks legislation introduced in 111 th congress includes two bills covering 211 call centers s 211 senator clinton and hr 211 representative eshoo

exclusively on analog technology using an architecture of circuits and switches developed when the american telephone telegraph company was regulated monopoly providing most of the nations telephone service1 modern communications innovations such as digitization packet switching and internet protocol ip standards are alien concepts in an outdated system design that literally chokes off the use of all but the most rudimentary features of modern enduser devices and stifles the development of more specialized equipment and services 2 systems for 911 unable to accommodate the latest advances in telecommunications technology are increasingly outdated costly to maintain and in danger of failure3 consumer expectations for accurate and timely response to 911 calls are based on the advanced features available on most communications devices not on the reality of faltering legacy system the analog system cannot carry text messages for example calls are delayed or dropped when analog and digital systems do not mesh information on the location of the call is lost because the digital details cannot be transmitted by the underlying telecommunications infrastructure or understood by the computers at public safety answering points psaps psaps are the call centers that receive and relay 911 calls as summarized in national emergency number association nena report simply put the 911 system has not kept up with technology and is badly in need of modernization 4 modernizing the system to provide the quality of service that approaches the expectations of its users will require investments in new technologies the general consensus is that present and future digital communications would be best supported by next generation 911 technology ng911 the term ng911 is widely used to refer to the modernization of all parts of the 911 system including hardware software data and operational policies and procedures all supported by multipurpose emergency service networks

nationwide overlay of system links that can operate at the national regional tribal state or local level to best meet the needs of specific circumstances such network if fully realized could support many types of emergency communications needs including first responder networks and emergency alerts network overlay for 911 systems can for example facilitate interoperability and system resilience by bringing extra resources to devastated areas where 911 call centers are damaged or overwhelmed with calls on daily basis it can provide foreign language assistance at any time anywhere 5 other

and alert and warning systems more robust capacity and the flexibility to receive calls for help in any format benefits like these are among the reasons that congress has required the preparation of national plan to prepare 911 for the transition to an ipenabled emergency communications network6 an ipenabled network for emergency communications has been defined as network based on an infrastructure allowing secured transmission of data among computers that use the internet protocol7 implementing ng911 will require not only the development of an ipenabled network and systems but will also entail changes in operational procedures training funding models and stateand possibly federalregulations and laws the national emergency number association nena began planning for the future of 911 under the banner of ng911 in 20008 nena started work on standards development for ng911 in 2003 and since then has taken the lead in defining designing and developing ng911 systems and solutions in partnership with other associations as well as representatives from industry government and the public safety community9 support for ng911 now comes from broad base including state and local managers for emergency communications and 911 associations such as nena comcare10 the national association of regulatory utility commissioners naruc11 the association of publicsafety communications officials international inc apco12 and the national association of state 911 administrators nasna13 many other international national and state and local associations are also actively

interrelated decisions about for example governance standards and technology funding and leadership congress has addressed some of these issues in the context of existing 911 infrastructure and technology and has recognized the need to plan for the transition to the next generation this transition will over time present many new policy issues congressional policy goals for the future could include addressing emergency communications needs and goals with policy statement that recognizes the convergence of technologies especially ipbased networks and standards that will place first responder networks 911 systems and emergency alert systems on common interoperable platforms identifying the federal role in implementing national policies for emergency communications without eroding state or local authority defining the role of the department of homeland security especially the regional emergency communications coordination working groups that it supports in guiding policies to sustain and improve 911 as part of its emergency communications plan reviewing the federal regulatory role in promoting competition in the provision of network services to psaps 25 designating radio frequency spectrum to provide connectivity to psaps for example by using wireless technologies such as microwave transmission in place of fiberoptic cables addressing the quality of interfaces with other emergency communications networks especially the radio links to first responders and their spectrum needs providing funding solutions establishing national guidelines or requirements for minimum levels of 911 service establishing program to assure that the quality of 911 services improves steadily nationwide the balance of this report describes the development of congressional policy in support of 911 technology and infrastructure federal programs the transition to ipenabled emergency communications costs and other elements of change before returning to discussion of goals for the future 25 the wireline circuits that complete the connection to the psaps are usually owned and operated by either an incumbent local exchange carrier ilec or competitive local exchange carrier clec operating under different regulatory requirements and protections the wireline competition bureau of the fcc oversees federal regulation of ilecs and clecs

legislative and policy actions regarding 911 have established base for the transition to ipenabled systems three major laws supporting improvements in the handling of 911 emergency calls have been enacted since 1999 these and other laws support policy objectives and strategies that provide the base upon which future policy might be built analyzing the legislation as continuum these key goals emerge equality of service and access to 911 mechanisms to improve funding for psaps and monitor collections and disbursements federal leadership in developing better 911 capabilities and transition to ip enabled 911 systems the major bills enacted into law are the wireless communications and public safety act of 1999 pl 10681 often referred to as the 911 act the ensuring needed help arrives ne

to assist the effort to provide comprehensive 911 services nationwide congress in 1999 passed the wireless communications and public safety act pl 10681 often referred to as the 911 act that mandated 911 as the national emergency number33 and provided for parity of wireless 9 11 services with the protections and authorizations already extended to wireline services34 among its provisions the law

needs 37 the fcc had taken first step toward adopting rules for wireless enhanced 911 in 1996 citing provisions of the communications act38 as the basis for its action after congress passed the 911 act the fcc plotted course for reaching wireless in two phases for phase i the wireless carriers were given year to prepare for psap requests for automatic number identification ani and locationfinder capabilities using technology existing at the time by 2001 for phase ii the carriers were to have identified and implemented new locationfinder technologies ali 1999 fcc ruling established october 1

established the principle that 911 calls should provide the same level of information and responsiveness matter what the communications device or the location of the call or the physical abilities of the caller congressional actions and fcc regulations have sought to expand the capacity of the existing 911 infrastructure to accommodate more types of devices to improve caller location information to provide wireless support in more areaswith more precisionand to accommodate persons with disabilities in the case of 911 service the twin policy goals of quality and equality may have bumped against the limits of the technologies currently in place significant new gains in accessibility and level of service appear to depend on implementing new technologies that are not supported by the current network architecture any new legislation intended to improve 911 service may need to address the substantial investments required to provid these improvements including for example financial assistance in acquiring the needed technology

are devices local networks call centers and interfaces with first responders g6g142g159g146g140g142g156g561 the cost of developing devices that comply with fcc requirements for caller information for 911 calls especially location information are borne by the communications service providers and their suppliers and by the consumers who subscribe to the services and buy these devices g14g152g140g138g149g561g16g142g157g160g152g155g148g156g561 to accommodate the needs of enhanced 911 local networks that provide routers and other infrastructure invest in upgrades to their facili ties the costs for these investments to route calls may be reimbursed through states 911 fund or may be passed on to the psaps that purchase access to the lines charges to psaps for communications services tend to rise as more features are added by their local exchange in some areas of the country there is little competitive pressure to upgrade these links the lack of access to an uptodate infrastructure is one reason why some areas of the country do not have enhanced 911 or even basic 911 services g5g138g149g149g561g5g142g151g157g142g155g156g561 to accommodate the information delivered through enhanced 911 psaps are required to invest in callprocessing equipment computers databases and other equipment the capital for these investments may come from 911 or e911 fees paid by subscribers into state 911 funds the funds are also used for operating costs state grants and local fundraising initiatives are other sources for capital investment and operating costs federal grant programs target investments in psaps 77 g11g151g157g142g155g143g138g140g142g156g561g160g146g157g145g561g8g146g155g156g157g561g20g142g156g153g152g151g141g142g155g156g561 the final step in processing 911 call is to relay information to emergency responders after the point of interface into the local first responder network the effectiveness of the 911 system depends on the capacity of the response network the emergency communications networks for public safety are also often constrained by the capabilities of old equipment as well as other operational limitations such as insufficient radio frequency spectrum and lack of communications interoperability among different first responder groups the upgrading of these networks are often considered as separate from improvements in 911 systems although some states have used 911 funds to help pay for public safety communications networks congress and the bush administration as well as states and other entities have typically addressed first responder communications networks through different set of policies and programs several required federal programs have yet to be fully realized 78 77 see appendix mechanisms to improve funding for psaps 78 among the crs reports addressing these issues is crs report rl33747 emergency communications legislation implications for the 110th congress by linda k moore

upgrading systems and maintaining and operating these new systems preliminary analysis of cost value and risk prepared for dot found that capital and operating costs would be comparable for improving the existing 911 system and migrating to ng911 under several scenarios that projected these costs over 20year period79 the model and assumptions used for the preliminary evaluation of costs will be revised by dot based upon the results of the proof of concept pilot programs final projection of costs under differing scenarios is to be completed by year end 200880 several trends were identified as part of the value analysis process primarily ng911 provides greater opportunities for cost savings and increased operational efficiencies than the current 911 environment ng911 has greater potential to meet the publics expectations for accessibility than the current 911 environment ng911 has greater scalability and flexibility than the current 911 environment ng911 has greater potential to increase public and responder safety through interconnectivity and interoperability than the current 911 environment the study therefore concludes that to meet the needs of public safety and the general publics expectations the preferred solution is to migrate to the ng911 environment81 g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g9g155g138g151g157g156g561 the federal grant program administered by the ico is scheduled to disburse 41325000 in matching grants in 2009 82 while allowing for consideration of developing 911 services for unserved communities the proposed rules for the grant program would favor purchases of hardware and software for enhanced 911 and ipenabled systems as well as training in connection with these investments the proposed allocation of funds would be by formula that gives equal weight to population and the number of miles of public road in each state state that qualified for grant would be allocated less than 500000 250000 for four territories covered by the program nine states would be entitled to receive over 1000000 california florida georgia illinois michigan new york ohio pennsylvania and texas states receiving funds must use them within three years under

upgrading communications infrastructure and improving federal assistance for emergency response and recovery after major disasters extending the authorization of the ico might also be beneficial for states that want to apply for matching grants under the program being established for 911 although under the proposed rules for the grant program the states have until 2012 to use the funds granted to them 95 they have only brief period to submit their requests96 this timetable is to ensure that the grant process is completed before the icos authorization ends97 newly empowered ico could be charged

infrastructure including wireless networks to support ipenabled emergency communications on national basis steps to achieve this could include addressing emergency communications needs and goals with policy statement that recognizes the convergence of technologies especially ipbased networks and standards that will place first responder networks 911 systems and emergency alert systems on common interoperable platforms reviewing the federal regulatory role in promoting competition in the provision of network services to psaps 98 designating spectrum to provide connectivity to psaps for example by using wireless technologies such as microwave transmission in place of fiberoptic cables addressing the quality of interfaces with other emergency communications networks especially the radio links to first responders and their spectrum needs the information that is expected from the national plan is important to congressional consideration of any of the abovesuggested goals and other goals that may be suggested first step for the 111th congress therefore may be to exercise the necessary oversight to see that the plan is completed and delivered as required by the net 911 improvement act of 2008 before the end of april 2009 congress could also consider the creation of other means to coordinate congressional policy and monitor progress toward the interrelated goals of creating an ipenabled emergency communications network improving first responder communications and upgrading the emergency alert system to digital mode 98 the wireline circuits that complete the connection to the psaps are usually owned and operated by either an incumbent local exchange carrier ilec or competitive local exchange carrier clec operating under different regulatory requirements

transmitting 911 calls as the wireline common carriers 100 the net 911 improvement act of 2008 extended these obligations and protections to include voice over internet protocol voip101 the federal communications commission fcc is responsible for promulgating and enforcing regulations to assure that cell phone and voip calls as well as those from wireline phones convey required information to the appropriate public safety answering point psap providing position information that locates cell phone or voip callers in manner comparable to wireline information is one of the challenges for parity among devices another challenge is presented by connections to thirdparty service providers for example telematics systems installed in cars such as onstar direct emergency calls automatically to customer service operator who then places the call to 911 usually identifying the appropriate call center from database video relay service for the hearing impaired is another example of an intermediary placing the call to psap access to psap contact information for thirdparty service providers continues to be an issue of concern to companies that provide services that include contacting 911 for assistance to address this concern the national emergency number association nena maintains registry of ps ap information that it makes available to validated call centers as well as psaps 102 the net 911 improvement act of 2008 specifically authorized but did not require the fcc to compile list of contact information of public safety answering points and make the information avai lable where releasing it would benefit public safety 103 the net 911 improvement act of 2008 also extended parity of protection to duly authorized emergency communications service providers that voluntarily

completed with accurate information depends on two essential components the capacity of the network and systems to captur and deliver the needed information and the capability of the psap to receive it providing cation information in rural areas for example can be difficult for wireless carriers partly because of inadequate infrastructure105 reflecting concerns that some carriers would stop serving remote areas rather than invest in improving location identification capabilities the enhance 911 act of 2004 directed the fcc to grant waivers to tier iii wireless carriers106 in situations where strict enforcement would decrease access to emergency services107 the enhance 911 act of 2004 also required the fcc to study the situation of tier iii wireless carriers regarding the waiver process and to provide information on effective technologies for implementing phase ii of we911 108 the fcc submitted detailed report in april 2005 but made recommendations regarding technology109

also have location problems such as when 911 call is made from inside highrise building even if wireless 911 is in place at the appropriate psap location identification can provide street address but not floor level location information is readily available for wireline phone subscribers as most telephone service providers have identifiable addresses stored in their databases many rural areas have invested in converting generic rural addresses such as rural routes or post office boxes into housespecific coordinates for 911 location information the association of publicsafety communicati ons officials international inc apco conducted an independent test of the accuracy of location information received by psaps that indicated many failings in the provision of location information from wireless calls 110 partially in response to the apco study the fcc opened new proceeding and in november 2007 proposed rules for carriers to provide more accurate location information to psaps111 verizon att and 105 problems have included the switch from analog to digital technology for cellular services digital technology provides significantly better locationfinding capability but analog transmissions have wider reach the difficulty of installing sufficient number of cell towers to provide tri angulation for location technologies and the predominance of cell towers placed along major highways sometimes referred to as string of pearls also complication for proper triangulation 106 for enforcement purposes the fcc divided wireless carrier s into three tiers tier iii small tier ii

implementing 911 services is covered by the telecommunications industry and by state andor local taxes or surcharges assessed on wireline and wireless telephone bills145 most states have some form of 911 or e911 fund that receives revenue from telephone bill surcharges and distributes it to various jurisdictions some states also compensate telephone companies for 911related expenses another source of funding at the local or county level is an increase in property taxes with the additional m onies going to psaps call center operators also hold fundraisers like fish fries and bake sales

provide aniali information beginning in 2003 the fcc has held occasional public forums to discuss 911 deployment and possible actions147 after the establishment of the public safety and homeland security bureau in 2006 the fcc took action on another requirement of the 911 act to encourage each state to develop and implement coordinated statewide deployment plans through an entity designated by the governor and to include representatives of the foregoing organizations and entities in development and implementation of such plans 148 it has contacted each state governor and requested information about points of contact for emergency communica tions as these are provided the fcc posts them on website established for that purpose149 the 2007 appropriations bill for the department of homeland security included requirement that the fcc submit report to congress on the capacity nationwide for rerouting 911 calls when call centers are disabled by disaster the law specified that the report would cover the status of efforts of state local and tribal governments to develop plans for rerouting 911 and e911 services in the event that public safety answering points are disabled during natural disasters acts of terrorism and other manmade disasters150 in the required report the fcc focused on administrative mechanisms not system capacities indicating that most states had some form of backup plan the report did not explore the limitations of existing technology nor consider possible changes to improve backup capacity the report was submitted to congress in september 2007 but has not been made public

calls for help currently go to 911 to 311 to 211 and to other call centers in both the public and private sector the 311 code was created by the federal communications commission fcc in 1997 to take nonemergency police calls as means to reduce congestion on 911 lines 169 the 211 dialing code is reserved by the fcc on provisional basis as universal number for community information and referral170 the 211 call centers support variety of social service hot lines including assistance in foreignlanguagesand can also be used to provide information and guidance in emergency situations171 large part
