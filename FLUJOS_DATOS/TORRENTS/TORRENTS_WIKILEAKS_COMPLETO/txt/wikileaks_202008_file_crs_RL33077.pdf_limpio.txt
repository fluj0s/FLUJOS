testify 18 usc 3144 the same is true in most if not all of the states1 although subject to intermittent criticism2 it has been so at least from the beginning of the republic3 the supreme court has never squarely considered the constitutionality of section 3144 or any of its pr edecessors but it has observed in passing that the duty to disclose knowledge of crime is so vital that one known to be innocent may be detained in the absence of bail as material witness stein v new york 346 us 156 184 19534 even more telling may be an earlier remark from the court to the effect that the constitutionality of this federal material witness statute apparently has never been doubted barry v united states ex rel cunningham 279 us 597 617 1929 1 discussion of the provisions of state law is

250 us 273 280811919at the foundation of our federal government the inquisitorial function of the grand jury and compulsion of witnesses were recognized as incidents of the judicial power of the united states by the sixth amendment in all criminal prosecutions the accused was given the right to speedy trial and public trial with compulsory process for obt aining witnesses in his favor by the first judiciary act the mode of proof by examination of witnesses in the courts of the united states was regulated and their duty to appear and testify was recognized the revised statutes contain provisions for requiring witnesses in criminal proceedings to give recognizance for their appearance to testify and for detaining them in prison in default of such recognizance in all of these provisions it is clearl recognized that the giving of testimony and the attendance upon court or grand jury in order to testify are public duties which every person within the jurisdiction of the government is bound to perform upon being properly summoned the personal sacrifice involved is part of the necessary contribution of the individual to the welfare of the public the duty so onerous at

authority can be used as means to jail suspect while authorities seek to discover probable cause sufficient to support criminal accusation5 or as preventive detention measure6 the lower courts have denied that the federal material witness statute can be used as substitute for criminal arrest warrant7 particularly in the early stages of an investigation however an individuals proximity to crime may make him both legitimate witness and legitimate suspect8 the case law and statistical information suggest that the federal statute is used with surprising regularity9 and most often in the prosecution of immigration offenses involving material witnesses who are foreign nationals10 critics however contend that since september 11 2001 5 carlson voelpel material witness and material

grand jury proceeding the purpose of section 3144 is the preservation of evidence for criminal proceedings potential defendants even if they are the targets of grand jury investigation have right to present evidence to the grand jury16 on the other hand federal prosecutor ordinarily arranges for the presentation of witnesses to the grand jury17 it is therefore not surprising that the courts seem to assume without deciding that the government may claim the benefits of section 3144 in the case of grand jury witnesses 18 issuance of section 3144 arrest warrant requires affidavits establishing probable cause to believe 1 that the witness can provide material evidence and 2 that it will be impracticable to secure the witness attendance at the proceeding simply by subpoenaing him19 neither the statute nor the case law directly address the question of what constitutes material evidence for purposes of section 3144 but in other contexts the term is understood to mean that which has natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed 20 at the grand jury level the government may establish probable cause to believe witness can provide material evidence through the affidavit of federal prosecutor or federal investigator gathering evidence with an eye to its presentation to the grand jury21 this may not prove particularly demanding standard in some instances given the sweeping nature of the grand jurys power of inquiry22 continued constitution to any of the branches described in the first thr ee

served and executed here feingolds testimony is needed at nashis trial once commenced the trial would continue on consecutive days and feingolds testimony would be needed before the government rested its case since feingold is presumably in california for the government to have to defer its arrest warrant until he ignored subpoena to attend the trial will pr eclude his testifying altogether the affidavit showed unsuccessful attempts to serve feingold with subpoena either through his california attorney or on seven different days at feingolds home 26 perhaps because the point seems too obvious for dispute or discussion none of the reported federal cases appear to have held the impracticality requirement can be satisfied by evidence that material witness who is foreign national illegally present in this country may be overseas and thus beyond the reach of the courts subpoena when his testimony is required the number of foreign material witnesses arrested and held for the

jury witnesses of matters occurring during their appearance before the panel54 there is some authority for the proposition that the rule does not bar disclosure to congress55 and there is reason to believe that the rule does not apply to executive branch officials with supervisory authority over justice department attorneys who assist the grand jury56 in addition from time to time congress has created several other exceptions to the rules general prohibitions either by amendment of the rule57 or by provision elsewhere in the code58 the omb statement that as it is written this provision would entail wholesale violation of rule 6e of the federal rules of criminal procedure may be an objection to the fact that the proposal does not take the form of an amendment to rule 6e59 yet it seems unlikely that omb would base statement of strong opposition solely on question of legislative drafting style the statement could be read as claim that congress lacks the legislative authority to enact provision at odds with rule 6e but this cannot be the rules were and are promulgated as an exercise of legislative authority60 even when amendments to the federal rules of criminal procedure come from the courts they are subject to congressional rejection or modification before they become effective61 the statement might be understood to declare that compliance with section 12 would involve wholesale disclosures which would be contrary to the purpose and demands of rule 6e were it not superseded by the instructions of section 12 this might be seen as contention that without the intervention of section 12 rule 6e would prohibit disclosure of the information identified in section 12 to the designee of the justice departments inspector general or to the house and senate judiciary committees or to either of them 53 united states v john doe inc 481 us 102 109 n5 1983 douglas oil co v petrol stops northwest 441 us 211 219 1979 54 frcrimp 6e2a obligation of secrecy may

implicated only with regard to matters occurring before the grand jury thus rule 6e is not implicated with respect to information concerning the detention of material trial witnesses under section 3144 of title 18 nor is it clear that rule 6e would be implicated by disclosure of information concerning the length of confinement or access to counsel of material grand jury witnesses as long as individual witnesses were not identified nor of information in the aggregate of the offenses at issue and frequency of grand jury appearances of incarcerated material witnesses 62 but for section 12 rule 6e would seem to apply to the identities of incarcerated grand jury witnesses the offenses under consideration by specific grand jury panels and the frequency of appearance by specific incarcerated witnesses even here however it is far from clear that absent section 12 the rule would preclude disclosure to congress or to ju stice department officials whose duties include investigation of misconduct by department attorneys63 nevertheless perhaps because of administration opposition the provision was dropped from hr 3199 prior to house passage similar provision could be found in hr 3199 s 1389 as approved in the senate in the conference bill hrept 109333 2005 or the legislation ultimately enacted g21g495g561g343g349g345g351g561 s 1739 introduced by senator leahy rewrites section 314464 in its recast form section 3144 among other things would establish preference for postponing arrest until after material witness has been served with summons or subpoena and failed or refused to appear unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that service is likely to result in flight or otherwise unlikely to secure the witness attendance make it clear that the provision applies to grand jury proceedings explicitly permit arrest by officers who are not in physical possession of the warrant require an initial judicial appearance without unnecessary delay in the district of the arrest or in an adjacent district if more expedient or if the warrant was issued there and the appearance occurs on the day of arrest limit detention to 5 day increments for maximum of 30 days 10 days in the case of grand jury witness 62 in re cudahy 294 f3d 947 7th cir 2002the purpose of rule 6e is to protect the confidentiality of the grand jurys hearings and deliberations and the term matters occurring before the grand jury is interpreted accordingly see martin v consultants administrators inc 966 f2d 1078 1097 7 th cir 1992the general ru is that rule 6es

judiciary committees on the number of material witness warrants sought granted and denied within the year the number of material witnesses arrested who were not deposed or did not appear before judicial proceedings and the average number of days arrested material witnesses were detained in lieu of the clear and convincing evidence standard in favor of release and the time limits on detention the existing statute insists that material witness may be detained because of inability to comply with any condition of release if the testimony of such witness can adequately be secured by deposition and if further detention is not necessary to prevent failure of justice 18 usc 3144 the proposed amendment has comparable provision in light of the 5 day limit on detention without further judicial approval s 1739 would eliminate the reporting requirement now found in rule 46h2 of the federal rules of criminal procedure ie an attorney for the government must repo rt biweekly to the court listing each material witness held in custody for more than 10 days pending indictment arraignment or trial for each material witness listed in the report an attorney for the government must state why the witness should not be released with or without deposition being taken under rule 15a
