offered to the entire school not to just one class but one is required to start quiet time is set up in the school day where those who learned tm can meditate the others who do not meditate can study raja rogers steve when is your article coming out steve came out on the 8th in the atlanta journal constitution weve had 12 calls from meditators who want checking or want family members to learn in other states less respons than anticipated our phone number is in the article ive been here to answer the phone taught two young boys last weekend not as result of the article raja rogers beautiful article came out in the wash post about fairfield sometimes it takes awhile to manifest some results any expos ure is good expos ure experience says it requires 1216 expos ures before someone buys especially if not familiar with the produc t jane the press corps asked that we write letter to the author of the article in the wash post i did that and received nice letter back from the author raja rogers were setting up national call center we are getting internet phone s east coast phone will be answered in raja kingsleys domain 2 phone s in ff for the midwest and 1 in the west coast if someone calls and gets an answering machine only 30 leave message if someone goes to tmorg site and dials 888learntm then they will go to the national call center rather than the local center need everyone s phone number and good email address so call center can get ahold of you and give you the contact data from the caller i believe elaine has collected this info eventually wed like to have everyone s schedule so we could book people into an intro jane will the list have all governors in an area eg vero elaine yes but the main contact is highlighted raja rogers so we will call the other govs if the main contact is not available hours 9 am on east coast and ending at 9 pm on the west coast 7 days week jeff governors answering the phone raja rogers recertified govs will answer the phone will have basic script right now the local numbers will still be on the website eventually we might remove them and have all calls go the call center jeff can they give addl pts like directions to peace palace raja rogers main thing is to get them interested in tm ray school that attended the conference already has the principal on board she got 20 teachers to join with her to try to get the program into the school raja rogers some schools have had problems with people seeing negative sites on the internet so we just present the scientific research we can also draw parallel with marconi discovering radio waves before they were accepted by the public at large jane new requirement is that we start with teaching the principal and teachers and then small group of parents jeff so far we have had 3 followup meetings 15 attended lot of enthusiasm we are going next week to some schools to present to core group of administrators jane do you see the need to have neutral place to meet that is not the peace palace there was some concern about people seeing devotional pictures raja rogers peace palace carries its own force so we dont need to have neutral place to meet jeff people saw the pictures of yogic flyers from craig pearsons book we just said these are people who have fulfilled their full potential and left it at that raja rogers 400 pundi ts will be in residence soon mvc is
