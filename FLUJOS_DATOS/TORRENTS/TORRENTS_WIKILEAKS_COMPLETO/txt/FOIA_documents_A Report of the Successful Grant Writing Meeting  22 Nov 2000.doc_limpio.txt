report of the successful grant writing meeting held on 22 november 2000 report of the successful grant writing meeting held 22 november 2000 on 22 november 2000 research committee organised seminar on successful grant writing this involved 4 people with extensive experience of working on panels evaluating grant applications for research councils and the eu offering short presentations in which they tried to summarise their views of what makes for successful proposal the aim was primarily to consider issues that turn good proposal into very good and successful one the participants were richard hey jean palutikof john plane and kerry turner along with simon gerrard who talked about business funding opportunities and janice darch id like to thank all of these people for their contributions below i have tried to distil out the essence of the contribution research contract income is very important to the school representing approximately half our total income it supports the contract researchers in the school and generates the overheads that support many of the technical and administrative staff this research activity also generates the publications that form the basis of the rae assessment which controls the level of the other main component of the schools income from the government the component of the research income also controls our phd studentship allocation from nerc and epsrc an overall review of grant application success rate by funding source emphasises several features table 1 firstly we submit lot of proposals and lot get funded secondly our applications are dominated by those to research councils and the eu our funding is even more dominated by these sources because in general they provide larger grants compared to the other sources business in particular represents small component of our income and there is real potential for this to grow significantly thirdly success rates of applications to research councils eu and charities are all around 50 which is substantially better than the average in these sources emphasising the quality of env applications the situation for proposals to government organisations and business in rather different these organisations tend to engage in discussion before proposal submission with potential bidders proposal submission is therefore fundamentally different as is obvious from the success rate considering individual pis there is wide range in the number of proposals submitted but evidence of systematic differences in success rates between pis submitting large number of proposals and those submitting few this suggests that nobody in env has magic formula for success clearly it is very important that only strong scientific proposals are submitted but it is also important to realise that you can only be funded if you submit proposal research councils different research councils do operate in somewhat different ways in terms of the proportion of funding that is through calls for proposals in particular areas compared to funding that is across the entire remit of the research council esrc and epsrc tend to fund more through the former route compared to nerc epsrc fund predominantly in themes developed via the foresight process and it is best to apply under these themes provided you can do so esrc also fund lot of work with centres eg cserge so link to these it is important to understand the philosophy of the council you are applying to in this regard and this information is publicly available particularly via the web in addition it is one of the jobs of the various research council administrators to help and advise you with the technical aspects of grant proposal submission though obviously not with the science case you make you should therefore feel free to call these people and seek advice another good source of advice is other people in env who have experience of the system janice darch can identify these people and they will usually be happy to share their experience and even show you their old grant proposals listings of successful proposals are also available in the env annual report all the research councils have additional specific funding schemes targeted at for example particular science areas new investigators and equipment provision information on the initiatives is on the web and available from janice darchs office all these schemes will have different deadlines and in some cases deadlines at all check out the deadlines and allow adequate time to prepare the science case and for janices office to prepare the paperwork all the research councils follow broadly similar strategy of sending proposals out to international peer review by referees some of which are selected by you and others by them based on their own files of experts in the field and advice from members of the grants committee the graded proposals are then considered by committee that considers the referees comments and gradings and then grades and prioritises the proposals for subsequent funding the key factor in the grading is the excellence of the scientific case as assessed by the external reviewers and by the panel against criteria of international excellence the different research councils do consider other factors to varying extents though all other factors are secondary but important if you are close to funding borderline epsrc in particular stress the value of the proposed work to beneficiaries and users and the relevance of this work all research councils and the eu are under pressure to justify the way they spend public money so it is worth considering these points albeit probably briefly since all proposals have tight page limits the assessment committee will be composed of intelligent and experienced scientists but they may or may not be expert in the area of your proposal even if they have been asked to speak to the proposal at the meeting usually 2 or 3 members are asked to speak to each proposal and others can comment if they wish members of the panel also have great deal of papers to read ahead of the meeting and face difficult task in grading proposals one aim in proposal writing is to try and make their life easier you can do this by making the proposal clear focussed and free of jargon try to convey the essence of the proposal and your enthusiasm for it early in the proposal funding committees are asked to consider if researchers are going to be able to deliver what they propose so make the proposal reasonable and realistic do not promise the earth but against that you need to impress them remember also that all research councils carry out some sort of evaluation of outcomes at the end of the grant you need to demonstrate in the proposal and associated documentation that you have the expertise in terms for example of published papers to carry out the work though reputation alone will not get you funded if you are trying to break into new field the committee will be wary of funding you with track record so consider collaborating with more experienced researcher in that field and do not ask initially for large grants epsrc do have programme line designed to foster interdisciplinary research where track record is less important and nerc have new investigators scheme for young faculty committees are asked to consider value for money so do not submit unreasonable budgets bur rather well justified budgets and carefully prepared work plans all the while keeping this section short to give you more room for science however research councils are committed to full funding of necessary costs so do not deflate the budget to the point where the work cannot be done if you want pdra instead of graduate student be sure to justify it remember to discuss data management and archiving research councils and the eu now insist that the products of publicly funded research including data ultimately become publicly available some research councils including nerc send referees comments to proposal submitters for response ahead of the grants committee meeting this is an opportunity to rebut misunderstandings by the referee but make your responses short and reasonable it is sometimes better to acknowledge good argument made by referee and say you will incorporate the idea if the point the referee has noted is minor the committee may accept this if the point is major it suggests you have not prepared the proposal well and this or any other major flaw in the proposal will probably mean the proposal will not be graded highly enough to be funded eu there is lot of information on eu opportunities available via the cru website framework 6 is already being developed within the eu so take any opportunities that present themselves to help influence the development of the framework to ensure that your own research interests are included the eu funding mechanism is very different to that of the research councils it involves consortia proposals involving several countries this allow bigger issues to be tackled but makes project development and management more complex it is sensible to get involved in eu projects first as partner rather than as coordinator since great deal of work falls on the coordinator and much less on the partners the assessment of eu proposals is only by panel with external peer review it is worth accepting invitations to be an evaluator to help understand how the system works the process is in two stages with low graded proposals falling at the first stage there is strict marking scheme which includes relevance and project management issues in addition to scientific criteria there is lot of information provided by the eu on the grading procedure with application forms and the coordinator needs to consider this carefully since the grading of sections in addition to the science case is often critical to success most of this work in the proposal writing falls to the coordinator rather little to partners so in general it is sensible to accept invitations to join consortia as partner if you are interested in the work to increase your chances of being invited to be partner work to raise your profile amongst european researchers by for example going to conferences accepting the job of coordinator is more problematic because it is lot of work though if it succeeds it can provide the opportunity to lead some exciting and novel large science projects if you choose to coordinate find out as much as possible from the eu information sources about the size of project that they are anticipating the norm at the moment is around 2m ecu with 8 partners if you propose very large projects it is sensible to discuss this with officials at the eu before preparing the proposal when writing the proposal the advice earlier for research councils about conveying the novelty and excitement is valid again you also need to remember that for many of the assessors english will not be the first language so try and keep the text short and straightforward it is clearly worthwhile to circulate the text amongst the partners but keep tight editorial control and try not to create poorly focussed incoherent proposal that is obviously written by committee the eu review is largely anonymous so reputations count for very little be sure to structure the proposal as the eu request in work packages and discuss the non science component of project and data management socioeconomic issues and benefits to the eu if you are coordinator you can bid for coordination costs do this there is lot of work involved in managing an eu grant government departments and agencies we do receive funds from wide variety of government departments and agencies and often more than one of these is involved for example ea and maff many of these organisations do call for research priorities however even if they accept your idea they may still go for an open call for proposals in this area this is unfortunate in that in theory somebody else could get to do your project but thats the system and you do still have an advantage in the bidding process because you understand the idea better than the competition in addition to these calls for bids to address particular research objectives some of these organisations also let contracts directly in these cases you need to make contacts in the organisation and develop ideas with them even in the normal bidding procedure your reputation as scientist who can deliver the research effectively counts for lot so again getting to know the funders is valuable these organisations basically do not fund unsolicited proposals so you need to develop relationship with them and to accept that their research agenda is focussed on using the product they are usually happy to see scientific publication of results as way of enhancing the status of these results but these are not the key outputs for them unlike the research councils ultimately they are concerned with policy advice business env currently gets rather little funding from business and has set strategic objective of increasing this area of funding there are increasing funding opportunities as government seeks to provide funds to contribute to businessuniversity collaborations as part of its plans for knowledgebased economy in addition there are of course direct funding opportunities with business both for research and consultancy the line between these is not clear but it is important to ensure that there is right to publish results key feature of collaboration with business is that personal contacts matter and this does require that barriers of style and language be overcome business seeks university collaboration because of the expertise and credibility such collaboration brings to their work when interacting with business it is important to recognise and work with the business goals in particular demonstrating value to the business from the collaboration env has business liaison coordinator simon gerrard and his advice can be very valuable in developing contacts with business tim jickells 5 december 2000 table 1 grant success rates 19952000 number of
