collaborative research the greater complexity of mode rn technology heightened specialization in advanced fields improved means of co mmunications and the desire to share the risks and expenses of high technology res earch have each contributed to this trend congressional interest in creating an environment conducive to collaborative research has resulted in numerous legislative initiatives the patent law amendments act of 1984 and the c ooperative research and technolog enhancement create act of 2004 are among those that have clarified patent law rules rega rding joint inventors and cooperative research endeavors observers have nonetheless expressed c oncerns that applicable patent law standards may discourage rather than fost er collaboration among researchers some patent law experts believe that current rules identifying the members of research team who qualify as joint inventors are too lenient vague and unpredictable this standard may lead to uncertainties with respect to patent ownership it may also encourage strategic claims drafting during patent acquisition and enforcement another target of concern is the current legal rule governing the joint ownership of patents in the event more than one individual is considered to be coinventor of an invention that is patented each such person is regarded as joint owner of that patent us patent law further deems jo int owner of patent to enjoy tenancy incommon which allows him to exploit patent without regard to the other owners this property rule appears to maximize the opportunity for exploitation of the patented invention in the marketplace yet because every inventor receives full rights in an invention matter what the extent of his contribution this ownership principle could possibly lead to inequitabl distributions of the profits of patented inventions if congress should deem legislativ response to be appropriate some commentators have called for more specific legislative guidance on the joint inventorship standard possible reform w ould be to stipulate brightline rules or possibly list of factors that courts should consider with respect to joint inventorship on the other hand fashi oning workable standard of joint inventorship might prove difficu lt or ultimately be unnecessary in addition alternative ownership rule ssuch as considering ownership on claimbyclaim rather than patentbypatent basisare possibility in weighing the desirability of any alternative to the current regime concerns for ease of judicial administration and the diminution of the incentives of one joint owner to commercialize the patented invention may be appropriate however the patent statutes joint inventorship and joint owners hip standards are effectively default rules as collaborative researchers may reach alternative arrangements via contract legal reform in this area may not be compelling needhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33063contents the role of collaborative resear ch in

first instance legislative attention towards collaborative research issues has been stimulated by the growing prominence of research partnerships among and between private sector firms universities and the federal rd establishment4 many reasons explain why cooperative projects have become an increasingly attractive vehicle for innovation the greater comple xity of modern technology has caused

to this trend towards collaboration one factor is the growth of the communications networks including the internet which collectively have ma collaboration over long distances much easier13 the growing complexity of modern t echnology has ramifications upon the cost of conducting research the sp ecialization of researchers and the ability to innovate cooperation may benefit firms by allowing them to share risks and costs high technology research is often expens ive and many firms have found li mited associations with other entities more cost effective than hiring needed expertise on permanent basis coupled with reported d eclines in public financing cost increases have also encouraged academic researcher s to find new sources of financial support14 the extreme complexity of many

that shape patent law doctrines as well as the practical workings of the patent system as applied to collaborative research patents and innovation policy the patent system is intended to pr omote the production and dissemination of technological information many commentat ors have argued that the patent system is necessary to encourage individuals to engage in inventive activity27 proponents of this view reason that absent patent system inventions could easily be duplicated by free riders who would have incurre d cost to develop and perfect the technology involved and who could thus undersell the original inventor the resulting inability of inventors to capitalize on their inventions would lead to an environment where too few inventions ar made by providing individuals with exclusive rights in their inventions for limited time the patent system allows inventors to realize the pr ofits from their inventions the courts have also suggested that abse nt patent law

system attempts to avoid these inefficiencies by requiring inventors to consent to the disclosure of their inventions in issued patent instruments29 there are still other explanations for the patent laws for instance the patent act of 195230 is thought by supporters to s timulate technological advancement by inducing individuals to invent around patented technology issued patent instruments may point the way for others to develop improve ments exploit new markets or discover new applicati ons for the patented technology31 the patent system may encourage patentees to explo it their proprietary t echnologies during the term of the patent pr oponents believe the protecti on provided by patents proprietary rights increases the likelihood firm will continue to refine produce and market the patented technology32 finally the patent law has been identified as facilitator of markets absent patent rights an inventor may have scant tangible assets to sell or license nd even less ability to police the conduct of contracting party by reducing licensees opportunis tic possibilities the patent system lowers transaction costs and makes technology based transactions more feasible33 the patent system has nonetheless attr acted great number of critics some assert that the patent system is unnecessary due to market forces that already suffice to create an optimal level of invention the desire to gain lead time advantage over competitors may well provide sufficient indu cement to invent without the need for further incentives34 some commentators observe that successful inventors are sometimes transformed into complacent blished enterprises that use patents to suppress the innovations of others35 others assert that the inventions that have fueled some of our most dynamic industr ies such as early biotechnologies and computer software arose at time when patent rights were unavailable or uncertain36httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33063crs6 36 continued 1990 1025 37 see crs

application merits th award of patent39 the patent acquisition process is commonly known as prosecution40 under the patent act of 195241 patent application must include specification that so completely describes the invention that skilled artisans are able to practice it without undue experimentation this requirement is re ferred to as enablement the patent specification must also provi information upon the best mode known to the inventor of pr acticing the invention42 the patent act also requires that applicants draft at least one claim that particularly points out and distinctly claims the subject matter that they regard as their invention43 in practice most patent applications contain multiple claims each claim sets out distinct proprietary interest that the patent applicant asserts for himself while reviewing submitted application the examiner will determine whether the claimed invention fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute two of the most important patentability criteria are novelty and nonobviousness to be judged novel the claimed invention must not be fully anticipated by prior patent publication or other knowledge within the public domain44 the sum of these earlier materials which document stateoftheart knowledge that is accessible to the public is termed the prior art to meet th standard of nonobviousness an invention

the term of the patent is ordinarily set at 20 years from the date the patent application was filed50 patent title therefore provides inventors with limited periods of exclusivity in which they may practice th eir inventions or license others to do so patent owners bear responsibility for moni toring their competitors to determine whether they are using the patented inven tion or not patent owners who wish to compel others to observe their intellectual property rights must usually commence litigation in the federal district courts the us court of appeals for the federal circuit federal

amendments act of 1984 prior to 1984 the patent statutes did not include express provisions that stated the legal standards for inventorship this situation resulted in judicial holdings that in the view of some observers were not conducive to collaborative research for example some courts required that an i ndividual contribute to the subject matter of each claim within patent in order to qualify as joint inventor53 being excluded from inventorship leads to the result that the individual would also not be considered an owner of the patent before 1984 some commentators believe d this result led to an atmosphere of caution among potential joint researchers54 under such rule entities that made significant contributions to research project could nonetheless be denied the rewards of patent ownership due merely to imprecisions or strategic decisionmaking during the draf ting of the patents claims55 concerns also arose that the patent law s standard of joint inventorship was not keeping pace with conditions in modern indus trial research laborat ories stateof theart research often involves numerous individuals who make different levels of contribution to project sometimes sporadically and over long period of time some observers believed the requirement that each named inventor make contribution to the subject matter of every claim was unrealistic in view of these industrial c onditi ons as explained by gerald j mossinghoff then the commissioner of patent s and trademarks complying with this requirement is so metimes difficult and at times impossible scientists or researchers in an organiza tion often work on particular aspect or embodiment of the invention or on only portion of the invention while others work on different aspects embodiments or portions scientists are continually added to research team while other scientists leave the team concepts and development plans generated through brainstorming cannot always be accurately attributed the preparation of patent pplications nevertheless requires the attorney to determine the inventorship of each claim adequate protection for an invention may require the filing of several applications to cover the separate contributions to all of its aspects56 by enacting the patent law amendm ents act of 1984 congress responded to both of these issues as amended by th 1984 legislation section 116 of

appropriately been named as inventors on patent claiming polyethylenelined plastic bottle in finding the two were properly considered joint inventors the court explained joint invention is the product of collaboration of the inventive endeavors of two or more persons working toward the same end and producing an invention by their aggregate efforts to constitute joint invention it is necessary that each of the inventors work on the same subject matter and make some contribution to the inventive thought nd to the final result each needs to perform but part of the task if an in vention emerges from all of the steps taken together it is not necessary that the entire inventive concept should occur to each of the joint inventors or that the two should physically work on the project together one may take step at one time the other an approach at different times one may do more of the experimental work while the other makes suggestions from time to time the fact that each of the inventors plays different role and that the contribution of one may not be as great as that of another does not detract from the fact that the invention is joint if each makes some original contribution though partial to the final solution of the problem59 the 1984 amendments also provided legisl ative mechanisms for correcting the identity of the inventors listed on patent traditionally the incorrect naming of inventors had significan t consequences for the validity of the patent60 either the improper addition of person who was not in fact an inventor which is termed misjoinder in patent parlance or the failure to name correct inventor which is termed nonjoinder were strict grounds for patent invalidity61 this longstanding patent law doctrine was believed to clash with the needs of

is known to the public this information is compared to the claimed invention to determine whether the invention is novel and nonobvious and therefore eligible for patentingof inventors coupled with the absence of mechanisms for correcting mistakes were believed to be illsuited for modern conditions the patent law amendments act of 1984 provided response to this situation by retaining the rule that identifying the correct inventor or inventors is condition of patentability62 however this legislation lowed for the correction of both nonjoinder and misjoinder errors63 as codified in 256 of the patent act the uspto may issue certificate correcting invent orship so long as these errors arose without deceptive intent section 256 also llows for courts to issue orders requiring the uspto to correct the listing of inventors on par ticular patent64 the 1984 legislation also amended the finition of prior art to exclude certain inhouse knowledgeknown to memb ers of collaborative research team but not to the general publicfrom qualifyi ng as prior art under the patent act65 congress confirmed nd slightly broadened this exemption when it enacted the american inventors protection act of

and ho rvat and another issued to jenkins70 the correspondence of invent or surnames between the application and the prior art patents was not coincidencethe prior art patents had been granted to the same bass and horvat in the one case and the same jenkins in the other as were seeking the new patent this meant that these i nventors own earlier work had been cited against them to establish obviousness or dinarily the patent statute makes it clear that an inventors own prior inventive fforts may not anticipate her own subsequent patent application71 however the bass court reasoned that an opposite approach was permissible because of traditional patent law prin ciple that treats each new combination of joint inventors as distinct inventive entity this rule applies even where these combinations sh are individual inventors under the inventive entity rule the team of bass jenkins and horvat is considered different inventive entity than the team of just bass and horvat each group of natural persons esse ntially acquires its own legal identity they as whole constitute the inventor of th at technology on this view the two prior art patents at issue in the bass litigation were as matter of legal technicality the work of different inventor from the one seeking the present patent and thus relevant prior art72 concerns arose that the holding in in re bass was not conducive to joint research large research institutions ma employ numerous technologists to engage in collaborative research and developmen t efforts and there may be constant shifting in the composition of inventiv teams working on different projects applying the rule of in re bass in this setting could lead to denial of patent rights even if only slight change in personnel occurred in par ticularly fertile and interactive corporate research department inventors could find themselves unable to obtain patents due to inhouse rejec tions for obviousness based upon efforts by their peers and even in part by themselves73 congress intended 103c1 to solve the problem highlighted in in re bass by exempting certain prior art from the obviousness analysis in joint research and development settings

inventions of common owner similarly to inventions made by single person81 under this legislation inventions generated through collaborative research are treated as if they were made by sing individual or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same individual if joint research agreement has been reached prior to the development of the invention this legal fiction in turn allows joint researchers to take advantage of the pr ior art exemption under section 103c1 of the patent act82 current issues congressional amendments to the patent act of 1952 in 1984 1999 and 2004 have clarified and refi ned the legal standards governing collaborative research in the view of some observers however additiona l concerns exist with respect to the governing patent law standards this report considers two of these issues the standard of inventorship itself as well as the property rules regulating joint ownership of patents standards of joint inventorship the 1984 amendments to the patent act sti pulated that individuals may be joint inventors even though 1 they did not physi cally work together or at the same time 2 each did not make the same type or amount of contribution or 3 each did not make contribution to the subject ma tter of every claim of the patent83 it can be appreciated that this language offers ne gative definitionthat is to say the statute identifies certain conditions that do not disqualify an individual from being considered an inventor but this provisi on does not affirmatively specify the level of technical contribution needed to allow an individual to rise to the level of an inventor and therefore be na med on the patent instrument84httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33063crs14 84 continued 116 sets explicit lower limit on the quantum or quality of

this determination has very significant practical c onsequences for collaborative research projects suppose for example that two firms each provide one of their employees to work on joint research

charges of infringement against it85 although specific statutory language defines which individuals may be considered joint inventor number of judicial opinions concerning inventorship disputes provide some guidance to industry most patent law experts agree that at least some basic principles regarding joint inventorship are clear from the case law as summarized by the federal circuit all that is required is that the joint in ventor 1 contribute in some significant manner to the conception or reduction to practice of the invention 2 make contribution to the claimed invention that is not insignificant in quantity when that contribution is measured against th dimension of the full invention and 3 do more than merely explain to the re inventors wellknown concepts andor the current

inventive c ontribution to the project himself he would not be judged joint inventor87 on the other hand suppose that the chemist had the general idea of the properties of desirable new compound but had idea how to actually make that compound thr ough research the laboratory technician develops the new techniques needed to fo rmulate the compound in such case the chemist and the laboratory

what constitutes joint inventorship are quite difficult to define it is one of the muddiest concepts in the muddy metaphysics of the patent law on the one hand it is reasonably clear that person who has merely followed instructions of another in perfo rming experiments is not coinventor of the object to which those experiments are directed to claim inventorship is to claim at least some role in the final conception of that which is sought to be patented perhaps one need not be able to point to specific component as ones sole idea but one must be able to say that without his cont ribution to the final conception it would have been lessless efficient less simple less economical less something of benefit90 to the extent that these criticisms are accurate they may have negative implications for collaborative research one commentator explains given the minimal and rather vague thus unpredictable standards for determining inventorship the current st ate of the law fosters uncertainty and apprehension regarding the contributions of various researchers or team members participating in the inven tive process in recent years claim of joint inventorship has become an attractive option for disgruntled scientists suing either their former research partners or former employers likewise defendants accused of infringement might endeavor to find an unnamed overlooked and minor contributor to defeat claim of infringement thus the very purpose of the 1984 amendments has been turned on its earrefurbished 116 designed to encourage team research may now be impeding it91 as result some commentators have called for more specific legislative guidance on the joint inventorship standa rd one possible reform would be to stipulate clear rule or possibly list of factors that courts should consider with respect to joint inventorship this legisl ation could be based upon such factors as the amount of contribution made by each put ative joint inventor the relationship between these individuals the overall size of the inventive entity and the technological field of the invention92 on the other hand fashioning workable standard of joint inventorship might prove very difficult

ownership second point of concern relates to the legal consequences of joint ownership as discussed previously if more than one individual qualifies as an inventor of particular patented i nvention then these individuals ar deemed to be joint owners who hold the patent as tenantsincommon95 under this legal arrangement each joint owner owns an undivided interest in the entire property further each joint owner may exploit the patent without requiring consent from the others96 suppose for example that firm and firm b engaged in joint research project among the results of that project was patent that named employees from both firm and firm b as inventors in turn those inventors had previously assigned their rights in their patented inventions to their employers in this hypothetical firm can use th patented invention without regard to firm bs interests and viceversa ne ither firm could prevent the other from exploiting the patented invention nor could one claim share of any proceeds that the other firm earns similarly one firm could freely license or sell its patent rights to another without interference from the other it should be noted that there are two impor tant

patent through infringement litigation therefore although one joint owner can manufacture sell license or othe rwise exploit patented invention without regard to the other joint owners permissi on of the other joint owners must be had prior to commencing an infringement suit in light of the usual rule governing tenancyincommon relationship however some commentators have observed that joint owners of patent are at each others mercy99 the policy basis for this rule ppears to be premised upon creating the maximum opportunity for the patented technology to be exploited in the marketplace100 for example suppose that three di fferent individuals are joint owners of patent under the defa ult rule established by the patent statute anyone who wishes to sell the patented invention need only obtain license from any one of the owners if the rule were otherwise pr ocuring license from all three owners might be more costly and difficult the tenanc yincommon relationship also prevents one of many joint owners from patent fro m holding up the entire transaction by demanding additional royalties or other consideration101 some commentators believe that the tenancyincommon rule may lead to some unjust outcomes in joint research settings however102 following 1984 amendments to the patent statute an individual may be named as an inventor even though he did not make the same type or amount of contribution as othe r inventors or he did not make contribution to the subject matter of every claim of the patent103 however once an individual is named inventor on pa tent he is deemed to be joint

surgical corp104 here dr yoon was named as the inventor of patent relating to surgical tools along with his licensee ethicon yoon brought an infring ement suit against us surgical us surgical subsequently learned that choi an electronics technician had collaborated with yoon and made some cont ributions to the patented i nvention us surgical then promptly obtained license from choi and then asked the court to name choi as co inventor of the patentinsuit due to this license if choi qualif ied as coinventor us surgical would be considered an authorized licensee and be able to preempt the lawsuit altogether us surgicals strategy ultimately prove d successful the district judge ruled that choi was coinventor of two of the 55 claims of the patent insuit and therefore was joint owner of the entire patent105 following an appeal the federal circuit affirmed the court of appeals cited number of circumstantial factors that supported the conclusion that choi had contributed to tw of the asserted patents claims among other factors yoons need fo r person with electronics expertise the length of time they worked together the absence of pay to choi and the similarity between the diagrams in the patent and the drawings in chois notebook each suggested that yoon and choi shoul d be considered joint inventors106 one of the federal circuit judges judg pauline newman issued dissenting opinion in the case her opinion expressed concern that choi who had been shown to have made contribution to only two of the 55 claims of the patentinsuit was now deemed an owner of the entire patent judge newman observed that prior to the 1984 amendments to 35 usc 116 choi w ould not have been considered joint inventor because he had not contributed to each of the patents claims she interpreted 116 as merely permitting the naming of additi onal persons as inventors on patent instrument judge newman further expl ained that being named as an inventor should not necessarily result in full status as co owner because the concepts of joint inventorship and joint ownership are concep tually distinct in her view ownership rights in patent are based on the notion that both inventors d shared equally in developing the invention in such circum stances joint tena ncy system where each inventor owns an undivided share of the tire patent is appropriate according to judge newman given the 1984 changes to th law of joint inventorship the law of joint patent ownership deserved reassessment107 subsequent commentary has largely been sympathetic to the views of the dissenting opinion in

inventorship law 108 in particular broad ception of joint inventorship in combination with tenancyincommon ownership paradigm may allow joint inventor to enjoy economic rewards that are not commensurate with his contribution to the patent believing that this situation frustrates the purpose of patent law observers have called for legislative reforms so that courts can fashion more equitable and economically efficient distributions of patentbased rewards109 number of alternatives to the patent laws current tenancyincommon rules exist in the copyright law for example each joint owner of copyrighted work is free to exercise any of the rights of c opyright owner without the permission of the other joint owners and may also license ot hers to exercise those rights as well however each joint owner must pay propor tional share of any profits she realizes to the other owners110 in theory similar arrangement could be dictated for joint patent owners as well another possibility would be to consider ownership issues on claimbyclaim basis rather than patentbypatent basi s put differently c ourts could determine whether putative joint inventor contributed to the subject matter of the specific claim at issue in particular litigation this pproach would contrast with the current law which inquires whether the putative inventor made contribution to any one of the claims in the asserted patent111 yet another approach would be to attempt to apporti on each owners interest in patent based upon the extent of his tec hnical contribution to the claimed subject matter current law awards each joint owner an equal interest in the patent it would be theoretically possible for courts to make more particularized determinations of the relative merits of each inventors contribu tion this rule could result for example in one joint owner being awarded 70 share in the patent while the other joint owner received 30 share other patent ownership arrangements similar to those disc ussed above may be possible112 in weighing the desirability of any alternative to the current regime one factor to be considered is ease of judicial administration to the extent that these proposals would involve more difficult deter minations than the current tenancyin common standard they are likely to increase the complexity and uncertainty of patent litigation113 another concern may be diminution of the incentives of one joint owner to commercialize the patented invention ev if one joint owne r does not require the permission of others to exploit patented invention in

account for any perceived shortcomings of the tenancyincommon principle by reaching an agreement in advance that stipulates an alternative owne rship relationship as with th patent statutes standards for joint inventorship115 the established ability of collaborative researchers to contract around the patent statute may sugge st that legal reform in this area is not compelling need concluding observations although amendments to the patent stat ute have clarified rules pertaining to cooperative research and development endeavors concerns about the standards of joint inventorship and joint ownership persist these topics represent relatively technical aspects of the patent law they are nonetheless subjects that have been the subject of legislative reform over the past two decades and that are of undoubted importance to collaborative re search although legislati on currently before the 109th congress proposes many reform s to the patent statute116 this proposal would retain rather than refine existing rules with respect to joint inventorship and joint ownership as technologies and market s continue to advance striking balance between encouraging cooperation among researchers while maintaining sufficient patentbased exclusivities to encourage innovation in the fi rst instance will continue to be in the public interest
