historical background the palestine mandate following world war i and the collapse of the ottoman empire the united kingdom was given the mandate for palestine which encompassed what is today jordan isr ael the west bank and the gaza strip1 britains stewardship of palestine was troubled from the beginning as it became embroiled in the struggle between jewish settlers seeking to establish their own state and arab inhabitants who were resisting th efforts because of uncertain data precise population figures for palestine at this time are not available the numbers most frequently cited are from 1922 british census which put the figures at 660000 arabs 84000 jews and 7600 others by 1948 there were an estimated 135 million arabs and 650000 jews2 during the 1920s and 1930s jewisharab relations in palestine worsened and were marked by spasms of violence repeated british efforts to find formula that w ould satisfy all parties succeeded only in further angering and alienating the two sides as world war ii wound down violence in palestine escalated and je wish underground groups began attacking british installations and assa ssinating british officials in february 1947 britain told the general assembly that it wished to relinquish the mandate and asked the new body to settle the issue the 1947 partition plan and the creation of israel the special commission on palestine eventually recommended dividing palestine into jewish state about 56 of the territory and an arab state about 42 of the territory and placing jeru salem about 2 of the territory under international administration3 the general assembly adopted this plan on november 29 1947 as general ssembly resolution 1814 many observers believed the plan was unworkable not least because it left many arabs living in the proposed jewish state the jews saw the decision as imperfect but accepted it as step toward creating the jewish state for which they had worked so long the arabs felt that

may 14 1948 the british withdrew from palestine and the jews proclaimed the independent state of israel in the following days and weeks neighboring arab states invaded the newly proclaimed state of isr ael in palestine when the fighting ended in 1949 israel held territories beyond the boundaries set by the plan total of 78 of the area west of the jordan river jordan held east jerusalem and the

pressed for military action against israel in may 1967 egyp t moved military units into the sinai peninsula and concluded military agreemen t with jordan on june 5 1967 israel assuming war was inevitable launched preemptive air strikes against its arab neighbors6 its subsequent victory over egypt jordan and syria took only six days israel took control of the sinai and the gaza strip from egypt the west bank and east jerusalem from jordan and the golan heights from syria almost 1 million arabs mostly palestinians came under is raeli rule in november 1967 the security council passed resolution 242 calling for israeli withdrawal from territories occupied during the war and the right of every state in the region to live in peace within recognized borders7 the defeated arabs states refused to recognize or negotiate with israel the israeli government decided to keep the territories as bargaining chips in future peace talks many observers believe one consequence of the war was the emergence of stronger sense of palestinian national identity palestinians began to more forcefully advocate for state of their own the palestine liberation organization plo which had been established in 1964 became more militant and portrayed itself as movement struggling for na tional liberation in time the plo became recognized by the palestinian people the arab states and much of the international communityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34074crs3 as the legitimate representativ of the palestinian people israel strongly opposed the plo because of terrorist attacks by its component groups and because its charter at the time aimed to destroy the state of israel the october war and camp david in 1973 the arabs led by egypt and syria launched surprise attack on israel in part to regain the lost territory catching israel off guard the arab armies made initial advances but eventually israel drove the arab forces back to roug hly the 1967 ar mistice lines by 1977 with the panarab dream shattered egyptian president anwar sadat offered peace if israel withdrew from the occupied lands and agreed to palestinian state in 1978 following vigorous diplomatic efforts by presiden t carter egypt and israel signed framework agreements that led to the egyptianisraeli peace treaty and israels withdrawal from the sinai and promised autonomy talks for palestinians in the west bank and gaza the autonomy talks however never materi alized and other arab states did not accept the camp david accords in th mid1970s israeli nationalistreligious groups accelerated their campaign to establ ish jewish settlements in the occupied territories in 1977 when the rightwing li kud party came to power in israel for the first time the government began backing the settlement enterprise more intensivelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34074crs4 the first intifa da uprising growing sense of frustration set in among palestinians during the 1980s over the lack of progress in finding durable resolution of their nationalist claims in decembe r 1987 after four gaza palestinians were killed by an israel defense force idf tr uck in traffic accident rioting broke out and quickly spread through the territories initially palestinian youth hurled stones and molotov cocktails at idf soldiers lthough in some later clashes hand grenades and guns were used the idf struggled at first to contain the

uprising put the palestinian question back on the international agenda in july 1988 in response to the months of dem onstrations by palestinians in the west bank jordan ceded to the plo all jordanian claims to the territory to try and fill the political vacuum in november 1988 the palestine nationa l council the plo legislature declared the establishment of the state of palestine in accordance with general assembly re solution 181 the 1947 partition plan though symbolic the plos declaration was seen by many as tacit recognition of israel and acceptance of twostate solution from the palestinian perspective by engaging the israelis directly rather than relyin g on neighboring arab states the palestinians reinforced their identity as separate nation wort hy of selfdetermin ation the impact on israelis was equally profound many observers have noted that the first intifada demonstrated to many israelis that something they had come to take for granted the occupation of the west bank and gaza could not continue indefinitely the oslo years by the early 1990s the intifada the end of the cold war and the changed international climate led israels new labor government and the plo to conduct secret negotiations in osl norway to settle the conflict the breakthrough came in 1993 and the resultin g agreements often called the oslo accords included letters of mutual recognition between israel and the plo the establishment of palestinian interim selfgoverning authority in the west bank and gaza and fiveyear window in which to conclude final status deal the new palestinian authority pa d directly elected presid ent and legislative council elected separately the pa assumed full control of major west bank cities and limited control in other areas however palestinian rejectionist violence and israeli settlement building in the terr itories undermined the proce ss nonetheless in july 2000 president clinton invited israeli prime minister ehud barak and plo chairman yasir arafat to camp david to press them to conclude final status deal baraks offer went further than any prev ious israeli offer but still fell short of palestinian demands the summit collapsed and the two sides traded accusations over who was to blame the second intifada and israels withdrawal from gaza i n september 2000 with tensions high then opposition leader ariel sharon visited the temple mountharam alsharif in jerusalems old city site holy to both jews and muslims the visit sparked palestinian riots in jerusalem which quickly spread through the territories igniting the second or

historians have noted that the concept of pales tinian national identity is relatively recent phenomenon and in large part grew from the challenge posed by zionism in the first half of the 20th century13 palestinian identity first emerged during the british mandate period began to crystalize with the 1947 partition pl an and grew stronger following israels conquest of the west bank and gaza stri p in 1967 although in 1947 the united nations intended to create two states in palestine one jewish and one arab only one came into being the arab state was stillborn victim of the military triumph of the new jewish state the failure of the palestinians and some allege the collusion of arab and british leaders14 today the palestinian publics desire to establish state of their own on at

local political arm in decem ber 1987 following the eruption of the first intifada hamas combines palestin ian nationalism with is lamic funda mentalism its founding charter commits the group to the destruction of israel and the establishment of an islamic state in all of historic palestine17 hamas rejected the oslo accords boycotted the 1996 elections and has waged an in termittent terrorist campaign to undermine the peace process its military wing the izz aldin alqassam brigades18 has carried out hundreds of terrorist attacks since 1993 killing more than 500 israelis the us state department has designated hamas as foreign terrorist organization fto hamas owes much of its popularity to an extensive social services network suppor ted by donations from palestinians other arabs and international charitable fr ont groups it funds schools orphanages mosques healthcare clinics soup kitchens and sports leagues in the west bank and gaza fatahs political hegemony inside the occupied territories was undermined by the inability of the plo and later the pa to coopt or incorporate hamas which proved more resistant than its secular rivals to the plos inducements the independence of this islamic group has created constant sense of ambivalence as to where the center of gravity in palestin ian politics lies par ticularly between 2000 and 2004 the popularity of hamas began to increase as fatahs fell hamas made strong showing in series of munici pal elections held between december 2004 and december 2005 still most observers were rprised by the scale of hamass victory in the january 2006 legislative election hamas won 74 of the 132 seats in the plc19 fatah won 45 seats and sm aller parties claimed the remainder hamass popular vote victory was far narrower 44 to fatah s 41 most observers believe that the hamas victory was functi on of several factors including complicated mixed electoral system that rewarded hamas s better organization and party discipline disaffection among younger marginaliz ed political activists and general disenchantment with fata h over its inability to deliver peace and good governance20 yet despite the electoral tback observers point out that fatah has done little to purge its ranks of corrupt discredited officials or adopt norms of honesty and transparency in order to regain the publics trust one scholar noted that fatah party leaders seem to be more intent on shortterm maneuverings against hamas and each other than the longterm viability of the party21 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34074crs9 21 continued june 2007 22 steven erlanger academics view differences within hamas new york times january 29 2006hamass decision to participate in the plc election may have intensified internal strife and threatened the organi zations vaunted unity there appears to be split between hardliners such as hamas political chief khalid mishal who lives in exile in damascus and mahmoud zahhar gazan considered close to mishal and more pragmatic figures such as current prime minister ismail haniyeh observers differ however on how far such split may go those who believe hamas is wedded to its violent antiisraeli agenda point to its deeply held religious views as expressed in its charter writte n in 1988 the charter is explicit about the struggle for palestine being religious ob ligation it describes the land as waqf or religious endowment saying that one can abandon it or part of it in the charter hamas describes itself as distinct palestinian movement which owes its loyalty to allah and that strives to raise the banner of allah over every inch of palestine it calls for the elimination of israel and jews from islamic holy land and portrays the jews as evil citing antisemitic texts these observers also note that hamas leader is on record as sanctioning permanent recognition of israels right to exist side by side with an independent palestinian state or as expressing willingness to disarm or to stop attacks on israel and israelis or to make distinction between israeli soldiers and civilians22 other observers see hamas as more pragmatic evolving movement they note that hamas has already moderated its positions by pa rticipating in the 2006 plc election body created by the oslo accord s which the group has long rejected and by expressing willingness to enter into longterm ceasefire or hudna with israel most importantly they say hamas signed the mecca accord in which it agreed to share power with fatah respect previous agreements signed by the plo and allow the plo to negotiate with israel and sub mit any agreement reached to the palestinian people finally they note that the plo also once terrorist group albeit secular one altered some of its tenets in the late 1980s nd early 1990s under pressure from the united states and agreed to condemn rrorism recognize israels right to exist and negotiate for twostate solution other rejectionist groups several other small palestinian groups c ontinue to reject the plos decision to recognize israel and negotiate twostat solution they remain active in the territories and retain some ability to carry out terrorist attacks and other forms of violence to undermine efforts at cooperati on and conciliation the largest of these is the palestinian islamic jihad pij designated foreign terrorist organization that like hamas is an offshoot of the muslim brotherhood the pij estimated at 1000 members emerged in the 1980s in the gaza strip as rival to hamas inspired by the iranian revolution it combined palestinian nationa lism sunni islamic fundamentalism and sh iite revolutionary thought the pij seeks liberation of all of historical palestine through armed revolt and the establishment of an islamic state but unlike hamas
