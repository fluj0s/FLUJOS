provides an overview of empl oyment related issues when business files in bankruptcy under the us bankruptcy code 11 usc 101 et seq as amended by the bankruptcy abuse prev ention and consumer protection act bapcpa1 business employer will genera lly file under one of two of the operative chapters of the code it may seek to cease operation and liquidate under chapter 7 or to continue in business and reorganize under chapter 11 the status of basic benefits such as wages pensi ons and health care for active and retired employees which have to date been the s ubject of greatest concern to employees of company in bankruptcy are examined the behavior and compensation of btors executives have become more controversial in recent years corresponding to many highprofile bankruptcies for example those of enron and worldcom that were caused in part if not solely by managerial malfeasance as opposed to exte rnal economic factors this report considers compensation of btors management as well employee benefits many employees especially retirees f ear loss of all empl oyment benefits upon learning that their employer has filed in bankruptcy fortunately this is not necessarily the case although some bene fits may be subject to modification or termination it is importa nt to know that employee benefits including retiree benefits have universal gal referent they may be c overed by wide variety of federal and state laws more important though is the fact th at specific employee welfare benefit plans are governed by cont ract terms which vary from plan to plan and each bankruptcy and the consequences for each of the debtors creditors including its employees is highly case specific unique to bankruptcy however is the demarcation between prepetition prefiling and postpetition postfiling claims because the entire bankruptcy proce ss is concerned with debt forgiveness of prebankruptcy indebtedness the classification of claim as pre or postpetition is of great consequence determining whether claim accrues pre or postpetition is not always clear cut active employees of an employer in chapter 11 reorganization typically chapter 11 debtor will get an order from the bankruptcy court permitting it to continue business and to compensate its employees just as it had prior to filing postpetition operating expenses are considered to be high priority administrative

employees of chapter 11 debtor will realize change in the terms and conditions of their employment the bapcpa amended the code to also include back pay ie prepetition wages due to employees as consequence of illegal behavior by the debtor as an administrative expense the bankruptcy court must deter mine that the inclusion of back pay will not substantially increase the probability of layoff or termination of current employees3 in traditional employmentatwill situa tions debtoremployer may lay off employees or attempt to renegotiate the terms of employment just as the employee is free to accept different compensation structure or terminate the employment relationship these contingencies may occur in connection with the debtoremployers bankruptcy but there are special requirements for chapter 11 debtor seeking to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees rejection of collective bargaining agreements in 1984 the us supreme court held that collective bargaining agreement cba could be rejected ie terminated by debtor4 in response to the courts interpretation congress enacted statute which prescribes the pro cedures that debtor in chapter 11 must take before it may alter the terms of or terminate collective bargaining agreement5 after petition is filed if the debtor wish to alter or terminate the collective bargaining agreement it must supply the authorized representative of the employees complete and reliable information to demonstrate the need in order to facilitate reorganization for the modifications to the employees benefits and protections the employees and debtor are required to engage in good faith negotiations with respect to proposals for alteration or termination of such agreements if the debtor files an application to reject cba the court is directed to schedule hearing for not later than fourteen days after the filing all interested parties may attend and participate in the hearing and the court should rule on the application within thirty days after the beginning of the hearing the court may approve the pplication for rejection only if it finds i that the debtor prior to the hearing provided the authorized representative of the employees with the necessary information ii the authorized representative has refused to accept the proposal without good cause and iii the balance of the equities clearly favors rejectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33138crs3 6 11 usc 507 7 this amount will be adjusted at threeyear intervals to reflect changes to the consumer price index 11 usc 104in addition the court may after

rejection active employees of an employer in liquidation if an employer must shut down it is likely to file under chapter 7 in this chapter the court appoints trustee who oversees the debto rs liquidation the debtors assets are reduced to cash and distributed among creditors lthough chapter 7 traditionally governs liquidation debtor may also liquidate its business under ch apter 11 when business closes health and life insurance benefits are terminated because unlike pensions they are not prefunded pensi on assets for the reasons discussed below are generally held in trust for the empl oyee and are not available to the debtors creditors common scenario in bankruptcy invol ves an employer who at the time of filing is in arrears in the payment of wages or contributions to employee benefit plans that require continuous funding em ployees who have contractual claim to payment are considered unsecured creditors the code establishes priorities for the payment of unsecured claims6 with the exception of administrative expenses disc ussed above priority claims generally cover prepetition debts because prio rity unsecured claims are paid before nonpriority claims there is much greater chance for creditor to realize payment for those having priority status as am ended by the bapcpa fourth priority is designated for unsecured claims for wages salaries or commissions but only to the extent of 10000 for each individual includi ng vacation severance and sick leave pay earned by an individual or corporation within 180 days before the date of filing or the date of the cessation of the debtors business whichever occurs first or for sales commissions earned by an individua l or by corporation with only one employee acting as an independent contractor in the sale of goods or services for the debtor7 fifth priority is similar to the fourth but governs unsecured claims for contributions to an employee benefit plan arising from services rendered within 180 days before the filing or cessation of the debtors business but only to the extent of the number of employees covered by each such plan multiplied by 10000 less 1 the aggregate amount paid to such employ ees under the fourth priority and 2 the aggregate amount paid by the estate on be half of such employees to any other employee benefit plan hence the fourth and fifth employee priorities together have

bankruptcy priority for prepetition employee wages and benefits including severa nce pay is an important benchmark in liquidation scenario it means that each em ployee with claim in this category will be near the head of the line for distribution of the pr iority amount nonpriority unsecured claims will be distributed pro rata among unsecured creditors including employees the priority is significant in reorgani zation as well the priority amount must be paid through the reorganization plan in order for it to be c onfirmed by the court as noted above the priority is conferre d on claims accruing prior to the bankruptcy filing severance earned postpetition how ever may qualify for an administrative expense priority9 claims for severance particularly those asserting priority as postpetition administrative expenses will be evaluated according to several factors and decided under the law of the federal circ uit the court will consider the terms of the agreement establishing severance including whether it is payable in lump sum or is based on length of service and when it was ag reed to determination of when the benefit accrues pr or postpetition is not always readily apparent and rules governing it may also vary among the circuits prior to the bapcpa the priority amount for prepetition employee benefits including severance was capped at 4925 earned within 90 days

negatively impact worldcoms relationship with its current employees th payments were necessary to restore the confidence of current employees whose coope ration and loyalty were essential to the reorganization effort pension benefits federal law does not require an employer to provide health insurance or pensions to employees although the tax laws are designed to encourage employers to provide these benefits they may be altered or terminated within or outside of bankruptcy the creation and administration of priv ate sector pension plans are governed exclusively by the employee retirement income security act erisa13 in 1974 congress enacted erisa to protect the interests of private sector participants and beneficiaries in wide variety of empl oyee welfare benefit and pension plans prime underlying policy of the act articulated by the supreme court is the congressional guarantee that if worker has been promised defined pension benefit upon retirement and if he has fulfilled whatever conditions are required to obtain vested benefit he will actually receive it14 because of erisas comprehensive regulatory sche pension benefits are the least likely of employee benefits to be affected by bankruptcy although they may be diminished or reduced in several situations thus employees in many of the defined benefit legacy industries such as steel airlines and more recently automobile parts manufacturers have experienced substantial reductions in their pensions as result of bankruptcyrelated di stress terminations there are wide variety of taxqualif ied employee

guaranty corporation pbgc there is signifi cant trend away from traditional defined benefit plans discusse d below to new hybrid pensi on plans such as cash balance plans which are form of defined benefit plan insured by the pbgc15 defined benefit pension plan s may be terminated voluntarily by an employer or involuntarily by the pbgc an employer may terminate plan voluntarily in one of two ways it may proceed with standard termination only if it has sufficient assets to pay all benefit commitments standard termination does not therefore implicate pbgc insurance responsibilities if an employer wishes to terminate plan whose assets are insufficient to pay all benefits the employer must demonstrate that it is in financial distress as defined by erisa the concern connected with distress termination is the adequacy of the plans funding that is is there enoug h money to support payment of the pension commitment this is where the pbgcs pension insurance program which is funded by employer paid premiums is implicated16 if an underfunded corporate pension plan is terminated the pbgc in surance program guarantees some payment to covered employees the pbgc then seeks recovery of the deficiency from the employer asserting lien therefor if necessary although the pbgc guaranty program is designed to minimize the impact of corporate bankruptcy on the debtors retirees when an underfunded pension plan is terminated the pbgc imposes statutory ceiling on guaranteed payments thus beneficiaries of an underfunded terminated plan may receive payments that are substantially less than promised neither standard nor distress termination by the employer is permitted if termination would violate the terms of an existing collectivebargaining agreement but negotiations in bankruptcy are influenced by the prospect of the debtors possible liquidati on the pbgc ma nonetheless terminate plan involuntarily notwithstanding the existence of collectivebargaining agreement likewise termination can be undone nd restoration ordered by pbgc when plan is restored full benefits are reinstated and the employer rather than the pbgc is again responsible for the plans unfunded

employers reserve right to modify or terminate employee welfare benefit plans and do so outside of bankruptcy19 courts reviewing plan alteration or termin ation generally base their decisions on the specific terms of plans documents or associated collective bargaining agreement in bankruptcy the status of retiree life nd health insurance benefits is largely determined by the nature of the action chapter 11 reorganization versus liquidation under chapter 7 or chapter 11 the reorganization of the ltv corp proved to be prime force behind clarification of the bankruptcy codes trea tment of retirees health and life insurance benefits during reorganization on the same da it filed in bankruptcy in 1986 ltv corp notified more than 66000 retirees of its intention to terminate health and life insurance coverage under the companys em ployee benefit plan acting swiftly to express its disapproval of ltvs interpretation of the bankruptcy codes requirements congress enacted legislati on blocking ltvs ce ssation of insurance payments on the retirees behalf20 then in 1988 congress amended the code by adding new 11 usc 1114 entitled payme nt of insurance benefits to retired employees the procedures for debtors termination of retiree insurance benefits are modeled after those for termination of collectivebargaining agreements in chapter 11 in summary 1114 provides that debtor in reorganization may not terminate health and life insurance payment programs maintained for retirees and their spouseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33138crs8 21 11 usc 1114l 22 at least one court has held

proposed modifications in benefit payments with representatives of the retirees and second seeking and receiving court approval to make the modifications if the debtor and the retirees cannot agree upon modifications and the debtor believes them to be necessary to permit reorganization the court may permit modifications subject to statutory guidelines the debtor must have negotiated with the re presentative of the retirees in good faith and the court after hearing in which all parties have had an opportunity to be heard must find that the proposed modification is necessary to permit the reorganization of the debtor and assures that all creditors the debtor and all of the affected parties are treated fairly and equitably thus in the course of chapter 11 reorganization in which the debtor continues to operate the business it must continue to pay retiree health and life insurance benefits unless it has negotiated necessary modi fications or termination of payments with the representatives of the affected group or has received the bankruptcy courts permission to do so payments made are accorded high priority administrative expense status the bapcpa amended 1114 to add

covered employee the period of coverage is limited to 36 months after the death of the covered employee although cobra provides reti rees lifetime coverage it is contingent upon the employers maintaining the plan for curre nt employees continuation coverage for all qualified beneficiaries terminates on the date when the employer ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee ie when the plan ends cobra may be useful safety net if an employer in bankruptcy terminates retiree health plan but continues to offer hea lth benefits to current employees in that event retirees would

employees who are victims of wrongdoing may wonder if they can assert those claims in the bankruptcy and increase their distributive share of the debtors assets it is frequently said that debtor in

claim is in itself complicated issue the courts have discretion to consider the most ppropriate manner to handle an unliquidated contingent claim whet her it should be estimated or whether the stay should be lifted the goal of the ba nkruptcy process is to fix an amount ie assign value for claim in order to expedite reorganization to determine whether reorganization itself is feasible and to assist the parties in fashioning plan it is also necessary to create yardstick to enable the court to apply the best interests of the creditor test for chapter 11 debtor the court cannot confirm chapter 11 reorganization plan unless creditors will r eceive more under the plan than if the debtor were liquidated38 and of course creditors ar constrained by practical strategic considerations litigation is an expensive proposition and it may not be worthwhile in the face of looming prospect of the debtors having inadequate assets to satisfy the claim simply put does the potential

reduction credit of 85 million representing the policy limits on two fiduciary liability policies40 basically in return for releasing defendants from further claims for indemnity or contribution arising from erisa based claims the plaintiffs will collect insu rance proceeds the district court judge is quoted as explaining without question this settlement is driven by the need to preserve for the plaintiff class the insurance policy proceeds which otherwise are likely to be consumed by litigation defense costs this factor works to justify settlement for less than what plaintiffs might obtain if they tinued to prosecute their claims through trial only to find that the actual recovery has gone up in smoke41 in another proceeding the us dept of labor announced an agreement that would

creditor may have perfectly legal cl aim bankruptcy law declines to permit or allow it generally for the purpose of maximizing the debtors estate for distribution to all creditors one example of such

pilots flight attendants mechanics and reservation agents explaining its rationale th court observed the bankruptcy code does not specifically address socalled key employee retention plans or kerps whether dopted before the filing of bankruptcy petition or after it is comm on however for bankruptcy courts to approve the adoption of postpetition kerps or the assumption of prepetition kerps if the debtor has used proper business judgment in adopting the plan and the plan is fair and reasonable in re aerovox inc 269 br 74 80 bankrdmass2001 nevertheless kerps have something of shady reputation all too often they have been used to lavishly reward at the expense of the creditor body the very executives whose bad decisions or lack of foresight were responsible for the debt ors financial plight but even where external circumstances rather than the exec utives are to blame there is something inherently unseemly in the effort to in sulate the executives from the financial risks all other stakeholders face in the bankruptcy process congressional concern over kerp excesses is clearly reflected in changes to the bankruptcy code that will become effective for cases filed after october 17

both the circumstances under which severance and retention payments may be made to insiders as well as the amount of such payments which will be limited to 10 times the average amount of severance or retention payments for nonmanagement employees during the same calendar year51 in support of their objections the us trustee and the unions argued that the plan was overly broad and would undercut employee mora by sparing management from financial sacrifices that th unionized workforce had to bear first the court considered whether the debtor made threshold showing that it used sound business judgment in adopting th plan it concluded that there can be little doubt based on the evidence that the plan is in response to serious retention problem because there were 340 unfilled open positions the court ultimately approved modified kerp that applied to management employees below the officer level upon approval but deferred applicability to senior level officers until plan confirmation of the objections to the program surely the most compelling from purely human point of view is that it represents betrayal of the principle of shared sacrifice that was championed by the company in the litigation and negotiations that resulted in over 900 million of wage and other concessions by its unionized workforce while management employees took some pay cuts and benefit reductions the plain truth is that those cu ts were significantly less than the cuts experienced by the nonmanagement employees it is hardly any wonder therefore that the rank and file employees have reacted to the proposal with considerable outrage as evidenced for example by the petition that was admitted at the hearing signed by 2209 members of the communications workers of america denouncing the propos ed severance plan and urging this court not to approve it the court is certainly sensitive to what one witness described as the uproar in the workplace after the company announced it would seek approval of the severance plan at the same time the court cannot ignore the fact that the landscape has significantly changed at the time the labor concessions were negotiated the company was headed along particular path that of transformation now it is headed on diffe rent path that of merger under transformation plan employeeswhether management or rank and filewere equally likely to keep their jobs i f the company successfully emerged from chapter 11 as viable airline or to them if the company had to liquidate under the proposed merger by contrast few of the unionized employees are likely to face the loss of their jobs since there is little overlap in the route structure of the two airlines howeve r somewhere between onethird and onehalf of the management employees are expected ultimately to lose their jobs the problem the company faces is that those management employees will be needed up until the day their employment is terminated perhaps two years from now if they leave too soon the merger itself and with it the jobs of the rank and file employees will be threatened the argument that the program is too broad and that any retention benefits should be narrowly targeted to critical or key employees likewise misses thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33138crs17 52 idat 799800 53 official committee of unsecured creditors of cybergenics corp v chinery 330 f3d 548 3d cir cert denied 540 us

eliminating its ability to carry the company through the merger put another way once football team has been reduced to 11 players ev ery one of them is critical since you cannot field team with fewer52 although postpetition retention and verance payments are substantially modified by the bapcpa the foregoing illustrates how bankruptcy court attempts to balance economic and non economic competing intere sts and claims in the reorganization process the court has less contro l over prepetition payments although they can be avoided in some circumstances such as when they are found to be fraudulent as discussed above in the enron bankruptcy ne vertheless there is an inherent tension in the policy decision to allow existing management to steer prospective debtor through reorganization when selfpolicing is also an issue the implicit conflict of interest that can arise between chapter 11 debtor company its management and its creditors is acknowledged by the courts us court of appeals considered whether bankruptcy court can authorize creditors committee to sue derivatively on behalf of the trustee to recover alleged fraudul ent conveyances made by management53 it concluded that courtappr oved derivative suit for the benefit of the debtors estate was permi ssible under the bankruptcy code as component of its analysis the cour t observed that avoiding fraudulent conveyance could be particularly vex ing problem in chapter 11 context this situation immediately gives rise to the proverbial problem of the fox guarding the henhouse if trustee is appointed the debtorreally the debtors managementbears fiduciary duty to av oid fraudulent transfers that it itself made one suspects that if managers can devise any opportunity to avoid bringing claim that would amount to reputational selfimmolation they will seize it for that reason courts and commentators have acknowledged that the debtorinpossession often acts under the influence of conflicts of interest these conflicts of interest can arise even in situations where there is concern that debtors management is trying to save its own skin for example debtor may be unwilling to pursue claims against individuals or businesses such as critical suppliers with whom it has an ongoing relationship that it fears damaging finally even if bankrupt debtor is willing to bring an avoidance action it might be too financially weakened to advocate vigorously for itself in any of these situations the real losers are the unsecured creditors whose interests avoidance actions are designed to protect54 in conclusion although the bankruptcy code presumes that debtor companys management is best qualified to lead the debtor through the reorganization process there are equitable and statutory mechanis ms to address inten tional wrongdoing andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33138crs18 less damaging departures from sound business judgment and while there is substantial flexibility in the reorganization process and employees are provided some level of protection there is question that the reorganization process is used strategically by business debt ors to shed what are perceived to be onerous employee
