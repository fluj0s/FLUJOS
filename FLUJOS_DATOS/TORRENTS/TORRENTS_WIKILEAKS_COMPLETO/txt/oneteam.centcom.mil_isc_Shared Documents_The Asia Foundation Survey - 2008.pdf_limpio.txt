in the 12 months since the asia foundation conducted its last survey of afghan public opinion in the summer of 2007amidst slow but steady gains in vital basic amenities and services and some successes inreconstruction efforts across the country the conflict resulted in significantly higher civilian and military casualties food shortages in many regions became severe with severalmillion afghans facing nearstarvation this coming winter and inflation and unemployment continued to rise the country and the international community now confront presidential and other elections in 2009 and 2010 in this context the asia foundation conducted its fourth annual nationwide survey of afghan public opinion in summer 2008 the aim as with the other nationwide surveysthat were conducted in 2006 and 2007 and the more limited survey in 2004 was to gather firsthand opinion of large sample of afghan citizens on variety of contemporarygovernance and developmentrelated issues such that the information generated is usefulfor policy makers and opinion shapers in government the international community andthe broader afghan public every effort is made to ensure that the questions asked andthe information collected on public opinion is actionable and with each passing yearthese surveys have become more acceptable and wider used both as valid and reliablebarometer of public opinion in afghanistan as well as public policy tool the asia foundations first nationwide survey was conducted in 2004 primarily to assess the knowledge and attitude of the electorate regarding the countrys first national elections presidential elections held in october 2004 the objective then was to equip thefoundation and other nongovernmental organizations with accurate data to help designand deploy voter education messages and campaigns the 2004 survey covered 804respondents from 29 of the then existing 32 provinces of the country this survey helpedargue the case for larger annual survey effort that could gauge and analyze public opinion in more differentiated manner at regional and provincial levels this in turn led tothe larger surveys conducted in 2006 2007 and now in 2008 with the support of the usagency for international development the survey conducted in 2006 was the first of the large annual surveys it collected the opinion of 6226 respondents from 32 of the 34 provinces of the country the 2006 survey provided significant policyrelevant data and established baseline for measuringpublic perceptions on subjects such as democratic governance and values role of political parties civil responsibilities and rights the place of religion in the evolving politywomens rights and other issues in 2006 in addition to the basic survey report thefoundation also released followup analytical volume titled state building political progress and human security in afghanistan that contained papers by experts who looked at the sur vey in greater and comparative detail on issues such as democratic progress levels of trustin institutions and the advancement of women in afghan society1 afghanistan in 2008the 2007 survey used sample of 6263 people from all 34 provinces of the country the survey came halfway through the term of the incumbent government in year when antigovernment forces were expected to mobilize in large numbers and the country was coming off record year in poppy cultivation these circumstances presented specialopportunity to gauge public opinion the 2008 survey interviewed 6593 afghans from each of the 34 provinces of afghanistan the security situation in some provinces was not very conducive to surveywork at the time of the fieldwork and there was some risk of not reaching respondentsin these areas fortunately however the field teams were prepared to use alternate sampling points and adjust for insecurity and logistical difficulties in order to cover all theprovinces and obtain representative sample of views the 2008 and previous surveys use standard questionnaire for comparability which combines questions on afghanistan that are relevant to policy makers social researchersand donor organizations with tried and tested questions that have been used in othercountries across the world in wellknown surveys like the east and south asia barometers and the latin pop surveys as well as other asia foundation surveys in bangladesh cambodia indonesia philippines and nepal each year some questions are added tocover new areas of interest and other less significant or less salient questions are removedfeedback received from each years survey is used to further finetune the survey instruments for 2008 the survey questionnaire was first revised inhouse and then sent toselect experts stakeholders and donors for review and suggestions acknowledging theintense focus on subnational governance and the upcoming 2009 elections relevantquestions in these subject areas were added to the basic questionnaire some standardquestions were rephrased wherever it was felt that clearer and more useful responsescould be obtained some design changes were also made to the sampling to increase the spread of the inter views to larger area and counter any cases of homogeneity in responses due to closelyclustered samples in significant adjustment to fieldwork this year additional qualitycontrol measures were built in to improve on the accuracy of the data collection interview backcheck teams from the foundations own staff supplemented the standard backchecks conducted by fieldteam supervisors as in previous years the foundation continued its emphasis on using the survey program to help improve afghan capacity in conducting research of this kind over the past twoyears the foundations fieldwork partner the afghan center for socioeconomic andopinion research acsor has been able to build team with the capacity to undertakeextremely large diverse and sensitive surveys across the country in 2008 total of 543interviewers up from 494 interviewers used in 2007 were used for data collection among its other capacitybuilding activities the foundation also supports research internship program that trains apprentices and places students from kabul university in2afghanistan in 200820072008 12 students underwent foundationsponsored internship with acsor fol lowing which several interns were placed at foundation cost with research organizationsin kabul current capacitybuilding activities also include training in the statisticalpackage for social sciences spss for personnel from the afghan governments centralstatistics

sunil pillai andnajibullah amin managed the overall survey project in kabul following the release of this survey report the foundation will release companion ana lytical volume in december that reflects on the 2008 findings of afghan public opinionlike the companion volume produced in 2006 this years effort will add expert commentary to the findings discuss trends in comparative light with other countries in theregion and from other data sources and draw policyrelevant conclusions the asia foundation kabul afghanistan october 20083 afghanistan in 20081 executive summary 11 key findings z although on declining trend since 2006 38 percent of survey respondents say the country is moving in the right direction while 32 percent say it is moving in thewrong direction and 23 percent have mixed views there is clear trend towardsgreater pessimism over the last two years z the security situation is both the main reason respondents give for saying the country is moving in the right direction and the main concern for those who say thecountry is moving in the wrong direction the proportion of respondents who citeinsecurity as reason for pessimism has increased by onefourth in the past year z the biggest problems faced by afghanistan as whole are identified as security36 economic issues including unemployment 31 high prices 22 pooreconomy 17 and corruption 14 z overall the proportion of respondents who have positive view of the security situation in their local area has decreased in most regions since 2007 respondentsreport an improvement in security conditions in the central hazarajat west and eastregions but consistent degradation in security conditions since 2006 in the southwest south east and central kabul regions see appendix 4 for reference map z large majority of respondents 82 are against poppy cultivation however attitudes have evolved in markedly different ways between regions since 2006 the proportion of respondents who say that poppy cultivation is wrong has increasedsharply in central hazarajat and the north east whereas the proportion who disapprove of poppy cultivation has decreased in the south east and east z unemployment is seen as major problem at both local 28 and national 31levels seventyeight percent of respondents say that the availability of jobs in theirlocal area is very low only seven percent of respondents report any improvementin employment opportunities over the last two years z the most important local problems relate to lack of basic infrastructure such aselectricity 30 water 22 and roads 18 the availability of electricity isconsidered particularly bad in the north east east and south west z the biggest problems faced by women in afghanistan continue to be the lack ofeducation and illiteracy 45 for the third year running5 afghanistan in 2008z the most widely enjoyed amenity is the availability of education for children which is judged by 70 percent of respondents to be good fortyfour percent of respondents report improvements in access to schools in the last two years z the proportion of respondents who say they are more prosperous today than theywere under the taliban government has decreased significantly since 2006 from54 to 36 in 2008 while those who say that they are less prosperous now hasincreased from 26 percent in 2006 to 36 percent in 2008 z twothirds of respondents 67 give positive assessment of the performance ofcentral government although the proportion of those saying that the governmentis doing bad job has almost doubled since 2007 the governments performanceis judged most positively with respect to the provision of education and healthcarerespondents are least positive about government performance in the economicarena and in combating corruption z at the local level respondents are most satisfied with the performance of provincial government 74 followed by district authorities 67 respondents are leastsatisfied with the performance of municipal authorities 50 satisfaction withgovernment at all levels has fallen since 2007 z public opinion about the justice system both informal and formal remains positive respondents continue to have higher level of trust and confidence in traditional dispute resolution mechanisms than they do in the modern state justice system particularly in rural areas satisfaction with shura and jirga mechanisms is higher than that for state courts in terms of accessibility 76 vs 68 fairness andtrustworthiness 70 vs 50 their effectiveness in following local norms and values 69 vs 50 and delivering justice 69 vs 52 both systems are judgedleast positively on the timeliness of their procedures 50 vs 38 z again in 2008 the most common definition of democracy mentioned by respondents is freedom followed by peace the proportion of respondents who mentionfundamental principles of democracy such as government of the people and rightsand law has fallen consistently since 2006 z more than twothirds of respondents 68 say that they are satisfied with theway democracy is working in afghanistan however significant levels of dissatisfaction are recorded in the south west 44 south east 35 and east33 of the country6afghanistan in 2008z local representative bodies both formal and informal enjoy the confidence of around twothirds of respondents including shura and jirga 69 communitydevelopment councils 65 and provincial councils 65 z nearly half of rural respondents 47 and quarter of urban dwellers 23 areaware of community development council cdc in their locale across thecountry as whole awareness of cdcs has risen from 37 percent of respondentsin 2006 to 42 percent in 2008 z just over half of respondents 53 are aware of the forthcoming 2009 electionsand just under half 48 say they know how to register to vote around threequarters of respondents 77 say they are likely to vote however positiveresponses on all these issues are significantly higher amongst men than women z seventytwo percent of respondents express some level of confidence in theafghan government to manage free and fair election process in the future themost important challenge is seen to be insecurity followed by weak governmentand corruption z fiftyone percent of respondents use the radio as their main information source fornational news and twentyone percent use television television is the preferredinformation source for over half of the respondents in urban areas 12 summary thirtyeight percent of survey respondents say that the country is moving in the right direction while 32 percent say it is moving in the wrong direction and 23 percent have mixed views however there is clear trend towards greater pessimismover the last two years the number of those saying that the country is moving inthe right direction has decreased steadily since 2006 whereas the number of thosewho say the country is moving in the wrong direction has increased security issues are identified as the biggest problem in afghanistan as whole and are the major factor shaping both optimistic and pessimistic views of the directionof the country however it is clear that security issues in afghanistan have predominantly localised dimension the survey finds that in 2008 the security situationin afghanistan is becoming more polarized with respondents in some places feeling secure most of the time and others experiencing relatively constant levels ofinsecurity overall the proportion of respondents who have positive view of thesecurity situation in their local area has decreased in most regions since 2007respondents report an improvement in security conditions in central hazarajat7 afghanistan in 2008west and east regions but steady degradation in security conditions since 2006 in the south west south east and central kabul regions both the proportions ofrespondents who say they often fear for their safety and those who report neverfearing for their security have increased since 2007 further emphasising the clumping of deteriorated security conditions in different parts of the country as in previous years the survey finds that compared to their level of fear for per sonal safety respondents actual experience of violence and crime is relatively lowwhen respondents were asked about the kinds of violence and crime they hadexperienced interpersonal violence or threat of violence is the most significantoverall followed by property crimes the experience of different kinds of crime in2008 is largely similar to that recorded in previous years except in the south westand south east where it has risen significantly making these the most crimeproneregions in the country the survey finds that most respondents would feel safe to participate in range of public activities that happen within their community such as resolving problems atthe community level or voting in national election however they are significantly more fearful of engaging in public political actions such as participating in apeaceful demonstration or running for public office women are more fearful thanmen about participating in resolving problems in the community or in peacefuldemonstration however there is significant difference in the proportions ofmen and women who say they would fear voting in national election or runningfor public office as in previous years the afghan national army ana and afghan national police anp enjoy the highest levels of public confidence of all government institutions however respondents express significant concerns about the capacity ofthese institutions to operate effectively without external assistance consideringthem unprofessional and poorly trained the proportion of respondents expressing these concerns has decreased since 2007 suggesting that there is perceptionthat ana and anp capacity is improving large majority of respondents are against poppy cultivation however attitudes have evolved in markedly different ways among regions since 2006 the proportionof respondents who say that poppy cultivation is wrong has risen sharply in centralhazarajat and the north east whereas the proportion who disapprove of poppycultivation has fallen in the south east and east those who approve of poppy cultivation do so principally for economic reasons such as employment creation andprofitability for farmers and workers which is consistent with concerns about8afghanistan in 2008unemployment as one of the most important national and local problems those who oppose poppy cultivation do so mostly for religious reasons because it is forbidden in islam significant proportion of respondents mention the link betweenpoppy cultivation terrorism corruption and crime only tiny proportion say theyoppose poppy cultivation because it is against the law in 2008 economic issues have gained prominence as major national problems com pared to 2007 particularly the issue of high prices related to the global crisis in foodprices unemployment and poor economy since 2006 there has been significantfall in the proportion of respondents who say that they are more prosperous todaythan they were under the taliban government indicating that respondents feel ahigher level of dissatisfaction with the economic situation of their families in 2008than they have done in previous years unemployment is identified as major problem at the local level and there is seen to have been very little improvement in employment opportunities over the last two yearsexpectations of future improvement are lowest in this area and significant proportion of respondents expect availability of jobs to be even lower in the coming year the other most important local problems identified by respondents concern basic infrastructure such as access to electricity water and lack of roads and essentialpublic services such as healthcare and education electricity supply remains one ofthe most problematic local amenities and emerges as the top development priorityin 2008 access to electricity varies widely between urban and rural areas and amongdifferent regions on the other hand the majority of respondents judge the availability of clean drinking water to be good in their local communities and continuedimprovements are expected in this area in the next year the biggest problem faced by women in afghanistan continues to be lack of edu cation and illiteracy for the third year running lack of womens rights and lack ofjob opportunities for women also feature high on the list the most widely enjoyed amenity is the availability of education for children education has fallen to fifth place amongst development priorities in 2008 probably because respondents report significant improvements in this area in the last twoyears nevertheless respondents also have high expectations for improvements inthis area in the coming yearthe majority of development programmes are seen to be targeting priority development issues such as education reconstruction building of roads and bridges or9 afghanistan in 2008water supply and healthcare the afghan government is seen as the primary agency responsible for economic development initiatives supply of public amenities suchas electricity and water and the provision of basic public services across the country around onefifth of respondents are aware of the governmentled development plan for their province although awareness differs widely betweenprovinces of those who know about the governmentled development plansnearly twothirds have some knowledge of the type of development activitiesproposed for their province overall assessments of the performance of central government are positive partic ularly with respect to the provision of basic public services the governments performance is judged most positively with respect to the provision of education andhealthcare but least positively in the economic arena and in combating corruptionat local level respondents are most satisfied with the performance of provincialgovernment followed by district authorities and are least satisfied with the performance of municipal authorities however satisfaction with government at all levelshas decreased since 2007 one of the issues affecting satisfaction with government is corruption which tinues to be perceived as major problem at all levels the perception of the prevalence of corruption tends to strengthen as the distance of the institution frompeoples daily lives increases corruption is also more often perceived to beincreasing at higher levels of government the perceived prevalence of corruption should be source of significant concern since institutions in which survey respondents frequently report corrupt practices also register particularlylow levels of public confidence another issue affecting respondents satisfaction with government is increasing dis enchantment with the responsiveness of elected representatives in addressing localproblems that are important to people positive assessments of the performance ofparliament in addressing the countrys major problems has fallen since 2007 and thesame is true of assessments of the performance of members of parliament mpsin addressing the major problems of their constituencies local representative bodies both formal and informal including provincial councils community development councils and traditional shura and jirga enjoythe confidence of the majority of respondents awareness of the existence ofcommunity development councils cdcs continues to rise particularly in ruralareas where they primarily operate as in previous years membership of cdcs isprincipally perceived to include influential local leaders but there are also significant10 afghanistan in 2008indications of the representation of less powerful social groups such as ordinary farmers landless agricultural workers and women the vast majority of those whoare aware of the local cdc are satisfied with its performance the survey also contains other indications of widening social participation in deci sionmaking twothirds of respondents feel that they are able to influence government decisions to some significant degree this represents significant increase inconfidence in personal efficacy since 2006 in addition there has been rise since2006 in the proportion of respondents who say religious leaders should be consulted in public decisionmaking the survey finds that respondents assessed both traditional dispute resolution mechanisms and modern state justice system positively in terms of their accessibility fairness and trustworthiness and their effectiveness in following local normsand values and delivering justice but least positively on the timeliness of their procedures levels of satisfaction are higher for shura and jirga across all domainsviews are mixed on the ability of the formal justice system to address crime bybringing the guilty to justice the survey finds slight preference for using statecourts to resolve land disputes and divorce cases particularly amongst women informal justice mechanisms are also frequently approached to help address local problems to report crime or to resolve disputes particularly in rural areas recourseto informal justice mechanisms is highest in the east and south east whereas thosein the north east and in central kabul prefer to use formal structures levels ofsatisfaction are considerably higher amongst those who ve taken their cases to local shurajirga than those who have taken their cases to the state courts and thisdifference has grown since 2007 the survey findings demonstrate that formal andinformal justice mechanisms are not seen as opposites but rather as part of continuum of institutions available to assist with addressing crimes and disputes again in 2008 the most common definition of democracy mentioned by respon dents is freedom followed by peace and these are also the most commonly mentioned personal benefits that respondents think democracy will bring indicating thatachieving peace and freedom for its citizens will be the acid test for many afghansof the success of the current system of democratic government by contrast theproportion of respondents who mention fundamental principles as the definitionof democracy such as government of the people and rights and law has beendecreasing consistently since 2006 the proportion of respondents who believethat democracy challenges islamic values has also been decreasing steadily since2006 although this view is still held by quarter of respondents particularly in rural11 afghanistan in 2008areas in low income households or among those who have never gone to school overall the majority of respondents say that they are satisfied with the way democracy is working in afghanistan however significant levels of dissatisfaction arerecorded in the south west south east and east regions of the country the survey finds increasing ambivalence about freedom of action for political par ties the majority of respondents agree that the government should allow peacefulopposition however support for allowing parties to hold meetings in local areashas decreased steadily since 2006 the survey also shows that tolerance and acceptance of different political viewpoints has diminished since 2006 as higher proportion of respondents say that different party affiliations would end their friendshipwith others public confidence in political parties remains low suggesting that thepolitical party system has not yet been established as key component of democratic political processes in afghanistan respondents demonstrate continued confidence in the efficacy of voting to bring about change however nearly twice as many respondents believe that votingshould be based on community preferences rather than individual preferences justover half of respondents are aware of the 2009 elections and just under half knowhow to register to vote around threequarters of respondents say they are likely tovote however positive responses on all these issues are significantly higheramongst men than women suggesting that the gender disparity in electoral participation seen in the 2004 and 2005 elections could be replicated in the elections in2009 the most common reason for not voting in the next elections is securityfuthermore the proportion of respondents who report having interest in theelections continues to rise disenchantment with elections is further emphasised bythe significant proportion of respondents who say that they will not vote becausethe elections will not make any difference quarter of female respondents whoare unlikely to vote in next years election say that this is because they will not bepermitted to do so this figure is nearly twice as high as the proportion of womenwho reported that they were not permitted to vote in elections in 2004 and 2005a worrying trend if it translates into practice the majority of respondents express some level of confidence in the afghan gov ernment to manage free and fair election process in the future the most important challenge in this regard is seen to be insecurity followed by weak governmentand corruption12 afghanistan in 2008the percentage of respondents who say that there is freedom of expression in their area has been decreasing steadily since 2006 the survey finds that physical security conditions are at least as important as the legal guarantee of freedoms in ensuring that afghan citizens enjoy freedom of expression the proportion of respondents who mention bad security conditions as the main constraint on their freedomof expression has increased significantly in the past two years the vast majority of respondents express support for the principle of equal rights under the law regardless of their gender ethnicity or religion this extends to highlevels of support for gender equality in educational participation but to much lesser degree to equal opportunities for women to work outside the home slightmajority of respondents both men and women have objection to being represented by woman on any governance body although women have much strongerbelief in equality of representation at political leadership level than do their malecounterparts levels of support for gender equality are systematically higheramongst those with higher levels of education there has been substantialchange in responses regarding women working outside the home or having equalopportunities in education since 2006 this is not particularly surprising as evolution in social attitudes to gender equality is process that takes place over muchlonger time periods however respondents views on womens participation in elections are clearly correlated with their other views on gender equality this demonstrates that encouraging the increased participation of women in political and socialaffairs depends on broadbased change in attitudes towards gender equality radio continues to be the most commonly used medium of communication in both rural and urban areas and the main source of information for national news making it still the best medium to reach the widest audience in afghanistan howeveraccess to most other media sources is much higher in urban rather than rural areasuse of print media is less common and is largely confined to those with higher levels of education particularly men whose literacy rate is twice that of women andthose living in urban areas around half of the respondents use meetings in thecommunity and meetings or sermons at mosques for getting news and information about current events however men are much more likely to get informationin this way than women which indicates the continuing challenges for communicating important information to women in afghanistan using formal media orcommunity fora13 afghanistan in 20082 the national mood 21 direction of the country for the third year running the survey sought to gauge how people assess the over all situation in afghanistan respondents were first asked whether they think thecountry is moving in the right direction or the wrong direction the most commonview held by 38 percent of respondents is that the country is moving in the rightdirection however sizeable proportion 32 say it is moving in the wrong direction about quarter of respondents 23 have mixed views on the overall direction the country is taking overall women have slightly more positive view with 40 percent saying that the country is moving in the right direction compared to 35 percent of menrespondents in urban areas have more negative view than those in rural area with37 percent of urban dwellers saying than the country is moving in the wrong direction as compared with 31 percent of respondents living in rural villages there are also significant differences in opinion across the regions see appendix 4 for reference map more people living in the north east 56 east 47 andnorth west 46 are optimistic about the overall situation of the country than thoseliving in other regions views are particularly negative in the south of the countrywhere only around quarter of respondents 25 in the south west and 23 in thesouth east say that the country is moving in the right direction though the overall mood of the country continues to be optimistic there has been clear trend towards greater pessimism over the last two years the proportion ofrespondents saying that the country is moving in the right direction has declinedsteadily from 44 percent in 2006 and 42 percent in 2007 to 38 percent in 2008similarly fewer people report having mixed feelings about the direction the country is taking falling from 29 percent in 2006 to 23 percent in 2008 on

of respondents identifying insecurity as the biggest problem in afghanistan fell from 46 percent in 2007 to36 percent in 2008 however the issue of high prices has shot into prominence tobecome one of

often mentioned by respondents is access to electricity 30 around one infive identify other basic infrastructure such as water 22 and lack of roads 18basic infrastructure problems are significantly more often highlighted as prioritiesin urban areas than in rural settings unemployment is identified as major problem at the local level by similar pro portion to those who see this as major national problem 28 compared to 31however it is given significantly greater priority by respondents in rural areas 30as compared to those in urban areas 23 basic public services such as health care 15 and

2007 and 2008 fig 34 these findings suggest that the security situation in afghanistan is becoming more polarised with some places feeling secure most of the time and others experiencingrelatively

centralkabul regions whereas theproportion of those who report never having any fear has been rising in the northwest north east east and central hazarajat regions as one might expect the degree of

areas 39 of rural as compared to 45 of urban respondents agreement with positive statements about theanp is also significantly lower in insecure areas such as the south east and southwest and somewhat lower in the western region than in other parts of the country respondents clearly have significant concerns about the anps capacity to operate the majority of respondents to the survey agree with the statements that the anp isunprofessional and poorly trained 60 and that it cannot operate by itself butneeds the support of foreign troops 69 interestingly though agreement withthese negative perceptions has also fallen since 2007 when 65 percent of respondents said the anp was unprofessional and 77 percent agreed that it could notoperate without assistance 35 perceptions of the afghan

experienced under the talibangovernment 19962001 more than third 39 report that their families aremore prosperous today than they were during the days of the taliban regimehowever similar proportion 36 say they are now less prosperous since 2006 there has been significant fall in the proportion of respondents who say that they are more prosperous today than they were under the taliban government more than half of respondents 54 said this in 2006 and nearly half 49in 2007 as compared to just over third 36 in 2008 similarly those who say theyare less prosperous now has risen from around quarter of respondents 26 in2006 to more than third 36 in 2008 these results seem to indicate thatrespondents feel higher level of dissatisfaction with the economic situation oftheir families in 2008 than they have done in previous years this more negativeassessment of family economic prosperity is largely congruent with the identification of economic issues including unemployment high prices and poor

of the most significant issues affecting the effectiveness of government insti tutions in afghanistan is corruption the survey attempted to document the perception of corruption at all levels of government it also sought to assess theimpacts of corruption on different facets of life respondents were asked whetherthey think corruption is major problem minor problem or problem at all intheir daily life their neighbourhood their local authorities their provincial government and in afghanistan as whole most respondents think that corruption is major problem at all levels of govern ment to varying degrees however perceptions of the prevalence of corruption rise58 afghanistan in 2008 822 52045 01020304050 very good job somewhat good jobsomewhat bad jobvery bad job dont knowas the distance of the institution from peoples daily lives increase for around half of respondents feel corruption is major problem in their neighbourhood 48 and intheir daily life 51 this rises to nearly

the survey then attempted to measure the incidence of corruption in particular areas of public life by asking respondents how often in the past year they had hadto give cash gift or perform favour when they had contacted government officials responses indicate that the majority of contacts with government institutionsdo not involve corrupt practices and that peoples overall perception of the prevalence of corruption is higher than their personal experience of it the situations inwhich respondents have most frequently encountered corruption are in dealing withthe judiciarycourts 51 applying for jobs 50 and receiving official documents49 at least third of respondents also report having encountered corruption inreceiving basic public services including healthcare 42 electricity supply 40and admissions to schools or universities 32 around forty percent of respondents have had similar experience in dealing with law enforcement agencies like theafghan national police 40 and

particularly low levelsof public confidence including municipalities 42 confidence the governmentjustice system 46 and the public administration as whole 55 see chapter 2 confidence in institutions

urban areas particularly in central kabul and the northeast while contact with elected representatives at both national and local levels issignificantly higher in central hazarajat than in the other regions when asked whether the problem for which they sought help has been resolved respondents experience was mixed around half 48 report that the problemhas been resolved while similar proportion 46

majority of people who approached traditional institutions at the community level like mullah shurajirga and malikkhan had theirproblems solved the majority of problems taken to the state security forces theana and anp had also been resolved the efficacy of these groups and institutions in assisting the resolution of local problems is probably significant contributing factor to the levels of public confidence they enjoy see section 27 confidence in specific institutions and organizations table 23 on the other hand only around third of respondents who approached govern ment authorities at

addressing the major problems of my constituency in the parliament q87b base 6593 fig 510 the negative view of the performance of local mps is clearly influenced by public attitudes to politicians and the widely held view that they principally serve their owninterests rather that those of their constituents respondents to the survey wereasked whether they agree or disagree with the statement politicians seek power fortheir own benefit and dont worry about helping people three quarters 76 saythey agree with this statement including 41 percent who strongly agree fewer thanone in five 19

addressing the major problems of the constituency see 57 role of elected representatives however they also highlight the fact that the afghan public is not very clear either about the appropriate roles elected representatives can play for example twothirds of respondents find their mp unresponsive in the south west 67 which is likely to be reflection of the high proportion of security and dispute related issues brought to mps although mps are generally unlikely to be able to exert any significant level of influence over issues ofthis kind similarly 58 percent of respondents in the central hazarajat report getting help from mps which is likely to reflect the fact that half of the problemsraised related to the lack of roads and bridges on the other hand the majority ofrespondents report that their mp was helpful in resolving local problems in thewest 65 north west 61 and eastern 60 regions finally respondents were asked whether the problem was resolved regardless of who helped third of respondents 33 report that the problem has been solvedwhereas twothirds 64 say it has not this suggests that better ways need to befound for identifying and responding to local problems 59 contact with provincial council representatives respondents were asked whether they have ever contacted representative of the provincial council pc for help in solving any of their personal or local problemsagain an overwhelming majority has not done this 87 only 11 percent say theyhave contacted pc representative for assistance these figures have remained constant since 2006 respondents who had contacted pc representative for help 11 of all respon dents were further asked for what kind of problem they had sought help the survey finds that people contact pc representatives for the same reasons as they contact mps again problems related to basic infrastructure are most prominentincluding electricity and water 18 and roads and bridges 15 disputes overland 9 and security problems 9 are also frequent causes for contact as areproblems with essential public services including lack of assistance to teachers 5and building clinics 4 however twice as many respondents have asked for

relevant respondents in the eastern region 52 urban dwellersare more likely to report crime to an authority 70 than their rural counterparts61 the survey also found that respondents with higher educational levels aremore likely to report crime than those who never went to school respondents who say they reported violence or crime were also asked to which authority or authorities they reported the majority of respondents mention government authorities nearly half 48 say they reported the crime to the afghannational police anp twentytwo percent say they reported to local government official such as district governor however significant proportion say theyreported the crime directly to informal or traditional institutions such as tribal leaders or maliks 24 and shuraelders 16

nearly one in five respondents 21 say they did notreport the crime because they thought it would make difference significant proportions also mention danger or fear of retaliation 18 and lack of trust in government officials 17 as the reasons for not reporting crime women are particularly deterred from reporting crime by danger or fear of retaliation 23 compared to 13 of men this is also more significant factor for respondents inurban areas 24 as compared to those in rural areas 17 danger or fear ofretaliation is particularly emphasized in the south west 29 west 22 centralkabul 22 and

judicial system would punish the guilty party little over half of respondents 56 saythey would have significant level of confidence while 38 percent say they wouldhave little or confidence including 15 percent who say that they would have noconfidence at all these responses reveal that sizeable proportion of the population does not believe that the formal justice system is able to address crime

while39 percent said state court significant proportion 17 reported having takentheir case to both kinds of institution confirming again the fact that respondentsdo not necessarily see formal and informal justice mechanisms as alternatives butas part of continuum of dispute resolution mechanisms available to them themajority of those living in urban areas tend to go to state courts 67 while thelargest proportion of those living in rural areas tend to go to shurajirga 45rural residents are twice as likely to take their case to both the state court andshurajirga 18 as urban residents 9

benefit from peace as corollary of democracy rather than seeing it as defining characteristic for example in thecentral kabul region 41 percent of respondents expect that democracy will bringthem peace while only 33 percent say that this is the meaning of democracy thesame is true in the central hazarajat where 38 percent expect to benefit from peacebut 28 percent think it is core element of

on responsesmore people who had passed tenth grade 48 say they would accept such afriendship than those who have never gone to school 40 the 2008 findings suggest that tolerance and acceptance of different political view points has diminished since 2006 the proportion of respondents who say that different party affiliations would end their friendship has increased from 38 percent in2006 to 44

respondents 72 express somelevel of confidence in the afghan government to manage the election processincluding nearly one quarter 23 who say they are very confident only 18 percent of respondents say they do not have confidence including 10 percent who saythey have confidence at all levels of confidence have not changed substantially since 2006 there are some significant differences in confidence

percent of respondents is insecurity this appears to be much greater concern in 2008 than in 2007when it was mentioned by only 24 percent of respondents lack of confidence ingovernment in general also accounts for significant proportion of responsestwenty eight percent of respondents cite weak government up from 25 percent in2007 and 11 percent mention corruption although this is almost half the

permitted to vote this was the case for one in eight female respondents 13 but male respondents gave this astheir reason women not being permitted to vote is likely to provide partial explanation for the low turnout of women during elections lack of engagement with the political process is also frequently cited as reason for not voting including lack of interest in the elections 12 and not supportingany candidate 5 only six percent say that they did not vote in 2004 for security reasons this is now the major concern for the effective management of elections in the future see above concerns about security were most prominent in the south west 14 and central hazarajat 12 in addition 10 percent of respondents in the south westsay they did not vote because of fear of intimidation

considerably more men 48 than women38 say that they are very likely to vote whereas nearly twice as many women13 as men 7 say they are very unlikely to these results suggest that the disparity in

percent in 2008this demonstration of disenchantment with the electoral processes is furtheramplified by the significant proportion of respondents 15 who say they will notvote because the elections will not make any difference the highest levels of disenchantment are in the north east where almost third of respondents 31 saythey have interest in the elections and fifth 22 say that the elections willmake difference quarter of respondents in the east also say they have nointerest in the elections 27 and similar proportion in the north west say thatthe elections will make difference 27 quarter of the female respondents who are unlikely to vote in next years election 25 say this is because they will not be permitted to do so this figure is nearly twice as high as the proportion of women who report that they were not permitted to vote in elections in 2004 and 2005 13 worrying trend if it translates into practice you said it is somewhat or very unlikely that you would vote in the upcoming

response to this question has risen significantly from 13 in 2006 to 16 in 2007 and 21 in 2008 this suggests acertain level of ambivalence to the amount of freedom of expression that existsin their

public services for women such as education and healthcare problemsassociated with womens rights and the norms of womens roles in traditional society are significantly more often mentioned by respondents in rural areas the lack of job opportunities for women is also identified by about quarter 24 of respondents particularly in the north west where 42 percent of respondents saythis is the biggest problem faced by women the problem of job opportunities forwomen is significantly higher priority for low income households 35 of households with monthly income of less than 2000afs as

starting points house holds and finally the respondent is presented in the following sections 3 selection of settlements and starting points the settlements within districts were selected randomly by the field director based on the lists of the existing settlements within each district each sampling point was assigned starting point and given direction the start ing points were recognizable locationssuch as mosques schools bazaars etcwithin each of the selected settlements for the survey the locations were verifiedby supervisors during the backchecking procedures 4 household selection in urban areas from the given starting point the interviewer headed in the assigned direction and stopped at the first streetlane on the righthand side of hisher routefrom there on the first contacted household was the fourth house on the right fromthe beginning of the street further on the selected household was each third inhabitable house on the right side of the interviewer route in blocks of flats the selectionroutine was each fifth apartment in rural areas the interviewer started from the center of the village or the bazaar mosque etc and went to the right selecting each third inhabited house onhisher route compounds containing two or more houses behind commonwall were treated like detached houses counting them counterclockwise fromthe gate to the compound 5 respondent selection and substitution in the selected household the information about all the household members was first collected from the list all the members aged 18 years and above were arrangedin descending order of age one respondent was randomly selected using the kishgrid in case the selected respondent refused to be interviewed or was not availableafter call backs replacement in the household was done instead the interviewer moved on to the next household according to the random walk procedures 6 callbacks rate method and results typically interviewers were required to make two callbacks before replacing the designated respondent due to securityrelated fears in previous projects the fieldforce has had difficulty meeting the requirement of two callbacks prior to substitution in this survey while the field force was able to complete some callbacks themajority of the interviews were completed on the first attempt 968 percent 3 per134 afghanistan in 2008cent of the interviews were completed on the second attempt and 10 interviews were completed on the third attempt due to the high rate of unemployment andcorrect choice of the appropriate time of day for interviewing completion on thefirst attempt is the norm in afghanistan 7 training of interviewers while the fieldwork supervisors were given briefingtraining in kabul the train ing for interviewers was conducted by fieldwork supervisors in their
