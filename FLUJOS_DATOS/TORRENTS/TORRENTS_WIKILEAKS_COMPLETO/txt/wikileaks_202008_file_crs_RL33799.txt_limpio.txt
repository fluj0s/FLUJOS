specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division climate change design approaches for greenhouse gas reduction program summary two events provide impetus for revisiting the cost issue with respect to designing greenhouse gas reduction program the first is the election of new president publicly committed to substantial reductions in greenhouse gases over the next several decades the second was passage of the 2005 sense of the senate climate change resolution calling on the congress to enact mandatory market based program to slow stop and reverse the growth of greenhouse gases and which states that the program should be enacted at rate and in manner that will not significantly harm the united states economy and will encourage comparable action by other nations facets of the cost issue that have raised concern include absolute costs to the economy distribution of costs across industries competitive impact domestically and internationally incentives for new technology and uncertainty about possible costs marketbased mechanisms address the cost issue by introducing flexibility into the implementation process the cornerstone of that flexibility is permitting sources to decide for themselves their appropriate implementation strategy within the parameters of market signals and other incentives that signal can be as simple as carbon tax or comprehensive credit auction that tells the emitter the value of any reduction in greenhouse gases to credit marketplace that is constrained by ceiling price safety valve and includes incentives for new technology as illustrated here the combinations of market mechanisms are numerous allowing decision makers to tailor the program to address specific concerns in general marketbased mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the most important being carbon dioxide co2 focus on specifying either the acceptable emissions level quantity or the compliance costs price and allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution for the other variable for example tradeable permit program sets the amount of emissions allowable under the program ie the number of permits available limits or caps allowable emissions while allowing the marketplace to determine what each permit will be worth likewise carbon tax sets the maximum unit cost per ton of co2 equivalent that one should pay for reducing emissions while the marketplace determines how much actually gets reduced in one sense preference for carbon tax or tradeable permit system depends on how one views the uncertainty of costs involved and benefits to be received the options discussed here represent continuum between alternatives focused on the price side of the equation eg carbon taxes through hybrid schemes eg safety valves to alternatives focused on the quantity side eg banking and borrowing they are tools to assist in the assessment of potential greenhouse gas reduction approaches

summary of selected options to address cost uncertainty of greenhouse gas reduction programs 24 list of tables table 1 2005 us greenhouse gas emissions 4 climate change design approaches for greenhouse gas reduction program climate change has been continuing policy issue since the united states ratified the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc an integral part and sometimes driving part of the ensuing debate has been the issue of cost in several manifestations1 for the george w bush administration the kyoto protocol was fatally flawed in fundamental ways including requiring compliance with mandates that would have negative economic impact with layoffs of workers and price increases for consumers2 this concern about cost can also be seen in the senates most recent resolution on climate change in 2005 samdt 866 echoing the language of its 1997 resolution sres 98 on the same subject the 2005 sense of the senate resolution on climate change declared that mandatory marketbased program to slow stop and reverse the growth of greenhouse gases3 should be enacted at rate and in manner that will not significantly harm the united states economy and will encourage comparable action by other nations4 facets of the cost issue that have raised concern include absolute costs to the economy distribution of costs across industries competitive impact domestically and internationally incentives for new technology and uncertainty about possible costs because stalemate has persisted on strategies to control greenhouse gas ghg emissions particularly because of cost uncertainties attention has increasingly focused on options to address these concerns and to move the debate forward these options range from incremental mechanisms within tradeable permit program such as banking and borrowing of credits which minimally affect overall emissions reduction targets to more fundamental proposals such as carbon tax which would take climate change policy in new and somewhat uncharted direction this paper explores these options to address the cost issue in four parts first the basic economic tradeoff between controlling the quantity of ghg emissions and the programs compliance costs is introduced and explained second the five 1 for an analysis of federal policy and congressional debate since ratification of unfccc see crs report rl30024 global climate change policy cost competitiveness and comprehensiveness by larry b parker and john blodgett 2 president george w bush president bushs speech on global climate change june 11 2001 3 the six gases recognized under the kyoto protocol are carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o sulfur hexafluoride sf6 hydrofluorocarbons hfc and perfluorocarbons pfc 4 samdt 866 passed by voice vote after motion to table failed 4354 june 22 2005 crs2 dimensions of the cost issue that have arisen so far in the climate change debate are identified and discussed third representative sample of proposed approaches to address cost concerns is compared and analyzed according to the five cost dimensions identified previously finally the proposed options are summarized and opportunities to combine or merge different approaches are analyzed the paper does not provide detailed discussion of allocation and implementation issues that creating marketbased mechanism particularly capandtrade program would entail introduction the price versus quantity debate in general marketbased mechanisms to reduce ghg emissions the most important being carbon dioxide co2 focus on specifying either the acceptable emissions level quantity or the compliance costs price and allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution for the other variable for example tradeable permit program sets the amount of emissions allowable under the program ie the number of permits available limits or caps allowable emissions while permitting the marketplace to determine what each permit will be worth likewise carbon tax sets the maximum unit cost per ton of co2 equivalent that one should pay for reducing emissions while the marketplace determines how much actually gets reduced in one sense preference for carbon tax or tradeable permit system depends on how one views the uncertainty of costs involved and benefits to be received for those confident that achieving specific level of co2 reduction will yield significant benefits enough so that even the potentially very high end of the marginal cost curve does not bother them tradeable permit program may be most appropriate co2 emissions would be reduced to specific level and in the case of tradeable permit program the cost involved would be handled efficiently though not controlled at specific cost level this efficiency occurs because through the trading of permits emissions reduction efforts focus on sources at which controls can be achieved at least cost however if one feels uncertain of the environmental benefits of specific level of reduction and anxious about the downside risk of substantial control costs to the economy then carbon tax may be most appropriate in this approach the level of the tax effectively caps the marginal cost of control that affected activities would pay under the reduction scheme but the precise level of co2 reduction achieved is less certain emitters of co2 would spend money controlling co2 emissions up to the level of the tax however because the marginal cost of control among millions of emitters is not well known the overall emissions reductions for given tax level on co2 emissions is subject to some uncertainty hence major policy question is whether one is more concerned about the possible economic cost of the program and therefore willing to accept some uncertainty about the amount of reduction received ie carbon taxes or one is more concerned about achieving specific emissions reduction level with costs handled efficiently but not capped ie tradeable permits crs3 model for tradeable permit approach is the sulfur dioxide so2 allowance program contained in title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments 42 usc 7651 also called the acid rain program the tradeable permit system is based on two premises first set amount of so2 emitted by human activities can be assimilated by the ecological system without undue harm thus the goal of the program is to put ceiling or cap on the total emissions of so2 rather than limit ambient concentrations second market in pollution licenses between polluters is the most costeffective means of achieving given reduction this market in pollution licenses or allowances each of which is equal to 1 ton of so2 is designed so that owners of allowances can trade those allowances with other emitters who need them or retain bank them for future use or sale initially most allowances were allocated free by the federal government to utilities according to statutory formulas related to given facilitys historic fuel use and emissions other allowances have been reserved by the government for periodic auctions to ensure market liquidity there are existing us models of an emissions tax although five european countries have carbonbased taxes5 the closest us example is the tax on ozone depleting chemicals odcs to facilitate the phaseout of odcs under the montreal protocol and subsequent amendments the united states imposed tax on specific odcs in 1990 this tax was designed to supplement the allowance trading program that the epa had designed to implement the international agreements several activities trigger the tax including the production andor importation of the chemicals or the importation of products that contain them or used them in their production processes in addition inventories of certain odcs held on january 1 of each year are subjected to floor stocks tax6 five dimensions of the cost issue five dimensions of costs associated with reducing ghg emissions are discussed in this section 1 absolute costs 2 distribution of costs 3 longterm costs 4 price signal and stability and 5 uncertainty of costs the absolute costs of ghg reduction program are function of the interplay among the tonnage reduction required the timetable imposed on that reduction and the techniques available and used to achieve that reduction the three ts variables involved with the tonnage requirement include the magnitude and firmness of the reduction requirement and the number of gases and sectors involved in the program variables involved with the timetable include its length and number of phases along with the number and extent of any deadline extensions allowed and on what basis finally variables involved with techniques include promotion and availability of new technology the degree of flexibility permitted in complying with 5 finland the netherlands sweden denmark and norway 6 for cfc11 and 12 the current 2006 tax is 1030 per pound the floor stocks tax is 045 per pound 2006 for more specifics on the current tax level see irs form 6627 environmental taxes crs4 the program and any ceiling on compliance costs all these program design parameters influence the absolute cost of the program and the timing and extent of any benefits received second concern with costs is their distribution across the various sectors of the economy as indicated by table 1 ghg emissions are spread throughout the economy with about 81 emitted by the electric power transportation and industry sectors restricting participation by any group could increase the absolute cost of the program and would certainly increase the costs to the remaining participants however numerous rationales have been put forward to justify excluding one group or sector from reduction requirement or to provide some other special consideration rationales offered include sector or industrys concern about 1 international competitiveness 2 lack of costeffective control options 3 inability to make necessary capital investments 4 economic disruption 5 credit for previous efforts that reduced emissions and 6 the minor contribution that industry or sector makes to the overall problem it is the multitude of such variables that make constructing an acceptable reduction allocation scheme very difficult table 1 2005 us greenhouse gas emissions million metric tons of economic sector co2 equivalent percentage of total electric power industry 2430 337 transportation 2009 279 industry 1353 188 agriculture 595 83 commercial 431 60 residential 381 53 total 7199 1000 source us environmental protection agency inventory of us greenhouse gas emissions and sinks 19902005 epa 430r07002 washington dc p es14 note the total does not include 62 million metric tons from us territories third concern is the longterm cost considerations of ghg reduction program climate change policy has to be thought of in decades not years ultimately successful climate change program would involve longterm transition to less carbonemitting economy generally studies that indicate the availability and costeffectiveness of emerging new technologies to achieve this transition include an economic mechanism to provide the necessary longterm price signal to direct research development demonstration and deployment efforts7 developing such price signal involves variables such as the magnitude and nature 7 for example see interlaboratory working group scenarios for clean energy future ornlcon476 november 2000 crs5 of the market signal and the timing direction and duration of it in addition studies indicate combining sustained price signal with public support for research and development efforts is the most effective longterm strategy for encouraging development of new technology8 as stated by morgenstern the key to long term research and development strategy is both rising carbon price and some form of government supported research program to compensate for market imperfections9 fourth consideration is the stability of the price signal in whatever form it takes eg allowance prices carbon taxes auction prices stable and reliable signal is necessary to minimize economic disruption and to encourage new technology experience with existing emissions markets suggests that shortterm price spikes and troughs occur that have at least shortterm economic effects either disrupting the market in the case of high prices or discouraging new technology in the case of low prices causes of this volatility can include 1 lack of trading volume 2 illiquidity in the market 3 external events and 4 regulatory uncertainty history with previous emissions trading programs suggests that if greenhouse gas program is based on marketbased implementation strategy the inclusion of flexibility mechanisms to ensure reasonable market stability is desirable10 final cost consideration is the cost uncertainty presented by the wide range of projected costs of ghg reduction to the extent one understands the variables that create the range presented by different forecasting models one can design program to address those variables projected costs of proposed greenhouse gas reduction program will differ among models based on the various economic and technological assumptions either embedded in the particular models processes endogenous variables or assumed externally and inserted into the model weyant has identified five assumptions that explain many of the differences in greenhouse gas reduction program cost estimates11 8 for example see cera advisory service design issues for marketbased greenhouse gas reduction strategies special report february 2006 p 59 congressional budget office evaluating the role of prices and rd in reducing carbon dioxide emissions september 2006 9 richard d morgenstern climate policy instruments the case for the safety valve council on foreign relations september 2021 2004 p 9 10 for example see dallas burtraw david evans alan krupnick karen palmer and russell toth economics of pollution trading for so2 and nox resources for the future march 2005 david harrison jr ex post evaluation of the reclaim emissions trading program for the angeles air basin organization for economic cooperation and development january 2122 2003 and andrew aulisi alexander farrell jonathan pershing and stacy vandeveer greenhouse gas emissions trading in us states observations and lessons from the otc nox budget program world resources institute 2005 11 john p weyant an introduction to the economics of climate change policy pew center on global climate change july 2000 crs6 basecase projections of future ghg emissions and climate damages the specifics of the reduction program examined particularly the amount of flexibility permitted in complying with its mandates how dynamic the model is representing substitution possibilities by producers and consumers including the turnover of capital equipment how the rate and processes of technological change are modeled how benefits are modeled figure 1 below illustrates how these and other variables such as type of model used can influence the estimated costs of climate change legislation measured by impact on gdp the figure indicates impacts generally ranging from positive 2 increase in gdp to 4 decrease interestingly the variables used in projecting cost and benefits are sufficiently robust to obscure strong correlation between cost and reduction requirements the range indicated also reflects the perspectives and parameters assumed by the forecast authors in previous report crs noted that cost analyses are influenced by the perspective or lens through which one views the problem12 analysts viewing climate change policy through technological perspective see it as an impetus for improved efficiency through technology improvements in the economy consistent with concepts such as lifecycle costs analysts viewing policy through an economic lens work through the boundaries of market economics and costbenefit considerations finally analysts viewing the issue through an ecological lens look to the benefits of controlling greenhouse gases and are suspicious of baseline scenarios that suggest that business as usual is an acceptable yardstick from which to measure policy changes each of these lenses implies fundamentally different ways of assessing policy actions and modeling potential costs and benefits the quantitative results are cost estimates that range from actual savings to the economy from ghg reductions to substantial costs 12 see crs report 98738 global climate change three policy perspectives by larry parker and john blodgett crs7 figure 1 the predicted impacts of carbon abatement on the us economy 162 estimates from 16 models source robert repetto and duncan austin the costs of climate protection guide for the perplexed world resources institute 1997 p 12 approaches for addressing cost concerns the following analysis of options to address the cost concerns identified above is loosely arranged by the focus of the specific option 1 the tonnage requirement 2 the time frame and 3 the techniques allowed for compliance it should be noted that several options examined affect more than one of the ts also the options are not mutually exclusive many can be combined to create more refined options tonnage options much of the discussion on ghg reductions has focused on historic baseline as the starting point for reductions assuming that the emissions inventory for specific year is adequate to support regulatory program whether marketbased or not such baseline is reasonable most existing emissions trading programs are based on historic baseline with modifications however there are options to calculate baseline that responds to economic events over time without necessarily compromising the tonnage cap also the historic baseline can be eliminated in favor of different methods of achieving specific reductions crs8 dynamic tonnage target another approach to address some of the concerns identified above is to calculate the tonnage target based on economic or other indexes or measures rather than strictly on historic or other static baseline for example the national commission on energy policy recommended that the tonnage requirements for ghg reduction program begin with year 2000 emissions with the future trajectory of emissions based on the product of progressively declining limit on the countrys ghg intensity times projected economic growth over time the progressively more stringent carbon intensity index would produce progressively more stringent emissions tonnage caps despite projected increases in economic growth the actual steepness of that path would depend on the rate of decline in carbon intensity mandated by the program and actual economic growth of course the dynamic tonnage target could be indexed to just about any relative variable eg energy prices depending on the specifics of the methodology and measures used in creating it the dynamic target could be more responsive to some unforeseen events such as substantial economic growth than static baseline at least in the short term this could reduce costs and economic disruption if sharp spike in economic growth were to occur in contrast slowerthananticipated growth would reduce the available emissions credits and thereby reduce the potential for hot air credits ie credits created by slowdown in the economy rather than by control efforts13 by potentially mitigating some effects of static historic emissions baseline dynamic tonnage methodology allows flexibility in distributing reductions and the resulting costs among different sectors of the economy growth ghg intensity production and other variables could be tailored for sectors states or regions based on specific concerns such as competitiveness for example an industry growth index could be used to calculate reduction requirements rather than an aggregated index such as gdp like most schemes dynamic target scheme could completely exclude some industries with the obvious result of shift in cost to the ones remaining in the program the effect of dynamic target on longterm costs would depend on the slope of reductions mandated by the program for example the recommendation of the national commission on energy policy called for an annual 24 reduction in allowable ghg intensity increasing to 28 annually after 10 years this declining curve would be multiplied by projection of presumably increasing economic growth steeper slope in ghg intensity mandates andor an overly pessimistic projection of economic growth would strengthen the need for less carbonintensive technology but at the risk of increasing cost if those technologies did not arrive in timely manner weak ghg intensity mandate andor an overly optimistic projection of economic growth could reduce necessary emissions reductions and provide weak incentive for new technology 13 vicki arroyo and neil strachan addressing the costs of climate change mitigation presented at the aspen workshop climate policy framework balancing policy and politics crs9 dynamic target would not necessarily prevent shortterm fluctuations in the price signal depending on the frequency of adjustments if target were based on macroeconomic trends such as gdp it would not respond much to shortterm or localized events such as the 20002001 electricity shortage in california also the mixture of indices with different vectors eg ghg intensity reducing targets while economic growth is increasing targets may create some uncertainty in markets regarding the appropriate price of credits finally dynamic target would not increase the certainty of cost estimates uncertainty about the future trajectory of economic growth would be reflected in cost estimates just as they are now with emissions capped at historically determined levels likewise benefit certainty would not improve for the same reason expand supply options the breadth of options permitted under reduction program can have significant effect on absolute costs legislation introduced in recent congresses has ranged from programs based on one economic sector eg electric utilities and one greenhouse gas eg carbon dioxide to several sectors including optin provisions and all six greenhouse gases covered by the kyoto protocol14 also some proposed programs have included international trading of emissions credits and biological sequestration offsets among the permissible means of complying with reduction requirements15 some of these options particularly international trading and sequestration have included limits on their applicability for example the regional greenhouse gas initiative16 has put control cost triggers characterized as safety valves on the availability of some supply options such as sequestration numerous analyses were done on the impact of global trading after the signing of the 1997 kyoto protocol for the united states the cost of complying with the kyoto protocol was estimated at 2350 per ton of carbon if global trading were included versus 61119 if only trading among developed annex 1 countries were permitted cost estimates of trading scenarios ranged from 193295 per ton17 studies have suggested that beyond international trading including non 14

sequestering capturing and storing co2 by peter folger 16 the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi is an initiative of currently ten northeastern states to reduce ghg emissions signed 2005 memorandum of agreement mou requires the parties to stabilize and then reduce co2 emissions from powerplants implemented through an allowancebased capandtrade program if the allowance price rises above 7 offsets from outside the region may be used for compliance purposes at 11 ratio with the generator able to cover up to 5 of its emissions if below 7 such offsets are discounted 50 and the compliance limit is 33 of generators emissions if the allowance price exceeds 10 offsets from international projects could be used to cover up to 20 of generators emissions for more information see httpwwwrggiorg 17 for review of these estimates see crs report rl30285 global climate change lowering cost estimates through emissions trading some dynamics and pitfalls by continued crs10 carbon dioxide greenhouse gases and sequestration in the supply mix can play an important and costeffective role in any climate change program18 expanding supply sources could help industries that do not have readily accessible means of reducing greenhouse gases on their own by providing them with additional options and making the credit market more liquid to the extent the expanded supply sources help create an integrated market with true market price for credits industries could avoid very high compliance costs and lessen the impact of those costs on their profitability however if competitors in other countries do not have to reduce emissions at all as is currently the case with the kyoto protocol competitive disadvantage would remain in some cases the degree to which expanded supply options would contribute to longterm and stable price signal would depend on how integrated these sources are in the overall permit market for example with the european trading system ets there are separate markets for credits created within the 15 members of the european union eu covered by the eu bubble credits created by joint implementation with eastern european countries and credits created via the clean development mechanism cdm with third world countries19 one type of credit cannot be traded for another the result is range of credit prices reflecting the relative risk and availability of the various credit types thus the longterm signal being delivered is currently unclear and may take time to develop likewise substantial fluctuations in the eu credit market have not been stabilized by the existence of the other two credit types in some ways expanding supply options may increase the uncertainty of cost estimates not only because of disparity in assumed reduction costs but also in assumed availability and penetration of the options themselves for example emissions reductions via the clean development mechanism could be substantial and very costeffective however the mechanism itself creates uncertainty with respect to availability as does the willingness of foreign governments to participate it is difficult to quantify the effect such an option could have on costs without some track record as is slowly being built by the ets carbon tax the most radical approach to controlling costs and addressing the concerns identified above is to impose carbon tax in lieu of proposed allowance 17 continued larry parker available from the author 18 for example see john reilly marcus sarofim sergey paltsey and ronald g prinn the role of nonco2 greenhouse gases in

euets by larry parker crs11 trading programs as discussed in the introduction to this report under carbon tax the costs are fixed by the legislation and the quantity of emissions reduced becomes the variable carbon taxes are generally conceived as levy on natural gas petroleum and coal according to their carbon content in the approximate ratio of 06 to 08 to 10 respectively however the levy would not have to be imposed on the fuels themselves proposals have been made to impose the tax downstream at the point where the fuel is converted into heat and co2 in addition there is reason why the tax could not be expanded to include all greenhouse gases in appropriate carbon equivalents carefully designed carbon tax could potentially address all five of the concerns identified above carbon tax puts limit on absolute cost by capping the marginal costs that participants should pay to reduce ghg emissions participants would receive firm price signal with respect to the upper value of ghg emissions and respond in the most costeffective manner that is reduce emissions up to the cost of the carbon tax and pay the tax on any remaining emissions that are more expensive to eliminate carbon tax can be tailored to address distributional concern in two ways the first would be to exempt either partly or completely whatever sectors or industries were felt to be threatened either competitively or otherwise by imposing the tax the current tax code provides numerous exemptions from various taxes for variety of reasons however such an approach would create economic distortions and complicate the tax structure the second approach would be to use some of the revenue generated by the tax to provide appropriate relief to targeted sectors or industries this could involve increasing funding for existing programs for such sectors or industries or creating new ones in some ways this approach might be more transparent than an approach that involves potentially complicated tax structure these approaches are not mutually exclusive they could be combined if considered appropriate likewise carbon tax can be employed to address longterm concerns in two ways first the carbon tax would create longterm price signal to stimulate innovation and development of new technology this price signal could be strengthened if the carbon tax were escalated over the long run either by statutorily determined percentage or by an index such as the producer price index second some of the revenue generated by the tax could be used to fund research development demonstration and deployment of new technology to encourage the longterm transition to lesscarbonintensive economy carbon taxs basic approach to controlling ghg emissions is to supply the marketplace with stable consistent price signal the fourth cost concern designed appropriately there would be little danger of the price spikes or market volatility that can occur in the early stages of tradeable permit program finally carbon tax basically places an upper boundary on projected economic cost uncertainty however it increases uncertainty with respect to environmental benefits by making emissions reductions dependent variable this is the basic tradeoff that pricebased control system presents one way that might mitigate the problem to some extent would be to combine the carbon tax with some form of crs12 quantity controls as noted earlier the cfc program attached tax to its trading program with beneficial results however it is the trading program not the cfc tax that is the primary regime for control in this manner carbon tax would be more of revenue raiser than control regime second hybrid would be safety valve that capped allowance prices such as proposed by the national commission on energy policy20 that approach is discussed later in this report the degree to which the problem is mitigated and others created depends on the interplay between the quantity control and the carbon tax timetable options similar to the countrys threeplus decades effort to reduce smog climate change promises to be an effort measured in decades not years unlike conventional pollution control efforts the environmental benefit of mitigating climate change would come from reduction in the stock of greenhouse gases that have built up in the atmosphere for decades whereas the economic costs of control are related to the current flow of additional gases into the atmosphere thus in situation similar to protecting the stratospheric ozone layer there would be substantial delay between control costs and environmental benefits indeed if shortterm reductions in the stock of greenhouse gases were the focus of climate change policy control efforts would be focused on controlling methane which has 20year lifetime compared with co2 which has 200year lifetime likewise temporary measures such as biologic sequestration would be accelerated with the assumption that new technology would be available in the future to capture the biologically sequestered carbon dioxide when it is released decades from now this situation leads to disputes over how time should be managed under ghg reduction program one argument is that modest cuts or slowing of the increase early followed by steeper cuts later is the most costeffective generally three cost related arguments are made in favor of this approach first over the longterm sustained ghg reductions involve turnover in existing durable capital stock costly process if the time frame of the reduction is long enough to permit that capital stock to be replaced as it wears out the transitional costs are reduced second increased time to comply would permit the development and deployment of new less carbonintensive technologies that are more costeffective than existing technology third assuming positive rate of return on current investment less money needs to be set aside today to meet those future compliance costs21 counter argument to the above focuses on the risks of delay both in terms of scientific uncertainty and technology development in terms of scientific uncertainty there is consensus on what concentration of greenhouse gases should not be exceeded in order to avoid undesirable climate change if the stabilization level needed is relatively low any delay in beginning reductions could be costly both 20 the national commission on energy policy ending the energy stalemate bipartisan strategy to meet americas energy challenges december 2005 p 21 21 robert repetto and duncan austin the costs of climate protection guide for the perplexed world resources institute 1997 p 21 crs13 economically and environmentally22 secondly given the sometimes long lead times for technology development both longterm price signal and research and development funding may have to be initiated quickly to encourage technology development and deployment in time to hold ghg concentrations to level that avoids unacceptable damages in the same vein an early signal with respect to climate change policy is necessary to discourage investment in durable longlived 5060 years carbonintensive technologies23 as stated by jaccard and montgomery the window of opportunity for reducing cost implies need for immediate and continuing action to develop new lowcarbon technologies and to begin shifting longlived investment decisions toward alternatives that lower carbon emissions absent these actions the rapid future emissions reductions included in the delayed emissions scenario may be more costly than more evenly paced and earlier reductions24 economicbased circuit breaker delaying or suspending compliance with environmental mandates because of energy and economic reasons is not novel idea the clean air act contains provisions permitting the president in response to petition by an affected states governor to temporarily suspend any part of state implementation plan or enforcement of the so2 trading program to address severe national or regional energy emergency25 for example during the 20002001 california energy crisis president clinton directed all federal agencies to do their part to assist the state in meeting its electricity demand for its part the epa revised its guidance on emergency generators to allow backup generators to be used to avert power blackout26 previously backup generators could be used only when the power was actually interrupted the increased flexibility permitted by the epa during the emergency meant more power at the expense of more pollution particularly of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides likewise marketbased systems are not immune to being suspended if economic or energy conditions turn severe contributing factor in the california power crisis was the regional

price of credits rose from less than 1 per pound of nox in january 2000 to more than 60 per pound of nox by march 200127 to solve this problem in march 2001 the south coast air quality management district amended reclaim to remove large power plants from the trading system and required owners of such facilities to reduce emissions under mandated commandandcontrol regime such facilities returned to the trading system in 200728 proposals have been made to formalize circuit breaker into any ghg reduction program in general proposals envision declining emissions cap system where the rate of decline over time is determined by the market price of permits if permit prices remain under set threshold prices the next reduction in the emissions cap is implemented if not the cap is held at the current level until prices decline29 such cap could be implemented on an economywide basis or by sector or other relevant grouping because the conditional reduction approach attempts to turn both the price and the quantity of reductions into variables solved by the trading market its effect on cost depends on host of variables most obviously the profiles of the emissions reduction targets and the price triggers for example the price trigger could be based on the spotmarket price the longterm market price or some hybrid price mechanism also the reliance on the market to either directly or indirectly determine price and quantity puts pressure on regulators to oversee operations and prevent any market manipulation designed to slow emissions reductions conditional tonnage target could address distributional issues if its tonnage targets and timetable triggers are tailored for specific sectors or industries this would substantially increase the complexity of the scheme and potentially risk bifurcation of the permit market as with other permit schemes discussed here another approach to addressing distributional concerns under conditional tonnage target would be to simply exempt certain sectors from its mandates when the control regime responds to relatively shortterm events it may not provide the longterm price signal necessary to promote longterm solutions the elastic time frame also gives ambiguous signals for planning the appropriate pace and scope of research and development efforts in contrast the regimes focus on short term economic disruption may help in damping shortterm volatility in the allowance market as noted the responsiveness of the price and timetable triggers would determine how effective the program would be in avoiding such disruption

website httpwwweeainccomcleanpowerindexhtml crs15 in reducing the uncertainty for cost estimates the scheme introduces about the same number of new uncertainties as it does in reducing others the circuit breaker prevents ever increasing costs although with some undetermined lag time however it is difficult to estimate absolute costs because one does not know how often it will be used the scheme also increases uncertainty about the future trend in benefits by making the quantity of emissions reduced variable shortterm break might not make much of difference particularly if participants were required to make up the emissions later however it introduces uncertainty into the system that would be difficult to quantify technologybased timetable another approach to increase flexibility in the system and encourage longterm technology development would be to provide special compliance schedules for entities deploying innovative less carbonintensive technologies an example of this possibility is section 409 of title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments30 under section 409 utilities choosing to meet their sulfur dioxide reduction requirements by installing qualifying clean coal technology receive fouryear extension on the program compliance deadline during the extension the affected emitter is allowed to operate under existing regulations and operating conditions if the technology fails to operate as designed the affected unit may be retrofitted with another qualifying technology or with an existing control technology for ghg reduction program qualifying technology could include geologic sequestration emerging energy efficient technology or advanced solar power technology extension could reduce costs in two ways first the delay in compliance itself would reduce cost by allowing the affected company more time to gather resources and optimize compliance plan second to the extent the delay encourages more costeffective approaches to ghg reductions compliance cost and longterm cost would be reduced of course the risk is that the delay will not result in successful technology development indeed it is likely that at least some of the projects would fail that is the nature of innovation however because technology development is crucial to longterm reductions in greenhouse gases some may feel the risk is worth it assistance with distributional costs under this option would depend on the opportunities for new technology in given sectors of the economy although some industries may have potentially costeffective technologyfixes such as geologic sequestration others may involve longterm structural changes of course the focus of technologybased timetable is to provide longterm signal to the market encouraging new technology such signal could be strengthened significantly with increased government funding of projects because this option is focused on new technology it would seem likely to have little effect on shortterm price volatility however there may be risk that the 30 pl 101559 title iv section 409 1990 crs16 temporary removal of significant emitters from the marketsystem in response to the incentive could increase shortterm volatility and uncertainty by diminishing permit demand and trading volume it is difficult to determine the effects of this option on cost estimates it would depend on how widespread the assumed participation rate is technique options most current ghg reduction proposals assume marketbased implementation strategy generally permit trading program this is not surprising as flexibility and new technologies are considered the keys to costeffective implementation strategy over the long run generally technique options range from making tradeable permit program more flexible through mechanisms like banking to creating hybrid program where the regime shifts from quantitybased permit program to carbon tax depending on defined circumstances banking and borrowing most existing trading programs include provisions for banking credits for either future use or future sale indeed the absence of effective banking in the reclaim program discussed earlier is credited with contributing to reclaims suspension during the california energy crisis as summarized by resources for the future rff allowance banking has been an essential component of the so2 program its absence is costly feature of the nox programs eroding the opportunity for cost savings from interannual trading and contributing directly to the suspension of trading in reclaim31 banking and borrowing reduces the absolute cost of compliance by making annual emissions caps flexible over time the limited ability to shift the reduction requirement across time allows affected entities to better accommodate corporate planning for capital turnover and technological progress to control equipment construction schedules and to respond to transient events such as weather and economic shocks generally banking and borrowing would not have any direct impact on distributional concerns which are more directly determined by initial allocation decisions banking and borrowing can help provide longterm market signal by supporting credit prices when costs are lower than expected32 the flexibility provided by banking and borrowing as noted can help dampen shortterm volatility the degree that they help is disputed as discussed later some argue that banking and borrowing may provide sufficient flexibility in some cases to 31 dallas burtraw david evans alan krupnick karen palmer and russell toth economics pollution trading for so2

2002 p 9 crs17 keep market disruptions to minimum33 however others argue that if program involves more than modest reductions more robust safety valve is preferable34 in estimating costs banking and borrowing help smooth out the reduction requirement as witnessed by the current acid rain program this economically desirable effect does not necessarily reduce the uncertainty in cost estimates because estimators will make different assumptions about the extent to which banking and borrowing are used by emitters the smoothing effect however has effect on the reduction requirement in contrast with several of the other alternatives discussed here this is major reason why this alternative is generally favored by those whose priority is to achieve specific reductions auctioning permits auctions can be used in marketbased pollution control schemes in several different ways for example title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments uses an annual auction to ensure the liquidity of the credit trading program for this purpose small percentage of the credits permitted under the program are auctioned annually with the proceeds returned to the entities that would have otherwise received them private parties are also allowed to participate second possibility is to use an auction to raise revenues for related or unrelated program for example many states participating in the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi are using auctions to implement their public benefit programs to assist consumers or pursue strategic energy purposes35 third possibility is to use auctions as means of allocating some or all of the credits mandated under ghg control program in examining modified auction program resources for the future rff analysis found that an auction scheme is dramatically more cost effective in allocating credits than either grandfathered allocation method36 or generation performance standard37 gps approach38 obviously the impact that an auction would have on the cost dimensions identified earlier would depend on how extensively it was used in any ghg control program and to what purpose the revenues were expended the costeffectiveness of an auctioning system results from allowing the marketplace to allocate credits however unlike carbon tax the marketclearing 33 henry d jacoby and denny ellerman the safety valve and climate policy mit joint program on the

option is discussed further below 35 for more information see crs report rl33812 climate change action by states to address greenhouse gas emissions by jonathan l ramseur 36 used in the so2 trading program credits are allocated gratis to entities in rough proportion to their historic emissions 37 also called an outputbased allocation credits are allocated gratis to entities in proportion to their relative share of total electricity generation in recent year 38 dallas burtraw karen palmer ranjit bharvirkar and anthony paul the effect of allowance allocation on the cost of carbon emission trading rff discussion paper 0130 august 2001 crs18 price for credits is not limited unless the system is combined with safety valve andor reserve price as discussed below hence an auction for credits would be more expensive for specific industries than under historically based grandfathered system where they would receive their credits free likewise the price consumers pay may be greater depending on the companies ability to pass on their additional costs to them however when the substantial revenues received by the auctions are considered auctions are more costeffective than grandfathered or gps systems as stated by rff the bottom line is that the au auction approach weighs in at substantially less economic cost to society than either of the two gratis approaches to allocating allowances au also provides policymakers with flexibility through the collection of revenues that can be used to meet distributional goals or to enhance the efficiency of the au even further by reducing preexisting taxes because the au approach is so costeffective corresponding sic carbon policy will have less effect on economic growth than under the other approaches this attribute provides the most significant form of distributional benefit39 as noted by rff the revenues from an auction can be used to address host of distributional concerns indeed as noted earlier the auction could be tailored to raise only as much as necessary to address those concerns as with rggi funding of public benefits programs or made more comprehensive to address credit allocation in terms of longterm price signal the type of auction employed would have some effect for example the program could implement price floor to facilitate investment in new technology via reserve price in the allowance auction process in addition the stability of that price signal could be strengthened by choosing to auction allowances on frequent basis ensuring availability of allowances close to the time of expected demand and making any potential shortsqueezing of the secondary market more difficult40 an auction could provide substantial incentive for new technology if the auction is structured to encourage longterm and stable price signal and if revenues received are at least partly directed toward research development and demonstration programs an auction would probably not reduce the uncertainty with costs because differing assumptions could be made about the actual operation of the auction its efficiency and the effectiveness of the recycled revenues however an auction would not have any effect on benefits received by the program unless it were joined with safety valve or other limit on auction prices safety valve the purpose of safety valve is to limit the costs of any climate change control program price at the potential expense of reductions achieved quantity safety valves encompass variety of carbon taxtradeable permit hybrid 39 burtraw et allowance allocation p 30 40 karsten neuhoff auctions for co2 allowances straw man proposal university of cambridge electricity policy research group may 2007 pp 36 crs19 schemes perhaps the most publicized version is that recommended by the national commission on energy policy41 the commission scheme would be implemented through flexible marketoriented permit trading program the total number of permits each year would be based on mandated decline in ghg intensity and projected gdp growth however the scheme includes costlimiting safety valve that allows covered entities to make payment to the government in lieu of reducing emissions the initial price of such payments would be 7 per ton in 2010 thus if covered entity chooses it may make payments to the government at specific price rather than make any necessary emissions reductions effectively safety valve places ceiling on compliance costs in that way it acts like carbon tax to the extent an entitys control costs or the permit market remain below the safety valve the scheme acts like tradeable permit program the degree to which safety valve reduces costs would depend on the extent to which it is used by entities eg who do not have costeffective alternative however the complex interactions involved in scheme that includes both price and quantity controls should not be underestimated as stated by jacoby and ellerman the usefulness of the safety valve depends on the conditions under which it might be introduced for time it might tame an overly stringent emissions target it also can help control the price volatility during the introduction of gradually tightening one although permit banking can ultimately serve the same function it is unlikely to serve as longterm feature of capandtrade system however because of the complexity of coordinating price and quantity instruments and because it will interfere with the development of systems of international emissions trade42 in contrast morgenstern argues that the complexity is worth it in preventing price spikes particularly if substantial reduction in emissions is envisioned if only modest reductions are undertaken system of banking and offsets is likely to be adequate in preventing price spikes in order to achieve more ambitious targets however the safety valve is clearly preferred43 to address distributional concerns safety value could be tailored for specific sectors to address concerns about costeffective reduction options or competition in addition to the extent the safety valve created revenues some of the funds raised could be recycled to affected parties the effect of safety valve on new technologies reflects the complexity discussion above if low safety valve price were chosen meaning it would keep compliance costs low it could have dampening effect on longterm development of new technology by creating ceiling on the value of ghg reductions but providing floor for those reductions weak market signal may be sent this might be offset to some degree if funds collected by the safety valve were directed 41 the national commission on energy policy ending the energy stalemate bipartisan strategy to meet americas energy challenges december 2005 42 jacoby and ellerman the safety valve and climate policy p 1 43 richard d morgenstern the case for the safety valve p 10 crs20 toward new technology but marketing of any resulting technology might still be difficult if the market price is held low safety valve would dampen the possibility of an upward spike in credit prices indeed it is major reason for considering such an option however it would not affect any volatility occurring below the safety valve value and have effect on collapse in credit prices by the same token the safety valve would put an absolute limit on the projected costs of the program at the level of the safety valve however it would do this at the expense of certainty in terms of reductions achieved illustrative approaches the selected options discussed above are summarized in appendix as suggested the various options identified have different strengths and weaknesses depending on the facet of costs one wants to address fortunately many of the options are not mutually exclusive nor do they require complete adoption parts of individual approaches can be combined with other parts to meet program specifications in terms of firmness of the goal also called the hardness of the emissions cap and time frame to illustrate program focused on achieving specific tonnage reduction with some flexibility in implementation but not in manner that threatens the integrity of the cap could incorporate several of these options the most obvious mechanism to include in the quantitybased capandtrade would be banking and borrowing options that would increase flexibility of the program across time without any deterioration in the tonnage requirement flexibility and protection against price increases could be enhanced by expanding supply options to include all greenhouse gases sequestration and international trading depending on ones confidence in the individual supply options use could be restricted to maximum percentage of reduction achieved through the option common in many proposals or to more flexible percentage restraint based on credit prices as in rggis capandtrade scheme proper monitoring and enforcement could minimize any potential effect on the cap this illustration would not necessarily provide either the longterm price signal or funding necessary for new technology one supplemental option that could help mitigate this problem would be credit auctions auctions would have effect on the cap but would provide the program with revenue flow that could be at least partly directed toward research and development the auction could be designed to raise revenues only by auctioning small percentage of the credits such as the current acid rain program or be comprehensive and auction all credits thus improving overall economics and providing clear market signal as many rggi participants are doing in the latter case coordinating the auction with any trigger price mechanism for expanded supply options would promote harmonious implementation depending on the structure of the auction chosen the comprehensive auction would also provide clear market price for reductions and with the addition of forward markets some indication of the general direction of those prices crs21 finally the auction and its resulting revenues could also be used to address pressing distributional cost issues although the mixture of options used in this illustration could potentially mitigate several of the cost issues identified here it would not provide cost certainty the quantity side of the equation is the controlling factor under this illustration prices could be tempered by the market flexibility introduced by the options but actual costs would not capped in contrast more priceoriented illustration could employ safety valve to place an absolute limit on credit prices in such hybrid system the focus of the program is the safety valve limit as much as any tonnage cap the quantitybased limits of the emissions cap determine the probability that the safety valve would be triggered assuming wellfunctioning market however in addition to the supply demand dynamic that the credit market will reflect any market failure or disruption resulting from external events could trigger the safety valve for participants ultimately quantity is subordinate to price one can potentially reduce the probability that the safety valve would be invoked by including several of the other options discussed here expanding supply options would enlarge the pool of available reductions and potentially improve the stability of the credit market if properly integrated employing dynamic tonnage target or an economicbased circuit breaker could help address any economic growth spike that might trigger the safety valve the question of using these options in safety valve program is whether they would affect the cap more or less than invoking the safety valve in contrast borrowing and banking would help stabilize markets without having any effect on the cap like the illustration above this approach would not necessarily promote new technology indeed the safety valve could discourage such development unless it generated revenue that was directed toward research and development if revenues were deemed insufficient for new technology and to address distributional concerns if desired the safety valve program could be supplemented with an auction however in any case this illustration is driven by price concerns concerns that make coordinating new technology development and minimizing impacts on the emissions cap difficult final illustration could also be the simplest imposition of carbon tax the clear focus of the program would be the level of the tax the steepness of any future increases in the tax and who has to pay the tax as noted earlier it could be crafted to address all the cost concerns identified in this report however it would represent new direction in us climate change and current international efforts crs22 addressing costs through market mechanisms resolving the pricequantity issue the fundamental policy assumption that changed between the us ratification of the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc and the george w bush administrations 2001 decision to abandon the kyoto protocol process concerned costs44 the ratification of the unfccc was based at least partially on the premise that significant reductions could be achieved at little or cost this assumption helped to reduce concern some had that the treaty could have deleterious effects on us competitiveness significant consideration because developing countries are treated differently from developed countries under the unfccc further ameliorating this concern compliance with the treaty was voluntary while the united states could aim to reduce its emissions in line with the unfccc goal if the effort indeed involved substantial costs the united states could fail to reach the goal as has happened without incurring any penalty under the treaty this flexibility would have been eliminated if the united states had ratified the kyoto protocol with its mandatory reduction requirements the george w bush administration cited this lack of flexibility as major reason for rejecting the kyoto process two events provide impetus for revisiting the cost issue with respect to designing greenhouse gas reduction program the first is the election of new president publicly committed to substantial reductions in greenhouse gases over the next several decades the second was passage of the 2005 sense of the senate climate change resolution calling on congress to enact mandatory marketbased program to slow stop and reverse the growth of greenhouse gases and which states that the program should be enacted at rate and in manner that will not significantly harm the united states economy and will encourage comparable action by other nations45 facets of the cost issue that have raised concern include absolute costs to the economy distribution of costs across industries competitive impact domestically and internationally incentives for new technology and uncertainty about possible costs marketbased mechanisms attempt to address the cost issue by introducing flexibility into the implementation process the cornerstone of that flexibility is permitting sources to decide their appropriate implementation strategy within the parameters of market signals and other incentives that signal can be as simple as carbon tax or comprehensive credit auction that tells the emitter the value of any reduction in greenhouse gases to credit marketplace that is constrained by ceiling price safety valve and includes incentives for new technology as illustrated here the combinations of market mechanisms are numerous allowing decision makers to tailor the program to address specific concerns 44 for review of us climate change policy see crs report rl30024 global climate change policy cost competitiveness and comprehensiveness by larry parker and john blodgett 45 samdt 866 passed by voice vote after motion to table failed 4354 june 22 2005 crs23 in sense the options discussed here represent continuum between alternatives focused on the price side of the equation eg carbon taxes through hybrid schemes eg safety valves to alternatives focused on the quantity side eg banking and borrowing they are tools to assist in the assessment of potential greenhouse gas reduction approaches leaving any policy decision on balancing the pricequantity issue to the ultimate decision makers this balance will not be easy to achieve by offering flexibility to program designers and participants marketbased mechanisms can assist in implementing ghg reduction program at less cost than more traditional commandandcontrol methods46 however the complexity of market mechanisms particularly trading programs increases substantially with the scope of emitting sources included particularly if international trading is envisioned and the specificity of any allocation scheme thus perhaps the most difficult issue to be addressed in designing marketbased implementation strategy for reducing ghg emissions is determining who is included and who is exempted 46 for background on this point with respect to climate change see crs report rl30285 global
