sophisticated public relations and media campaigns since the mid1990s terrorism analysts believe that these campaigns have been designed to elicit psychological reactions and communicate complex political messages to global audience as well as to specific subpopulations in the islamic world the united states europe and asia some officials and analysts be lieve that qaedas messages contain signals that inform and instruct operatives to prepare for and carry out new attacks bin laden and other leading qaeda figures have referred to their public statements as important primary sources for parties seeking to understand qaedas ideology and political demands global counterterrorism operations since 2001 appear to have limited bin ladens ability to provide command and control leadership to qaeda operatives and affiliated groups other qaeda leaders and affiliates continue to release statements that encourage and provide guidance for terrorist operations iraq has become focal point for jihadist rhetoric underscoring qaeda leaders interest in iraq and support for the ongoing insurgency statements released by osama bin laden and his deputy ayman zawahiri since late 2004 have rekindled public debate in europe and the united states surrounding qaedas ideology motives and future plans for attacks statemen ts released following the july 2005 qaeda linked suicide bombing attacks on the london transit system have characterized those attacks and qaedas ongoing terrorist campaign as response to british and american military operations in iraq in january 2006 bin laden stated that qaeda does not object to longterm truce with the united states on the basis of fair conditions but alluded to nearly complete preparations to carry out attacks inside the united states the ideological content and political tone of recent qaeda statements have led some terrorism analysts to speculate that the messages may signal an on effort by qaeda founders to reaffirm their leadership roles and the role of the qaeda organization as the vanguard of an emerging loosely organized international jihadist movement others have argued that the presently limited operational capabilities of qaedas founders have inspired them to focus on ideological outreach activities and efforts to influence public opinion in the united states and europe many observers believe that the groups primary goal remains to inspire plan and carry out attacks against the united states and its allies around the world with particular emphasis on targeting economic and energy infrastructure and fomenting unrest in iraq afghanistan the persian gulf states and countries neighboring israel this report reviews qaedas use of public statements from the mid1990s to the present and analyzes the evolving ideological and political content of those statements the report focuses primarily on statements made by osama bin lade n but also considers statements made by ayman zawahiri the late abu musab zarqawi iraqbased

and affiliates have conducted sophisticated public relations and media campaigns since the mid1990s using series of faxed statements audio recordings video appearances and internet postings1 terrorism analysts believe that these campaigns have been designed to elicit psychological reactions and communicate complex political messages to global audience as well as to specific subpopulations in the islamic world the united states europe and asia bin laden and his deputies have personally stated their belief in the importance of harnessing the power of international and re gional media for qaedas benefit and qaedas central leadership structure has featured dedicated media and communications committee tasked with issuing reports and statements in support of the groups operations 2 some officials and analysts believe that qaedas messages contain signals that inform and instruct operatives to prepare for and carry out new attacks bin laden has referred to his public statements as important primary sources for parties seeking to understand qaedas ideology and political demands 3 through his public statements over the last ten years bin laden has portrayed himself both as the leader of consistent ideological movement and strategic commander willing to tailor his violent messages and acts to respond to specific political circumstances and to influence specific audiences and events surveys of jihadist literature suggest that such leadership role may remain elusive for bin laden and zawahiri particularly among ideologues and religious scholars who otherwise support jihadist activities and goals study completed by the combating terrorism center at the us military academy at west point in november 2006 concluded that both men have had an enormous impact on the wider jihadi movement but our data shows that they have had little to impact on jihadi thinkers 4 global counterterrorism operations in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks appear to have limited bin ladens ability to provide command and control leadership to qaeda operatives and affiliated groups bin ladens last confirmed messages were released in june and july 2006 mourning the death of abu musab zarqawi and calling on muslims to support the islamists in somalia in january 2006 message he proposed temporary truce with the united states in exchange for series of us concessions it is unlikely however that bin laden could ensure wholesale cessation of hostilities or that qaeda supporters would abandon the strategic priorities reflected in their statements that have sanctioned encouraged and provided guidance for terrorist operations 1 unless indicated translated citations are derived from compilation of usama bin ladin statements 1994january 2004 open

invasion of afghanistan during the 1980s are thought to have provided the backdrop for his belief that muslims could take effective military action inspired by select islamic principles5 his exposure to the teachings of conservative islamist scholars in saudi arabia and his work with arab militants in afghanistan prov ided the theological and ideological basis for his belief in the desirability of puritanical salafist islamic reform in muslim societies and the necessity of armed resistance in the face of perceived aggressiona concept qaeda has since associated with communallybinding islamic principle known as defensive jihad6 after the iraqi invasion of kuwait in 1990 bin laden expressed these views in opposition to the introduction of foreign military forces to saudi arabia bin laden characterized the presence of us and other nonmuslim troops in saudi arabia after the 1991 gulf war as cause for renewed commitment to defensive jihad and the promotion of violence against the saudi government and the united states g515g6g142g140g149g138g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g12g146g145g138g141g516g561 in the early 1990s bin laden emphasized his desire to secure the withdrawal of us and other foreign troops from saudi arabia at all costs bin laden criticized the saudi royal family publicly and alleged that their invitation of foreign troops to the arabian peninsula constituted an affront to the sanctity of the birthplace of islam and betrayal of the global islamic community 7 finding his rhetoric and efforts rebuffed by saudi leaders bin laden was expelled from saudi arabia and his ire increasingly focused on the united states following period of exile in sudan and afghanistan in which his radical views sharpened bin laden issued declaration of jihad against the united states in 1996 that signaled his emergence as an internationally recognizable figure and offered full account of his main critiques of an enemy he described as the alliance of jews christians and their agents 8 adopting the sensitive historical and religious imagery of islamic resistance to the european crusades bin laden condemned the us military presence in saudi arabia criticized the international sanctions regime on iraq and voiced his opposition to us support for israel 9 the declaration also cited massacres in tajikistan burma kashmir assam the philippines fatani

expanded the vision and scope of his selfdeclared conflict with the united states and specified his political prescriptions for the reformation of islamic societies echoing us academic samuel huntingtons theory on the impending clash of civilizations 11 bin laden repeated his characterization of socalled new crusade led by america against the islamic nations and emphasized his belief that an emerging conflict between islam and the west would be fought between the islamic world and the americans and their allies12 bin laden argued that the islamic world should see itself as one seamless community or umma and that muslims were obliged to unite and defend themselves turning his focus to the internal politics of the islamic world bin laden urged muslims to find leader to unite them and establish pious caliphate that would be governed by islamic law and follow islamic principles of finance and social conduct 13 bin laden repeatedly argued that afghanistan had become model islamic state under his taliban hosts and used religious rhetoric to solicit support for the taliban and qaeda14 although he possesses traditional islamic religious credentials or authority bin laden issued fatwa or religious edict in 1998 that claimed that the united states had made clear declaration of war on god his messenger and muslims15 through its policies in the islamic world the fatwa made use of the principle of defensive jihad to argue that us aggression made armed resistance and the targeting of american civilians and military personnel incumbent upon all muslims the statement also announced the formation of the world islamic front for jihad against the jews and crusaders which consisted of tacit alliance between bin laden his supporters and number of regional islamic militant groups following qaedas bombings of the us embassies in kenya and tanzania 1998 and the uss cole in yemen2000 bin laden refused to take direct responsibility for the attacks but claimed that he approved of the strikes and shared the motivations of the individuals who had carried them out bin laden argued that the bombings should be seen by americans and the world as retribution for us policy and compared them to alleged massacres of palestinians in historic cases familiar to many muslims and arabs 16 10 declaration of jihad islah london september 2 1996 op cit 11 see samuel p huntington

and others subsequently issued several statements confirming qaedas responsibility for the attacks on new york and washington following an established pattern bin laden acknowledged his support for th hijackers and repeated his claim that strikes on american targets should be viewed by muslims and americans as defensively motivated response to perceived american aggression in the islamic world statements attributed to bin laden and zawahiri since 2001 have promised fu rther attacks and sought to justify qaedas targeting of american and british civilians by arguing that western societies are morally corrupt recent democratic reform and human rights initi atives are insincere or bankrupt and american and british civilians should be held accountable for the policies of their democratically elected governments in the middle east that qaeda finds objectionable or unjust 17

embassy bombings and other terrorist operations but relatively few statements have been made regarding qaedas strategic goals in planning and executing the september 11 2001 attacks on new york and washington text attributed to qaeda military commander sayf adl released in may 2005 identifies three primary objectives for the september 11 attacks 18 according to adl qaedas main objective in perpetrating the september 11 attacks was to carry out damaging strike against the united states in retaliation for its perceived aggression in the islamic world adl indicates that in the opinion of qaedas leadership this primary objective was partially achieved although other strikes would have had greater impact if they had been successful however adl does not identify specific planned attacks that may have been disrupted since september 2001 qaedas second objective as identified by adl was to signal and support the emergence of new virtuous leadership dedicated to opposing the zionistanglosaxonprotestant coalition that qaeda blames for litany of social and political ills in the islamic world analysts have associated this stated objective with qaeda leaders views of themselves as the vanguard of broader global islamic movement and their desire to inspire political upheaval and change across the islamic world the third and ultimate objective according to adl was to prompt the united states to come out of its hole adl claims that qaeda wanted to provoke the united states into attacking areas of the islamic world associated with the organization and its affiliates in doing so adl claims qaeda hoped to make it easier to attack elements of us power 17 it is fundamental principle of any democracy that the people choose their leaders and as such approve and are party to the actions of their elected leaders by electing these leaders the american people have given their consent to the incarceration of the palestinian people the demolition of palestinian homes and the slaughter of the children of iraq this is why the american people are not innocent the american people are active members in all these crimes statement from shaykh usama bin

islamic nation and the beleaguered people of the world reflecting on the subsequent us response to th attacks bin laden and others have described the invasions of afghanistan and iraq as new crusades and highlighted both the considerable economic impact of the 911 attacks and the subsequent costs of the us military response as indications of qaedas effectiveness adl and others have conceded that the attacks on new york and washington were not totally successful while arguing that the september 11 attack was enough to prompt the americans to carry out the anticipated responsenamely direct military action within the islamic world 19 qaeda appears to have been less successful in using the purportedly hoped for us military response to help the islamic nation to wake from its slumber as it claims to have planned both bin laden and his deputy ayman zawahiri have criticized the population and governments of the is lamic world for failing to answer their calls to arms and for cooperating with the united states and its allies these criticisms have been coupled with renewed calls for armed resistance against the united states and its allies from zawahiri adl the late zarqawi and others

insurgent operations in iraq as symbol of qaedas success27 zawahiri reiterated the interest of qaedas leadership in the iraqi insurgency and the countrys political developments in many of his messages during 2005 and 2006 both men vehemently denounced the successful constitutional and electoral processes that have laid the groundwork for the formation of the new iraqi government zawahiri has repeatedly argued that the democratic reforms initiated by the united states in iraq and afghanistan are incomplete and insincere while zarqawi adopted more sectarian rhetoric in seeking to dissuade

baathists to arab and persian collaboration against the byzantine empire in the 7th and 8th centuries29 bin laden has also encouraged muslim iraqis and noniraqis of all ethnic and linguistic backgrounds to cooperate in opposing the iraqi government and coalition forces in iraq he has applied similar disregard for ethnic linguistic and ideological differences in issuing condemnations of socalled collaborators identifying arabs cooperating with iraqi and coalition authorities as equally guilty parties 30 while zawahiri and zarqawi were similarly indiscriminate in their calls for antius cooperation differences appeared to have emerged in their perspectives on the targeting of muslims who collaborate with coalition troops or initiatives and the desirability of pursuing an agenda of violent opposition to iraqs shiiteled government on sectarian grounds these differences became public in october 2005 after the publication of an intercepted letter reportedly written by

sharia law secular government or manmade law is considered unacceptable and deemed contrary to islamic faith the liberation of the homelands zawahiri argued that reforms and free elections will not be possible for muslims without first establishing the freedom of the muslim lands and their liberation from every aggressor he also emphasized the importance of establishing control over the middle easts energy resources and described the muslim world as impotent and exposed to the israeli nuclear arsenal the liberation of the human being zawahiri articulated vision of contractual social relationship between muslims and their rulers that would permit people to choose and criticize their leaders but also demand that muslims resist and overthrow rulers who violate islamic laws and

zawahiri and zarqawi from 2005 through 2007 summary follows jihadist action must have clear thought or idea that outlines its means and objectives adl recommended that zarqawi and others declare that their strategic objective is to reintroduce the islamic way of life by means of establishing the state of islam that will solve the entire problems of the nation this objective should be supported ideologically by circle of judicious men and scholars and propagated by special dawah islamic outreach authority the goal is to better enable the jihadist movement to employ the islamic nations potentials including human and financial resources by attracting more supporters the strategic objectives of the jihadist movement should be rooted in and motivated by what adl refers to as the clear banner of islamthe banner of there is deity but god and muhammad is the messenger of god this fundamental statement of islamic faith is meant to signify the ultimate priority of the principle of tawhid or the unity and authority of god and religion in qaedas ideological framework detailed strategic and operational plans must be developed with shortterm and longterm components adl links the failures of other contemporary islamic movements to the fact that their actions were mostly random according to adl mujahidin should have shortterm plans aimed at achieving interim goals and longterm plans aimed at accomplishing the greater objective which is the establishment of state throughout his statement adl alludes to the existence of broad plan developed by qaedas leaders but he declines to describe it in detail in july 2007 statement zawahiri outlined nearterm plan and longterm plan for achieving qaeda objectives 45 if the ruler renounces the law of god the governed on gods orders

interests as everyone who attacks the muslim ummah must pay the price in our country and theirs in iraq afghanistan palestine and somalia and everywhere we are able to strike their interests and the long term plan is divided into two halves the first half consists of earnest diligent work to change these corrupt and corruptive regimes as for the second half of the longterm plan it consists of hurrying to the fields of jihad like afghanistan iraq and somalia for jihad preparation and training thus it is must to hurry to the fields of jihad for two reasons the first is to defeat the enemies of the ummah and repel the zionist crusade and the second is for jihadi preparation and training to prepare for the next stage of the jihad 47 the next stage remains largely undefined in available statements from qaeda leaders and efforts to define long term goals are likely to prove divisive in light of evident differences in iraq and other conflict zones over short term strategy and tactics

the palestinian cause waxes and wanes depending on the networks need for supportbecoming more pronounced during periods when qaedas actions have alienated supporters or as part of more outright ideological appeal bin laden has addressed these charges personally and argued that support for the palestinians and all muslims is and will remain essential to qaedas cause which is the mobilization of the entire muslim world in resistance to perceived us aggression 48 other qaeda figures have alluded to the desirability of attacks on and eventual conflict with israel in january 2006 zarqawi

vulnerabilities of the united states and its allies particularly with regard to the role of middle eastern oil as the basis of industry in the global economy53 bin laden has called for muslim societies to become more selfsufficient economically and has urged arab governments to preserve oil as great and important economic power for the coming islamic state bin laden also has described economic boycotts as extremely effective54 weapons in an interview reportedly conducted on or around the fourth anniversary of the september 11 terrorist attacks zawahiri urged mujahidin to concentrate their campaigns on the muslims stolen oil and to not allow the thieves ruling muslim countries to control this oil55 statements by bin laden and zawahiri urging attacks on oil infrastructure and military supply lines could indicate shift in qaedas strategic and tactical planning in favor of more protracted attritional conflict characterized by disruptive attacks on economic and critical energy production infrastructure string of attempted attacks on oil production facilities in saudi arabia and yemen since early 2006 have been heralded by some jihadist media outlets as operations conforming to qaeda leaders calls for economic warfare against the united states and its regional allies the saudi arabian government has sought to discredit qaeda affiliates by portraying their attempted attacks on oil facilities as threat to the economic lifeblood of the saudi population

qaeda affiliates in iraq display the uncompromising commitment of qaedas leaders and operational affiliates to consistent ideological agenda focused on two sequential goals the expulsion of foreign forces and influences from islamic societies and ultimately the creation of an islamic state ruled by sharia law the political prescriptions outlined in the statements are rooted in the islamic principle known as tawhid or the principle of the absolute unity of god and an identification of islam as an allencompassing religious political and social system 56 according to this perspective islamic faith adherence to islamic law and implementation of conservative islamic social and political principles are synonymous throughout their statements qaeda founders and affiliates characterize as infidels those who do not share these beliefs those who oppose the creation of an islamic state on the terms they describe and those supporting existing governments and coalition activities in the islamic world 53 one of the most important reasons that made our enemies control our land is the pilfering of our oil be active and prevent them from reaching the oil and mount your operations

various target audiences in his early statements for example osama bin laden adopted pseudonationalist tone in directly addressing the population of saudi arabia and outlining ways that specific groups in saudi society could support qaeda in his 2004 and 2006 statements addressed to the us and european public bin laden blended threats of violence with attempts to portray himself as statesmanlike figure more palatable to western audiences and appealing to moderate muslims bin ladens earlier statements also addressed the american public in several instances that he since has characterized as attempts to explain his motives and outline steps the united states should have taken in order to avoid qaeda attacks over time the cornerstone of qaeda leaders religious and political rhetoric has remained consistent muslims should view themselves as single nation and unite to resist antiislamic aggression on the basis of obligatory defensive jihad nonislamic government is unacceptable and muslims should join qaeda and other sympathetic groups and movements in opposing those seeking to establish secular democratic governments or maintain existing governments deemed to be insufficiently islamic bin laden has often coupled his islamicunity rhetoric with litanies of antisemitic statements condemnations of israel and allegations of us complicity in the suffering of muslims worldwide in many pre911 statements bin laden broadened his rhetorical outreach to appeal to nonarab muslims especially those concerned with or engaged in conflicts in chechnya bosnia kashmir and the philippines following september 11 2001 bin laden has appealed directly to national groups on the front lines of robust counterterrorism operations particularly the populations of saudi arabia pakistan iraq and the palestinian territories g18g155g138g144g150g138g157g146g140g561g15g142g156g156g146g138g151g146g156g150g561 although bin ladens ideological rhetoric has remained relatively consistent he and other qaeda leaders have placed varying levels of emphasis on specific strategic objectives and tactics in their statements over the years in statements addressed to us and european audiences bin laden and others have outlined specific political demands that support an image of qaeda as pliable pragmatic political actor nevertheless qaedas operational record seems to indicate that its leaders commitment to specific national causes and limited political objectives are rhetorical tools designed to elicit support for their broader ideological agenda of confrontation with the west and puritanical reform in the islamic world for example bin ladens rhetorical treatment of the presence of us troops in saudi arabia during the 1990s is largely inconsistent with qaedas ongoing terrorist operations ther following the almost complete withdrawal of us military forces from saudi arabia in september 2003 57 although only small number of us military personnel remain in saudi arabia qaeda affiliates have continued violent campaign to topple the saudi government and have targeted nonus civilians in numerous terrorist attacks 57 in his september 1996 declaration of jihad against the united states bin laden described the presence of us troops in the arabian peninsula as one of the worst catastrophes to befall muslims since the death of the prophet mohammed in an earlier interview however he indicated that the the withdrawal of american troops would serve as the solution to the crisis between the united states and the islamic world

have characterized usled military operations in afghanistan and iraq as new provocations and crusades that justify ongoing attacks in his december 2004 statements bin laden referred to the confrontation between the us its allies and jihadist movement s as war of destiny between infidelity and islam and third world war seemingly leaving little doubt about the scope or flexibility of qaedas strategic ambitions grievances and demands from strategic perspective statements from zawahiri and others advocate for phased struggle in which the first goal is the expulsion of us military forces and proximate goals include the overthrow of corrupt regional leaders the creation of shariaruled is lamic state military confrontation with israel and conflict with shiite muslims

pragmatic willingness to adapt the strategic and tactical content of their statements to changing circumstances while retaining messianic commitment to their broader ideological agenda though bin ladens selfprofessed goal is to move incite and mobilize the islamic nation 58 until it reaches revolutionary ignition point59 qaeda leaders statements and qaedas attacks largely have failed to effectively mobilize widespread muslim support for their agenda thus far since late 2001 however public opinion polling and media monitoring in the middle east and broader islamic world indicate that dissatisfaction with the united states and its fo reign policy has grown significantly within many muslim societies in light of this trend qaeda leaders shift toward more explicitly political and ideological rhetoric seems to signal direct attempt to broaden the movements appeal solicit greater financial and material support and possibly inspire new and more systematically devastating attacks some experts have argued however that the uncompromising antidemocratic tone of some public statements by bin laden and zawahiri may alienate muslims who oppose theocracy or who support secular or representative government the antishiite sectarian rhetoric of some qaeda affiliates and the persistence of terrorist attacks that kill and maim sunni and shiite muslims in iraq also undermine qaedas appeal among some groups experience suggests that qaedas leaders believe that regular attempts to characterize qaedas actions as defensive and religiously sanctioned will increase tolerance of and support for their broader ideological program the identification of limited political objectives and the implication that their fulfilment will resolve broade r grievances may generate broader appeal than the groups underlying ideological agenda osama bin ladens truce proposals addressed to citizens of the united states and its european allies illustrate this trend but the proposals validity has been questioned due to ongoing attacks and continuing threats overall qaeda leaders statements from the mid1990s through the present indicate that they continue to see themselves and their followers as the vanguard of an international islamic movement primarily committed to ending us interference in the affairs of islamic countries and supportive of efforts to recast islamic societies according to narrow interpretations of islam 58 usama bin ladins message to iraq aljazirah television february 11 2003 op cit 59 bin ladin interviewed on jihad against us quds arabi november 27 1996
