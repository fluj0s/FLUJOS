social policy division summary based on data from the census bureaus current population survey cps an estimated 457 million people lacked health insurance coverage in 2007 representing 153 of the civilian noninstitutionalized us population when comparing statelevel health insurance estimates threeyear average is used to increase their reliability during 20052007 the estimated average percentage uninsured was 155 nationally ranging from low of 83 in massachusetts to high of 245 in texas states in the midwest and northeast generally had lower uninsured rates than those in the south and west these statelevel estimates must be interpreted with caution because they are based on sample of the population when sampling variation is taken into account the uninsured rate in nine states is not statistically different from the national rate the uninsured rate in 28 states and the district of columbia is statistically lower than the national rate and statistically higher in the remaining 13 states estimates of health insurance coverage by state during 20052007 the estimated average percentage uninsured was 155 nationally table 1 shows that 20052007 average uninsured rates ranged from 83 in massachusetts to 245 in texas eight states massachusetts hawaii minnesota wisconsin iowa maine pennsylvania and connecticut had threeyear average uninsured rates of less than 100 three states florida new mexico and texas had average uninsured rates of 200 or more generally states with the lowest uninsured rates were located in the midwest and northeast states with the highest rates were in the south and west figure 1 crs2 table 1 provides private health insurance1 public health insurance2 and uninsured estimates with percentage rankings by state the right side of the table indicates whether states threeyear average uninsured rate is statistically lower shown with statistically higher shown with or not statistically different shown with x than the national rate of 1553 both private and public health insurance affect states uninsured rate for example as shown in table 1 minnesota and maine have similarly low uninsured rates4 however minnesota has the highest threeyear average private coverage rate in the country 797 and relatively low public coverage rate 240 on the other hand maine has lower threeyear average private coverage rate 695 and the highest public coverage rate 359 thus even though there are differences regarding whether people in maine and minnesota obtain private or public health insurance the impact is that both have similarly low uninsured rates states with the highest rankings for average percentage uninsured during 20052007 led by texas with nearly quarter of its population have some of the lowest rankings for private coverage all but two of the 10 states with the highest uninsured rates shown in the last 10 rows of table 1 rank in the lowest 10 states for private coverage estimates with 95 confidence intervals the estimates in this report are based on data from the march 2008 supplement to the current population survey cps5 the cps is representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized population and is designed to produce reliable estimates at the national regional and state levels the small sample sizes available from the cps for many states make it prudent to use threeyear average when comparing statelevel estimates and to consider the estimates in terms of range of values like table 1 table 2 shows the best point estimates or single values for the average number and percentage of people covered and not covered by health insurance it also reports range of values the 95 confidence interval for these estimates the larger the confidence interval in relation to the size of the estimate the less reliable the estimate the size of the range depends primarily on the sample size 95 confidence interval means that if repeated samples were collected under essentially the same conditions and their confidence intervals calculated in the long 1 coverage through an employer or union all coverage from outside the home and coverage purchased directly from private insurer 2 medicare medicaid the state childrens health insurance program schip and other governmentprovided health insurance as well as coverage related to employment in the military 3 statistical significance was tested at the 95 confidence level also referred to as the 5 significance level this means that one can be 95 certain that the difference between states uninsured rate and the national rate is not zero ie the states rate is statistically higher or lower or could be zero ie the states rate is not statistically different 4 their uninsured rates are statistically lower than the national rate and are not statistically different from each other 5 because the supplement is now fielded from february through april it has been officially renamed the annual social and economic supplement asec to the cps though many analysts continue to refer to it by its traditional name crs3 run about 95 of those intervals would contain the true number of people with or without health insurance reasons for differences in the percentage uninsured figure 1 indicates that people in the south and west are more likely to lack health insurance and that residents of the midwest and northeast are more likely to be covered various characteristics of states population may account for these differences nationwide the uninsured rate is related to age race and ethnicity employment and number of other factors6 the prevalence of particular population and employer characteristics may account for some of the regional or state variation in uninsured rates the percentage of states population that is uninsured may also be affected by state policies such as eligibility criteria for the states medicaid program or its state childrens health insurance program schip 6 for more information see crs report 96891 health
