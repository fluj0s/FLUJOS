address on january 28 2008 the president explained the reason for issuing the executive order the peoples trust in their government is undermined by congressional earmarks special interest projects that are of ten stuck in at the last minute without discussion or debate last year i as ked you to voluntarily cut the number of earmarks and the cost of earmarks in lf i also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that ne ver come to vote unfortunately neither goal was met so this time if you send an appropriations bill that does not cut the number or cost of earmar ks in half ill send it back to you with my veto and tomorrow i will issue an executive order that directs federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by congress if these items are truly worth funding congress s hould debate them in the open and hold public vote16 presidential authority to issue executive orders and their legal effect there is long tradition of congressiona l

vested in president of the united states that the president shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states and that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed17 the presidents power to issue executive orders and proclamations ma also derive from express or implied statutory authority18 irrespective of the nature of the authority to issue executive orders and proclamations th instruments have been employed by every president since the inception of the republic and presidents have not hesitated to wield this power over wide ra nge of often cont roversial subjects19 furthermore if issued under valid claim of authority and published these instruments may have the force and effect of law requiring courts to take judicial notice of their existence20 while these principles establish the aut hority of the president to issue executive orders generally the question of whet her particular order comports with constitutional and statutory provisions requires more nuanced analysis the framework for analyzing the validity of an executive order was delineated in youngstown sheet tube co v sawyer 21 there the supreme court dealt with president trumans executive order direc ting the seizure of steel mills which was issued in an effort to avert the effects of workers strike during the korean war invalidating this action the majority held that under the constitution the presidents power to see that laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be lawmaker22 specifically justice black mainta ined that presidential authority to issue such an executive order must stem either from an act of congress or from the constitution itself23 applying this reasoning ju stice blacks opinion for the court determined that as statute or constitutional provision authorized such presidential action the seizur order was in essence legislative act the court further noted that congress had rejected seizure as means to settle labor disputes during consideration of the tafthartley act given this characterization the court deemed the executive order to be an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine explaining the founders of this nation entrusted the lawmaking power to the congress alone in both good and bad times24 while justice blacks majority opinion in youngstown seems to refute the notion that the president possesses implied constitutional powers there were five concurrences in the case four of which maintained that implied presidential authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34373crs5 25 id

majority opinion specifically justice jackson establis hed tripartite sc heme for analyzing the validity of presidential actions in relation to constitutional and congressional authority26 justice jacksons first category focuses on whether the president has acted according to an express or implied grant of congressional authority if so according to jackson presidential authority is at its maximum for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that congress can delegate and such action is supported by the strongest of presumpti ons and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation27 secondly justice jackson mainta ined that in situations where congress has neither granted nor denied authority to the president the president acts in reliance only upon his ow n independent powers but th ere is zone of twilight in which he and congress may have concurrent authority or in which its distribution is uncertain28 in the third and final category justice jackson stated that in instances where presidential action is incompati ble with the express or implied will of congress the power of the president is at its minimum and any such action may be supported pursuant only the presidents own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of congress over the matter29 in such circumstance presidential action must rest upon an excl usive power and the courts can uphold the measure only by disabling the congress from acting upon the subject30 with regard to president trumans order justice jackson determined that analysis under the first category was inappropria due to the fact that seizure of steel mills had not been authorized by congress either implicitly or explicitly justice jackson also determined that the second category was clearly eliminated in that congress had addressed the i ssue of seizure through statutory policies conflicting with the presidents actions31 employing the third category justice jackson noted that president trumans actions could only be sustained by determining that the seizure was within his domain nd beyond control by congress32 justice jackson concluded that such matters were not outside the scope of congressional power reinforcing his declaration that permitting the president to exercise such conclusivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34373crs6 33 id at 638 640645 34 exec order 12291 46 fed reg 13193

osha governing ethylene oixide including challenge based on the argument that critical portion of the proposed rule had been deleted based on command from omb while stating that ombs participation in the rulemaking presents di fficult constitutional questions concerning the executives proper role in administrative proceedings and the appropriate scope of delegated power from congress to certain executive agencies the court nonetheless found that it had occasion to reach the difficult constitutional questions presented by ombs participation id at 1507 37 see crs report rl32855 presidential review of agency rulemaking by t j halstead 2005and preclusive power would endanger the equilibrium established by our constitutional system33 applying these principles to the case at hand there does not appear to be any discernible basis upon which it could be asserted that executive order 13457 runs contrary to constitutional or statutory precepts while th potential centralization of control over agency treatment of nonstat utory earmarks raises significant policy issues eo 13457 appears to fall within the accepted parameters of presidential authority in the executive order context particularly when viewed in relation to other executive orders that have asserted similar and arguably more expansive centralization authority for instance in 1981 president r eagan issued ex ecutive or der 12291 ushering in new era of presidential control over agency rulemaking activity34 eo 12291 required costbenefit analyses and blished centralized review procedure for all agency regulations eo 12291 legated responsibility for this clearance requirement to the office of information and regulatory affairs which had recently been created within the office of management and budget as part of the paperwork reduction act of 1980 the impact of eo 12291 on agency regulatory activities was immediate and substantia l generating controversy and criticism opponents of the order asserted that review thereunder was distinctly antiregulatory and constituted an unconstitutional transfer of authority from the executive agencies35 despite these concerns cour ts considering omb involvement in agency rulemaking under the executive order did not address the constitutionality of such review36 and congress did not act to countermand th executive order the review scheme established in the reagan administrati on has been employed and modified by subsequent administrations in manner that conveys conception of presidential authority consonant with that of the reagan order37 however arguments against the constitutionality of these executive orders have largely diminished to the point thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34373crs7 38 id 39 508 us 182 1993presidential review of agency rulemaking has become widely used and increasingly accepted mechanism by which presiden t can exert significant and sometimes determinative authority over the agency rulemaking process38 the implicit acquiescence of congress and the courts regarding the constitutionality of 12291 and its successors indicates that president may successfully utilize executive orders to ex ert significant centralized control over executive branch activity that has traditionally been exercised at the departmental or agency level this rationale seems fully applicable to executive order 13457 particularly in light of the fact that non statutory earmarks are not legally binding on executive branch agencies consistency between executive order and existing case law regarding report language art i sec 9 cl 7 of the constitution states that money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of ppropriations made by law with respect to all appropriations ws and other legislation enacted af ter the date of the order the executive order directs each agency head to take all necessary steps to ensure that agency spending decisions are based on th text of laws and not on language in legislative history documents or other c ongressional communications to agencies and otherwise to implement the policy that ear marks should be included in the text of bills voted upon by congress and presented to the president the supreme court in lincoln v vigil39 unanimously acknowledged premise upon which the executive order appears to be ba sed language in legislative history documents does not legally bind agencies unless it is enacted in the text of statute fundamental principle of appropriati ons law is that where congress merely appropriates lump sum amounts without st atutorily restricting what can be done with those funds clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose legally binding restrictions and i ndicia in committee reports and other legislative history as to how funds should or

though not as we have seen just in the legislative history40 year later in shannon v united states 41 the court emphasized this point when it observed that we are not aware of any case in which we have given authoritative weight to single passage of legislative history that is in way anchored in the text of statute we ag ree with the dc circuit that courts have authority to enforce principle gleaned solely from legislative history that has statutory reference point42 the court in the lincoln case quoted from ltv aerospace corp decision of the comptroller general who heads th government accountability office gao formerly the general accounting office in that decision the comptroller general said that with respect to appropriations there is clear distinction to be made between the imposition of statutory restrictions or c onditions which are intended to be legally binding and the technique of specifyi ng restrictions or conditions in nonstatutory context in this regard congress has recognized that in most instances it is desirable to maintain executive flex ibility to shift around funds within particular lump sum so that agencies can make necessary adjustments this is not to say that congress does not expect that funds will be spent in accordance with budget estimates or in accordance with restrictions detailed in committee reports however in order to preserve spending flexibility it may choose not to impose those particular restrictions as matter of law but rather to leave it to the agencies to keep faith with the cong ress there are practical reasons why agencies can be expected to comply with these congressional expectations on the other hand when congress does not intend to permit agency flexibility but intends to impose legally binding restriction on an agencys use of funds it does so by means of explicit statutory language43 the comptroller general added that as general proposition there is distinction to be made between utilizing legislative history for the purpose of illuminating underlying language and resorting to that history for the purpos of writing into law that which is not there an accommodation has developed between the congress and the executive branch resulting in the appropriation proc ess flexibility discussed above funds are most often appropriated in lump sums on the basis of mutual legislative

testimony and expressions of intent in committee reports the understandings reached generally are not engrafted upon the appropriation provisions enacted to establish as matter of law specific restrictions covering the detailed and complete basis upon which appropriated funds are underst ood to be provided would as practical matter severely limit the capability of agencies to accommodate changing conditions44 both the supreme court and the comp troller general have indicated the consequence for an agency if it disregards directives in legislative history documents the court in the lincoln case said that and of course we hardly need to note that an agencys decision to ignore congressional expectations may expose it to grave political consequences45 referring to passage wh ich indicated that congress sometimes places restrictions in legislative history documents rather than in statutory text to permit agencies to accommodate ch anging conditions when allocating funds the comptroller general stated that this does not mean agencies are free to ignore clearly expressed legislative history applicable to the use of appropriated funds they ignore such expressions of intent at the pe ril of strained relations with the congress the executive branch has practical duty to abide by such expressions this duty however must be understood to fall short of statutory requi rement giving rise to legal infraction where there is failure to carry out that duty46 congressional response to executive order the above sections have reviewed th elements of executive order 13457 the legal basis for the president to issue executive orders and their legal effect and the consistency between the substance of the order and case law which acknowledges that earmarks in legislative history documen ts but not in statutory text do not legally bind agencies to fund them primary pur pose of the executive order appears to be to limit the discretion of individual execu tive agency heads to fund earmarks that appear only in legislative history do cuments and other nonstatutory sources it expresses uniform policy throughout the executive branch that they generally should not be funded and that agency heads should base funding decisions on authorized transparent statutory cr iteria and meritbase d decisionmaking congress has number of options to re spond to this executive order it can choose to operate within the new legal milie u that it appears to formalize or take steps to countermand it one option to opera within it of course would be for congress expressly to include each earmark in the text of statute and thereby place it beyond the agency decisionmaking pro cess that the executive order requires for nonstatutory ones to become law each earmark in bill would have to pass the house and senate and be pres ented to the president and if the bill were vetoed pass by twothirds of each house to override presidential veto another form of express incorporation would be for congress to incl ude language in statute to the effecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34373crs10 47 pl 1105 121 stat 8 2007 48 id chap 10 21057b 121 stat at 55 49 467 us 837 1984

in corporate by reference in the text of statute each earmark that appears in legislative history documents in such way that members and senators voting on the incorporating textual language and the president to whom the language is presen ted would be made aware of the earmarks involved an example is provision of the revised continuing appropriations resolution 200747 which provides that the office of national drug control policy shall expend funds for counterdrug tec hnology center by public law 109115 in accordance with the joint explanatory st atement of the committee of conference hrept 109307 within 60 days after the date of enactment of this section48 the unambiguous language of directiv of this type shall expend would appear legally to bind an agency to expend funds in accordance with the joint explanatory statement to which the directive refers in chevron usa v natural resources defense council inc 49 the supreme court held that when court reviews an agencys constr uction of statute it is confronted with two questions first always is th question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue if the intent of congress is clear that is the end of the matter for the court as we ll as the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress50 passage in the policy section of the earmarks executive order may acknowledge this principle it states in re levant part that f or appropriations laws and other legislation enacted after the date of this order executive agencies should not commit obligate or expend funds on th basis of earmarks included in any non statutory source including reports of committees of the congress or other congressional documents excep t when required by law if congress should choose to attempt to countermand the executive order it could seek to enact language stating that it should have force and effect another congressional option would be to seek to deny funds to the office of management and budget to enforce the order as noted bove 4b of the order states that it shall be implemented in manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropr iations there is precedent fo r congress enacting statute to revoke an executive order during the administration of president william j clinton congress enacted provision of the national

previous year directed the secretary of health and human services to estab lish fetal tissue bank given the highly speculative basis of any asserted constitutional authority for the president to issue such an order there appears to be little doubt as to the legitimacy of this congressional revocation53 however any congressiona l attempt to revoke the earmarks executive order could set the stage for more significant confrontation given the broad conception of presidentia l authority upon which its issuance appears to be premised54 ultimately whether enacting statute to revoke the order or enacting language denying omb funds to enforce it would have significant legal effect is not clear because of the nature of the order as noted in the discussi on above on consistency between it and relevant case law execu tive order 13457 does not appear to create new law instead it directs executive agencies to comply with principle acknowledged by the supreme court namely that agencies are not legally required to fund earmarks contained in legislative doc uments but not in the text of statutes its significance appears to be in the blishment of uniform policy throughout the executive branch and the imposition of specific duties on agency heads to foster its implementation conclusion the provisions of executive order 13457 may significantly influence the dynamic that has traditionally governed executive and legislative practice with regard to nonstatutory earmarks but the order itself appears to fall within the accepted parameters of presidential authority in the executive order context courts have acknowledged premise upon which the order appears to be based earmarks in legislative history documents and other sources that are not anchored in statutory text have legal force or effect moreover while the provisions of the order appear to direct executive agencies to refrain from funding nonstatutory earmarks that they may have funded as matter of c ourse before it was issued congress has options such as expressly including earmarks in the texts of statutes or statutorily incorporating by reference earmarks in legislative histor documents these congressional responses may ameliorate the impact of the order ultimately the extent to which the earmarks executive order will affect agency practi ce pertaining to nonstatutory earmarks remains to be seen and as the foregoing an alysis indicates may prove to be more matter of political rather than legal significance
