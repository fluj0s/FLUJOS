by another procurement officer that the mode of delivery was not veri fied as there was reason to suspect that there was something wrong with the deliveries148 172 another procurement officer stated that procurement depended on the information provided by either the ri or th pouch unit as they we re not involved in the actual receiving process and ther efore could not know how the goods were

based company was supplier of commercial goods to the organisation and many of its p eacekeeping missions commencing in 1996 approximately and continuing through and until october 2005 during this time the company with full knowledge of the wrongf ulness of its actions improperly used the diplomatic pouch service to transport goods to the organisa tions missions in violation of the privileges granted to the united nations under the convention of the privileges and immunities these actions were not approve d by the organisation and continued despite former cpo of unmibh mr francois chapais might have filed formal complaint the task force was not able to corroborate this information as mr chapais retired from the united nations in 2003 and will not be available for an interview until 1

unit redacted and strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 39 the fact that the company was sp ecifically directed to refrain from the use of the pouch to ship its goods the egregiousness of op gs acts were further compounded by the fact that the company often billed the organisation for its ship ments despite receiving the benefits of free transport of its items thr ough the use of the diplomatic pouch as result of such actions the company wa s improperly personally enriched and the organisation was defrauded by suffering losse s for opgs false billings for freight charges which were in fact not incurred 189 based upon all facts and circumstances as well as the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom it is evident that opg nd its principal executive officers the subject also known as aka joe sco tt and don thompson engaged in criminal scheme to defraud the organisation through false an d fraudulent represen tations fraudulent practices and the submission of invoices eking reimbursement for charges which in fact had not been incurred the scheme furthe r consisted of the prac tice of charging the organisation for freight costs for their liveries to several of the organisations missions and overseas locations while at th same time shipping their items free of charge through the use of the diplomatic pouch 190 in furtherance of the scheme the comp any presented the organisation with false documents seeking payment for transportation co sts which in fact had not been incurred opg purposefully included such costs in quotations purchase orders and invoices although these costs were effectively never borne by the company it is clear that opgs claim that the presentation of such documents and these incidents were the product of accident is without credibility in light of the sheer number of cases and the numerous instances in which the practice was brought to the attention of opg and the company was instructed to cease its activitie s despite these admonitions the company and its officers pursued this strategy in number of the organisations missions continued to use the diplomatic pouch for ordinary commercial shipments and improperly receive reimbursement for transpor tation fees not due and owing to them 191 as result of the scheme the organisation suffered quant ifiable losses at least in the amount of us60970 us33707 of which was recovered it is quite likely that this figure is underestimated as the investigation only fo cused upon 13 missions in which records were available but incomplete while several other missions records were unable to be examined at all 192 the task force further finds that the subject was improperly granted full access to the united nations premises and wa s improperly issued the united nations identification holding united nations ground pass the subject was able to deliver goods directly to the pouch unit without prior security clearance where the boxes containing the goods were accepted without examination of the contents the ability of the company to gain direct access to the pouch unit effectively aided the scheme and was factor in allowing for its continuati on however the gross negligence of the united nations staff also played major role in perpetuating the scheme oios

fraudulent efforts continue as he seeks to do business through iases and through other corporate identities b the headquarters pouch unit 194 the task force has not identified evidence of purposeful collusi on in the scheme on the part of any staff member at the h eadquarters mail operations unit or the pouch unit 195 however the task forces examination of this matter under the relevant united nations staff rules administrative instructi on and the convention of the privileges of the united nations results in the following 196 staff at the pouch unit in breach of the convention of the immunities and privileges of the united nations and the corresponding provisions in administrative instruction stai368 accepted goods from opg and other commercial vendors for dispatch through the pouch wit hout proper approval or author ization by the appropriate united nations entities 197 the former chief of mail operations mr almeida failed to appropriately respond to this abuse of the pouch system wh it was brought to his attention in 2001 198 mr almeida and staff member 13 the recently retired ch ief of the special services section failed in th eir duties to implement and enfo rce procedures to protect the interests of the organisation and this fa ilure resulted in financial loss to the organisation of at least us60970 161 this figure constitutes very conservative estimate of the loss in light of the fact that the task force was unable to examine all the pertinent documents for shipments of items by opg in addition mr almeida and staff member 13 failed in properly exercisi ng their supervisory f unctions and allowed opgs efforts to continue when the companys privileges should have been curtailed and the company firmly barred from use of the pouch to transport its goods c the united nations missions and overseas agencies 199 the task force could not identify any fo rm of collusion or participation in opgs scheme on the part of the united nations officials at the field missions and overseas offices however the inve stigations revealed the following 200 that opgs billing practices of repeat edly charging freight costs while using the pouch was widely known amongst procurement officials and other united nations staff members at missions and overs eas offices as result of poor communication between the organisations personnel in the united nations missions and headquarters and insufficient instruction given to the united nations staff in the missions opgs nefarious behavior was not br ought to the attention of th united nations headquarters 161

nations pouch unit redacted and strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 41 until 2005 the lack of notice to appropriate officials in the headquarters procurement service and the office of central support serv ices enabled opg to continue their fraudulent activities undiscovered and undeterred for many years 201 the task force has found that instructi on of staff at the united nations field missions on the use purpose and restrictions of the pouch service was insufficient to prevent the misuse of the diplomatic privileges granted to the organisation for the transmission of its items in international transit 202 further clear responsibilitie s of the parties involved in the process were not delineated many united nations staff members were and c ontinue to be unfamiliar with the policies concerning the use of th diplomatic pouch service which are in existence this lack of proper procedur as well as awareness and sense of responsibility amongst staff members also contri buted to opgs ability to continue its activities undiscovered and unint errupted for many years 203 further it is clear that th contents of shipments of goods through the diplomatic pouch are not sufficiently and consistently examined exposing risks that the pouch will be used for improper and even illegal means this risk came to fruition recently as several individuals were arrested for usi ng the pouch to transmit illegal contraband internationally such method of shipment is particularly attractive to smugglers because shipments by pouch are not examined by customs officials vii conclusions 204 the task force finds that the subject and the company opg engaged in criminal scheme to defraud the organisation in violation of the co mmon law and title 18 united states code section 1343 the or ganisation was victim of the scheme 205 the task force concludes that the former chief of the mail operations unit did not properly exercise his manage rial functions by failing to take corrective measures once the scheme was identified not ensuring that pg and the subject were denied access to use the pouch unit for commercial shipments and not informing other officials in the organisation of the unauthori zed and illegal activity all in violation of united nations staff regulation 12b 206 the former chief of the special services section did not properly exercise his managerial functions by failing to implemen t and enforce procedures to protect the integrity of the diplomatic privile ges granted to the organisation 207 the task force concludes that the personnel in the pouch units at the headquarters in new york and in the missi ons were generally derelict in their responsibilities and functions once irregularities in the use of the pouch were identified and it became known that opg was improperly billing for shipments costs not actually incurred oios procurement task force
