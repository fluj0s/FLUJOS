jickling specialist in financial economics government and finance division summary the commodity exchange act exempts certain energy derivatives contracts from regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc these exemptions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22912 are popularly known as the enron loophole soaring energy prices have raised concerns about whether the cftc has enough information about these unregulated markets to monitor energy trading in comprehensive manner the farm bill pl 110234 established more stringent regulatory regime for electronic trading facilities that offer contracts that play significant role in setting energy prices number of other bills in the 110th congress would impose new reporting or regulatory requirements on the bilateral energy swaps market which was not addressed by the farm bill this report will be updated as legislative developments warrant background in 2000 congress passed the commodity futures modernization act cfma pl 106554 whose central purpose was to set out the conditions under which derivative financial contracts instruments like futures options or swaps whose value is linked to the price of some underlying commodity could be legally traded in the overthe counter otc market that is off the futures exchanges that are regulated by the commodity futures trading commission cftc the cfma established three categories of commodities and made them subject to varying degrees of regulation financial commodities such as interest rates currency prices or stock indexes were defined as excluded commodities excluded commodities can be traded in the otc market with minimal cftc oversight provided that small public investors are not allowed to trade second category is agricultural commodities here because of concerns about price manipulation the law specifies that all derivatives based on farm commodities must be traded on cftcregulated exchange unless the cftc issues specific exemption after finding that proposed otc agricultural contract would be consistent with the public interest1 finally there is third allother category exempt commodities which includes whatever is neither financial nor agricultural in todays markets this means primarily metals and energy commodities the statutory exemption 1 this exemptive authority is in section 4c of the commodity exchange act crs2 from regulation provided by the cfma for exempt commodities is commonly known as the enron loophole2 what is exempt from regulation the cfma added new section 2h to the commodity exchange act exempting two classes of transactions from most cftc regulation first bilateral contracts between eligible contract participants3 that are not executed on trading facility4 are exempt from the commodity exchange act except for certain antifraud and manipulation provisions second contracts in exempt commodities between eligible commercial entities5 that are executed on an electronic trading facility6 are also exempt from most provisions of the commodity exchange act substantial volumes of trading in energy contracts avail themselves of each of these exemptions the bilateral swaps market in the bilateral swaps7 market there is centralized marketplace equivalent to the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22912 futures exchanges like nymex or the chicago board of trade instead number of financial institutions large commercial and investment banks act as dealers they stand ready to offer contracts linked to commodity prices taking the other side of their customers positions the customers include hedgers producers and commercial buyers of commodities other financial institutions and speculators such as hedge funds and institutional investors eligible contract participants may enter into swaps directly with each other but the market is dominated by large dealers partly because of concerns about credit risk or the risk of counterparty default very little information is available about otc commodity markets the bank for international settlements bis conducts surveys of swap dealers which probably capture 2 before its collapse in 2001 enron corp was pioneer in otc energy trading and developed an electronic market enron online for trading physical and derivative contracts based on number of energy products 3 defined in the law as financial institutions insurance companies brokerdealers government units professional futures traders and businesses and individuals meeting certain asset and income thresholds the presumption is that these are sophisticated traders who do not need the protections offered by government regulation 4 trading facility is defined in law as facility or system in which multiple participants have the ability to execute or trade agreements contracts or transactions by accepting bids and offers made by other participants that are open to multiple participants in the facility or system 5 these are defined as eligible contract participants see note 3 above who 1 deal in the physical commodity or 2 regularly provide risk management or hedging services to those who do 6 defined as trading facility see note 4 above that operates over an electronic or telecommunications network and maintains an audit trail of transactions 7 swap is derivative contract economically equivalent to futures contract two counterparties agree to exchange payments over the life of the contract the payments fluctuate according to changes in the underlying commoditys price so that the net cash flow is always positive for one party and negative for the other crs3 most of the market but the bis data do not break out individual commodities they report that the notional value8 of outstanding otc derivatives on commodities other than precious metals at the end of 2007 was 83 trillion up from 50 trillion in 2005 in terms of gross market values the figures were 673 billion in 2007 and 813 billion in 20059 market value also called fair value measures the current worth of derivative based on whether the related cash flows are positive or negative the time remaining to the contracts expiration and the volatility of the underlying price at the end of 2007 two of the largest dealers in energy swaps morgan stanley and goldman sachs reported that the fair value of their commodity derivatives totaled 412 billion and 288 billion respectively10 electronic trading facilities since the passage of the cfma in 2000 an exchangelike market for energy derivatives has come into being trading occurs on electronic platforms among eligible commercial entities under the cfma the cftc had substantive regulatory authority httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22912 over these electronic trading facilities the markets were required to notify the cftc that they were operating and provide very basic information about the owners of the market cftc regulations refer to these trading facilities as exempt commercial markets ecms the cftc website lists 18 ecms 12 of which trade energy contracts 2007 cftc study reported that eight of these were active and suggests that only single ecm handled volume of energy transactions comparable to the regulated exchanges that market is operated by intercontinentalexchange inc ice11 while the ecms are not subject to reporting requirements under the commodity exchange act some information about ices activities appears in the firms securities and exchange commission filings ices electronic platform offers hundreds of different contracts but most of the volume is accounted for by about two dozen highly liquid contracts in north american natural gas and electrical power and global crude oil trading volume in 2007 for these three commodities was 158 million contracts natural gas 83 million power and 85 million oil the notional value of the natural gas contracts traded was 27 trillion comparable to the nymex figure of 29 billion12 8 notional value is the value of the underlying commodity in derivatives however since traders do not own or purchase the underlying commodity notional value is merely reference point used to calculate gains and losses which are based on changes in price 9 bank for international settlements

contracts in 2007 ice futures europe regulated exchange in the united kingdom owned by ice traded 111 million and the mcx located in india partly owned by nymex traded 14 million13 us exchanges have tried to establish market for electricity futures but have never succeeded according to the cftc the ice and nymex natural gas markets are economically linked and function as single market the major traders on ice are also the major traders on nymex as result the cftc concluded in october 2007 that its capacity to monitor trading on nymex was limited and that it needed further transparency with regard to ices otc market14 the cftc made recommendations for legislation that would extend cftc oversight to certain electronic trading facilities offering contracts based on exempt commodities closing the enron loophole the farm bill in late 2007 both the house and senate considered legislation that generally httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22912 followed the cftcs recommendations in may 2008 provisions addressing the regulation of ecms were included in title xiii of the farm bill hr 2419 and enacted as pl 110234 the farm bill amends section 2h of the commodity exchange act to provide for cftc regulation of electronic trading facilities that offer significant price discovery contracts in exempt commodities these contracts are those that perform significant price discovery function that is contracts 1 with settlement price linked to regulated markets contract 2 that may be the subject of arbitrage trading involving exchangelisted contracts 3 that are traded in sufficient volume to have an effect on other market prices or 4 that are used as reference point for pricing transactions in other markets once the cftc determines that contract meets one or more of these criteria the electronic trading facility becomes subject to exchangelike regulation an electronic trading facility on which the cftc determines that significant price discovery contracts are traded will be required to comply with nine core regulatory principles the facility will have to ensure that contracts are not readily susceptible to manipulation monitor trading in significant price discovery contracts to prevent market manipulation price distortion and disruptions of the delivery or cashsettlement process 12 continued 2007 p 8 and volume surges again futures industry magazine marapr 2008 p 23 13 ibid contract size varies from market to market 14 cftc report on the oversight of trading on regulated futures exchanges and exempt commercial markets oct 2007 p 12 crs5 establish and enforce rules that will allow it to obtain any necessary information to monitor trading adopt position limits or position accountability levels for speculators in significant price discovery contracts provide for emergency authority to liquidate open positions and to suspend trading in significant price discovery contract publish daily trading information on price and volume monitor and enforce compliance with the rules of the electronic trading facility applicable to significant price discovery contracts including the terms and conditions of the contracts and any limitations on access to the market and avoid conflicts of interest and antitrust violations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22912 these core principles are very similar to the principles that apply to the futures exchanges except that the exchanges must comply with additional principles dealing with protection of small public customers the farm bill does not alter provisions in current law that limit trading on electronic trading facilities to eligible commercial entities see note 5 above who are presumed to be sophisticated traders who do not need government protection in addition the farm bill requires that trading in significant price discovery contracts be subject to the cftcs large trader reporting system the cftc receives daily reports on all positions that exceed specified size thresholds and publishes the data in aggregate form in its weekly commitments of traders reports distinguishing between hedging and speculative positions is the loophole still open the farm bill provisions will bring major changes to markets where the cftc identifies significant price discovery contracts they will become selfregulatory organizations with formal enforcement responsibilities the cftc will have enhanced authority not only will it routinely receive data about trading and the positions of hedgers and speculators but it will have power to suspend or revoke the operations or regulatory status of an electronic trading facility that fails to comply with the core principles fails to enforce its own rules or violates applicable cftc regulations there is question of how far the new regulatory regime will extend since the key designation is significant price discovery contract rather than market could the new regulations apply to single contract traded on market but not the market as whole in terms of trade data and position reporting requirements the answer appears to be yes but in other areas it is not clear since the electronic trading facility with single significant price discovery contract would be required to set up market surveillance operation to prevent manipulation why would it limit that operation to single contract it might enhance trader confidence and improve its competitive position by applying that surveillance system to all trading crs6 the farm bill does not affect bilateral swaps that are negotiated between two parties rather than executed on trading facility accessible to multiple market participants the commodity swaps market is large and growing and it can be argued that the logic that led the cftc to call for more regulation of electronic facilities that such facilities were economically linked to the regulated markets and used by the same traders also applies to the swaps market the major dealers in commodity swaps also trade on nymex leading wall street firms all have seats on the exchange and it is very likely that major commercial hedgers such as oil companies utilities and transportation firms also use the exchange and swaps markets simultaneously speculators like hedge funds and investment banks proprietary trading desks constantly seek out arbitrage opportunities among the various markets it is not clear why if the cftc expects to benefit from more transparency in the electronic trading facility market it would not similarly benefit if new disclosure or self regulatory requirements were applied to bilateral swaps however in its october 2007 report on exempt commercial markets the agency concluded that staff experience in surveillance of these markets does not suggest that the otc bilateral or voice broker energy markets exhibit significant price discovery attributes thus their direct impact on httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22912 other parties and markets is limited in addition the nonstandardized form and significant size and dispersion of these markets would make it extremely costly and difficult to extrapolate beneficial market surveillance information on routine basis15 further legislative proposals several bills before the 110th congress propose to regulate or otherwise affect the otc bilateral energy swaps market several bills hr 6330 hr 6341 hr 6372 and s 3134 would remove energy commodities from the category of exempt commodities and place them on the same regulatory footing as agricultural commodities this would require that otc energy contracts be approved by the cftc before they could be traded hr 6264 would limit participation in the otc energy market to firms that deal in the physical commodities hr 3009 s 577 s 3131 and s 3202 would impose new reporting requirements on energy swap dealers andor other otc market participants summaries of these bills are available in crs report rl34555 speculation and energy prices legislative responses by mark jickling and lynn j cunningham
