presidential nomination and confirmation for persons nominated by the president to lower court judgeships ie the us courts of appeals and district courts has increased steadily scholars and other observers have argued that several factors have contributed to this change1 one component of the increase in time to confirmation has been an increase in the number of senate returns of judicial nominations to the president all nominations including judicial nominations considered by the senate can be returned to the president in two cases after the adjournment sine die of congress or during recess of 30 or more days if the senate has not agreed by unanimous consent to carry nominations through the recess the president usually renominates the person whose nomination was returned this report provides an overview of renominations that occur in the context of the process of appointing judges to what may amount to life tenure positions on the us courts of appeals and district courts the report then provides data on the number of returned and resubmitted nominations between 1977 and 2006 covering the terms of presidents carter reagan george hw bush clinton and the first three congresses of president george w bush this report first reviews the nomination process assessing how renominations fit into that process the report then summarizes trends in renominations between 1977 and 2006 with particular attention to the senate judiciary committees practice of holding or not holding hearings for renominated individuals finally the report analyzes the confirmation rates of renominated individuals compared with those who are nominated only one time throughout this report attention will be called to the unique experience of the 107th congress where majority control of the senate shifted during the first session one of the consequences of that shift was the return of all of president bushs pending judicial nominees at the beginning of an intrasession recess in august 2001 one of the central considerations in this report is the difference between nominees and nominations each nominee to judgeship may receive several nominations 1 these factors include increased incidence of divided partisan control of the senate and the presidency increased disagreement among senators over nominees and rising attention to judicial nominations by interest groups see eg nancy scherer scoring points politicians activists and the lower federal court appointment process palo alto ca stanford university press 2005 and sarah binder and forest maltzman senatorial delay in confirming federal court judges 19471998 american journal of political science vol 46 1 january 2002 crs2 before being confirmed or rejected by the senate or having his or her name withdrawn by the president or returned to the president without renomination resubmissions and confirmation of judicial nominees the constitutional provisions governing appointment and confirmation of federal judges are straightforward according to article ii section 2 of the us constitution the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors other public ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law when the senate has consented to nomination it has done so in the form of vote on the presidents nominee2 this procedure applies to article iii judges as well as article i judges3 senate consideration of nominee is driven by senate rules one such rule rule xxxi provides in part that nominations pending before the senate shall be returned to the president if the senate adjourns or takes recess of more than 30 days the rule may be set aside if the senate agrees to do so by unanimous consent but failure to waive the rule usually by senator objecting to proposed unanimous consent agreement returns pending nominations to the president when the senate takes recess4 the senates august recess tends to last longer than 30 days5 and the recess between sessions of congress may also last more than 30 days in addition to returns that may occur during recess of the senate nominations are returned to the president if nominee has not been confirmed or rejected by the 2 in the first congress there was some dispute as to how the senate was to carry out its constitutional function the senate agreed at that time to do so by voice vote see joseph harris the advice and consent of the senate study of confirmation of appointments by the united states senate new york greenwood press 1988 pp 3739 3 article iii section 1 of the us constitution established the supreme court and such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish appointees to these courts hold their offices during good behaviour and their compensation may not be diminished while they hold their office judges on article i courts also called legislative courts are appointed by the president are confirmed by the senate and serve for fixed term the territorial and commonwealth courts as well as the court of appeals for the armed forces the us tax court the court of appeals for veterans claims and the court of federal claims are all article i courts in this report judges nominated to the territorial and commonwealth courts are included in statistical calculations those nominated to the other article i courts are not included in statistical calculations 4 senators have usually exempted from unanimous consent one or more pending nominations and have only rarely insisted on the return of all pending nominations see crs report rl31980 senate consideration of presidential nominations committee and floor procedure by elizabeth rybicki 5 the senates august recess has lasted at least 30 days every year since 1996 between 1977 and 1995 nine august recesses lasted fewer than 30 days in congress since 1977 has the senate gone without at least one 30day recess either during session or between sessions dates of senate sessions are available at httpsenategovreferenceresourcespdfcongresses2pdf crs3 senate or withdrawn by the president by the end of congress presidents may resubmit nominations on which the senate did not take action in previous congress6 resubmissions are important to understanding how long judicial nominees wait for senate confirmation one might consider the example of priscilla r owen nominated to the fifth circuit court of appeals by president george w bush judge owen was confirmed by the senate on may 25 2005 on nomination submitted to the senate on february 14 2005 period of 100 days from nomination to confirmation as appendix 1 indicates however judge owen was first nominated to the fifth circuit on may 1 2001 and her confirmation after she was nominated fourth time did not come until 1477 days after her original nomination the three earlier nominations of judge owen were each returned by the senate during the august recess in 2001 and at the end of both the 107th and 108th congresses respectively resubmissions are also relevant to presidents success rate on judicial confirmations to take recent example president clinton made 105 nominations to the circuit courts of appeals 65 of which were confirmed one might conclude then that 62 of president clintons courts of appeals nominations were successful however president clinton nominated 90 individuals to the courts of appeals of whom 65 were confirmed confirmation success rate of 727 in any administration if one calculates the percentage of confirmations using the number of nominations as the denominator one will likely calculate lower success rate than if one uses the number of nominees as the denominator returned nominations patterns in returned nominations table 1 outlines how many nominations were returned by congress between 1977 and 2006 the columns in the table indicate for each congress the number of nominations that were returned within session intrasession returns between sessions intersession returns and at the end of congress one nominee can have nominations returned more than once in given congress 6 the president may also renominate individuals whose nominations were rejected or withdrawn though this was not done with nomination to the us district courts or courts of appeals in the time frame covered by this report in 1844 president tyler renominated john c spencer to the supreme court after his nomination had been rejected by the senate the second spencer nomination was withdrawn by president tyler on the same day it was made see crs report rl33225 supreme court nominations 17892006 actions by the senate the judiciary committee and the president by denis steven rutkus and maureen bearden 7 roger l gregory originally nominated to the fourth circuit court of appeals by president clinton was confirmed once he was nominated by president george w bush as result he is considered one of president clintons 25 unsuccessful nominees see appendix 1 crs4 table 1

nominations database cell entries include district judges nominated to district courts in guam northern mariana islands and virgin islands sixteen nominations to these article i courts are included of which four were returned one intrasession return during the 101st congress one return at the end of each of the 96th 100th and 102nd congresses fourteen nominations to seats on the court of international trade are also included two of which were returned one at the end of the 105th congress the other at the end of the 107th congress intrasession returns are those made during recesses within sessions of congress b intersession returns are those made during recesses between sessions of congress c charles w pickering sr and william h pryor jr are counted twice because both had two nominations pending in the 108th congress d william j haynes ii terrence w boyle michael b wallace n randy smith and william g myers iii are counted twice each in this cell all five had nominations returned to the president on aug 3 2006 and again on sept 29 2006 all five were also returned to the president at the end of the 109th congress crs5 several patterns emerge from table 1 first the overwhelming majority of returns of nominations occur at the end of congress intrasession and intersession returns are less common if one excludes the 107th congress for reasons discussed below 38 nominations have been returned during congress since 1977 compared with 310 returned at the end of congress second the four congresses during which the senate returned the most nominations were the 102nd 55 nominations returned the 106th 42 the 107th congress 71 and the 109th congress 50 forty of the 71 returns in the 107th congress occurred during the august recess following transfer in party control of the senate the 102nd and 106th congresses represent the final congresses coinciding with the presidencies of george hw bush and william clinton respectively one might interpret these numbers as suggesting that the senate when controlled by the opposite party of the president may attempt to wait out president whose party the opposition hopes to see end its run in the white house but the evidence to support such conclusion is mixed the number of returns in the 104th and 108th congresses the end of the first terms of president clinton and president george w bush respectively is not much greater than for congresses that did not lead up to presidential election furthermore more nominations were returned to the president at the end of president reagans first term the 98th congress 24 nominations than at the end of his second term the 100th congress 17 nominations third returns have disproportionately affected nominees to the courts of appeals between 1977 and 2006 1437 nominations were made to district court positions of which 243 169 were returned for the courts of appeals 461 nominations were made of which 145 315 were returned8 fourth the number of returns has trended upward particularly during the last eight congresses 102nd to 109th president george w bush has the greatest number of returned nominations per congress with 147 returns over three congresses an average of 49 nominations per congress if one excludes the 40 intrasession returns during the 107th congress the average is 357 returns per congress higher than the average number of returns per congress for president clinton 263 and president george hw bush 30 all three of those averages are higher than the average number of returns per congress for president reagan 138 and president carter 105 figure 1 plots the trends in number of returns per congress counting all types of returns intrasession intersession and end of congress as figure 1 indicates in every congress from the 103rd 19931994 through the 107th 20012002 the number of courts of appeals nominations returned increased with dropoff in the 108th congress the number of returns of courts of appeals nominations in the 109th congress was the secondhighest in the past 30 years with the exception of the 105th congress similar pattern can be observed for district court nominations though the 8 these numbers reflect nominations not nominees of which there were 358 for the courts of appeals and 1301 for district courts in the 95th 109th congresses crs6 number of district court nominations returned in the 109th congress 28 was the thirdhighest number since 1977 figure 1 returns of judicial nominations 95th 109th congresses 19772006 50 45 40 35 number of returns 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 congress district court returns court of appeals returns possible explanations for returns as suggested above analysis of table 1 and figure 1 makes clear that returns of nominations have generally increased over time and particular instances of high numbers of returns generally coincided with periods of divided party control of the presidency and the senate but divided party control of the senate and presidency also existed during the 100th through 102nd congresses and the 101st congress 19891990 had the lowest number of returns of any congress since the 97th 19811982 furthermore in the absence of divided party control in the 108th and 109th congresses nominees were returned with some frequency another explanation for the generally increasing frequency of returns may be related to timing in particular the president may have made nominations too late in congress for the senate to have given full consideration to the nominee if the timing of nomination contributed to the likelihood of return the nominations made later in congress would have been more likely to be returned to the president than those made earlier in congress this possibility can be evaluated by breaking each congress down into five periods specifically the first session roughly speaking the first year of any congress and then each of the quarters of the second session of each congress to see if the number of nominations returned increased in each period9 table 2 focuses on the first nomination of each individual to judgeship by the president and excludes those nominations that resulted in intrasession and intersession returns to provide clearer picture of the relationship 9 to simplify table 2 the first session of each congress was not broken up into quarters crs7 between the time remaining in congress and the likelihood of return of nomination of the 1437 district court and 461 courts of appeals nominations made between 1977 and 2006 1269 district court nominations and 332 courts of appeals nominations met these criteria the nominations were assigned to one of the five time periods on the basis of the date the nomination was received by the senate table 2 presents information on when nomination was submitted to the senate and the percentage of nominations returned to the president as the data in table 2 indicate 50 of nominations made to the district courts in the first session of congress were returned to the president while 404 of nominations made in the third quarter july 1september 30 of the second session of congress and 741 of the nominations made in the fourth quarter october 1 december 31 were returned this pattern suggests that one of the factors influencing the number of district court nominations returned to the president was the time in congress when the president made nomination this pattern is also found in nominations to the courts of appeals but the increase over time is somewhat less pronounced 160 of nominations made in the first session were returned at the end of congress while 306 of nominations made in the third quarter of the second session and 800 of the nominations made in the fourth quarter of the second session were returned the overall relationship between timing of nomination and probability of return may help explain why some nominations are returned while others are not but does not aid in understanding why the number of returned nominations has increased over the past 30 years if however more recent presidents have made more of their nominations near the end of congress then the senate may be returning more nominations simply because the president is nominating more individuals to judgeships later in congress table 3 reports the percentage of nominees who received their first nominations in the last six months of congress to somewhat greater degree than 30 years ago presidents are nominating individuals to the district courts late in congress and the senate is returning those nominations with greater frequency president george w bush 189 of first nominations submitted in the last six months of congress submitted greater percentage of nominations to district court judgeships than any other president in the past 30 years followed by presidents reagan and clinton both at 168 as the second column of table 3 indicates greater percentage of president george w bushs endofcongress nominations have been returned by the senate than any other presidents in the last 30 years the increased percentage of nominations made late in congress and the increased percentage of those nominations returned during president george w bushs tenure may explain the increase in returns but may themselves be explained by still other factors crs8 table 2 number of

nominations that were first returned during an intrasession or intersession recess are excluded from the data used for this table in order to illustrate the effect of time period of nomination on endof congress returns crs9 table 3 also indicates that on average nominations to the courts of appeals made in the last six months of congress were less likely to occur but more likely to be returned under presidents clinton and george w bush than under their three predecessors the percentage of nominations made by presidents to the courts of appeals in the last six months of congress was 100 for three of the five presidents between 1977 and 2006 presidents carter george hw bush and clinton president george w bush has nominated one judge to the courts of appeals for the first time in the last six months of congress and that nomination was returned by the senate at the end of congress10 the percentage of nominations to the courts of appeals made in the last six months of congress that were returned is substantially higher for presidents clinton and george w bush taken together than for the collective record of presidents carter reagan and george hw bush table 3 percentage of nominations

of the 109th congress crs10 patterns in renominations the president resubmitted the nominations of 197 individuals to the senate between 1977 and 2006 70 to the courts of appeals and 127 to the district courts the 70 individuals were renominated to the courts of appeals total of 103 times the 127 individuals renominated to the district courts were renominated total of 145 times not all returned nominations are resubmitted to the senate in some cases return at the end of congress may be of nomination made by president who is leaving office and the next president may choose not to renominate the person this particularly has been true when there have been changes in party control of the presidency one president since 1977 george w bush has resubmitted court of appeals nomination originally made by predecessor of the opposing party11 renominations of individuals originally nominated by president of different party to district judgeships are also uncommon but not quite as rare such renominations have occurred 10 times since 197712 table 4 and figure 2 track renominations of district court and courts of appeals nominees by president and congress the patterns observed in returned nominations appear to some degree in renominations whereas returns were most common at the end of presidents term renominations were least common during the first congress of president because individuals whose nominations were returned in the last congress of predecessor were unlikely candidates for renomination this is particularly noticeable when partisan control of the presidency changed with the elections of presidents carter reagan and clinton each of these presidents had three renominations in his first congress13 11 roger l gregory originally nominated to the fourth circuit court of appeals by president clinton was confirmed once he was nominated by president george w bush see appendix 1 12 two of the 10 nominees were first nominated by president carter and renominated by president reagan israel glasser eastern new york and john sprizzo southern new york one ralph nimmons middle florida was nominated by president carter and renominated by president

joanna seybert eastern new york and david trager eastern new york two david cercone western pennsylvania and legrome davis eastern pennsylvania were first nominated by president clinton and was renominated by president george w bush all 10 were confirmed see appendix 2 for additional details on these nominees 13 president clinton also renominated james jones to the western district of virginia in the 104th congress judge jones was originally nominated by president carter crs11 table 4 number of us district court and us courts of appeals renominations by president and congress 95th

103 239 source crs judicial nominations database cell entries include all renominations including those of persons first nominated in previous congress or earlier in the same congress two other patterns are consistent with respect to returns appeals court nominees are disproportionately represented in the renomination data and there has been marked increase over time in the number of renominations these two patterns clearly flow from the increase in returned nominations but some specific data may prove illustrative of the 1437 total nominations to district court positions between 1977 and 2006 136 or 94 were renominations of the 461 total nominations to the courts of appeals over that same time period 103 or 223 were renominations of the 245 returned district judge nominations 136 555 of the nominations were resubmitted of the 145 returned courts of appeals nominations 103 710 of the nominations were resubmitted14 14 on jan 9 2007 president george w bush resubmitted the nominations of four of the 10 nominees to the courts of appeals whose nominations were returned at the end of the 109th congress and 24 of the 28 district court nominations returned at the end of the 109th congress this raises the count of resubmitted nominations to 140 of 245 571 for the courts of appeals and 127 of 145 875 for the district courts as of jan 9 2007 crs12 finally as noted above in the case of returns the number of renominations has also increased over time using the data from table 4 one can calculate the average number of renominations per congress for each president president carter resubmitted judicial nomination an average of two times per congress president reagan resubmitted judicial nomination an average of 95 times per congress president george hw bush did so seven times per congress and president clinton averaged 133 judicial renominations per congress if one does not count the 40 nominations returned by the senate in august 2001 and resubmitted the next month president george w bush has averaged 297 renominations per congress for his first three congresses15 figure 2 tracks this rise by congress for district court and courts of appeals nominations that were resubmitted as figure 2 indicates greater number of renominations have certainly occurred over the last three congresses but the 104th 105th and 106th congresses all saw more renominations than most other congresses the clear exception being the considerable number of renominations to district court judgeships in the 99th congress 19851986 which followed the return of 17 nominations to

following change in party control of the senate as table 6 indicates majority of the 70 courts of appeals nominees whose nominations were resubmitted during the 19772006 period received hearings by the senate even if they did not receive those hearings on their first nominations fifty five of the 70 nominees 786 received hearings on at least one of their first two nominations nine of the 70 129 received hearings on both the first and second nominations the most common pattern is for nominees to receive hearings on their first nominations but to receive hearings on their second nominations 33 of the 70 nominees 471 whose nominations were resubmitted followed this trend some 15 nominees did not receive hearings on either of their first two nominations six of these were individuals nominated first in the 106th congress by president clinton and then renominated at the beginning of the 107th congress 17 days before president 18 continued motion on the nomination crs15 clinton left office the remaining nine nominees who did not receive hearings on their first or second nominations received third nominations hearings for courts of appeals nominees with three or more nominations twentyfour individuals were renominated more than once to the courts of appeals during the 19772006 period see table 5 fifteen of those 24 did not receive hearings on their first or second nominations six of those were individuals nominated by president clinton in the 106th congress and renominated at the beginning of the 107th congress 17 days before president clinton left office of the remaining

least twice and never received hearings were barry p goode ninth circuit and helene n white sixth circuit both of whom were nominated three times in the 105th 106th and 107th congresses by president clinton19 resubmitted district court nominations many of the same patterns observed in judiciary committee practice with resubmitted courts of appeals nominations can be seen in judiciary committee treatment of resubmitted district court nominations for district court nominees third nominations are very rare as table 5 indicates nine individuals have been nominated to the same positions three times since 1977 none has been nominated more than three times accordingly an analysis of judiciary committee treatment of the first two nominations covers nearly all nominations to the district courts in the last 30 years table 7 reports judiciary committee practice with resubmitted district court nominations specifically table 7 accounts for all 127 renominated district court nominees

committee even if the hearings were not on the first nominations only 17 of the nominees whose nominations were resubmitted did not receive hearings on their first or second nominations20 the most common pattern is to not receive hearing on the first nomination but to receive hearing on the second nomination 83 of the 127 654 district court nominees whose nominations were resubmitted followed this pattern district court nominees with three nominations only nine individuals were nominated to seats on the us district courts more than twice between 1977 and 200621 all nine received hearings by the senate judiciary committee on at least one of the three nominations james mcgregor nominated in three consecutive congresses the 100th 101st and 102nd received hearing on his first nomination but was never confirmed the other eight nominees were eventually confirmed by the senate though three were first nominated by president george hw bush during the 102nd congress and were not confirmed until renominated by president george w bush22 20 seven of the 17 were nominated third time received hearings and were confirmed on the third nomination for details on these nominees see appendix 2 21

2 for details crs17 resubmissions and confirmation previous sections of this report have focused on senate practice with returns patterns in presidential resubmissions and how renominated individuals were treated by the senate judiciary committee this section examines how renominated judicial nominees ultimately fared before the senate relative to other judicial nominees if returns and renominations tend to indicate controversial nominations then one might expect that fewer judicial nominees who received multiple nominations were confirmed than those who were nominated only once on the other hand there is some evidence that returns particularly of district court nominations are necessitated by the senate not finding time in its schedule to confirm nominees on their initial nominations if returns and renominations are driven largely by the senate calendar and by extension the time the vacancy occurs and the time the president takes to fill vacancies with nominees then renominated individuals should be confirmed at nearly the same rate as individuals who are nominated only once table 8 presents the percentage of nominees confirmed by the number of times they were nominated during the 19772006 period district judges who were nominated only once were confirmed 902 of the time on the first nomination of those district judges who were renominated 881 were confirmed on the second nomination and 889 of those who received three nominations were confirmed on the third nomination therefore the data indicate that for district judges renominations and returns that necessitate the presidents renomination do not appear to diminish substantially the probability that the nominee will eventually be confirmed the same cannot be said for nominees to the courts of appeals examination of table 8 reveals that 865 of the nominees who were nominated only once were confirmed23 that number fell to 783 for second nominations and to 556 for third nominations furthermore of the five individuals who received four nominations two 400 were confirmed therefore the data indicate that nominees to the courts of appeals faced declining probability of confirmation the more often their nominations were returned by the senate 23 this is somewhat different from saying what percentage of nominees were confirmed on their first nomination between 1977 and 2006 249 of 358 total courts of appeals nominees or 695 were confirmed on their first nomination for district court nominees 1059 of 1301 nominees or 814 were confirmed on their first nomination crs18 table 8 us

nominations database crs19 concluding observations renominations are an increasingly common feature of the judicial nomination and confirmation process this report chronicles the uneven rise of renominations in the judicial nomination process between 1977 and 2006 and assesses the senate handling of hearings for judicial nominees whose nominations have been resubmitted as well as the ultimate prospects for confirmation for nominees whose nominations were returned and resubmitted at least one time two important trends emerge from this analysis first returns by the senate and renominations by the president have grown over the past 30 years within that overall growth senate returns of nominations are most common in the final congress of presidents term before the 107th congress the two congresses with the most returned nominations were the 102nd congress when democrats controlled the senate and president george hw bush was ending what would be his only term as president and the 106th congress when republicans controlled the senate and president clinton was ending his second term second there is an important distinction between the path of nominees to the us district courts and the us courts of appeals nominees to the courts of appeals were more likely to have their nominations returned by the senate were more likely to be renominated more than once though less likely to be renominated by president of different political party than district court nominees were more likely to have second hearings if they received hearings on their first nominations and were less likely to be confirmed on their second and subsequent nominations than nominees to the district courts these trends reflect an increasing controversy over courts of appeals nominees the difference in the treatment of district court nominees and courts of appeals nominees has become more pronounced in the last 30 years crs20 appendix 1 us courts of appeals nominees with
