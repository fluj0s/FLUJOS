audit of overtime at unog ae200531104 executive summary from january to april 2005 oios conducted an audit of overtime at the united nations office at geneva unog the audit covered compensation for overtime and night differential for the years 2002 2003 and 2004 with expenditure totalling some 464 million unog accepted all the audit recommendations and have either implemented or are in the process of implementing most of them overtime policies and guidelines the conditions governing compensation for overtime and night differential as contained in appendix b to the staff rules applicable to unog h ave remained unchanged for almost 40 years the significant differences in the condition s applied at headquarters and at unog have substantial financial implications while man of these differences could be attributed to differences in the local conditions prevailing in g eneva and new york as pointed out by both unog and ohrm other differences may longer be j ustified in geneva double rate for overtime work applies on weekdays from 9 pm until 7 am the next day on saturdays from 12 pm to midnight and on sundays and official holidays in new york double rate is applicable only for sunday s or the seventh day of the scheduled workweek or official holidays on the other hand r egular working hours per week are 40 in geneva while only 35375 in new york in geneva staff in the professional and general rvice categories are paid 10 and 25 per cent respectively of the hourly gross salary at the staff members grade and step as night differential in new york only one rate 10 per c ent is paid for all staff members during the three years 20022004 the net night differen tial at the 25 per cent rate paid to unog security staff and drivers amounted to some 82100 0 had unog applied the 10 per cent rate the cost would have been only some 330000 in geneva as compensation for normal overtime the staff takes cto for the first eight hours and the rest is paid in cash in new york after review conducted three times year the staff is compensated by cto for the first 40 hours and the rest is paid in cash in the view of oios comprehensive review is over due to determine whether the 1966 appendix b still reflects the current local conditi ons and whether the significant variations between different duty stations are still justified unog concurred that there is need to review and update appendix b but felt that the rev iew should be undertaken as part of the systemwide review initiated by ohrm although st epbystep approach could be considered in most cases overtime and night differential were not authorized in advance the form used by unog finance section bears prior authorization si gnature but oios ascertained that these forms were signed post facto and only served the pu rpose of certification by the section chief the analysis of the pattern of overtime paid indica ted that authorizing work on overtime is an established practice in many sections and the total overtime paid in these sections continued to increase each year in some sections staff members regularly worked more than 40 hours overtime in month in contravention of the condit ions in the security service few security staff membe rs who regularly were paid overtime night differential and weekend premium accounted for abo ut 41 per cent of the total amount paid from 2002 to 2004 at the travel and transportation unit the overtime and night differential paid to certain drivers doubled from 93400 in 200 2 to 185500 this was attributable to the full time assignment of two drivers to the dg start ing january 2003 as well as significant increase in the usage of drivers after office hours and during weekends for the three main users of unog vehicles there wa s significant increase in usage over the last years at unog overtime averaged 600 hours year from 19 98 to 2001 the annual average from 2002 to 2004 increased to 1300 or more than double moreover the cumulative overtime accrued during the weekends and official holidays i ncreased fourfold from an average of 200 hours in the last four years to some 800 hours in 2 004 despite the recruitment of an additional driver drivers overtime alone amounted to some 500 hours per year in 2003 and 2004 for significant amount of overtime accrued by the drivers the official purpose of the use of the vehicle was not obvious oios is further lookin g into the issue at ohchr overtime fluctuated over the last six yea rs ranging from low of 386 hours in 2000 to peak of 883 hours in 2004 at ece overti increased steadily from 182 in 2002 to almost 400 hours in 2004 according to the policy of the provision and use of official cars stai337 dated 15 october 1986 the official cars should be used only for of ficial business within working hours but not for transportation to and from work oios noted tha t the pattern of usage by the highranking officials was not in compliance with this policy the division of administration unog has reminded the users concerned of the official policy ohrm has confirmed that the policy outlined in stai337 is still valid but wanted to bring the issues raised to the attention of dmocss to review the policy and determine need f or modification if any june 2005 table of contents chapter paragraphs i ii iii introduction audit objectives audit scope and methodology 15 6 78 iv

administration of overtime in unog there was audit by the board of auditors on this subject in unog however the central support services of unog division of administration undertook an internal review of its current practices in june 2004 5 the findings and recommendations contained in th is report have been discussed during the exit conference held on 27 may 2005 with the former director division of administration unog and other officials concerned draft of this report was shared with the director division of administration and the ch ief human resources policy service division for organizational development ohrm on 1 and 2 june 2005 respectively their comments have been reflected in the report in itali cs unog has accepted most of the recommendations made and is in the process of imple menting them ii audit objectives 6 the main objectives of the audit were to evaluat the adequacy and effectiveness of i overtime policies and guidelines established in unog and ii implementation of the policies and guidelines with regard to authorization recording and payment of overtime and night differential 2 iii audit scope and methodology 7 the audit scope included the overtime and night differential paid during the period january 2002 to december 2004 the review focused n the various sections in unog in particular the central support service which autho rized more than 50 percent of the overtime paid during the review period the audit focused on the policies and guidelines established by unog the procedures adopted by various sections in authorizing recording and monitoring and payment of overtime and night differential 8 oios reviewed the existing policies and guidelin and the available documents relating to overtime and night differential the au dit team reviewed and analysed the information relating to the overtime and night diff erential paid during the review period the audit team also selectively reviewed few cases of s ubstantial overtime payment to determine whether the total overtime hour worked was justifie d the team assessed the procedures in place relating to prior authorization approval and review of overtime documents before they are paid the audit team met and discussed with the responsible staff members in the central support service css financial resources manageme nt service frms and human resources management service hrms the audit team also compared the overtime policies and procedures established at headquarters in ne w york unhq and at the united nations office at vienna unov iv audit findings and recommendations overtime policies and guidelines existing unog policy needs to be reviewed 9 according to staff rule 10312 staff members ser ving at established offices in the trades and crafts category in the general service category or in the field service who are required to work in excess of the working week blished shall be given compensatory time off or may receive additional payment under condit ions established by the secretarygeneral these conditions shall be set forth in the appendix b to the staff rules applicable to the duty station according to staff rule 10313 staff membe rs who are assigned to night time tours of duty shall receive night differential at rate nd under conditions set forth in appendix b to the staff rules applicable to the duty station the secretarygeneral in his bulletin stsgb20021 promulgated the latest version of the staff rules on 1 january 2002 with appendix b containing the conditions governing comp ensation for overtime and night differential at headquarters 10 for unog the conditions governing compensation for overtime and night differential appendix b were issued on 1 september 1966 these conditions have remained unchanged for almost 40 years and are still applied oios not ed that unog reviewed these conditions in january 1998 but decided not to formally propose r evisions reasons for this decision were not clear on the files according to the flemming p rinciple the conditions shall be determined by reference to the best prevailing loca l conditions at the duty station since local conditions have not stagnated over the last 40 year s oios sees an urgent need to review and revise the conditions contained in appendix b 3 11 oios noted significant differences in the condi tions governing compensation for overtime and night differential between headquar ters and unog head2right at unog the overtime shall be compensated as speci twice the rate if staff member worked on weekdays from 9 pm until 7 am next day on saturdays from 12 pm to mid night and on sundays and official holid ays in new york the special rate is applicable only for sundays or the seventh day of the scheduled workweek or official holidays on the other hand staff members in geneva have 40 regular working hours per week while staff in new york has only 35 375 hours furthermore unog pointed out that the staff member concerned shall r eceive less than four hours of overtime compensation for time worked on the sixth or seventh day of the week or on official holiday head2right regarding night differential the geneva conditions differentiate between professional and general service gs staff the professional ca tegory is authorized 10 per cent of the hourly gross salary at the staff members grade and step as night differential whereas the gs staff members receive 25 percent of the hourly rate in new york the rate of 10 percent of the hourly rate of the aggreg ate of the staff members salary is paid for all professional and gs staff these diffe rences have substantial financial implications during the three years 20022004 re viewed unog paid net night differential at the 25 per cent rate to the secur ity staff and the drivers totalling some 821000 had unog applied the 10 per cent rate th cost would have been only some 330000 as unog rightly pointed out the applicable hours for night differential in new york are from 600 pm to 930 am versus 700 pm to 800 am in geneva therefore the time for entitlement to n ight differential in geneva covers 13 hours compared to 155 hours in new york oios is aware that the different conditions do not allow simple and straightforwar d comparison nevertheless even taking into account the entitlement to more hours i n new york the application of the 10 per cent rate would have resulted in significant savings oios is not convinced that local conditions alone can explain and justify such significant difference head2right at unog the first eight hours of ordinary overtime will be compensated by equal time of cto and the balance hours are paid in cash in new york overtime shall be paid after review conducted three times year nd after ascertaining that staff member had accumulated more than forty hours of cto which could not be authorized because of the exigencies of the service the remaining entitlement of forty hours of cto will be counted as part of the staff m embers accumulated entitlement at the time of the next review head2right in geneva weekend premium is paid to staff members for whom the normal working week of 40 hours has been modified by the adoption of shift system or roster system also of 40 hours the premium is payable at 50 per cent of the hourly rate of the staff members salary to those who have worked between 7 00 am on saturday and 700 am on monday the premium is payable in addition to the night differential such premium is paid in new york head2right the practice of stand by duty or on call duty the time during which staff member is not required to be present at work but i s expected to report to work as soon as requested to do so needs to be clarified in ge neva 20 hours of recuperation are credited to staff members on stand by duty from mon day 900 pm to the following monday 500 am according to ohrm on call duty has been authoriz ed in new york for certain departments and may be incorporate d into appendix b for new york in future 4 head2right oios also noted that unov in 2004 prepared condit ions governing compensation for overtime appendix b at unov reflecting the b est prevailing local conditions and aimed at ensuring consistency among the agen cies based at the vienna international centre the revised draft has been pe nding with ohrm who intended to conduct review of all local appendices b 12 oios is fully aware that the conditions contain ed in appendix b of each duty station are determined by reference to the best prevailing local conditions at the duty station and that many differences in the conditions applicable in ge neva and new york are reflection of different local labour markets nevertheless local labour markets are not stagnating but develop over the years ohrm and unog therefore nee d to ensure that the provisions of appendix b still reflect the prevailing local condi tions in geneva this requires complete review and overhaul of appendix b oios also wishes to highlight that many of the variances between the conditions applicable in new york and g eneva cannot be explained by different local conditions in the us and in europe oios note d that the provisions applied at unog are relatively close to those applied at unov wher eas the conditions applied at icty are similar to those at unhq oios is not convinced tha t the local labour market conditions in the hague are closer to new york than to geneva og should therefore initiate comprehensive review of the conditions set forth in appendix b taking into account the prevailing local conditions the conditions applied by other entities in geneva and the conditions in other duty stations oios is aware that complete overhaul and revision of appendix b may not be achievable within the near fu ture as first step and as matter of priority those parts of appendix b containing the conditions governing compensation for overtime and night differential should be reviewed and revised recommendation head2right unog division of administration in consultation wi th ohrm and the controller should review and revise t he provisions of the 1966 appendix b governing compens ation for overtime and night differential at unog in order t ensure that they reflect todays prevailing local conditions in geneva and that variances from the provisions applied at other duty stations are justified rec 01 13 unog acknowledged the need to review and if necess ary update appendix b for geneva however unog felt that this might be ver lengthy exercise given the sensitive nature of other issues dealt with in appendix b an d proposed that the review be undertaken as part of the systemwide review initiated by ohrm although stepbystep approach could be considered ohrm stated that they did not know whether the pro visions of the 1966 appendix b still reflected the best prevailing loca l conditions in geneva and highlighted that any revision of appendix b applicable to geneva sho uld be done by reference to local conditions oios will record this recommendation as implemented upon receipt of the results of review and revision of the conditions in appen dix b for geneva governing compensation for overtime and night differential b compliance to the conditions and policies non existence of prior authorization 14 according to the unog conditions governing over time and night differential all overtime shall be authorized in advance and subsequ ently certified by the chief of the 5 division or service concerned however oios review of the overtime claim forms indicated that the overtime was not authorized in advance in almost all the cases the form used by unog finance section bears prior authorization si gnature but oios ascertained that these forms were signed post facto and only served the pu rpose of certification by the section chief concerned therefore oios could not ascertain the justification for the overtime claims oios understood that in some sections like security and safety prior authorization might not be practical at all the times due to the nature of the job but oios noted that in most of the instances in which overtime had been authorized lik major conferences visits of vips and social events it was possible to plan and authoriz overtime in advance oios believes that planning and authorizing overtime ahead of time wou ld enable managers to control excessive and unjustified claims submitted by staff members 15 oios recommended that the division of administ ration ensure that the requirement for prior authorisation of overtime is adhered to while processing the overtime claims and advise all responsible certifying offic ials to comply with this requirement unog accepted the recommendation and will establish procedure to ensure that all requests for overtime are properly authorized befor ehand for the central support services unog has already put in place proper mechanism u nog added that there would be exceptions where prior authorization was not practi cal due to the nature of the work oios considers this recommendation as implemented but xpects unog to properly justify and document such exceptions recurrence of overtime 16 according to the conditions governing compensat ion for overtime the need to incur overtime should always be of transitory nat ure to meet urgent or unforeseen circumstances that make it imperative for staff to work beyond normal hours any incidence of recurring overtime will be brought to the attent ion of the director of administration oios analysis of the pattern of overtime paid during the review period indicated that authorizing work on overtime is an established practice in sect ions focused in this review like security and safety section sss and procurement and transp ortation section pts building and engineering section bes and text processing secti on tps oios noted that the total overtime paid in these sections continued to increa each year on the other hand there was significant decrease in overtime in the financial r esources management service frms due to special factors discontinuation of payroll serv ices for unhcr and automation of certain reconciliation tasks using imis it is only this d ecrease that prevented total expenditure for overtime in unog to continue to increase for sss nd pts the trend remained to increase the table below figures provided by unog indicate s the

1106 44 1465 23 1039 6 1299 11 recommendation head2right unog division of administration in order to minimi ze overtime expenditure should on quarterly basis review the pattern of overtime payments and advise the respect ive heads of offices through inter office memorandums rec 02 17 unog accepted this recommendation and added that it would seem to overlap with the regular review of expenditures carried out by b udget and certifying officers oios suggests that unog advise budget and certifying off icers to take up with the respective heads of offices the results of the review of overtime unog also explained that increase in overtime might be attributable to various reasons s uch as nonavailability of general temporary assistance provisions to face peak worklo ad periods and that the freeze on the recruitment might have further impact on overtime costs unog added that notwithstanding this situation unog would ensure t hat it would ensure that regular monitoring is strengthened and any anomalies would be brought to the attention of managers concerned oios will record this recommendation as implemente d when it receives copy of guidelines on the regular monitoring of overtime or copy of memos to managers on the status of overtime in their respective programmes r activities nonobservance of the 40hour overtime limit 18 the conditions governing overtime stipulate tha t in the interest of the health of the staff member and the efficiency of the services th supervisors would not require staff 7 member to work more than 40 hours of overtime durin g any one month except where unusual exigencies of service so require oios noted that i n some sections the staff members worked for more than 40 hours overtime in month in par ticular the drivers in the transportation section regularly worked for more than 40 hours oi estimated that on average every driver worked 67 hours of overtime per month in yea rs 2003 and 2004 in some glaring cases one of the drivers worked overtime for 1085 hours in december 2003 and another driver rendered overtime work for 1355 hours in august 20 04 oios believes that this needs to be addressed and the service of staff members should n ot be required beyond 40 hours in addition to their normal working hours as this is pattern it cannot be justified by unusual exigencies of the service 19 furthermore oios review also indicated that so staff members were requested to work on overtime continuously for more than 1220 h ours without any break including lunch oios is concerned that this practice would affect t he health and efficiency and effectiveness of the staff member in carrying out his or her func tions this practice was common among drivers and security personnel recommendation head2right the unog division of administration in the interes t of the health of the staff members and of efficiency of th service should enforce the limit of 40 hours of overtime s hould the need for it arise unog should consider hiring temp orary staff rec 03 20 unog accepted this recommendation and will enforce the 40hours limit as from july 2005 compliance would be monitored through continu ous random checks oios will close this recommendation as implemented upon receipt and verification of overtime statistics for the period july to october 2005 nonobservance of the cto rule 21 according to the conditions governing overtime the first eight hours of ordinary overtime in month will be compensated by equal off at the earliest possible date and will not be paid however in some instances the ov ertime was calculated and paid to staff members for all the time worked as overtime this p ractice was prevalent in security services provided to other agencies on cost reimbursabl basis oios also noted instances in which similar payments were made to staff members i n the regular budget in oios opinion this practice should be stopped to minimize expendi ture under overtime uneven distribution of overtime night differential and weekend premium 22 oios review of the overtime paid in the securit and safety section indicated that there were few security staff members who were re gularly paid overtime night differential and weekend premium for example in the years 2002 to 2004 approximately 14 per cent of the security staff were paid about 41 per cent of t he total overtime and night differential the security and safety section asserted that only thes security staff members were willing to work overtime and in night shifts although oios wa s not able to verify this assertion oios believes that unog should endeavour to achieve mo re even distribution of work among staff members to avoid the perception of unequal tr eatment furthermore oios noted cases where some drivers at the g4 level and security of ficers at the g4 to g6 level received net remuneration including their compensation for over time that exceeded the total net salary of p4 or p5 staff member in 2004 and in some month s that of d1 staff member such cases point to the need for unog to ensure that overtime is more evenly distributed among staff 8 members recommendation head2right unog division of administration should advise all ffices concerned to adequately plan their work beyond norm office hours so that it is evenly and fairly distributed to many staff members taking into account the skills and availab ility of staff members rec 04 23 unog accepted this recommendation and will advise ll offices concerned of the recommendation and request its swift implementation with the establishment of internal controls to avoid recurrence unog added that sinc the security and safety section is now part of the independent department of safety and curity this recommendation could be addressed to that department which could consider it in its review of their administrative rules oios will take up this issue in its present audit of the sss oios will record this recommendation as implemented upon receipt of unog s advice to all offices concerned and of statistics on compensation for overtime per staf f member for the period july to october 2005 oios will followup on the abovementioned c ases need to minimize overtime of the drivers 24 as stated above oios noticed that the overtime and night differential paid to the drivers increased significantly during the review p eriod oios undertook critical review of the increase to determine whether the increase is dequately justified and to determine whether there is scope to minimize overtime to the drivers oios relied on the internal memorandums and documents maintained in the central support services unog and the relevant statistics maintained in the database 25 according to stai387 all official vehicles w ill be considered as part of pool available for all operational functions of the offi ce concerned accordingly since october 1999 the drivers subunit transportation and trav unit purchase and transportation section unog had been organized as pool where all drivers were rotated morning and afternoon shifts and posts shift system the sub unit is composed of five drivers and one supervisor and is equipped with three vehicles the drivers are servicing mainly the director general of unog the high commissioner for human ri ghts the executive secretary of ece and other highranking officials the shift sy stem allowed keeping the overtime under control as the drivers mutually covered one another 26 in september 2002 an additional driver was rec ruited and the shift system was revised since january 2003 two drivers and one ve hicle were exclusively assigned to the dg of unog on full time basis except when the secre tarygeneral visits geneva in addition to this the threshold of 40 hours of overtime in month was raised to unlimited levels in april 2001 oios noted that these measures impacted the accumulation of overtime by any one of the drivers as it was longer possible to balance the overtime hours 27 according to stai337 the heads of the respec tive offices may be assigned vehicle on fulltime basis at locations other than new york geneva and vienna the fulltime assignment of vehicle and two drivers to the dg unog is therefore not in line with organizations policy on the provision and use of fficial cars and should be discontinued unless the secretarygeneral changes the organizati ons policy 9 28 according to the statistics available on the us age of drivers services by unog the economic commission for europe ece and office of the high commissioner for human rights ohchr oios noticed the following an average of 600 hours in year was recorded unde r unog from 1998 to 2001 the annual total increased to 1020 hours in 2002 desp ite the recruitment of an additional driver overtime further increased to 1344 hours i n 2003 and 1544 hours in 2004 during weekends and official holidays the cumulativ overtime accrued by the two drivers exclusively assigned to the dg unog had ev increased fourfold from an average of 200 hours in the last four years to 805 hours in 2004 according to the overtime records maintained by the drivers significant amount of overtime in 2003 and 2004 was accumulated in instan ces where the official purpose was not obvious oios is further looking into the i ssue at ohchr overtime was fluctuating over the last six years ranging from low of 386 hours in 2000 to peak of 883 hours in 2004 t ece overtime increased steadily from 182 in 2002 to 398 hours in 2004 29 according to stai337 official cars may be u sed only for official business within working hours but not for transportation to and fr om work oios noted that vehicles were used frequently by heads of offices for transportat ion to and from work which is not in compliance with the organizations policy ohrm has confirmed that the policy outlined in stai337 is still valid but wanted to bring the i ssues raised to the attention of dmocss to review the policy and determine need for modifica tion if any as recommended by oios unog division of administration has reminded the he ads of offices in geneva which are regular users of official cars of the rules govern ing the use of official vehicles recommendations head2right unog division of administration should fully implem ent pooling of all official cars with shift system fo r drivers in order to minimize overtime work ensuring that vehi cle normally used by the directorgeneral is made avail able for other official requirements when not required by t he dg for official purposes rec 05 30 unog stated that the recommendations had been impl emented prior to the audit and that the division of administration and office of t he directorgeneral unog ohchr and ece and the drivers were informed in february 2005 of new procedures to exercise better control of overtime unog also drew attention to th specific security requirements defensive driving and related aspects which ma arise from too open use of vehicles assigned to vips oios welcomes the steps already taken to make bet ter use of the official vehicles and drivers and to minimize drivers overt ime oios will close these recommendations upon receipt of documentation showi ng that all official vehicles and their drivers form part of pool furthermore unog shou ld consider putting drivers on standby duty rather than paying overtime for periods when ctual work requirements are not foreseeable oios will followup on the actual usag at later stage 10 inadequacies in the authentication of the overtime documents 31 as the overtime was not authorized in advance oios verified the claims submitted to ensure that the overtime accrued was adequately aut henticated by responsible official immediately after the completion of the duty on d aily basis in respect of the drivers the overtime accrued has been authenticated by the resp onsible officials only in very few cases in number of cases overtime was authenticated by th users secretaries only in most instances however the time of actual duty was not authenticated as result oios could not verify whether the time accrued by the drivers as vertime was actual overtime accrued by them 32 oios also noticed that staff members who did n ot have the authority authenticated the overtime in the security and safety section number of claims were authenticated and signed by nondesignated persons the chief of secu rity and safety section has
