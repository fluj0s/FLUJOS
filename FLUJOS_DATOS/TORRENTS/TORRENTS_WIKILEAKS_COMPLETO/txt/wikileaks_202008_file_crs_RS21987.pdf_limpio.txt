provides sidebyside summary of the major features of financial institutions customer protection systems reflecting safetynet provisions legislated over time usually in reaction to specific collaps besides these explicit guarantees regulatory bodies can attempt the rescue of fa iling financial enterprise s using many tools authorized by laws and regulations and of ten acting in the background such tools include liquidity lending arranging memoranda of understanding i ssuing cease and desist orders against risky practices and arranging mergers of weak entities into stronger institutions if the entire financial economy seems threatened by pending collapse of either sizeable financial institution that is too large to fail or many financial businesses collectively the federal reserve fed can step in as the nder of last resort to avert serious adverse consequences for the economy eg use of the feds liberal bank liquidity policy immediately after the 911 attacks and curren tly the subprime meltdow n led to failures of institutions once believed to be too large to fail bear stearns fannie mae freddie mac and aig all of which were or are being assisted by th federal government moreover congress may have to provide emergency funding when parts of the federal safety net are under severe pre ssure the cleanup of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s and early 1990s for example require d appropriated funds plus new deposit insurance fund and regulator more recent example is the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 that provided 700 billi on to purchase distressed assets such as mortgagebacked securities and to make dir ect capital investments in troubled financial institutions an important conceptual distinction be tween support structures is who ultimately pays for the protection lawmakers originally created federal deposit insurance in user fee model of insurance in which the g overnment owned and operated each insurance system and charged member banks for its use following the banking failures of the late 20th century legislation moved deposit protection part way toward an alternative mutual model in which the burden of financing th system falls more clearly on the banking industry mutual institutions are owned by th eir customers such as saving associations depositors and insurance companies policyholde rs as result some analysts now claim that the banking industry owns the deposit in surance funds in mutual mode in reality the federal government still owns and operates them that is so because in all depository institution cases the ultimate guarantor is th economic power of th federal government history has shown that deposit guarantees shor t of the federal level have universally been inadequate to prevent panics runs nd severe economic da mage when called upon1 industrysponsored and statelevel programs ve contained the collaps of their covered entities only if the damages have been small credit union share insurance in contrast more nearly follows the mutual model likewise state insurance company guaranty and federallysponsored securities i nvestor protection arrangemen ts follow the mutual model

guarantee tlg program on october 23 2008 in the midst of the curre nt financial crisis the federal deposit insurance corporation announced its tempor ary liquidity guarantee program to help unfreeze the us short term credit markets at the time financial institutions were not lending to each other especially in the commercial paper market which was almost completely frozen the twopart program temporarily guarantees all new senior unsecured debt and fully guarantees funds in certain noninterest bearing accounts at fdicinsured institutions issued be tween october 14 2008 and june 30 2009 with guarantees expiring later than june 30 2012 the fdic expects these guarantees would restore the necessary confidence for invest ors to begin investing in obligations of depository institutions evidence suggests that these shotterm markets are slowly returning to normal after the tlg program was implemented the second part of the fdics tlg progra m is to guarantee 100 of noninterest bearing

not cover monoline insurance companies 4 see the testimony of patrick m parkinson deput director divi sion of research and statistics of the board of governors of the federal reserv system before us house of representative the subcommittee on capital markets insuran ce and government sponsored enterprises committee on financial services february 14 2008 httpwwwfederalreservegovnewseventstestimonyparkinson20080214ahtm2009 this addresses the concern that many small business accounts such as payroll accounts frequently exceed the current maximum deposit insurance limit of 250000 the tlg program is being paid for by dditional fees placed on depository institutions that use these guarantees not taxpayers2 financial guarantors monoline insurance companies financial guarantors are insurance companies that insure the credit quality of securities that banks securities firms insurance companies among others hold as assets even though state insurance regulators have sole authority to supervise them3 financial guarantors safety and soundne ss may have critical impact on the safety and soundness of all financial businesses incl uding federal re gulated banks4 the failure of one or more financial guarantors could possible bring bout other financial bus iness failures because credit rated securities backed by guarantors insurance on for example national banks books would be downgraded requiring the banks to add capital if the bank is unable to acquire the necessary capital the bank could suffer losses or even fail due to the falling prices of its insured assets which might longer cover its liabilities including deposits financial guarantors provide insurance against credit defaults of securities specifically they focus on insuring the timely payment of principal and interest on securities including municipal bonds asset backed securities nd collateralized debt obligations cdos the guarantors insura nce raises the credit rating of the underlying securities which in turn lowers the interest costs to the issuer and makes the securities more attractive to wider range of investor s the nine new york monoline insurance companies insure 25 trillion of domestic and international bt an increasing part of this debt was cdos backed by subprime re sidential mortgagebacked securities such debt led to losses for these monoline compan ies because these securities were being sold at substantial discounts the growing po ssibility of more losses caused the rating agencies to lower the treble ratings of several of these financial insurance companies the treble credit rating is required for the guarantors to offer treble credit ratings on securities issuers offer because some gu arantors were downgraded the securities they insured are being downgraded as well which means that banks securities firms and insurance companies among others holding these downgraded assets must increase their capital as the price of these assets falls new york state insurance regulators and the us treasury are seeking ways to help these financial guarantors get recapitalized
