options to purchase the companys stock has become widespread among american businesses employee stock options have been praised as innovative compensation plans that help align the interests of the employees with those of the shareholders they have also been condemned as schemes to enrich insiders and avoid company taxes the tax code recognizes two general types of employee options qualified and nonqualified qualified or statutory options include incentive stock options which are limited to 100000 year for any one employee and employee stock purchase plans which are limited to 25000 year for any employee employee stock purchase plans must be offered to all full time employees with at least two years of servic incentive stock options may be confined to officers and highly paid employees qualified options are not taxed to the employee when granted or exercised under the regular tax tax is imposed only when the stock is sold if the stock is held one year from purchase and two years from the granting of the option the gain is taxed as longterm capital gain the employer is not allowed deduction for these options however if the stock is not held the required time the employee is taxed at ordinary income tax rates and the employer is allowed deduction the value of incentive stock options is included in minimum taxable income for the alternative minimum tax in the year of exercise consequently some taxpayers are liable for taxes on phantom gains from the exercise of incentive stock options in the 110 th congress identical bills hr 3861 and s 2389 have been introduced to provide an abatement of any taxes still owed on phantom gains nonqualified options may be granted in unlimited amounts these are the options making the news as creating large fortunes for officers and employees they are taxed when exercised and all restrictions on selling the stock have expired based on the difference between the price paid for the stock and its market value at exercise the company is allowed deduction for the same amount in the year the employee includes it in income they are subject to employment taxes also although taxes are postponed on nonqualified options until they are exercised the deduction allowed the company is also postponed so there is generally little if any tax advantage to these options on december 16 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued new rules requiring companies to subtract the expense of options from their earnings the securities and exchange commission sec applied these new rules to fi nancial statements for large publicly traded companies beginning with their next fiscal year after june 15 2005 or december 15 2005 for small companies currently the sec is investigating allegations that some companies backdated some of their stock options this report will be updated as issues develop and any new legislation is introduced

companys employees officers and directors options to purchase the companys stock has become widespread among american businesses1 according to information technology associates 15 to 20 of public companies offer stock options to employees as part of their compensation package and over 10 million employees receive them during the technology company boom of the 1990s they were especially important to startup companies allowing them to avoid paying large cash salaries to attract talent 2 employee stock options have been extolled as innovative compensation plans benefitting companies stockholders and employees3 they have been condemned as schemes to enrich insiders at the expense of ordinary stockholders and as tax avoidance devices4 this report explains the tax treatment of variou s types of employee stock options recognized by the internal revenue code examines some of the issues that have arisen because of the real and perceived tax benefits accorded employee stock options discusses the financial accounting standards boards fasb rule for expensing employee stock options and describes the controversy over the backdating of stock options g6g142g143g146g151g146g157g146g152g151g561 employee stock options are contracts giving employees including officers and sometimes directors and other service providers the right to buy the companys common stock at specified exercise price after specified vesting period the exercise price is typically the market price of the stock when the option is granted although it can be more or less as discussed later under types of employee stock options the vesting period is usually two to four years and the option is usually exercisable for certain period often five or 10 years the value of the option when granted lies in the prospect that the market price of the companys stock will increase by the time the option is exercised if the price falls the option will simply not be exercised the contract does not obligate the employee to buy the stock employee stock options typically cannot be transferred and so have market value to illustrate suppose that ceecorp inc is publicly held corporation whose stock is selling for 10 share on january 1 2004 as part of her compensation plan ceecorps chief financial officer cfo was granted options on that date to buy 1000 shares of stock for 10 share any time over the next 10 years subject to certain conditions one condition was that she had to work for the company until she exercised her options another was that her right to the options vested over period of four years onequarter each year this meant that on january 1 2005 she received an unrestricted right to buy 250 shares of stock for 10 share and so on each year until on january 1 2008 all of the options were fully vested and she could buy 1000 shares if she chose 1 the original author of this report was jack h taylor consultant in business taxation 2 john doerr and rick

when the cfo became vested with the right to buy 250 shares with further restrictions on her ownership of the stock she could pay the company 2500 for the 250 shares which were at that point worth 7500 with an immediate gain of 5000 ignoring taxes for the moment in either cash if she sold the stock or property if she held on to it she could similarly exercise the other options as they became vested or wait for later stock price changes the options would continue to be worth extra compensation for her as long as ceecorps stock was selling for more than 10 share when she exercised her options the company had to be prepared to sell her the stock at the belowmarket exercise price so on january 1 2005 if she chose to buy 250 shares of ceecorp stock the company had to either buy 250 shares of its own stock for 7500 or issue 250 shares of new or treasury stock that it could have sold for 7500 when it sold these shares to the cfo for 2500 the economic reality wa s the same as if it had paid her 5000 in cash she received additional compensation of 5000 and ceecorp was out 5000 that it would have still had if she had not exercised her options

services of employees or directors by the use of stock options has several advantages for the companies startup companies often use the method because it does not involve the immediate cash outlays that paying salaries involves in effect stock option is promise of future payment contingent on increases in the value of the companys stock it also makes the employees pay dependent on the performance of the companys stock giving them extra incentive to try to improve the companys or at least the stocks performance ownership of company stock is thought by many to assure that the companys employees officers and directors share the interests of the companys stockholders before june 15 2005 accounting rules did not require stock options to be deducted from income in the companies financial statements consequently net profits reported to shareholders were larger than they would have been if the same amounts were paid in cash critics of the stock options however argue that the practice gives officers and directors strong incentive to inflate stock prices and that there is real evidence that it does improve performance many of the leading users of stock options were among the companies suffering substantial stock losses in recent years receiving pay in the form of stock options can be advantageous to employees as well stock options can be worth far more than companies could afford to pay in direct compensation particularly successful startup companies some types of stock options receive favorable income tax treatment receiving pay in the form of stock options serves as form of forced savings since the money cannot be spent until the restrictions expire of course it is risky form of pay since the companys stock may go down instead of up some employees may not want to make the outlay required to buy the stock especially if the stock is subject to restrictions and cannot be sold immediately and some simply may not want to invest their pay in their employers stock httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31458g7g150g153g149g152g162g142g142g561g21g157g152g140g148g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g497g561g22 g138g161 g561

stock option some variations are due to the tax rules that govern them and some are because of the intended use of the options by the companies granting them this report focuses on the tax treatment of the options and the issues arising from the tax treatment but one of the issues is whether the tax code has kept up with the proliferation of ways options can be designed the internal revenue ir code recognizes two fundamental types of options one is called statutory or qualified options because they are accorded favorable tax treatment if they meet the codes strict qualifications ir code section 421424 generally the value of these options is not taxed to the employee nor deducted by the employer the second is nonqualified options which have special tax criteria to meet but are taxed to the employee as wage income when their value can be unambiguously established which irs says is when they are longer at risk of forfeiture and can be freely transferred they are deductible by the employer when the employee includes them in income ir code section 83 some options have special features designed to do more than just compensate employees some such as the employee stock purchase plans discussed below are granted at less than the market price of the stock to make it easier for recipients particularly lower level employees to buy stock nonqualified options are often used to reward management and some are only exercisable if certain goals are met premium options are granted at price higher than the current price of the stock performancevested options are not exercisable until specific stock price is reached indexed options are repriced based on broad stock indices to differentiate between the companys performance and the markets performance there are other variations 5 options are not the only way to use companys stock to compensate employees direct grants of stock are always possible and can be hedged with restrictions similar to those governing the exercise of options stock appreciation rights and phantom stock plans pay employees the cash equivalent of the increases in the compan ys stock without their actually owning any6 these various plans have different tax consequences for companies and employees g19g158g138g149g146g143g146g142g141g561g21g157g152g140g148g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 two types of stock options qualify for the special tax treatment provided in ir code section 421 incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans both types require that the recipient be an employee of the company or its parent or subsidiary from the time the option is granted until at least three months before the option is exercised the option may cover stock in the company or its parent or subsidiary such options may not be

approved by the shareholders the plan must designate the number of shares to be subject to the options and specify the classes of employees eligible to participate in the plan the option price must be less than the market value of the stock at the time of the grant and it must require exercise within 10 years from the time it was granted the market value of the stock for any incentive stock options exercisable in any year is limited to 100000 for any individual this is the limit on the amount that receives favorable tax treatment not on the amount that may be granted options for stock exceeding 100000 in market value are treated as nonqualifying options there are additional restrictions for options granted to persons owning more than 10 of the outstanding stock

approved by the shareholders but this type of plan must generally cover all fulltime employees with at least two years of service or all except highly compensated employees it must exclude any employee who owns or would own after exercising the opti ons 5 or more of the companys stock the option price must be at least 85 of the fair market value of the stock either when the option is granted or when it is exercised whichever is less the options must be exercised within limited time more than five years the plan must not allow any employee to accrue rights to purchase more than 25000 in stock in any year g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g22g138g161g561g22g155g142g138g157g150g142g151g157g561 both types of qualified stock options receive some tax benefit under current law the employee recognizes income for regular tax purposes when the options are granted or when they are exercised taxes under the regular tax are not imposed until the stock purchased by the employee is sold if the stock is sold after it has been held for at least two years from the date the option was granted and one year from the date it was exercised the difference between the market price of the stock when the option was exercised and the price for which it was sold is taxed at longterm capital gains rates if the option price was less than 100 of the fair market value of the stock when it was granted the difference between the exercise price and the market price the discount is taxed as ordinary income when the stock is sold companies generally receive deduction for qualified stock options so the tax advantage accrues to the employee not the employer companies that would not be taxable anyway such as startup companies not yet profitable would care little if at all about the tax deduction and would be expected to use this method of compensation many companies that are taxable grant qualified stock options however so these options must have some advantage that outweighs the tax cost in some cases the companies doubt find that rewarding their employees with qualified stock options is worth the cost in other cases perhaps the officers and employees who receive the options exercise special influence over the companies compensation policies if the stock is not held for the required two years from the granting of the option and one year from its exercise special rules apply the employee is taxed at ordinary income tax rates instead of capital gains rates on the difference between the price paid for the stock and its market value either when the option was exercised or when the stock was sold whichever is less the company

were ordinary compensation paid in the year the stock is sold to illustrate the tax treatment of incentive stock options suppose that the ceecorps grants to the cfo described previously were under an incentive option plan approved by the shareholders the cfo could postpone taxation of her 5000 gain by holding the stock until at least january 1 2006 one year after she bought it and two years after the options were granted assuming the stock was still worth 30 share she could realize her gain at that point and be taxed at the lower capital gains rate instead of her regular tax rate

paying the amt the tax treatment is similar to the regular tax treatment of nonqualified options 7 although the minimum tax exemptions limit the minimum tax to relatively highincome taxpayers it does impose some burden on the otherwise taxfavored option plans the minimum tax can make the receipt of qualified stock options an extremely complex problem it is imposed in the year the options are exercised and the stock is transferred without restrictions at the amt rates of 26 or 28 and the basis of the stock then becomes for amt purposes the market price of the stock when the st ock is sold it will have two bases one for the amt and one for the regular tax double taxation will not result because an alternative minimum tax credit will be available if the employee is not again subject to the minimum tax or an adjustment of minimum taxable income will be made if he owes minimum tax again that year since taxpayers often will not know if they are subject to the minimum tax until the tax year is over tax planning can be very difficult under certain circumstances it is possible fo r an individual to owe the amt on the value of incentive stock options at the time that these options are exercised but in the same year subsequent decline in the value of the stock after exercise would cause the individual to owe income taxes under the amt on phantom gains there was credit for prior year minimum taxes in excess of regular taxes that accrues when the taxpayer returns to the regular tax system but this credit was not refundable 8 on december 20 2006 this unfair situation was solved for

is not often raised as an issue in their tax treatment it is often argued that giving favorable tax treatment to limited amount of compensation in the form of options helps spread the use of options to rankandfile workers nonqualified options which are not tax favored are more likely to go to officers and highly paid employees employee stock ownership plans are xplicitly promoted as means for workers to become owners of their companies in addition the cost to the government is at least partially offset by the lack of tax deduction at the company level there may be corporate governance

subject the value of qualified stock options the difference between the exercise price and the market price to fica and futa taxes in the year the options are exercised this new rule would have been effective january 1 2003 and until that time irs would not attempt to collect any taxes on the options change in income tax treatment was proposed nd income tax withholding would not have been required13 the proposed regulation received negative reaction in the public comments that irs requested companies argued that the additional tax cost and the paperwork burden of new accounting requirement would discourage the granting of options and make them less attractive to employees the critics argued that congress explicitly excluded the value of an exercised qualified stock option from income and that something cannot be wages if it is not also income 14 on june 25 2002 the treasury department and the irs announced an indefinite extension of their administrative moratorium on qualified stock options pam olson acting assistant secretary for tax policy stated that given the significant administrative changes that would be required of employers to implement the proposed withholding it is clear that delay in the effective date is necessary to provide employers with adequate time to make the required changes in addition treasury and irs need additional time to consider the many comments we received on the proposed regulations and to decide on an appropriate course of action consequently employers will not be required to implement the changes for at least two years after the regulations have been issued in final form 15 on october 22 2004 pl 108357 american jobs creation act was signed by the president and this law included provision title 11 subtitle f which

for taxfavored treatment are by far the most important at least by value because there are statutory limits on the amount of these options that can be offered these are the options used to compensate corporate officers and highly paid employees unlike qualified options these options can be offered to anyone providing services to the company not just employees therefore they can also be given to those who serve on the companys board of directors or even to independent contractors when news reports and policy analysts mention options without other qualifications they normally mean nonqualified

options fall under the general rules governing the transfer of property other than money in return for services ir code section 83 basically the rule is that the recipient receives income equal to the fair market value of the property less any amount paid for it when he receives an unrestricted right to the property and its fair market value can be reasonably ascertained stock options without readily ascertainable market value are specifically excepted by section 83e3 qualified stock options are also excluded in the case of nonqualified options irs has ruled that options that are not tradeable as is almost always true of these options have readily ascertainable market value therefore their fair market value cannot be established until they are exercised and any restrictions on the disposition of the stock have been lifted at that time the value of the options is equal to the difference between the exercise price and the stocks current market price 16 there is provision in section 83 b allowing the recipient of the options to elec t to include their value in income in the year they are exercised valuing them as if the stock were not restricted however future deduction is allowed if the stock is later forfeited nonqualified stock options exercised by employees are subject to fica and futa taxes and income tax withholding just as cash wages are the company granting the options is allowed to deduct from income the same value of the options that the recipient includes in income in the same year it is taxable to the recipient section 83h if the options granted by ceecorp to its cfo in our previous example were nonqualified options there would be three notable differences from the qualified options assumed before one is that she would have been immediately taxable on the difference between what she paid for the stock and what it was worth in the year she acquired it so she would have owed income and fica taxes on 5000 in 2005 the second was that ceecorp could deduct the 5000 as employee compensation on its own tax return and would also owe fica and futa taxes on it and probably most important in the real world althoug h not in our example there would have been limit on the value of the options granted so highly compensated officer like chief financial officer could receive potentially large amounts of additional compensation

when they are granted or when they become vested so receiving compensation in this form postpones the payment of taxes from when they would have been due on an equivalent amount of ca sh wages however the reason for not taxing them is the uncertainty of their actual value the tax rules follow the practical path of postponing tax until their value is realized as is the case with capital gains in addition the companys deduction of the compensation is also postponed being allowed only in the same year that the recipient reports the income realized since most of these options go to highly compensated individuals whose marginal tax rates would often be higher than the companys the government 16 ir reg 1837

treatment of stock options under the generally accepted accounting rules that govern the way companies report to stockholders creditors and regulators is quite different from the tax accounting rules originally the accounting rules were of very limited scope because employee options were normally priced equal to the market price of the companys stock when they were granted they were said to have value the fact that they were intended to have value and therefore serve as compensation was not taken into account as they became more popular however the accounting standards were modified to require some recognition of their effect on companys income rule fas 123 required companies to estimate the value of the options when they are granted using an option pricing model and show that amount called the fair value as cost over the years until the options are vested in their published financial statements the companies could either treat the estimated value of the options as cost in calculating net income 17 or they could use the traditional valuing of the options ie zero in calculating net income and show the effect of deducting the estimated value in footnote most companies chose to use the footnote method but in the early 2000s many large corporations shifted to the deduction method these corporations included boeing cocacola general electric general motors and winndixie 18 financial corporations adopting th deduction method include allstate insurance american express bank of americ jp morgan chase merrill lynch citigroup wachovia and prudential financial19 in the very simple example used so far ceecorp and its cfo the traditional valuation of the options when granted would be the stock is selling for 10 share the options allow the cfo to buy it at 10 share so the options value is zero ceecorp like almost all public corporations would probably calculate its net profit on its financial statement using this valuation under fas 123 however it would also use an estimating model to determine market value the model would estimate the likelihood that the stock would go up in value over the life of the option and take other variables into account and establish what the option might be worth on the open market when granted if it could be marketed so ceecorp might estimate that the fair value of the options when granted was 16 each for total value of 16000 and report in footnote to its financial statement an additional compensation cost of 4000 each year for the four years over which the options vested it would not account for the actual cost of the options when exercised on its income statement 20 several bills were introduced in congress over the years to restrict the tax deduction for options because of the differences with the accounting treatment the bills attempted to change the companies accounting practices to make the cost of stock options more apparent to stockholders and investors but the device chosen in the bills is to restrict the tax deduction allowed to the 17 this method is commonly referred to as expensing 18 steve burkholder fasb to change reporting of shifts to expensing of employee stock options daily

without further changes in either the accounting rules or the tax law however this approach did not in fact conform the tax and book treatment the book expense was based on the estimated value of the options when granted and is charged off over the vesting period of the options the tax deduction in contrast was allowed only when the options are exercised and would under this approach be limited to the smaller of the estimated or actual values in addition the amount deducted by the company would longer necessarily equal the amount taxed to the individual

those large companies on fiscal calendar year27 but effective april 21 2005 the securities and exchange commission sec postponed the stock option expensing standard until the beginning of companies next fiscal year thus companies with fiscal years on calendar year basis will not have to comply with the expensing standard until the first quarter of 2006 the sec gave three justifications for this

sent copy of this article to the sec in 200440 in may 2005 his article was published in journal called management science 41 dr lie indicates that the board of directors of company generally assigns the administration of the stock option grants of the stock option plan to the compensation committee42 executives however may be able to influence the decisions of the committee because executives often propose parameters of stock option grants executives often have close personal friendship with some committee members and executives may influence the timing of compensation committee meetings

negative before the award dates and positive afterward44 these findings were consistent with his hypothesis of backdating of stock options without disclosure the publication of dr lies article led to sec investigations of the timing of the granting of stock options by certain companies dr lies article did not mention any company by name but his hypothesis of backdating of stock options without disclosure was tested for five corporations by authors charles forelle and james bandler in an article in the wall street journal on march 18 2006 45 these authors examined the timing of stock option

that the odds of these dates happening by chance was extraordinarily remote46 for example one corporation ceo received six stockoption grants from 1995 to 2002 which occurred at dates when the stock price was unusually low47 the author found that the probability of these dates being selected by chance was around one in 300 billion48 backdating of stock options without di sclosure has serious implications companies have right to give executives lavish compensation if they choose to but they cant mislead shareholders about it granting an option at price below the current market value while not illegal in itself could result in false disclosure thats because companies grant their options under shareholderapproved option plan on file with the sec the plans typically say options will carry the stock price on the day the company awards them or the day before if it turns out they carry some other price the company could be in violation of its options plan and potentially vulnerable to an allegation of securities fraud it could even face accounting issues options priced below the stocks fair market value when theyre awarded bring the recipient an instant paper gain under accounting rules thats equivalent to extra pay and thus is cost to the company company that failed to include such cost in its books may have overstated its profits and might need to restate past financial results 49 in addition backdating without disclosure can have important negative tax implications for both the company and the recipient of the stock options backdating options can force companies to restate tax positions which can result in an obligation to lose tax deductions and pay back taxes penalties and interest for tax purposes corporations can generally deduct executive compensation however irc section 162m limits this deduction for public companies to 1 million per year per executive for compensation paid to the top five most highly compensated executive officers for proxy reporting purposes if options are in the money when granted then the compensation realized by the grantee upon exercise will count towards the 1 million irs deduction cap thus the discounted options are ineligible as performancebased compensation under section 162m furthermore discounted options would be treated as nonqualified defined compensation under section 409a resulting in taxation and excise taxes at the time of vesting rather than exercise finally for incentive stock options to qualify for favorable tax treatment they must be granted at 100 of the underlying stock fair market value on the date of grant 50 on may 22 2006 charles forelle and james bankler wrote second article in the wall street journal concerning backdating of stock options without disclosure51 the authors

grants52 the authors state that the sec is investigating at least 20 companies for manipulation of options timing53 some companies that opposed the fasb proposal to require expensing of stock options are now under investigation by federal authorities for allegedly backdating the dates of the granting of stock options without disclosure54 this turn of events according to randall heron and erik lie casts the companies arguments against expensing stock options in different light and offers what some accountingindustry observers say is vindication for fasb 55 in their article in the journal of financial economics titled does backdating explain the stock price patten around executive stock option grants professor randall heron and professor erik lie examine the frequency of backdating of stock options since august 29 2002 when the sarbanesoxley act pl 107204 mandated that the sec change the reporting regulations for stock option grants 56 before the change executives receiving stock options had up to 45 days after the end of the companys fiscal year to report them to the sec57 after august 29 2002 recipients of stock options must report them to th sec within two business days of receiving the grant58 one day after receiving this information the sec makes it public and now firms with corporate websites are required to post this information on the day after they disclose it to the sec59 the authors state that if backdating produced the abnormal return patterns around executive option grants we hypothesis that the new reporting requirements should substantially dampen the abnormal return patterns that previously had been intensifying over time 60 heron and lie utilized large sample of stoc k option grants to ceos between august 29 2002 and november 30 2004 and compared this sample with large sample from january 1 2000 to august 28 200261 the authors conclude that overall we find evidence suggesting that backdating is the major source of the abnormal stock return patterns around executive stock option grants our evidence further suggests that the new reporting requirements have greatly curbed backdating but have not eliminated it to eliminate backdating it appears that the requi rements need to be tightened further such that grants have to be reported on the grant day or at the latest on the day thereafter in addition the sec naturally has to enforce the requirements 62 52 ibid 53 ibid 54 david reilly fasb appears in new light on stock options the wall street journal aug 14 2006 p c1 55 ibid 56 randall heron and erik lie does backdating explain

of stock options still occurs it was far more prevalent before new reporting regulations were applicable on august 29 2002 on july 26 2006 the sec voted to adopt changes to the rules requiring disclosure of executive and director compensation and related matters63 these new rules include disclosure regarding option grants64 the securities and exchange commission various state prosecutorial and department of justice doj probes into backdating abuses are ongoing in addition many firms have mounted their own internal probes into possible abuses about 200 companies have been under federal investigation andor have restated earnings65 by november 2007 the secs investigation caseload had fallen from peak of 160 to about 80 and the sec had brought civil enforcement actions against seven companies and 26 former executives associated with 15 firms and according to reports from the doj there were at least 10 criminal filings against defendants for backdating
