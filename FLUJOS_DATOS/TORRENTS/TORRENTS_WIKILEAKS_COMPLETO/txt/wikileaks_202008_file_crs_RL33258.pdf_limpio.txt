voice for developing countries in setting regional and multilateral trade agendas the united states and brazil have cultivated constructive relationship in pursuit of their respective efforts to promote trade liberalization including attempting to broke r compromise with the european union in the world trade organization wto d oha round and forming bilateral working groups on trade and other issues still they approach trade policy quite differently are at odds over how to proceed regionally with the free trade area of the americas ftaa and share concerns over specific trade policies and practices brazils trade strategy can be explained only in part by economic incentives its trade preferences also reflect deeply embedded macroeconomic industrial and foreign policies whereas us trade strategy emphasizes the negotiation of comprehensive trade agreements on multiple fronts brazil is focused primarily on market access issues as they pertain to its ec onomic dominance in south america brazil exercises this priority in all trade arenas such as pursuing changes to agricultural policies in the wto expanding the southern common market mercosul in south america and resisting the ftaa for lack of balance conducive to brazilian interests brazil has modern divers ified economy in which services account for 53 of gdp followed by industry and manufactur ing at 37 and agriculture at 9

oranges and coffee and the second largest of soybean beef poultry and corn it is also major producer of steel aircraft automobiles and auto parts yet surprisingly relatively small trader by world standards the united states is br azils largest singlecountry trading partner brazil is critical of us trade policies such as the byrd amendment repealed but program in effect until october 1 2007 which directs duties from trade remedy cases to affected industries the administr ation of trade remedy rules and what it considers to be discriminatory treatment in the us expansion of free trade agreements in latin america it also objects to productspecific barriers such as tariff rate quotas on sugar orange juice ethanol and tobacco subsidies for cotton ethanol and soybeans and prolonged antidum ping orders on steel and orange juice us concerns focus on brazils comparativel high tariff structure especially on industrial goods mercosuls common extern tariff program and brazils refusal to address issues of critical importance to the united states such as services trade intellectual property rights governme nt procurement and investment despite these differences both countries recognize the potential for important gains to be had from mutually acceptable trade liberalization at all levels as developing country with an opportunity for considerable growth in both exports and imports however brazil may have the most to gain from addressing both foreign barriers to its trade and unilate rally opening its economy furtherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33258contents brazilian

strategy david ricardo postulated th rationale for free trade some 200 years ago when he argued that countries could improve thei r national welfare if they exploited their comparative advantage by exporting those g oods at which they were relatively more efficient at producing and importing the rest later arguments for trade pointed to the benefits arising from in traindustry trade and inves tment in which specialized production along with scale economies could lead to even more efficient exchange and innovationdriven productivity increas these foundational ideas which recognize the value of both imports and ex ports remain valid today for explaining why countries generally wish to pursue fr eer trade and why trade liberalization has been at the center of the economic refo rm debate in much of latin america in practice however few countries have opted unilaterally to throw open their borders to unfettered free trade and the call to maintain trade barriers is common even if it is understood that they come with cost to society as whole there are many reasons for this perhaps most transparent is resistence by firms and workers who stand to bear most of the adjustment costs of freer trade even if national welfare is ultimately enhanced throug h lower priced goods and rvices greater selection of choices from imports and overall efficiency gains that can lead to higher national income less obvious is that countries adopt diverse trad policies based on historically socially and politically determined trade preferences that cannot be explained solely by calculus of economic cost s and benefits the trade preference framework helps explain brazils trade strategy it pegs brazil as regional leader based on its leadership in pressing for south american economic integration its conditional support of multila teral negotiations and its reticence to consummate separate trade deals w ith developed countries3 brazils trade preferences in order of priority are 1 expand and strengthen mercosul where brazil is the undisputed industrial hub and political leader 2 advocate developing country interests in the doha round especia lly on agricultural issues and 3 resist what it views as welfare reducing usdesigned ftaa and to lesser extent also preferential trade arrangement with the european union unless it serves as counter influence to the ftaa4 brazil and

create new incentives or pressures to make breakthroughs at other levels eg regional or multilateral it is comprehensive by its inclusion of issues that go beyond market access such as services trad intellectual property rights government procurement and investment brazil has narrower and more cautious tack restricted largely to market access and dominance in regional trade where it feels most ready to compete the perceived benefits of brazils strategy include attaining greater bargaining power through the mercosul coalition slowing th multilateral trade lib eralization process to allow

deeply embedded in the countrys industrial foreign and macroec onomic policies discussed below trade and industrial policy the regional leader category captures well the influence brazils economic

relations the most important aspects of trade policy therefore are driven less by commercial interests and often are subordinated to larger foreign policy imperative primarily enhancing brazils influence in latin america and the world in the western hemisphere this implies taking on the united states in the words of one brazilian expert brazils foreign policy over the past four decades is char acterized by competition with the united states and the objective of developing the nations industrial capacity as key condition for independent activities within the international system11

concluding various commitments on trade progre ss in the doha round ftaa and eu negotiations has proven harder to achieve12 trade and macroeconomic issues macroeconomic challenges ve and continue to cons train brazils trade policy options brazil for example is known fo r its historical accommodation to inflation having employed for decades comprehensive system of wage price and interest rate indexation as part of its macro economic management inflation ran at manageably high rates for years and wa s fought albeit unsuccessfully with number of stabilization plans by the 1970s however it eventually spiraled out of control following the oil price shocks th is led brazil to the 1980s debt crisis along with much of latin america13 by the 1990s the economy was defined by its growing deficits and debt fa iled efforts at stabilization sl ow growth averaging only 23 from 1980 to 2004 and reluctance to em brace reforms an important factor in brazils sluggish economic perform ance was poor productivity growth due to microeconomic policy distorti ons discussed above macroeconomic problems and to some degree also its closed trade policy14 brazilian trade policy also had to adjust to

available for debt service real interest rates adjusted for inflation in brazil have hovered around 10 for years making them among the highest in the worldthe formation of mercosul in 1991 with argentina uruguay and paraguay to consolidate its trade positions in south am erica and the adoption of government assisted export promotion policy to help ddress its large and growing external debt the average tariff in brazil fell from 51 in 1988 to 14 in 1994 but the selective preferences given under mercosul belied the liberalization message as brazil continued to limit trade outside the regional pact allowing it to manage carefully the degree to which foreign co mpetition would be accepted15 brazils trade policy shifted again in 1994 to accommodate the real plan price stabilization policy imposed by then finance minister and laterpresident fernando henrique cardoso it was named for new curre ncy that was pegged to the us dollar to serve as an anchor to bring down hyperinflation the plan actually worked where others had not but in pegging the real to the dollar the differences in inflation between the two countries caused large real appreciation of the brazilian currency as price levels between the two countries diverged this resulted in sudden turn to trade deficits in 1995 see figure 2 an economic consequence that ran counter to the political priority given to running trade surpluses to offset the exchange rate effect on the balance of payments brazil raised interest rates and redoubled its protectionist policies16 the macroeconomic story was further complicated by major financial crisis in 1998 that resulted in curre ncy devaluation and return to floating exchange rate in 1999 argentinas financ ial collapse in 2001 and financial panic in 2002 exaggerated by the impending presidential election of longtime workers party leader luiz inácio lula da silva today braz ils macroeconomic priorities still constrain trade and other policy choices the economy is stable but growing at inadequate levels to bring about desi red development goals to control inflation the lula administration has had to maintain very high real interest rates while brazils large debt service obligation has required large primary budget surplus approaching 5 of gdp in 2005 and trade surplus17 the cost of this development stra tegy has been accepting the microeconomic distortions discussed above and inadequate social spending which raises the prospect for future social and political unrest given the already very high levels of income inequality and poverty subordinating trade liberalization to debt reduction and other goals also diminishes brazils growth pros pects key variable in reducing poverty therefore as may be seen brazils trade preferences which point to cautious some would say protective and carefully managed approach to trade liberalizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33258crs8 18 data from brazilian institute of geography and statistics and braz ilian embassy

and thereby stabilize regional political relations as well mercosul has succeeded on the political si and also developed as credible collective voice in the wto and the ftaa its success at economic integration is more questionable mercosul began as free trade area but was designed to evolve into customs union defined by common external tari ff cet and eventually common market with the free movement of goods investment and labor to date mercosul remains an incomplete customs union with many exceptions to the cet early successes were measured by the doubling of intrame rcosul trade by 1995 as tariffs came down according to schedule and cooperation re mained largely positive this trend reversed course in the late 1990s because of financial cr ises in argentina and brazil and the absence of macroeconomic c oordination and other policy problems brazilian trade within mercosul expa nded by only 13 fro m 1999 to 2004 with brazils trade balance shifting from nearly balanced

in broader trade preferences as well the united states remains committed to an agreement that includes negotiating investment services intell ectual property rights and government procurement among other issues brazil has not deviated from its more limited support of dealing mostly with market access and its refusal to engage on these other issues unless the united states concedes to address agricultural subsidies and trade remedy issues24 this impasse resulted in compromis unveiled at the 2003 ftaa ministerial meeting in miami calling for twotier agreement under which countries could assume different levels of commitment the proposed framework viewed by the united states as an accommodation to brazil would include common set of rights and obligations for all countries along with optional obligations th at could be enteredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33258crs13 25 it has been noted that the addition of venezuela as full member of mercosul consolidates in one bloc all the countries

summit declaration called for time to explore problems in the ftaa process while awaiting the outcome of the upcoming world trade organization wto ministerial indicating that at this juncture there is unified vision on how to proceed with the proposed ftaa brazil continues to offer to negotiate market access talks between the mercosul countries and the united states the socalled 41 option an overture the ustr has repeatedly declined brazil sees little advantage to an ftaa at this point in time particularly one that does not address its inte rests and so appears content with the status quo for the indefinite future the united states by contrast has been frustrated by an inability to advance naftalike regionwide agreement therefore it appears that brazil will continue to reinforce support for rcosul while biding its time on the ftaa and attempting to make headway with agricultural issues in the wto mercosul negotiates the ftaa as bl oc which may gather strength if venezuela joins as full member25 interestingly most analyses of the economic effects of joining the ftaa point to differe nces in costs and benefits between brazil and the other three smaller members the gains

brazil has signaled that it is still interested in negotiating with the united states in 2006the cost and benefit calculus however is more complicated for the smaller mercosul countries an ftaa means givi ng up preferential access to the large brazilian market which could mean net loss in welfare for some sectors the ftaa would also mean greater access to the us and other latin american markets and reduced costs for capital goods and ot her imports that longer face high mercosul cet eg 35 in the case of automobiles the smaller economies might also consider the effects of any future economic setbacks from potential macroeconomic problems in brazil or argentina brazil also is reticent to push for an ftaa precisely because with mercosul and more so with functioning south america community

ndustries that compete directly with more efficient us firms eg machinery and chemicals could lose in the short run combined with possible trade restructuring that other mercosul countries might face brazils comparative advantage might shift to some degree from industrial products in regional economic union to more agricu ltural goods in hemispheric one given the economic and political strength of the united states the ftaa might alter the balance of power in the region to the possible detriment of brazils regional leadership the potential for these re lative changes compounded by brazils concerns over its ability to conform to pr ovisions covering enforceable intellectual property rights services trade and invest or protection point to why brazil remains reluctant to advance an ftaa particularly if us agricultural protection remains relatively untouched stated more succi nctly although an ftaa could provide commercial and certainly consumer gains to brazil it may come at cost to industrial and foreig n policy priorities27 for the united states even twotier ftaa may make sense particularly if the alternative is an ftaa without brazil with twotier ftaa most of the hemisphere would be integrated including brazil at least nominally it may be viewed as way to coopt brazilian reti cence or at least diminish the stalemate approach that can also extend to other mercosul

the wto negotiations with brazil to find way to reduce agricultural subsidies resists addressing antidumping rules but is generally sympathetic to finding solution to developing country concerns over providing drugs for hivaids and other emergencies30 the implication for brazilus trade relations is that the wto is an arena where the two countries can find areas of both commonality and disagreement for many issues the united states has indicated that the multilateral forum is the preferred or only venue for issue resoluti on domestic agricultural subsidies and so progress in addressing brazilian concerns in the ftaa are contingent at minimum upon success at the wto brazil has taken similar stands with respect to services trade intellectual property rights and other issues hence it is
