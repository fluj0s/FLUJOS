stages of release lecture given on 27 july 1965 thank you thank you well ive missed you too but i had somewhere between forty and fifty case folders on my plate every day and im getting some help on those now so all is well and now i hope i dont have to put in all the extra time because im not doing it all having to get in and patch it all up im sure i wont do thatwhere is he but i will say im still curious about whats happening to some of them you know its like continued story processing people on the power processing what happened today you know was little nell saved all right now after all that what ive been up to is nothing more serious than figuring out the various aspects of releasing people and one of the interesting things about releases is that weve been making them for years and years and years and years and years and the auditors have just been passing right over the top of those floating needles and going right on their way process process process and i suppose that i shouldnt mention it but org secs in charge of getting in income in orgs havent been paying any attention to those free needles either because youd have to end processing dont you see and with all thiswith all this it has made rather catastrophic situation in that the earliest releases that were checking out and so on are back in 1951 and if we dug around amidst the oldtime dianeticists why they were probably in there by the ton in other words we were making this condition all the way along the line in the earliest days there was some excuse for it we werent processing on meter but after 1958 there had been excuse for it at all when i made that tremendous rash of clears on an acc one time they were keyedout clears but those needles were floating gorgeously from that time on people should have been alert on the situation becausei think it was about 57all those things wereall those rules about meters and so forth were released what free needle looked like what floating needle was you know and how it all behaved thisand how one and all just seemed to be able to sit there and watch those needles float and the thing at clear read and keep right on auditing i dont know because they actually upfrom that point there on were cleaning clean as far as the state of first stage release was concerned and they just went on cleaning that clean for years and the longer they cleaned it why the more upset people became you see we were up to our ears with success and didnt even know it now the thing which we didnt know in some exoneration of all of this is that you cannot and must not run process beyond free needle you just must not and that rule extends right straight on up to clean it goes all the way through dont you run something which has already went now youd have to get the whole aspect of processing backwards in order to do this youd have to get the idea that something else happened the pc spouted fireworks out of his ears or something like this occurred at theas the end product of the process but it doesnt matterand now nail this one down in brass please because this rule is all the way from bs on up and even applies to self analysis weve got people who went clear onwhat we were calling clearon self analysis in 1952 books out they all of sudden went free needle on the subject well that meant that any recall process from there on was verboten on that person see you might have run some upperlevel process and then cleaned that up do you follow but you can just crudely group all lowerlevel processes as just one type of process so theres the objective theres the subjective theres this theres that theres the other thing we know all about that but all of those processes of course are just skimming the top of the case cases go to many levels and the first level off of it is is there room you know where am i you know that kind of thing just recognition of the environment so if you just ask somebody to look around and spot where he was you have more or less gotten rid of the objective processes now if the individual was asked to look around to find out where he was and that needle at that moment floated youve had it as the auditor youve had it right then you cant run any cchs thats it all objective processes are now ffftt gone you follow that whole class of processes 15 now null and void now it isnt that it isnt nice to run them its that youll practically kill the guy if you run them do you understand because youre cleaning clean now i dont know if youve ever sat across from an auditor who is industriously prepchecking and who was reading the meter with periscope from down in thesome implant period he sits there and at that moment that you ask him this question do you have present time problemat the moment that he asks this question you get slight twitch or something like that fly lights on you you know something like that and the needle goes tick and its set at sensitivity 128 see and over here at 32 and its all gunned up and new batteries and everything you know and this fly lights on you and it goes tick and so he says whats the problem and you say well i dont have any problem you see and he says well one reads here i know my job im supposed to clean this meter whats the problem and you say well there isnt any problem well im going to find this problem if its the last thing i ever do of course there is problem there actually is problem its the auditor thinks hes got one and he hasnt now from that moment on have you ever seen session deteriorate well look at that same circumstance look at that same circumstance on the broad picture of processing the guy doesnt have any more bank sitting there its gone and now the auditor tells him to run something and the d of p tries to figure out this unusual case case cant run on the cchs cant run on anything well hes oriented hes oriented in his environment poor guy has had it dont you see and from there on processing him on anything even vaguely resembling an objective process would be cruelty that makes war look innocent this is the main thing that was missing we didnt have this datum that you must not process beyond it see that was the missing datum and when i discovered that one wow now its funny thing that it stillit still carries on through right up to the power processes and your class vii gets to know this with violence lets say hes running process and the expected end phenomena has not occurred of the process but the needle floats even on process of that magnitude hes got to quit thats it softly quietly however thats it see we dont care why it floated but we mustnt run that process anymore now you dont have the whole class of power processes go out fortunately simply because needle floats on one of them each and every one of them because of the difference of things theyre directed at will now pick up more charge off the top of the bank you see they reallythey dont just sweep the road off lightly with kids toy broom you know they clean up the cement highway too and you can always find little more bedrock but on any one of those processes when it goes free and floats thats it poof youve had it now our main problem then from the most fundamental processing straight through to the most complex is overrun overrun now this happened to along about this has happened to dozen times two dozen times three dozen times i lost count auditors sitting there saying cant get thecant get the and there id go again well of course i was doing research and id get plowedin and so forth and i think most of the time i must have beenthe last half of all of my research and so forth on lowergrade processing i must have been running on other peoples banks and i used to catch myself mocking up somebodys case and running it so that i could find out how it worked im pretty good at that one london one time sent telex there was some kind of pc in difficulties up there in london and i told them to do some kind of list on this pc and find the item on it and i said and when she finds the dog why run this process on the dog and london next day sent telex back the strangest thingit was dog what did they think anyhow the net action here with regard to all of this is you have to know when to quit and when i came back from palmas why suzie was sitting back in the room and i was trying to run some r6ew see and shes watching the needle and it was falling off of set you couldnt keep the needle on set you couldnt set the meter in other words it didnt matter how low you put the sensitivity you couldnt set the meter and r6ew at that moment was flat it had flattened somewhere along the line id been running it when i was down south and it had gone to floating needle now phyll stevens wrote in today and shes found eight or nine hundred end words down in australia and shes in terrible trouble because they dont seem to have any bypassed charge i told them to do an l6 thats all right but they couldnt seem to find any bypassed charge and the needle the last session had stopped being between 20 and 30 with the needle floating and now was up at 35 and so forth and the needle was stuck theyd run r6ew to floating needle you couldnt go beyond it do you follow now actually i could more run r6ew today than fly to the moon on washboard thats very embarrassing to because im fixing up sequences of end words but i can only work with the actual gpms now and iti just had horriblei was fortyfour down the line letterperfect flaws nothing and i suddenly found that one of the gpms right up at the top was lock and i had to go clear back up to the top of the bank to run this gpm i was swearing like pirate this morning now i suppose that that r6 gpm my running gpms by items i suppose in the r6 material is the one thing of this that isnt true because all of the things float on that and that is what you pull the pc out of and when you go down the line on gpms sooner or later your needles going to float sooner or later but that doesnt mean theyre all gone it means you cant contact them and then you re in trouble you follow because you wanted total quitness of the bank now r6 is the only process which is dealing with total erasure all other processes are dealing with locks on r6 now if you look at your various levels of processing then it begins fundamentally with the r6 bank there is just the guy and i suppose the fundamental on that is the possibility that he could get aberrated i suppose thats the first possibility and on top of that the r6 bank is built and then on top of the r6 bank is built this tremendous accumulation that we know as end words and so on and on top of those is erected whole series of whole track incidents and other types of gpms known as implants people wonder why you didnt stay release actually it was these implants that were done against the original bank restimulating the original bank that eventually cut people down to size its just the repetitive restimulation the later implants are nothing but they restimulate the basic r6 bank and tie it up and thats how you less and less frequently were in released state you understand that in your highest state in this universe there has beenyouve never been any higher than release see youve been temporary keyout keyed in again by implanting or some experience well on top of the implants and so on lot of engrams would build up whole track the whole track type of engram is built up and theyre sort of sandwiched amongst the implants and then the next piece of the cake are secondaries which is emomisemotional experiences sitting on top of these engrams the engram containing pain and unconsciousness the secondary containing merely misemotion now on top of the secondary sits what we call locks and locks are simply moments of restimulation of engrams and secondaries engrams are in actual fact restimulation of end words end words are restimulation of the r6 bank itself you can pull an awful lot of end words off of the r6 bank you see without actually going into the r6 bank and getting the actual words that is the little spook that is here so that if you get too much r6ish type material into your r6ew youre liable to get into bit of trouble dont you see dont add those endings quite right just get what you get thats the whole trick in running r6ew just get what you get and then youre actually running locks off the bank you see now do you see what these various stratas are surrounding all this is thing called the physical universe now you may have noticed this around if theres any further bank than the r6 bank it would be the physical universe as bank considering it bank it hardly is considerable as bank but you could in dim way consider it such dont you understand now therefore what youre doing with pc from the moment of inception on down the whole line is carving away at this stack of stuff now it consists of significance and masses it also contains spaces and energies it also is plotted against time but thats all there is in it there isnt anything else in it now you say therea machine yes there can be machine in it there is thing called machine and there can be thing called circuit but these are actually specializations of what i have just mentioned you see some guy thats being talked to by circuit sometime and its laugh what it is is valence but its merely combination of energy and significance you see and this comprises mass that sits there you know and the netit sits in its own madeup space you see and its plotted against the pcs experiential track known as time thats all there is in the bank if you think theres anything else in the bank and so forth why god help you so what youwhat you got there is ais asome part of the bank is telling you something else is there dont you see and this is long experience on this line and every time somebody thinks he has something else in the bank besides the items ive just mentioned why hes in trouble from there on now freud and the psychoanalyst actually had more popularity mostly because they had more r6 in their technology than anything else in other words they didnt direct attention to it as bank but they hadthey had some root and end words on which they were basing everything but they actually recognized recovery in terms of the release of affect now release of affect is technical term in psychoanalysis and i very often misexplain their technical terms according to the modern psychoanalyst but ive got laugh on him i had the original definitions see transference to him today is something very weird and is something very hokuspokus well originally what freud meant by transference was he meant transference and he meant the patient flipped into another valence wed say and the optimum valence according to the psychoanalyst is the analyst and all kinds of wild things you know but now this release of affect is interesting because they simply mean by that misemotional discharge you know pctheir patient cried see but they frankly didnt reallydidnt recognize that there were other emotions besides grief which is interesting because theres apathy theres fear theres hate any one of those things could be the content of one of these secondaries now secondary depends for its force exclusively upon the pain and unconsciousness contained in mental image picture called an engram if you havent got any engrams youre not going to collect any secondaries so when you seewhen you see somebody boo hooing like mad and nothing has touched them dont be mystified about it in similar circumstances someplace down the track they got shot to pieces in similar circumstances so now this similar experiences makes them realize that theyre about to be shot to pieces you see so they cry do you follow but youll find that thishere sits an engram and thats unconsciousness pain and so forth mental image picture of and sitting right on top of it will be that secondary i spotted this back in 1950 it was very interesting wevewe got to point where wed start to run the secondary and actually we could go on little spur track you know and go right straight down through the engram right underneath and cut the secondary off the top of it well freud got as far as grief of the secondary but all anybody has ever been trying to do when he was sincerely trying to help somebody with his mind was reduce the effectreduce the effect of this thing called the reactive mind as for the unconscious mind or the subconscious or the reconscious or thewhatever it isupon the individual himself theyve been seeking to reduce the effect of that upon the individual that has been the main goal of decent and honest psychotherapy see where it has existed that has been the object in view there were many therapies of this character on the whole track some people wonder if there was such thing as scientology on the whole track personally i doubt it very very much but you wouldnt really know do you see if some guy had discovered it all by himself i think you would know if somebody had discovered it while working with many other people because it would have kept on going on wave basis but if somebody discovered it all by himself you wouldnt know about it at all dont you see he would simply have freed himself and along about halfway through he would have said well the hell with the rest of the human race and taken oft dont you see that crude ah what am i doing around here dont you see and would have gone so you wouldnt really know but as far as peoples banks is concerned there has never been trace of it there has been trace of people attacking their r6 bank and youll occasionally find gpm in pc that the pc had gnawed on he wishes he hadnt too because its something like stirring up the fire with stick of dynamite dont you see its not good cooking implement but youll sometimes findyou wont find large stretches of track gone dont get that idea somebody trying to tell you oh well my r6 bank went in eight what are you doing standing there in body that would be your immediate question somebody says well i got rid of my r6 bank eightynine trillion years ago and so forth and what you doing with body you got him see he hasnt gotten rid of any of it but people have collided with it and theyve chewed an item or two out of gpm and youll sometimes find an item in one of the gpms thats got big mouse hole gnawed in the side of it frankly thats just that or its just squashed or crushed you know he just says whats this whats this im tired of this you know and he took couple of beams or something of the sort and he slapped it and he wishes he hadnt that isnt the right way to asis one but as far as marks of psychotherapy on the track that actually go down to the fundamentals of the r6 bank beyond that one i have mentioned of thetan occasionally running into it one way or the other all these things are tied up with pictures pictures is about theas high as they got and freud didnt even get the pictures but he could touch emotion occasionally now some of the psychotherapies usedi wont bore you at long length with some of these thingsbut what theyd do is take photograph of the area where you had just had the experience and then hit it with clapstick make two sticks come down clap like that against clap clap as though they were exploding the photograph do you understand actually they take photograph of the area where you had the experience andyou werent in body when they were using this kind of therapyand theyd sort of get you dazed in there and then theyd show you this photograph and then theyd go clap like that with it with big clapstick in front of the photograph and itd look like the photograph was exploding and after while thetan who was sort of anaten or goofed off or something like thatoh you know eventheyd only use it when somebody was more or less comatose or something of that sort and they couldnt get him up and so on oh so hed take the picture of his own misemotional or engramic or painful experience and hed hit it himself clap with couple of beams oh thats what you want ppssswwww see and hed snap out of it and hed be all right thats whole track psychotherapy thats about as high as they got that is the practice of the galactic confederacy at this particular instant thats what they do thats what their psychotherapy is now there were many other technologies which came up that had idea of helping anybody suppressive technologies and these things tend to get confused with helpful technologies theyre easily mistaken for one another because it is very simple to see that they have some similar words phrases or points of view in them dont you see but they go in two different vectors one is trying to help somebody out the other one is just trying to fix him up but good now implanters learned quite bit about thetans they knew that they could freeze them into immobility they knew they could do various things to them they invented things like sleep lights and so forth there are any number of things which have been developed to have an effect upon an individual and when you get suppressive and he tries to study scientology he studies it all from the viewpoint of trying to have an effect on people not trying to lessen the effect of the bank on the individual but trying to get technology which will have an effect on somebody and he equates all of his processing on the basis of did it have enough effect on the pc not did it make the pc better well now on some of these processes you do get aquite an explosive effect on the pc but immediately he comes out of it and is better do you understand it isnt the effect youre after its the betterness youre after now the whole subject of alchemy was devoted one hundred percent to throwing into total restimulation the entirety of the r6 level and letting the guy cook thereafter it had other goal their original people that monkeyed around with it might have had some kind of an impulse in this direction but certainly their books and writings and things they told you to do and howwhat they told you to practice and so forth in this old field of alchemy which we know today by the way as turning leadtransmutation of metalsit had nothing to do with alchemy transmutation of life was what they were talking about there was the lead of human beingness to the gold of spirit this was where they wentoriginalgot theirtheir comparison and you read these long books on this particular subject and boy theyre just full of r6ew dichotomies they dont run them out you just get in deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and you get one of these boys on the power processes thats been into some such practice like that and he gets onto one of the power processes and nothing comes off but dichotomies boy you have to get him out of that hes just been plowed into the r6 bank since time immemorial and you have to pull him out of it and find the practice that got him in there and run the practice out otherwise you cant fish the boy out one of the tricks by which this is done but there are several of these things theres hypnotism hypnotism is nothing but to make people more suggestible or more compliant not to make them any better dont you see and some hypnotist gets hold of hypnotism tries to make hypnotism then work in the field of healing or something like this well hes on reverse vector because you have to wake people up to make them better not put them to sleep so you discover that there were innumerable practices on the whole track which were devoted to simply having an effect upon the individual making him weaker making him more compliant making him more easily controllable by the state you take some of these states that ran on the basis of thought tower they had thought tower and if you had any hostile thoughts to the state why the thought tower was supposed to pick these up and record them and you instantly reported to the chief polices office and had yourself brainwashed this was one of the wildest swindles that ever heard of it because they never have had thought tower which ever did pick up anybodys thought but the person was implanted with the idea that if he had hostile thought it would be picked up by the thought tower and he was under compulsion to go and visit the police office crazy stuff all sorts of control mechanisms of one kind or another they used to take quote piece of thetan and keep it inthis is very early tracktake piece of thetan and keep it in laboratory or something and if he escaped why they would then touch this with hot rods or something and this would hurt him and he would have to come back and of course hes simply told this on compulsion that this is what is happening it doesnt ever happen so when he escapes he feels pain so he knows whats happening so he has to come back you get the idea do you notice the common denominator to all of these things which merely try to have an effect upon the individual is lies common denominator is lies falsehoods theres always pitch now the common denominator of things that set men free is truth so these things are two opposite vectors and they can be very easily confused youll sometimes have rosicrucian suddenly stumble into scientology organization and start telling you all about when you grimace at yourself in the mirror horrible apparition should appear over your shoulder and yes hes been through all that he knows about exteriorization because hes been deep in his skull for long time and you try to straighten the guy out well youre never on any talking basis you apparently are speaking about similar subject and whats missing there is its going thataway and were going thisaway were going in two different opposite directions and one of the earliest rules about processing is when the pc was headed for succumb and the auditor was trying to get the pc to survive there was insufficient agreement in the session to let session run and that rule still holds and you run into it today pcs tired of this life and he wants to be processed and exteriorized so he can kick the bucket hes got some heavy heavy heavy pt problem he has idea of confronting present time all he wants to do is kick the bucket and drop down to the local maternity ward see and pick up another body and there the auditor sits trying to get the pc over his sciatica or lumbago or something like this you see and the pc is trying to acquire lot of lumbago if he could just acquire enough lumbago then hed die and he could pick up new body you see so the auditors going up and the pcs going down well they cant agree you see now you very normally then find yourself in an argument with somebody who is hypnotist or something like that and he cant understand you and you cant understand him even though you appear to be talking in some tiny similar points about the same mechanisms well thats because hes going down and youre going up he wants to make people more suggestible you want to make them more selfdetermined and aware these are two different directions and this is the main thing that you have to be alert for when you are studying philosophy or the field of the mind or anything like that is which direction are these guys going thats the first thing you should ask and there are many tests by which this can be done but the whole test of sincerity is is the fellow doing what he says hes doing or is he doing something else and its these two questions that have to be answered about any government or any movement or about any individual is this fellow doing what he says hes doing is what he says hes doing what hes doing do you understand or is he doing one thing and saying hes doing another or is he saying hes doing another and doing something different than what he is saying in other words the single test of this is therefore whether or not there is falsity in the line all these downgrade subjects implanting hypnotism electric shock prefrontal lobotomy to get very very medieval about our modern practices all have this pitch in them theyve got falsity in the line in other words they sit therethey say theyre trying to make people well but actuallythat you understand but they dont understand this at all they even explain to you glibly well person would get out of the hospital three weeks earlier onuniformly on the average if we didnt use any shock at all and you in some horror look at the psychiatrist and you say wellwait whywell then why do you shock them and he looks at you like youre stupid well of course youve assumed something and so has the state so have the parents of the insane person or their wives or sisters or mothers theyve assumed that the psychiatrist is there to help the person out and he isnt see theres the apparency but the opposite action is with psychiatry in charge is the world saner their statistics are runaway theyre not just down heres runaway down statistic you see its hitting the chute since psychiatry has entered the field of criminology new york police department and the british police have uniformly brought forward statistics showing you that law and order is on the decline and crime is fabulously on the increase and its on the increase to such degree that its out of control its like forest fire rolling and they criticize the sociological approach and other such approaches to the field of crime theyve been working too hard with those rather than law enforcement so crime is runaway so under this type of thinking are things getting better well things are not getting better because theres falsity on the line what you understand hes doing is not what hes doing do you follow now itthe testthe test of the thing is to this degree is is the individual doing what he says hes doing now you have reality on that as an auditor you know that you can sit there and if you find the problem you get reaction discharge on the meter and the individual feels better youve gotyouve got this well why is that because as long as he is saying its some other problem it wont blow well thats because theres falsity entered into it so we get the sole crime that can occur in this universe is actually not making things not doing things actually not destroying things these are not the basic crimes the basic crimes are altering things masking or hiding purposes masking or hiding truth supposing you had research line going somewhere where every time they found datum that didnt agree with their other datum they threw it in the wastebasket that would be dishonest research wouldnt it every time they found anything thatin variance with what they were doing they would threw it in the wastebasket and yet ive now described im afraid psychological research the way it is practiced now it cant be practiced that way in the field of engineering or trains would run and buildings would stand up and everybody could see they were false but on some subject where somebody is telling you oh well you have to be very learned before you know anything about this field of art is one of these you ever listened to cubist painter maybe there is something in cubism maybe theres even art connected with cubism but it sure isnt what they say it is i got couple of kids in here who can draw better abstracts than the abstractest abstractor they do it very well they undoubtedly mean something by it too they dont tell somebody they mean something by it there you would have the same practice there is such thing as abstract art which could go in two different directions one to mask the fact that the fellow didnt know anything about art at all and the other direction that he was trying to express something that so far had not been expressed now itd be up to you to detect which one it was if he was having any trouble with his art or any problems with regard to his art then you would know there were just that many falsities in his art do you follow just that many lies on the line so its just test of how many alterises its always just test of how many alterises there are any subject has few alterises in it otherwise it would disappear but to the degree that it has very very few alterises in it it will help people and to the degree that it has many of them it will hinder people do you follow that line of reasoning well this is what makes the north and south vectorthe vector of survive help people what do we think of as the good things and so forth then there is minimum of falsity in that linea minimum of pretense minimum of falsity the other direction of lets do them in lets have an effect upon them lets produce new gas which makes all men have purple faces now that would be good contribution youll find theres tremendous falsities along that line what we normally associate with the evil practices are actually designated or that is these are actually identified by the number of falsities in connection with them so you can almost define good on the basis of truth now youll find out the worse off pc is the more he thinks hes got in his mind its quite an interesting index you can get somebody finally thats got old tin cans and broken bottles and so forth in his brain he will accumulate like junk man any past psychotherapy aesculapian or religious practice or something like that and hes got all of these if theyve got complex of some kind or another and he stumbles across it anyplace hell collect it like pack rat looking for boojum hes trying to find it hesits something but hell just add it he must have that too its like young doctor studying in hospital or young nurse studying for her nursing certificate and so on they pick upsome of thempick up all the diseases they read about they go around with symptoms of angina pectoris and symptoms of irresponsibility andif they read it in book of diagnosis theyve got it dont you see they hear thatthey hear that rheumatic heart is accompanied by certain curvature of the fingernail and theyre looking there at theand all of sudden they look by george theyve got that curve of the fingernail dont you see in other words theyre on an addition theyre on an additive line additive in the direction of additive then we actually approach evil and on the direction of subtractive we approach good so what is the basic theory of scientology processing scientology processing is based on subtractive actions and truth its based on truth the isness of the thing is what we care about we dont care about the alterisness except to the degree that the individual has alterised it dont you see now once weve gotten down to this there isthere is the isness of what really is there what is in the mind we dont care why is it in the mind the hell with that question lets leave that to hegel and kant and some other boys that didnt make it ehheh i shouldntthat just slipped out i just wanted to point out to you theyre dead nobody noticed they couldnt have known so much about philosophy after all anyway they pretended that it was very difficult subject now the thing then that you must recognize is that cleaning clean brings about the manifestations of evil i know this is very esoteric point im making here im riding all over the plains and across several rivers to get back to it but i wanted to show you exactly where this thing is see you clean clean youre adding why because theres not anything there to be cleaned so therefore the pcs got to put something there or the auditors got to put something there or somebodys got to put something there before anything will happen now if there are just so many things in the mind five six general classes of things whatever they are ive just enumerated them dont bother to count them theyyou should know them in your sleep theyre nothing to them theres just that many things and when theres more of that particular type of thing or that class of reaction in the mind in order to do any more processing on that you have to put something there or pretend something is there in order to run it out now there are these two points which are very very cleancut here one there isis reactive bank and it is composed of certain exact definite elements and there isnt anything else when you have disconnected the pc from that class of element he has ceased to be an effect of it and all intents and purposes you can regard it as gone now its either temporarily disconnected or it is gone the thing that wont get gone until its all done is the r6 gpms themselves complete and they are not going to disappear by somebody changing his postulates because they are the fanciest concatenation of postulates that anybody ever got tangled up with every postulate you could make is boobytrapped in it now therefore nobodys going to get through the r6 bank by changing his mind but there wouldnt be anything else in the mind if there werent an r6 bank there there would be other thing in the mind the individual would be able to confront be familiar be this be that be the other thing see hed do these things but there would be thing there therell be isness you follow so youve got this other stuff built up on it and heres this r6 bank in its totality and then on this r6 bank guy gets kind of woggy and woozy on the subject of postulating because he learns not to do certain things and certain other things and he learns to think carefully andso he gets his thetan block knocked off if he doesnt and he accumulates an r6ew series of locks on top of this he has certain purposes so he actuallyalong with the r6ew locks theres another strata of actions which are goals his own goals pile up on this thing and get all stacked into it too which is also an interesting phenomenon but that we put in along the line of implants you see heres your next little grade up above this and they last as sort of an overlay and theyre quite similar to the gpms and then you have now engrams whole track variety engrams which are mental image pictures spaced in certain times which have certain experiences contained in them and they consist of energy and thought and theyve got some space connected with them you see certainly some mass mental mass and then lying on top of those you get strata of secondaries which is to say moments of misemotion and the person became misemotional because he had moments of pain and unconsciousness in restimulation and that upset him so he got upset and he misemoted see people mistake how many misemotional states there are there are quite few misemotional states you find them in the tone scale and so forth anything below 2 or anything thats ever been named below 2 were finding as turning up on power process secondaries the pc will feel apathetic for two sessions he graduallyall of sudden he runs an apathetic secondary you see or hes run this thing out its the misemotional strata and now we get onto the whole subject of locks and lock is simply restimulation of the engramsecondary package in other words itll be on this basis fellow sees two cars run together he has himself an engram of two carshes in one and he got hurt and he went unconscious so hes got an engram on the subject of cars running togetherhe sees two cars run together and hes assaulted by the concussion and explosion and the screams of the maimed and dying the main goal of thei think of the highway department and so forth is motorists the way they control things anyway the finalhell get secondary see hell experience tremendous amount of fear when he sees these two cars go together now he wasnt touched it didnt threaten him he didnt own either car but youll find him crying about this now if he had friend in it youd have real honesttogod fullblown secondary hed feel terrible over this see now your next stage up from this is he sees picture of two cars or he sees wrecked car in junk yard not at the site of the wreck at all hes not connected with it any way shape or form theres been action he has experience whatsoever he doesnt even notice that hes seen wrecked car but he comes away from there feeling blue yeah he just isnt quite up to snuff hes now got lock and eventually he begins to record everything he ever sees thinks or does he is one walking concatenation of every instant of time is lock because its connected somehow or another to some secondary or some engram someplace on the track so he gets full time track there are blanks you can run this guy back through yesterday and it runs like an engram but you can you can run him through it and you can recover practically everything there is in yesterday i think its fascinating i usedive done lot of this and its sort of lost art these days because its not that significant weve got the whole of dianetics all wrapped up you see we can run an engram on anybody hes black sees black all over hisyou know andview he never sees anything at all pictures naw there arent any such things as engrams boy you can take and get the duration of the incident that hes looking at and it all opens up and there he is staring at the burning city you got the idea there he is so where weve got an individual occluded even that todaywe can turn off the occlusion see we can run him on the track now whats the setup here its simply that when he finally became human he had 100 percent track every moment ishis life was becoming time track he was now going down scale at an accelerated rate theyre all locks mental image pictures he couldnt look at anything in the universe right now without it hanging up on some experience hes had that he didnt like you got it male voice yeah well there istheres the bank now the individual also happens to be surrounded by thing called the physical universe i dont know if youve ever noticed it but there it is around and this physical universe can generate such thing as problem its him versus it or it versus him and along with the physical universe theres the other fellows universe his fellow being has also got bank with different experiential track than his but based on the exact same r6 bank theyre fundamentally basically the same bank but this other fellow lived different and he lived different track so they have at first glance different banks but they dont their basic bank is identical so youve got the other fellows universe and you got the physical universe now the other fellow in his universe can cause you problems while communicating to you through the physical universe and the physical universe itself can cause problems and so we can get thing called present time problem that doesnt have anything to do with mental image picture doesnt have anything to do with the reactive bank but it can restimulate the reactive bank and make it harder to solve the present time problem but present time problem can actually exist thats one of the things that auditors dont always notice the guys in jail well you say well lets run out all the locks and secondaries and so forth that isnt going to do him any good hes in jail and actually he cant get his attention on his bank and if he does hell just go back and run other times when hes been in jail millions and trillions of years agworth of locks on the thing and hell just keep running this and he wont get any better because hes running up against this unalterable fact hes in jail now if you could run him all the way down through and he could solo audit himself through the r6 bank there wouldnt be any jail that would hold him but is his worry so great about being in jail at this particular moment that he cant get his attention on his r6 bank and if it is he wont make it if you find pc who was chased way down the track he is probably thereor pc whos going mad with his problems or somethinghes probably way back down the track but actually hes being driven there by problem with the physical environment and the others with whom he associates and that problem is so great that its the physical universe that is out of gear and therefore we get pc making gain in the presence of present time problem now you can handle this present time problem usuallyusually on the simple basis that its problem because he doesnt think he can handle it hes entered lie into it he doesnt think he can do anything about it which is the lie that is entered into it and so he doesnt do anything about it so it remains problem do you understand so then if the auditor could audit around the fringes of this problem and get the person to take the problem apart and confront its elements and get the lies out of the problem then he could probably confront the problem and he would either have to do something about it or he wouldnt have to do anything about it because it ceased to be problem do you understand but you getyouryou get caught in the idea that the problem is something totally dependent upon the individuals mind it really isnt totally dependent on the individuals mind when youve got your hand caught in clothes wringer man it has nothing to do with your backtrack your hand you need it in your business true we could get over wanting to have hands but this is the other element in processing now therefore if an individual has tremendous present time problems youre not even going to get him to confront locks and youre at very shallow level of case gain or something happening to prevent the case from gaining but theres one just little bit higher than that and thats an arc break an arc break is person who thought he was going to be helped but felt he had been kicked in the teeth but hes not sure what kicked him in the teeth and he cant isolate it and some lie of apparent hostile nature has been entered into his environment and hes in restimulation but doesnt know where and he goes into confusion and so forth so he cant concentrate on either the bank or present time or the auditor so that would be the first thing you could get person over in actual auditing you have to get person over an arc break before you can audit him i dont care what process youre running him on so it isnt necessarily part of the bank but its made up from lackan arc break is merely an incomplete cycle of some kind or another that is all there is to an arc break arc break is more complex than that its lowering of affinity reality and communication and so we call it an arc break its sudden downcurve its highly technical term it means exactly what it says but its incept and so forth is an incomplete cycle of action it couldnt complete it because the guy died before he got there dont you see or its been lost or somebody said it was everywhere and it was only joe and theres some big lie entered into it probably but nevertheless however it was he didnt get chance to do what he was trying to do and thats his main upset and hes not auditable hes wondering whatwhatwhat fog you know not what wall but what fog am i in whawho is shooting at you know and you know person can get so puzzled as to who is shooting at him that he cant put any attention on his bank or his environment and so forth now all of us as human beings have to some slight degree an underthegun existence see were never completely out from underneath the gun theres things called economics there are wellmeaning friends there are shortages of theof materiel the lack of time things like this that make it hard to get along with the physical universe and others but you can tolerate quite bit of it unless youre on bit of skid in the first place lets say youre tipped over somehow or another and youve just had bad shock of some kind or another and then youd be surprised how things that didnt irritate you yesterday irritate you today well similarly person can be processed under certain amount of duress that is to say their environment can give them certain amount of duress and they can still react well to processing well ill give you an idea right now i am totally aware of the fact that if the us makes just about one more mistake why weve had it see theyve specialized in them lately and they must have textbook on how to make mistake in three easy state departments or something theyre gorgeous at it they just make mistakes making military mistakes diplomatic mistakes wrong target mistakes well they cant afford any when youre in rough spot dont make mistake dont allow yourself the luxury of an error in other words because itll worsen the situation all out of proportion for instance your pc is all cavedin and hysterical and the auditor makes the slight tiny mistake the pc just goes appetite over tin cup pc is feeling good the auditor forgets to acknowledge drops the emeter on the floor it just doesnt mean much to the pc do you get the idea so the amount of duress that an individual is under is proportionate to the degree that he thinks it threatens his survival now i know that right now the only reason id be vaguely interested in the united states alleged governmentthe only reason id be interested in that at all is because im an old hand at this sort of thing i know how easy it is for some guy to make enough blunders to wind things up in nice juicy bunch of mushroom clouds and i dont want to grow any mushroom clouds lately i mean weve got use for them theyre waste of time and falloutwere not interested in fallout we might be interested in mocking up radiation but not interested in somebody elses fallout in other words we could get here to point where world war iii could catch up things and thats the big bang dont you see itsit would be too destructive it isntanother type of war and that could interrupt things that operates as present time problem i never worry about it to amount to anything unless im already getting my head kicked in close up on something else dont you see now ill find myself all of sudden in auditing or something of that sort saying well how much time have i got really we havent got enough time dont you see its pressure of time which makes present time problem out of it so theres always certain amount of duress that the pc is under see theres always tiny bit its what is their tolerance for that much duress at that particular moment that makes the difference do you follow now pc who is more or less arc broken with life has tremendous present time problems all of them unsolvable and doesnt even know hes got mind and is believing bunch of erudite lies that have been told to him from all around the clock through his educationin other words standard better welloff human being todaythis bird hasnt got chance you try to process him first off the bat and you already are dealing with somebody whos up against too many unknowns and too many arc breaks mmmll rrrlmmm mmmm ooh now you make much of mistake with this bloke few little tiny errors and theyre blown up out of all magnitude now supposingsupposing youd gotten this guy and by some miracle had gotten him over his present time problems gotten him over his arc break with the environment show him he had mind showed him where he was going showed him that he really could be headed someplace and thenand then he made it the arc breaks with life are gone or you got rid of all of his present time problems and the needle floated you disconnected him temporarily from the remaining banks dont you see and now at this point he could confront these arc breaks with life he can confront these problems with life he sees exactly where he sits he knows whats bugging himits been this mind and you go on auditing arc breaks you go on auditing present time problems of course youve directly and immediately invalidated the individual you are cleaning clean youre adding things that werent there all you had to do was notice the needle floated the guy nowlets say youve gotten the problems mocked up and he was all set and his needle was floating on his life in general you say boy thats it youre okay now thats fine thats all thats it well he would have said well i think so and he would have stayed pretty doggone stable from there on you wouldve let him have his win in other words but if you went on auditing him and auditing him some more and auditing him for more problems youre sort of telling him at the same time that he cant confront problems hes starting to have to dream up difficulty with problems in order to have case to audit you couldnt audit on that strata anymore you wouldve had to have audited now in direction of recall processes you wouldve had to have audited now in the direction of recall processes i dont ask you to be this precise about it because frankly we havent got any bank of experience on exactly who goes released on an objective process exactly what process could you run him on next i would much rather jump him from free needle and take question about it at all up to next stage power processing because we know those can be run on him theres some possibility for instance that you could run some more of this or some more of that or something on the lowlevel processes if there is i havent made close delineated list of it im really not that interested in it because you could probablytheres some corners of it that you could go on and clean up but im not that interested in it because there is such thing as power processing its sort of like dabbling around withitd be almost cleaning clean anyhow see what gain could he make on this basis well hed better make the gainhis next jump had better be on power processing and then were fairly safe and we dont have to teach people so many i dont say then that there isnt any other lowergrade process that wont do anything for the pc but certainly everything that you have handled on that pc up to the moment when he went free needle can longer be run on that pc and that i tell you for sure because youre now cleaning clean and youre upsetting him because in essence thats longer bothering him and you by auditing it are selling him the idea that he ought to be bothered by it now waiting for him at the moment he went clean on locks let us saysupposing you got rid of some locks you ran some arc straightwire and you saw yourself sitting looking at floating needle uuh my god dont even utter that next command you know whats this professional thoroughness that has to utter two more auditing commands before you end the process you just saw that needle float free and you have just uttered the first of six commands you say all right youyouve been trying to say something there for moment what was that welloh well yeah i feel pretty good i feel quite remarkable and so forth i had cognition few minutes ago well of course to be good fellow your immediate thought would be you should sayto be social you should say at that point well what was the cognition you dontthats too much youve gone too far you dont give him the second command see you dont say oh well what was that cognition that you had leave it alone man thethisthats it you say well we seem to have attained where were going here so thank you thank you thats it i want you to go over and see the examiner and he why whats happening did something happen yes something happened now you go on over and see the examiner and get your declare goodbye dont even let him stand around and talk about the session you see youre restimulator the next little while because hes used to obeying your auditing command anything you say to him is liable to be the examiner who opens his mouth threeeighths of an inch when he only has to open his mouth quarter of an inch is fool if theres something wrong with this pc we should take glimpse at the folder and see that the auditor has said this and see that ifs okay and take look at the pc and see if the indicators are in and move the pc over to declare dont you see if theres something wrong with the folder that sort of thing send him over to review let review worry about it but one more command and youd be cleaning clean man now youve got to fish him out of the fact youre running something that isnt there any longer now you see it can turn straight over onto the negative side you subtracted him from that class of aberration known as locks let us say hes out of it now this i havent been saying very hard about release theyre gone there isnt any more of that see now you getyou get tripped up in this when i tell you well you pulled him out of the r6 bank yes youve pulled out the lock disconnectorsthe lock connectors to the r6 bank but theyre gone he might have two or three more around that hell kick into it sooner or later but leave him alone theyll blow sooner or later youll even find second stage release that has run through the first stage engram see theand sometimes two or three days later theyll stumble along and you have to give them anotheryouthe best thing to do is to give them the other punch but they werent stopped on free needle they were stopped on the end phenomena see and somewhere in that series of commands exactly following the end phenomena the needle would have floated if it were carefully watched you understand now if the needle floated theyve not only gotten rid of their engrams and secondaries but they have also you see floated the needle do you follow in other words the two things took place when those two things went together you havent got any more worries about it but if the auditor missed the free needle and went on even onimonly reason im talking about power processing im not trying to teach you how to run power processes im just telling you even at this level and so forth it would just be one more command after that float honest youre liable to be auditing the pcs for days and days and days and wonder what in the name of common sense happened well what happened normally was something floated the needle and its been missed by both the auditor and the pc and boy you talk about finding needle in haystack from there on out needle in haystack is nothing because you at least have visible needle and visible haystack for the pc youre looking in the goneness for the whatwentness through mass of itwasntthereanywayness afterwards thats pretty hard to do so these overruns and so forth are very poor show now there would theoretically be preciselybe precisely sort of aof an objective environment type of release but it doesnt show up normally once in blue moon somebody will be running the cchs and accidentally when the persons feeling pretty good put him on meter and find out hes got floating needle but normally its after somebody has runi dont know of many of these look around the room and the needle goes free i dont know of any of those so i just neglect this one as possible because iiti think it would be very freakish case and it would certainly be nothing with which you would classify something on the next one would behed also run right away on recall processes so why bother with it get your recall process if youre running recall processes which is locks of some kind or another if that needle went freeor communication processes or recall processes same thingneedle went free and floated thats it you just might as well wipe out all of the lowergrade processing from that point on but you might have to go through level 0and in most cases willlevel 0 level i level ii grade level iii grade and level iv grade and finally they float off the launching pad on service facs that you could normally count on making providing you didnt overrun something and providing you flattened the processes that you were running and providing the d of ping was good and the auditing was good andyou know why he would make it thats the way it was designed to go and sure enough weve hadweve had several go this way see just recently but thats first stage release so you just say loosely any time this happens below this particular state why its first stage release well whats first stage released ot people ask that question well he not only went free needle he went free body too now its moreno more complicated than that how well can this fellow operate well some of these guys can operate and some of them cant operate and some of them theytruth of the matter is they utter about two postulates in the humanoid world and so forth and theyre back in their head or fallen on their head or something of this sort but if you dont acknowledge the fact they did go out and take look around and they do feel that they can do this if this is not acknowledged in any way shape or form why you sort of arc break the guy so youve got to tell himyouve got toyouve got to classify him as he is in other words hes first stage released ot the fact that whatits merelyit says that he went free from his body as well as free on the meter do you follow it doesnt mean anything more significant than that now your secondof course thats enough now your second stageyour second stage in actual facts takes care of the secondaries and engrams and youre knocking out the bank on secondaries and engrams and fortunately we have the technology which does this but it is terribly powerful technology it is very easy to dish pc with an overrun its very delicate action but the odd part of it is is as you would suspect of very powerful process it runs in great purity of delivery in other words this process has got to be delivered as itself it cant be alterised in any shape or form because it is too close in to the truth dont you see and you start adding things to it youit just goes unworkable on you and you wonder why the pc is in there forever well somebodys doing something else or the pcs doing something else or hes nothes not running with the very great purity of the process itself you could run for instance level 0 pretty sloppy and you arent deep enough into the bank to affect anybody very hard but if you wouldran power process with better than level 0 comm cycleerk horrible i mean oof theres too much there dont you see youre pushing the case around too fast and furious and you got to be right on the ball but what are you getting rid of there youre getting rid of the whole track secondaries and engrams is actually what youre getting rid of now theres third stage relwell supposing that this second stage release while you were doing this you got the individual knock out the secondaries and engrams and so on and pulled the pin on that section of the bank what if he also went free of his body at that particular time great but you just designate himyou just put ot on the end of the thing in other words your designation of second stage release and second stage released ot second stage release simply means he went free on the meter and second stage released ot means he also went free of the body got that and now you get to your third stage release well actually theres process known as r6ew which waits for him on the other side and thats fine and r6ew is not part of third stage release it can still be run on third stage release but the third stage release leads him through the physical environment contact with the bank let be thatthat esoteric and ends up with cutting off the r6ew top going justgoing off the top of those floating end words you can get himyou can get him off of what pins him into those end words you can just separate that and those are theits little series of four processes they are very delicately run they dont take long on second stage release but therein lies the hooker it doesnt take long but it takesits shorter time as it is done delicately and correctly i suppose you could go in for this and make lifetime profession out of it if you missed all of the free floating needles and you run each one of those processes to floating needle and theres four of them there and you run them to floating needle each one isattains to subject one has to do with people and one has to do with where hes been and so forth do you see and so you get that well you run each one of those things and then the needle is really floaty man now of course he can dive off the shade of this and hes got protective coating now between him and the r6 bank it stands there naked and raw hes got the r6ew spans that are lying in amongst the gpms and so forth boy there they are and he can run those like shot but its quite interesting its quite interesting that r6ew can run to floating needle so there actually is another state of release before you go to clear there actually is fourth stage release its made on r6ew fourth stage release then your fifth stage release i suppose that it can occur running the gpms but im also very sure that im not going to give it much attention because itsmy main worry in actuallyin running gpms has been to hold on to the cans well thats worry you got to get it all straight and its very complex and so forth and its very tricky its one of trickiest mental gymnastics anybodys ever askedbeen asked to do from subjective viewpoint of it all but the truth of the matter is is you could run that up and there probably are ways you could shortcircuit it in other words you could probably run it in such way as to detach yourself from the body and so forth and youd still have some fragments of r6 bank well the end product of that would be lot of bunk because you wouldnt be able to sit there and hold on to your cans very well and get yourself in connection with whats missing on the r6 bank until all of sudden you just cease to mock it up and somewhere up the line you had missed whole span of these things and they keyed in again well the hell with that racket lets do the job dont you see so your last fear on the line of when youre going towhat you would call i suppose fifth stage release which would then be clear would be dont get sent before youre ready to went you see the dilemma because let tell you its awful hard to sit on cloud nine and run an emeter which is way down there on that shiny planet i can do it but it takes some doing sometimes now therefore you have these various stages of release and they all wind up in the state of clear but that was because we never before had the state of clear we didnt have this state in view people would consider clear this and argued about clear and there must have been something wrong with the word clear or we wouldnt have argued about it to the degree that we argue about it for so many years what weve meant all that time was release also people were arguing about what was release about every few months youd get query what is release well itsyou have then series of gradual keyouts now at any given one of those keyouts the individual detaches from the remainder of his reactive bank but there is the next section that you could attach him to and get him to tackle and you better had sooner or later because lifes going to connect it with him anyhow do you see if you dont life will so what you do is like slicing large cheese youre just cutting more of the cheese off but the trouble is every time you cut piece of the cheese off the individual floats off and he hasnt got any more worries about cheese and you have to whistle him up ifand say well if you dontif you dont watch it in the next few years or the next few hours or the next few minutes anotherthisthis cheese bank is going to show up again so lets take another slice of it off okay and you have to bring him back and actually the first commands of the next stagenow remember its got to be the next stagethe extra command of the old stage that hes finished itsit would find nothing dont you see but this next stage that first command actually keys in the bank again that keys in that next slice of cheese see and then youll finally move it down and find there isnt any cheese and the individual says is that what ive been worrying about all this time yes thats what youve been worrying about those are the various states i thought i had better give them to you rather graphically and try to explain to you exactly what we were doing you get false impression if you believe that the individual just sort of flies out of his bank and flies into it again thats an oversimplification of what happens actually its certain strata of his bank disappears it is in actual fact erased its more than just release because what proves it is auditing him on it any further is just about as kind as blowing his head off with shotgun its the wrong thing to do so when section of his bank or type of his whole bank is gone why its gone and youve to grab another handful of the bank in order to get it the odd part of it is you can rehabilitate these stages you can rehabilitate these stages by getting keyins and getting keyouts and so forth but ithere is one word of warning about rehabilitation you can rehabilitate it but actually in rehabilitation youre already working on the next stage do you understand and it has to be done very delicately because rehabilitation processes are not designed to handle the next stage so theres littletheres really limit by which you could rehabilitate one of these states the easiest way to rehabilitate clear is spot the thing get rid of all the additive processing that was cleaning cleans rehabilitate it to that degree dont you see just get rid of that and then get him into the next stage going on up and that is the best and most sensible way to handle it rather than just keep program going for rehabilitation year keeps the bank away you know well ive given you some data on this i thought you could use in general and maybe give you little clearer understanding of this thing of release ive been working with it hot and heavy here for many months and weve got lots of data on it now and its very predictable its easy to do and simultaneously with this all over the world right at this particular moment why theres stampede on starting up here there and so forth amongst old groups of scientologists and so forth and even someday itll hit the dianeticists even someday why even though theyre off the communication lines and so forth here and there why theyll suddenly start turning up and say you know i think i was clear i got letter the other day from an oldtime dianeticist said hey hey ive been released ive been released and you know who did it you did and i was giving him some processing one night and i released the guy i made him first stage released ot and i remember definitely somebody processed him the next day and you never saw anybody cave in so hard or go so low so wonder he was so happy after all these years why hed gotten rehabilitated his total number of hours in processing was i think fifteen minutes i wouldnt count on doing it that fast but that was record all right and i hope the information will do you some good thank you very much
