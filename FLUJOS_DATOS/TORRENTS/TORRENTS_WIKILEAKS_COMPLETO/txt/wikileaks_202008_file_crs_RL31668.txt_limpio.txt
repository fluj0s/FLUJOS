charmaine mercer analyst in education policy domestic social policy division federal pell grant program of the higher education act background and reauthorization summary the federal pell grant program authorized by the higher education act hea is the single largest source of grant aid for postsecondary education attendance funded by the federal government it is estimated to provide nearly 14 billion in fy2007 to about 53 million undergraduate students for fy2007 the maximum pell grant was funded at 4310 with the expiration of the hea the congress is likely to debate what changes may be needed in the pell grant program as part of its consideration of hea reauthorization pell grants are needbased aid intended to be the foundation for all federal student aid awarded to undergraduates eligibility is limited to undergraduates there is absolute income threshold that determines who is eligible and who is ineligible for pell grants nevertheless pell grant recipients are primarily low income in fy1999 an estimated over 90 of pell grant recipients considered to be dependent upon their parents had total parental income below 40000 of pell grant recipients considered to be independent of their parents over 90 had total income below 30000 among the issues that may be debated by the congress during the hea reauthorization process is the extent to which the pell grant program continues to act as the foundation for all federal needbased aid for undergraduates concern has been raised about the diminished role that the pell grant may be playing for example needbased aid recipients are as likely to borrow subsidized loans under the federal stafford loan program as they are to receive pell grants this overarching issue may trigger consideration of various steps to increase the amount of pell grant aid flowing to the neediest students this might include deliberation over raising the pell grant minimum award those with the smallest grants are the least needy of pell recipients converting the program into an entitlement possibly with higher annual maximum grants converting the program to an entitlement is also seen by some as response to the periodic uncertainty about the adequacy of the annual appropriation to meet program costs and resulting funding shortfalls other issues that may engage the congress include whether some element of academic merit should be introduced into the process of determining pell eligibility and level of pell assistance this report will be updated to reflect major legislative action to reauthorize the pell grant

education act background and reauthorization introduction the federal pell grant program authorized by title iv of the higher education act hea is the single largest source of grant aid for postsecondary education attendance funded by the federal government it is estimated to have provided approximately 14 billion to about 53 million undergraduate students in fy2007 pell grants are needbased aid intended to be the foundation for all federal student aid awarded to undergraduates the us department of education ed estimates that in fy2006 pell grants constituted approximately 17 of all federally supported aid including grants loans and work opportunities that benefit postsecondary education students at all levels1 the statutory authority for the pell grant program was most recently reauthorized by the college cost reduction and access act of 2007 pl 11084 through fy2017 however comprehensive reauthorization of the hea has not occurred since the hea amendments of 1998 and still awaits congressional attention most recently the hea was amended and extended by the third higher education extension act of 2007 pl 110109 until march 31 20082 as it deliberates on the reauthorization of the hea the congress may debate what changes if any to make to the pell grant program this report reviews how the program works and provides analysis of program funding recipients numbers and characteristics and the role being played by the program in the distribution of federal student aid it concludes with an examination of several pellrelated issues that may be considered by the congress in the hea reauthorization process this report will be updated to reflect major legislative action to reauthorize the pell grant program 1 percentage calculated from data presented in us department of education fiscal year 2008 budget summary p 54 total federal student aid excludes 31 billion in consolidation loans under which borrowers consolidate prior loans if consolidation loans are included the pell percentage falls to approximately 12 2 the original termination date for most of the provisions of the hea was september 30 2003 this termination date was extended through fy2004 by the general education provisions act gepa series of subsequent measures pl 108366 pl 10981 pl 109150 pl 109212 pl 109238 pl 109292 pl 11044 pl 11051 and pl 110109 have temporarily extended the hea program and provision authority crs2 how the program works this section provides an overview of the structure of the pell grant program and the process through which grants are made to students it describes student eligibility the award rules for determining students grants program funding and the role played by postsecondary institutions in the program briefly the pell grant program provides grants ie aid that does not have to be repaid to needy undergraduates in any year federal funding is available to ensure that all eligible students attending eligible institutions receive pell grants3 to apply for these grants students must complete the free application for federal student aid fafsa with requested financial and other information and submit it to central processor under contract with ed the central processor provides each applicant with student aid record sar and each institution of higher education ihe designated by the applicant with an institutional student information record isir these documents contain the information submitted on the fafsa and the calculated expected family contribution efc the efc is what is expected to be contributed by the student and his or her family toward postsecondary education expenses the efc is described in detail below pell grants are portable that is the grant aid follows the student to the eligible postsecondary education institutions in which they enroll institutions that receive valid sars or valid isirs for students meeting all other program eligibility requirements must disburse pell grants to them the size of the grants is based principally on the financial resources that students and their families are expected to contribute toward postsecondary education expenses and the maximum grant that the annual appropriations process sets for the program student eligibility to be eligible for pell grant student must meet requirements that apply to federal student aid in general and requirements specific to the pell grant program among the requirements generally applicable to federal student aid are the following students must be enrolled for the purpose of earning degree or certificate at an eligible institution students must have high school diploma or the recognized equivalent4 absent such diploma or its equivalent students must 3 as explored below if costs for the pell grant program exceed the current fiscal years appropriation additional funds can be used from the subsequent years appropriation this process of ensuring that grant payments will be made has led some to liken the program to quasi entitlement the issue of making the program into an actual entitlement is discussed later in this report 4 students completing home schooling as recognized under state law are considered to be eligible crs3 demonstrate an ability to benefit from postsecondary education by passing an examination approved by ed students have to maintain satisfactory academic progress while enrolled in postsecondary education in order to be eligible for federal student aid satisfactory progress is delineated by policies developed by each participating ihe conviction for possession or sale of drugs can disqualify students for federal student aid5 students are ineligible if they are in default on title iv student loan or have failed to repay an overpayment on title iv grant students must meet citizenship requirements6 males between 18 and 25 years of age must register with the selective service system in order to eligible for federal student aid pellspecific requirements include the following fulltime and parttime7 undergraduates8 are eligible to receive pell grants there is statutory limit on the number of years in which students can receive grants students who are incarcerated in federal or state penal institution are ineligible for pell grants the program provides assistance only to financially needy students as determined under the programs award rules see below award rules key concepts an eligible students annual pell grant is determined on the basis of set of award rules certain concepts are key to an understanding of the application of these award rules appropriated maximum pell grant the appropriated maximum pell grant is specified in the annual appropriations legislation for the us department of education that legislation appropriates funding for the pell grant program and sets the maximum award that can be made during the fiscal year the revised 5 for additional information on drug convictions and student aid eligibility see crs report rs21824 student eligibility drug convictions and federal financial aid by charmaine mercer and laura l monagle 6 generally students must be us citizens or us permanent residents individuals with several other entrance statuses can qualify for aid individuals in the us on temporary basis such as those with student visa or an exchange visitor visa are not eligible for federal student aid 7 less than halftime students are eligible 8 students enrolled on at least halftime basis in postbaccalaureate program required by state for k12 teacher certification or licensure are also eligible such program cannot not lead to graduate degree and the enrolling higher education institutions must not offer baccalaureate degrees in education crs4 continuing appropriations resolution 2007 set the maximum appropriated pell grant award at 4310 for award year 200720089 this maximum award is different from the authorized maximum pell grant which is the annual maximum pell grant specified in the hea this topic is explored further in the section below on program funding additionally the college cost reduction and access act of 2007 included mandatory funding for the pell grant program to increase the amount of the maximum appropriated award specifically the maximum appropriated award would be increased by the following amounts 490 for award years 20082009 and 20092010 690 for award years 20102011 and 20112012 and 1090 for award year 20122013 this newly added provision specifies that any individual who qualifies for pell grant award under the provisions associated with the current appropriated maximum pell grant award is eligible to receive this addon amount for example for the 20082009 award year assuming the maximum appropriated pell grant award remains 4310 an individual who qualifies for pell grant award of 500 would receive an additional 490 for total of 990 because heshe qualified under the provisions for 4310 maximum award thus if person is eligible for pell grant award of at least 200 on the basis of the appropriated maximum award this individual would receive the addon amount in any given award year expected family contribution the efc is the amount that the federal need analysis system determines can be expected to be contributed by student and his or her family toward the students cost of education this calculation is based on consideration of available income and for some families available assets basic living expenses federal income tax liability retirement needs and other expenses are taken into account in this process different efc formulas are applied to three different groups of students those who are considered dependent on their parents the efc formula assesses the financial resources of both the parents and the dependent student independent students with dependents other than spouse if any and independent students with dependents other than spouse eg children10 the efc determination utilizes financial information submitted by the aid recipient on the fafsa cost of attendance the cost of attendance coa is measure of students educational expenses in general it is the sum of tuition and fees an 9 award year 20072008 began july 1 2007 and ends june 30 2008 10 for federal student aid purposes and the calculation of the efc an individual is considered independent of his or her parents ie parental income and assets are not considered in determining the efc if the individual is at least 24 years old by december 31 of the award year is an orphan or ward of the state or was until age 18 is veteran of the armed forces or active duty military is graduate or professional student is married has dependents other than spouse or is deemed independent by financial aid officer for other unusual circumstances crs5 allowance for books supplies transportation and miscellaneous personal expenses and room and board allowance11 award rules the primary pell grant award rule is that students annual grant is the least of the maximum appropriated pell grant minus efc or coa minus efc12 additionally by law pell grant award cannot be less than 400 for those students whose pell grant would be between 200 and 400 the law provides 400 grant those whose calculated pell grant is less than 200 receive grant prior to the enactment of the college cost reduction and access act of 2007 there was third award rule tuition sensitivity that functioned to reduce the amount of the pell grant award for students attending higher education institutions with very low tuition charges the tuition sensitivity provision was first adopted by the higher education amendments of 1992 and was intended to protect base amount of the pell grant maximum award and make portion of increases above that base sensitive to tuition more specifically tuition sensitivity reduces the pell grant award received by small number of the lowincome students who also attend institutions with very low tuition charges for fy2007 the only students whose pell grant would possibly be reduced under tuition sensitivity are those students whose tuition charges and any allowances for dependent care or disability related expenses are less than 805 whose efcs are 800 or less and whose total coa is 3500 or higher however this provision was eliminated by the college cost reduction and access act of 2007 effective july 1 2007 finally an important feature of the pell grant award rules is that the grant is determined without consideration of any other financial assistance student may be eligible to receive or may be receiving this reflects the intention to make the pell grant the foundation to which other assistance is added institutional role an eligible institutions role in the pell grant program primarily involves determining student eligibility disbursing awards adjusting awards to ensure that students do not receive more assistance than they are eligible for record keeping and reporting to ed13 11 it can also include an allowance for dependent care expenses for students with dependents costs associated with study abroad programs for students engaged in such programs expenses associated with disability for students with disabilities and the costs associated with employment under cooperative education program students who are less than halftime are eligible for room and board costs for more than three semesters of which more than two can be consecutive 12 the hea prohibits the pell grant from exceeding the difference between the coa and the efc this precludes the awarding of pell grant in excess of what student might need to cover coa after taking efc into account 13 much of the information in this section is based on the us department of educations federal student aid handbook for 20062007 available on the web at httpifapedgov ifapwebappcurrentsfahandbookspagjsp crs6 to be eligible for hea title iv programs including the pell grant program an institution must be public or private nonprofit ihe proprietary postsecondary institution or postsecondary vocational institution among other requirements14 it must be legally authorized by its state to provide postsecondary education must be accredited by nationally recognized accrediting agency or meet alternative requirements and admit as regular students only individuals with high school diploma or the equivalent or individuals beyond the age of compulsory school attendance ed certifies an institution for participation in hea title iv programs based on consideration of its institutional eligibility administrative capacity and financial responsibility the institution must then enter into program participation agreement with ed which delineates the requirements and responsibilities for participating institutions in addition to other title iv eligibility requirements high student loan default rate can render an institution ineligible for the pell grant program this applies if an institution is ineligible for the federal family education loan program or direct loan program under hea title iv as result of its loan default rate determined by the secretary of education for fy1996 or subsequent fiscal years an eligible institution calculates students pell grant award using the coa and enrollment status it has determined for the student and applying these values with the students efc to the pell grant payment schedules published annually by ed pell grants must be paid out in installments over the academic year student receives pell grant only for the payment period for which he or she is enrolled generally institutions credit students account with the pell payment to meet unpaid tuition fees room and board any remaining pell funds are paid directly to the student to cover other living expenses based on estimates of the funds an institution needs to cover initial pell payments ed establishes an initial authorization of pell grant funding against which an institution may request funds this initial authorization level is adjusted as the award year advances to reflect actual disbursements institutions can receive federal payments for pell awards in several different ways for most schools the advance payment method is used under which an institution receives federal funds prior to making payments to students schools for which ed has concerns about their ability to meet title iv participation requirements may be required to use the reimbursement payment method under which the institution is paid back for funds it has disbursed to students in addition the pell grant program pays participating institutions an administrative cost allowance of 5 per enrolled pell recipient 14 for additional information on institutional eligibility and federal student aid see crs report rl31926 institutional eligibility for participation in title iv student aid programs under the higher education act background and issues by rebecca skinner crs7 program funding the pell grant program is the federal governments single largest source of grant aid for postsecondary education students this section reviews recent program funding trends exploring the difference between the annual appropriation for the program and program costs and the issue of annual shortfalls or surpluses in funding it also provides data on the appropriated maximum and authorized maximum pell grants as well as annual average grant awards pell funding appropriated for particular fiscal year is generally intended to support awards during an award year that begins on the july 1 that falls in that fiscal year and ends the following june 30 for example fy2007 pell appropriated funds are intended principally to support awards made between july 1 2007 and june 30 2008 further pell grant appropriations are available for obligation over twoyear period for example the fy2007 appropriation became available for obligation upon enactment of the fy2007 appropriations legislation15 and can be obligated through september 30 2009 as is discussed later in separate section on surpluses and shortfalls in the pell grant program the annual pell appropriation has been used to meet prior year costs or carried over to meet future costs annual appropriation and program costs table 1 provides the annual appropriation by fiscal year for the pell grant program and the estimated annual costs of the program given the possible use of fiscal years appropriation for pell grants for multiple award years or the appropriation of funds specifically to meet shortfalls from prior years it is not surprising that the annual appropriated amount does not precisely equal the program costs for any year the question of annual surpluses or shortfalls has vexed the program on many occasions it is considered separately below table 1 history of pell grant appropriations and program costs fy1973fy2007 dollars in millions rounded to nearest million fiscal year appropriations estimated costs 1973

maximum award is often used as gauge of the programs support for lowincome college students because this is the amount that the neediest students those with an efc of 0 are likely to receive during the annual appropriations process there is frequently debate about setting the maximum award the figure below depicts the change over time in the size of the authorized maximum grant none specified for fy2007 appropriated maximum grant and the average award during the mid to late 1990s the gap between the authorized and appropriated maximums was largest not unexpectedly the average annual award generally tracks changes in the appropriated maximum surpluses and shortfalls as mentioned the annual appropriations legislation for ed provides funding for the pell grant program and sets the maximum pell grant to be awarded the appropriated maximum grant these appropriated funds are available for two fiscal years in general that means that an annual appropriation is typically available for obligation on october 1 of the fiscal year in which the appropriation is made and remains available for obligation through september 30 of the following fiscal year for example the fy2006 appropriation became available for obligation with the enactment of the fy2006 appropriations legislation december 30 2005 and can be obligated through september 30 2007 the pell grant award year runs from july 1 of one year to june 30 of the following calendar year eg 20062007 award year begins july 1 2006 and ends june 30 2007 as result the period of availability of the appropriated funds

grant program us department of education budget service budget tables for various years crs11 the annual appropriation level and maximum grant are determined well in advance of the award year they are intended to support the annual appropriation is determined on the basis of estimates of the program costs that are likely to be incurred at the chosen maximum grant to the extent those estimates of future program costs are inaccurate the annual appropriation may be too much or too little in the event of surplus the authorizing statute provides ed with limited carryover authority what has been of most concern to federal policymakers recently are the measures that can be taken to address funding shortfall the hea requires the secretary of education when he or she has determined that the appropriated funds are insufficient to satisfy all pell entitlements16 to notify each house of congress of the shortfall identifying how much more is needed to meet those entitlements prior to the higher education amendments of 1992 pl 102325 the secretary of education had statutory authority under the hea to reduce awards to respond to shortfall in appropriated funds17 reductions were made in awards in eight years using this authority the last in 19901991 after this hea authority was repealed appropriations legislation for fy1994fy2001 continued to provide the secretary with reduction authority but that authority was not used18 the fy2002 and subsequent appropriations legislation have not included such language the secretary can respond to shortfall in pell grant funding by borrowing from the next years appropriation as noted earlier the pell grant appropriation is available for obligation for two fiscal years this permits ed to use funds from two fiscal years appropriations to meet one award years costs fy2001fy2005 the growth of the shortfall the experience to date of the pell grant program with the fy2001fy2006 appropriations offers the most recent examples of responses to pell grant shortfall table 3 the most recent ed estimate is that the fy2005 shortfall for the program was approximately 43 billion how that program shortfall was reached is delineated in the table and text below 16 the authorizing statute speaks of entitlements when it describes the award determined for student based on the published award schedule 17 some form of authority to reduce awards was provided to the secretary between the inception of the program in 1972 and the 1992 amendments immediately prior to its repeal in 1992 this provision permitted reduction in awards only within certain limits award could be reduced for students whose efc was 200 or less ie the awards for the neediest students would be protected schedule of reductions for other awards had to use single linear reduction formula that applied uniformly increasing percentage reductions as initial entitlements decreased award could be made to student whose initial award was reduced to less than 100 under the reduction formula 18 the appropriations legislation required the secretary to reduce awards using fixed or variable percentages or using fixed dollar reduction if prior to issuing the payment schedules he or she determined that appropriated funds could not fully fund the appropriated maximum grant schedule of reduced grants would then be published crs12 appropriations law for fy2001 set the maximum pell grant at 3750 and appropriated 8756 billion in january 2001 ed estimated that fy2001 program costs at that maximum grant level would be 9115 billion and that the difference between the appropriation and program costs would be made up by 359 million in surplus funds from the prior year19 as table 3 shows as of january 2005 the fy2001 program costs were 9996 billion in addition only an estimated 328 million was available in surplus funds this left an estimated 912 million shortfall for fy2001 in the pell grant program ed covered that shortfall by borrowing from the fy2002 appropriation which became available for obligation during the 2001 2002 award year the initial fy2002 appropriation for the program was 10314 billion intended to fund 4000 maximum grant in its fy2003 budget request ed estimated that fy2002 program costs would be 10730 billion20 well in excess of the appropriated level and more than ed had estimated during the fy2002 appropriations process given that ed was using fy2002 appropriated funds to cover the fy2001 shortfall the department requested an fy2002 supplemental appropriation of 1276 billion the congress responded by increasing the available fy2002 appropriation by 1 billion the more recent estimates for fy2002 from ed shown in table 3 demonstrate how volatile program cost estimates have been during this period currently ed estimates that fy2002 program costs were 11664 billion coupled with 1 billion supplemental appropriation enacted into law the total fy2002 appropriated funds were 11314 billion of this amount an estimated 912 million was used to cover the fy2001 shortfall leaving the available funding 1262 billion below what was needed to cover the fy2002 program costs in march 2003 the department estimated program costs for fy2003 maximum pell grant of 4000 at 1167 billion this estimate assumed 292 million in savings from anticipated enactment of legislation authorizing the internal revenue service irs to match aid applicant data with federal income tax returns in the absence of this legislation which to date has not been enacted total estimated program costs were pegged at 11962 billion the more recent ed estimates show fy2003 program costs of 12730 billion as the fy2002 and fy2003 cost estimates rose the fy2003 year shortfall rose in part because the shortfall from fy2002 grew in march 2003 the fy2003 shortfall was estimated to be 1538 billion or 183 billion with the addition of the 292 million assumed to be saved by the irs match as illustrated in table 3 the

enrollment status and type and control of enrolling institution income there is absolute income threshold that determines who is eligible or who is ineligible for pell grants23 nevertheless pell grant recipients are primarily low income in fy2003 award year 20032004 an estimated 38 of dependent pell grant recipients had total parental income below 20000 and over 80 84 had total income of less than 4000024 independent pell grant recipients income is generally lower than their dependent counterparts nearly 40 396 of independent pell grant recipients had total income of less than 10000 over slightly more than 85 857 had total income below 30000 23 as has been described eligibility for pell grant depends to great extent on the efc calculated for student and his or her family the efc can be affected by host of factors other than familys income this includes among other factors family size number in college the students dependency status and assets 24 total income for dependent students is the total income of their parents this includes most taxable and untaxed income for independent students total income is the taxable and untaxed income for the students and their spouses if any crs17 given the focus of the program on needy students it is not surprising that much higher percentages of low income undergraduates receive pell grants this might be considered pell

source crs estimates from 20002003 npsas given the intended purpose of the pell grant program to provide lowincome students with the foundation of their aid it is noteworthy that substantial portion of very low income undergraduates did not receive pell grant apparently large percentage of these very low income students did not apply for federal financial aid26 the percentage of dependent undergraduates from the lowest income category who received pell grant increased markedly if aid application is taken into account rising from 592 to 797 similar increase in participation characterized the lowest income independent undergraduates when aid application is considered from 496 to 750 nevertheless even among aid application filers relatively significant portion of the lowest income students did not receive pell grants it is possible that many of these lowest income students who did not apply for aid may have believed they were not financially eligible for aid or they may have had sufficient resources to meet their costs27 at least some of those who believed they 26 it should be noted that the ability to speak with confidence about the income levels of students who did not file the fafsa is adversely affected by certain data quality issues for nonaid filers income information comes from surveys of students and from imputation according to the npsas code book in the data analysis system these income data are much less reliable than those from aid filers 27 an analysis of 19951996 npsas data found these to be the two primary reasons offered continued crs19 were ineligible for aid may have actually been eligible28 among other possible explanations is that very lowincome students in particular find the federal financial aid application process too complex to pursue or that such students are more likely not to know that aid is available enrollment status pell recipients regardless of dependency status are more likely to be

federal needbased aid is to build on the pell grant as described earlier other financial aid received by student is not taken into account in determining students pell grant how well does the pell grant currently function as the foundation aid this section explores this question by analyzing the purchasing power of the pell grant and the distribution of other federal aid to pell recipients purchasing power the appropriated maximum pell grant available to students with zero efcs is often used as gauge of the pell grant programs level of support in each year in fy2001 the appropriated maximum grant 3750 covered 73 of the average tuition fees room and board at public twoyear institutions 41 at public fouryear institutions and 16 at private fouryear institutions figure 3 below compares the appropriated maximum grant to average undergraduate tuition fees room and board charges at public twoyear public fouryear and private fouryear institutions crs21 between fy1973 and fy200629 it is evident that the maximum was at its peak relative to these average charges during the 1970s figure 3 percentage of tuition fees room and board covered by the appropriated maximum pell grant fy1973fy2006 1200 1000 public 4year 800 public 2year 600 private 4 year 400 cost of attendance 200 cap 00 1 973 1 97 6 197 9 1982 1 98 5 198 8 1991 1 994 1 99 7 2000 2 003 2 00 6 source us department of education digest of education statistics 2005 table 312 the college board trends in college pricing 2006 table 1 importantly the purchasing power of the pell grant through fy1992 1992 1993 award year was constrained by statutory cap on the percentage of coa that pell grant could cover depicted as black dots in figure 3 from fy1973 to fy1984 the cap was 50 from fy1985 to fy1992 the cap was 60 after that time there has been absolute limit on the percentage of coa that can be covered30 29 the data used for figure 3 are average undergraduate tuition and fees paid by fulltime equivalent students the room and board amounts are fulltime charges the average full cost of attendance for federal need analysis purposes would be higher than these socalled fixed charges including additional expenses for such things as books and transportation the inclusion of fulltime room and board in figure 3 may be somewhat problematic particularly at the communitycollege level because these charges are not adjusted for part time enrollment and may not reflect the actual costs faced by students living off campus but as noted later in this section the overall conclusions regarding pell grant purchasing power apply regardless of the charges used the source of these data is the us department of educations digest of education statistics 2005 table 312 prices for public and private fouryear institutions for academic years 19731974 19741975 and 19751976 are not available from ed for this figure they were estimated based on the annual rates of change in prices for other public or private fouryear institutions these institutions do not include public or private universities for which ed did have data private twoyear institutions are not considered because they account for very few students 30 in place of the absolute cap on the percentage of coa that the pell grant could cover the continued crs22 still it must be stressed that it is not clear what impact the coa cap would have had on the coverage data presented in this figure first the expenses covered in the figure are averages meaning that students actually faced charges that ranged above and below the levels shown second charges for tuition fees room and board do not constitute the full costs that make up coa as result annual percentages of average coa covered by the appropriated maximum pell grant would have been lower than the percentages delineated in this figure31 nevertheless even if one assumes that the percentage of coverage by the maximum pell grant of tuition fees room and board would have been limited to the 50 or 60 caps these caps would have had impact on the coverage of average public and private fouryear expenses shown here from fy1985 onward as result it is evident that from the mid 1980s through the early 1990s the appropriated maximum pell grant lost ground relative to average tuition fees room and board at public and private fouryear institutions despite recent increases in coverage the fy2006 percentages remain below the fy1985 percentages 54 for public four year colleges and 23 for private fouryear colleges indeed for private fouryear institutions the peak purchasing power which occurred in the mid to late 1970s when the percentage of these average costs covered at those institutions was well in excess of 30 would not have been affected by the coa caps since average charges in that sector were always below the caps the erosion depicted in figure 3 is found when other comparisons are made for example the trend lines are very similar if the annual average pell grant is compared to average tuition fees room and board or if either the appropriated maximum or average grant is compared to just tuition and fees32 pell grant recipients and other federal aid one measure of the role that the pell grant plays as the foundation award is the extent to which undergraduates who received federal needbased student aid from the hea33 were pell recipients data from fy2003 suggest that pell grants alone may not have constituted the primary foundation for these students in fy2003 although nearly twothirds of federal needbased aid recipients received pell grants comparable portion of needbased aid recipients borrowed stafford subsidized loans34 30 continued hea now provides the tuition sensitivity amount this was described earlier and is considered in greater detail in the concluding section of reauthorization issues 31 data for the average coa from consistent source over this time period are not available 32 the percentage of costs covered varies significantly depending upon which pell measure is used the appropriated maximum or average or which set of prices is used tuition fees room and board or just tuition and fees 33 pell grants federal supplemental educational opportunity grants federal perkins loans federal workstudy earnings and stafford subsidized loans 34 further onethird of federal needbased aid recipients secured stafford unsubsidized continued crs23 these data certainly raise questions about the foundation role intended for the pell grant program the extent to which needbased aid recipients borrowed stafford loans whether subsidized or unsubsidized is troubling to policymakers and analysts who believe that borrowing imposes burden on lowincome families that may adversely affect students enrollment patterns35 another approach to delineating the role of pell grants is to explore the extent to which pell recipients as group relied solely in fy2003 on the grant to meet college charges without having to secure other federal aid particularly loans with their repayment obligation in fy2003 for just 158 of pell recipients was that grant their only source of aid as shown in table 8 pell grant recipients participated in other federal student aid programs sometimes at high rate among the federal needbased student aid pell recipients were most likely to also be borrowing stafford subsidized loans over 56 of pell recipients received these loans average amount of 3219 table 8 pell grant recipients participation rates and average awards in other aid programs fy2003 average amount of aid of pell

20032004 npsas the overall price of education has an impact on the extent to which pell recipients secure stafford loans for pell recipients attending public twoyear institutions where the average cost of attendance is lower than at public fouryear institutions and particularly at private fouryear institutions the propensity for borrowing was much less than for pell recipients as whole for fy2003 258 of pell recipients at public twoyear institutions borrowed stafford subsidized loans and 111 borrowed stafford unsubsidized loans 34 continued loans 35 see for example advisory committee on student financial assistance empty promises the myth of college access in america june 2002 pp 1113 crs24 possible reauthorization issues this section provides brief overviews of several issues that may be considered by the congress as it deliberates on the pell grant program there is an overarching question which to some extent links the first three specific issues described below as was delineated earlier there may be some question about whether the pell grant is playing the foundation role intended for it particularly for the neediest students steps to increase the targeting of pell grant assistance to such students may be debated by the congress during this reauthorization process and are part of the initial issues discussed below at various points in the analysis below fy2007 cost estimates of changes to the program are presented and compared to an estimate of the fy2007 cost under current law at 4310 maximum appropriated grant these estimates were made using the pell grant estimation model of the us department of educations budget service36 entitlement the pell grant program is subject to annual appropriations as delineated earlier the authorized maximum award has usually been higher than the maximum set in the appropriations process the last time they both were the same was for fy1979 further given the difficulty in estimating program costs the annual appropriation has in several years been significantly less than what was needed to meet those costs causing shortfalls and leading to reductions in grants borrowing from subsequent years appropriations or supplemental appropriations as result in many years there may be uncertainty among students their families and higher education institutions about the level of support the program will provide one response to these circumstances has been the proposal that the pell grant program be made into an entitlement as consequence its funding would be mandatory this would preclude shortfalls support maximum pell grant at the level set in the authorizing legislation and reduce annual uncertainty about the program advocates of this step may also stress that funding higher maximum pell grants would direct greater funding to the neediest students congress has wrestled with this issue in the past indeed during legislative action on the higher education amendments of 1992 the house and senate education committees approved versions of reauthorized hea that would have made the program an entitlement these provisions were not enacted concerns about the consequences of making the pell grant an entitlement have centered on several issues questions are raised about the cost of doing so for example if the authorized maximum pell grant for fy2005 award year 20052006 36 the ed budget service models version u2008 was utilized for the present analysis 2007 crs does not make official congressional cost estimates of federal programs or legislative proposals that is the responsibility of the congressional budget office estimates of costs and the number and characteristics of recipients included in this report are intended to suggest the relative magnitude and nature of the impact of changes in the pell grant program crs25 of 5800 were to be funded total program costs are likely to be about 198 billion more than 414 increase in the estimated cost of the program minimum grant there has been longstanding interest in ensuring that the pell grant program serves needy students and in maximizing the grant that can be awarded to those students this interest is often heightened by efforts to expand eligibility for the program because as additional presumably higher income students are drawn into the program raising the appropriated maximum grant which would focus greater amounts of funding on the neediest students becomes more costly higher maximum generally means somewhat more aid for all students eligible for assistance further with the recent growth in federal support for middleincome students through the federal income tax system37 concern has been raised about the continued federal commitment to aid for lowincome students38 among the changes to the pell grant program that might be considered in any effort to target the grants more fully on lowincome students and if possible increase the size of their grants39 is raising the minimum grant as has been described under current law the minimum pell grant annual award for any recipient is 400 any applicant eligible for pell grant of at least 200 but less than 400 is awarded the 400 minimum this retention of grantees eligible for between 200 and 399 and the boost in their grants to 400 is identified in this discussion as the minimum grant bump overall any increase in the minimum pell grant will reduce the number of recipients and program costs the impact may actually be more significant with regard to recipients than to program costs based on the estimated consequences for program costs and recipients shown in table 9 it appears that without very large increase in the minimum pell grant what is gained financially by greater targeting on lowincome pell recipients may not be enough to support substantial increase in the appropriated maximum pell grant for remaining eligible students table 9 shows estimates for the impact of three different increases in the minimum pell grant for award year 20072008 400 true 400 minimum without the 200 bump 600 and 800 for all of these estimates the maximum 37 crs report rl31484 higher education tax credits targeting value and

and fred j galloway in financing postsecondary education the federal role october 1995 see httpwwwedgovofficesopeppifinpostsecedbrenemanhtml crs26 appropriated pell grant was fixed at 4310 the level

estimates based on eds budget service pell grant model these selected increases in the minimum annual pell grant have greater impact in percentage terms on the number of recipients than on the total costs of the program this general pattern is not surprising an increase in the pell grant minimum affects those recipients with the smallest grants only those recipients whose current pell grant falls below the new minimum lose eligibility while those with larger grants are unaffected thus for example establishing true 400 minimum bump decreases program costs by at most 400 per recipient losing eligibility40 raising the minimum grant by more substantial amounts will lead to proportionately greater reductions in program costs although more recipients will be affected and will lose larger grants academic merit the pell grant program does not currently have any eligibility requirement based on academic merit in period of increasing federal interest in improving student outcomes at all levels of education and holding recipients of federal funds accountable for academic improvement the congress may consider meritbased proposals for the pell grant program during the hea reauthorization at present students have to maintain satisfactory progress in order to continue to receive pell grant satisfactory progress is defined by participating institutions and is often viewed as minimal academic standard proposals to strengthen the academic standards supported by the program or introduce academic merit to the program may take the form of raising the academic performance requirements that students must meet in order to receive pell grant after the initial year of eligibility providing additional pell grant assistance to students who demonstrate high levels of academic performance precluding the use of pell grant funding to support any 40 under nobump 400 minimum the actual decrease from current law may be less than 400 for some current recipients losing eligibility this may arise in part because pell grants must be paid out to recipients in installments over the academic year as consequence change in enrollment status may lead to receipt of total pell grant funding of less than 400 for example student enrolled fulltime for the fall semester and eligible for the minimum award of 400 could receive an initial payment of 200 for the first semester if he or she did not enroll for the second semester the second payment is not made and the total pell aid received would be 200 crs27 form of remedial education41 or limiting the number of years in which pell grant assistance can be received to accelerate program completion issues raised by such proposals include concern about their disproportionate impact on needy students who must rely on the pell grant to meet college costs as consequence attention may be directed to the relationship between pelllinked academic accountability if any and other accountability provisions that the congress might consider for the hea and the higher education community in general further if the current program is retained but new funding is directed to needy students meeting academic merit requirements concerns may be raised about the impact on funding for the basic pell grant42 41 currently student may receive federal financial assistance for up to years worth of remedial education student cannot receive aid if he or she is enrolled in program composed solely of remedial work or if the remedial course work is required for admission to an eligible program 42 congress has chosen not to fund the academic achievement incentive scholarships authorized by the higher education amendments of 1998 which would have doubled the amount of pell assistance provided to eligible incoming higher education students
