nearshore waters where most seafood was cau ght however as fishing techniques improved fishermen ventured farther ffshore before the 1950s the federal government assumed limited re sponsibility for marine fish eries responding primarily to international fishery concerns and treaties by enacting implementing legislation for treaties eg the northe rn pacific halibut act in 1937 as well as to interstate fishery conflicts by consenting to interstate fishery compacts eg the pacific marine fisheries compact in 1947 in the late 1940s and ear ly 1950s several latin american nations proclaime d marine jurisdictions extending 200 miles offshore this action was denounced by those within the united states and other distantwater fishing nations who sought to preser ve access for farranging fishing vessels beginning in the 1950s atlantic and 1960s pacific increasing numbers of foreign fishing vessels steamed into us offshore waters to catch the substantially unexploited seafood resources since the united states then claimed only 3mile jurisdiction in 1964 pl 88308 prohibited fi shing by foreignflag vessels within 3 miles of the coast in 1966 pl 89658 pr oclaimed an expanded 12mile

for unilateral us action the enactment of the fishery conser vation and manageme nt act fcma in 1976 later renamed the magnuson fishery conservation and ma nagement act and more recently the magnusonstevens fish ery conservation and management act msfcma 16 usc 1801 et seq1 ushered in new era of federal marine fishery management the fcma was signed into law on april 13 1976 after several years of debate on march 1 1977 marine fishery resources within 200 miles of all us coasts but outside stat jurisdiction came under federal jurisdiction and an entirely new multifaceted regional management system began allocating fishing rights with priority given to domestic enterprise primary federal management authority was vested in the national marine fisheries service nmfs also popularly referred to as noaa fisheries within the national oceanic and atmospheri c administration noaa of the us department of commerce2 the 200mile fishery conser vation zone was superseded by an exclusive economic zone eez proclaimed by president reagan on march 10 1983 presidential proclamation 5030 eight regional fishery ma nagement councils were created by the fcma3 council members are appointed by the secretary of commerce from lists of candidates knowledgeable of fi shery resources provided by coastal state governors4 the councils prepare fishery management pl ans fmps for those fisheries that they determine require active federal manageme nt after public hearings revised fmps are submitted to the secretary of commerce for approval approved plans are implemented through regulations published in the federal register together these councils and nmfs have deve loped and implemented 40 fmps for various fish and shellfish resources with 9 dditional plans in various stages of development some plans are created for an individual species or few related ones eg fmps for red drum by the south atlantic council and for shrimp by the gulf of mexico council others are developed for larger species assemblages inhabiting similar habitats eg fmps for gulf of alaska groundfish by th north pacific counc il and for reef fish by the gulf of mexico council many of the implemented plans have been amended one over 30 times and three have been developed and implemented jointly by two or more councils the msfc ma was last reauthorized in 1996 by pl 104297 the sustainable fisheries

allocations as domestic fishing and processing industries ex panded foreign catch from the us eez declined from about 38 billion pounds in 1977 to zero since 1992 commensurate with the decline of foreign catch domestic offshore catch in federal waters increased dramatically from about 16 billion pounds 1977 to more than 63 billion pounds total us and foreign offshore fishery landings fro m the

background prior to the 109th congress the msfcma was last reauthorized in 1996 by pl 104297 the sustainabl fisheries act authorization for appropriations expired on september 30 1999 the 1996 amendments established fish conservation initiatives directing nmfs and re gional councils to protect essential fish habitat minimize incidental fish bycatch and restore overfished stocks in addition host of modifications to re gional council manageme nt procedures and federal management policy were enacted while nmfs sought to implement the 1996 amendments13 fishing industry and environmen tal groups criticized nmfs and regional council imple mentation efforts while environmental groups have expressed concerns that nmfs and regiona l councils have not been as responsive as needed on conservation measures fishing industry representatives are concerned that too stringent an application of conservation measures may cripple commercial fishing and bankrupt many fishermen key issue in the reauthorization debate in the 109th congress was achieving balance between c onserving fish and maintaining viable commercial fishing industry congressional action at issue for the 109th congress

mammal protection act mmpa in 1972 while some critics assert that the mmpa is scientifically irra tional because it identifies one group of organisms for special protection unrelated to their abundance or ecological role supporters note that this act has accomplished much by way of promoting research and increased understanding of mari ne life as well as encouraging attention to incidental bycatch mortalities of marine life by the commercial fishing and other maritime industries the act established moratorium on the taking of marine mammals in us waters and by us nationals on the high s eas the act also established moratorium on importing marine mammals and marine mammal products into the united states this act protected marine mammals from clubbing mutilation poisoning capture in nets and other human actions that lead to extinction it also expressly authorized the secretary of commerce and the secretary of the interior to issue permits for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33459crs23 taking of marine mammals for certain pur poses such as scientific research and public display under the act the secretary of commer ce acting through nmfs is

walruses sea and marine otters polar bears manatees and dugongs this division of authority derives from agency responsibilities as they existed when the mmpa was enacted title ii of the act established an independent marine mammal commission mmc and its committee of scientific advisors on marine mammals to oversee and recommend actions necessary to meet the requirements of the act prior to passage of the mmpa states were responsible for marine mammal management on lands and in waters under their jurisdiction the mmpa shifted marine mammal management authority to the federal government it provides however that management authority on sp eciesbyspecies basis could be returned to states that adopt conservation and ma nagement programs consistent with the purposes and policies of the act it also provides that the moratorium on taking can be waived for specific purposes if the taking will not disadvantage the affected species or population permits may be issued to take or import any marine mammal species including depleted species for scien tific research or to enhance the survival or recovery of the species or stock the mmpa allows us citizens to apply for and obtain authorization for taking small numbers of mammals incidental to activities other than commercial fishing eg offshore oil and gas exploration and development if the taking would have only negligible impact on any marine mammal species or stock provided that monitoring requirements and other conditions are met the acts moratorium on taking does not apply to any native american indian aleut or eskimo who resides in alaska near the coast of the north pacific or arctic ocean if such taking is for subsistence purposes or for creating and selling authentic native articles of handicr afts and clothing and is not done wastefully the act also authorizes the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations in 1988 most us co mmercial fish harvesters were exempted from otherwise applicable rulemaking and permit requirements for fiveyear period pending development of an improved system to govern the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations this exemption expired at the end of fy1993 and was extended several time s until new provisions were enacted in 1994 by pl 103 238 which reauthorized the mmpa through fy1999 the eastern tropical pacific tuna fishery was excluded from the incidental take regimes enacted in 1988 and 1994 in stead the taking of marine mammals incidental to that fishery is governed by separate
