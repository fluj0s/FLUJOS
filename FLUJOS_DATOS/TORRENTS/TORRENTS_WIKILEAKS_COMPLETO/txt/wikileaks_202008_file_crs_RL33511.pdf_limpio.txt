the strong incentives for joint industryuniversity research that foreign governments provide4 ombs historical trend data indicate that in constant dollar terms federal rd funding declined from about 18 of total federal discretionary outlays in fy1965 to about 16 today in part because of economic pressures and budgetary caps during the years fy1991 to fy2002 federal rd fundi ng was below the

that had been ra ised about the declines in federal rd funding have not abated b ecause of return to deficit spending and likely future reductions in discretionary rd spending as constrained federal

notion that basic research knowledge leads to technological innovati on as crucial determinant of economic growth because of the lack of credible data and disagreement among experts policymakers do not know exactly how much increased federal research support would enhance growth and which r d fields or programs warrant funding in order to promote technological innovation10 as result some say that federal policy for industrial innovation and its lik ely byproduct economic growth should focus more on improving the climate for i ndustrial rd such as by tax incentives altered regulatory policies and wider liability protections the benefits of federal rd investments are likely to be discussed in the context of longterm economic projections of deficits decreasing outyear federal rd budgets and reductions in domestic di scretionary spending there are other related issues for instance will federal state and i ndustrial policies to increase support for academic research but ofte n

funding in some areas as evidenced by in itiatives in california and other states to fund stem cell research and biotechnology rd12 other issues of debate focus on diversifying priorities for fiel ds of support there are also issues of organizing the government to fund and generate re search knowledge modifying funding mechanisms and enhancing accountability for federal rd investments for instance
