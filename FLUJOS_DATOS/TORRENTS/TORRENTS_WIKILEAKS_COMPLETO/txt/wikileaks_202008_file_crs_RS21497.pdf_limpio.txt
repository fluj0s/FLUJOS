miller janice rubin legislative attorney american law division summary in kentucky assn of health plans inc v miller1 the supreme court ruled that kentuckys any willing provider statutes which mandate that health plans and health insurers may not exclude from their networks any healthcare providers that agree to the plans participation terms are not preempted by erisa as statutes that regulate and are specifically directed toward the insura nce industry they are exempted from such preemption by the savings clause in erisa which precludes preemption for state laws that regulate insurance banking or securities rejecting plaintiffs arguments grounded in case law interpreting the mc carranferguson acts antitrust exemption for the business of insuran ce that the kentucky ws because they also reach healthcare providers are not specifically di rected toward insurers and do not regulate insurance practices the court reconsidered and rejected prior judicial reliance upon mccarranferguson case law as guide to interpreting erisas applicability to and preemption of state laws purporting to deal with insurance the court emphasizes the distinction between the conduct of private parties that is the focus of mccarran ferguson interpretation and the state laws that are the subject of the current litigation to conclude that our use of the mccarra nferguson case law in the erisa context has misdirected attention failed to provide clear guidance to th lower federal courts and added little to the relevant analysis2 kentucky has enacted statutory provisions that prohibit health insurers from discriminating against any health providers who are willing to abide by health plans participation terms socalled any willing provider statutes3 erisa employee retirement income security ac t of

treatment of the mccarranferguson exemption and its background see crs report 90212 the mccarranferguson acts exemption of the business of insurance from federal antitrust law may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan4 state laws that regulate inter alia insurance are not however preempted5 the mccarranferguson act exempts the business of insurance from the federal an titrust laws to the extent that nothing in such business constitutes boycott6 thus leaving insurance regulation predominantly to the states7 petitioner health plans in kentucky assn of health plans inc v miller argued to the supreme court that because the kentucky statutes required actions not encompassed in the mccarran ferguson business of insurance exemption they did not qualify for erisas nonpreempti on treatment the court took the opportunity to clarify the difference between the two federal stat utes and announced that it would longer rely upon case law interpreting the mccarran ferguson exemption in deciding whether the erisa savings clause would protect challenged state laws during the more than 50 years of its existence the applicability of mccarran ferguson has been interpreted in series of decisions clarifying the exemption culminating in 1979 with the courts opinion in group life ins co v royal drug8 synthesized in union labor life ins co v pireno 9 i n pireno the supreme court restated the three factors court must find in order to determine that practice constitutes the business of insurance and qualifies fo r the mccarranferguson exemption it must have the effect of transferring or spreading policyholders risk it must constitute an integral part of the policy relationship between the insured and the insurer and it must be limited to entities within the insurance industry10 the pireno court had also noted that even express exemptions from the antitrust laws must be construed narrowly and the kentucky assn of health plans court thus agrees with petitioners argument that the challenged any willing provider statutes probably would not under royal drug and pireno be entitled to the mccarranferguson exemption because they address entities both within and outside the insurance industry but the savings clause in erisa the court notes unlike the mccarranferguson exemption is not limited to the business of insurance and the health plans cannot prevail upon the court to allow erisa to preempt the kentucky statutes whether or nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21497crs3 11 538 us at 338 12 id at 539540 emphasis in original the court had noted previously that not all state laws directed at the insurance industry would necessa rily pass erisa savingsclause muster giving as an example of one that would not law manda ting that insurance comp anies pay their janitors twice the minimum wage even though such statute would undoubtedly constitute prerequisite to an entitys ability to engage in the business of insurance it would not affect the traditional riskpooling arrangements between an insurer and insuredan hmos contracts with providers cons titute the business of insurance under royal drug is beside the point11 we believe that our use of the mccarranferguson case law in the erisa context has misdirected attention failed to provide clea r guidance to lower federal courts and as this case demonstrates added little to the relevant analysis that is unsurprising since the statutory language of erisas savings clause differs substantially from that of the mccarranferguson act rather than concerning itself as does mccarran ferguson with whether certain practices constitute the business of insurance or whether state law was enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance the erisa clause asks merely whether state law is law which regulates insurance what is more the mccarranferguson factors were developed in cases that characterized conduct by private actors not state laws12 because the two statutes are worded di fferently and serve different purposes therefore the court finds that it can long er without creating dditional confusion and disagreement among participants in the judicial system utilize the case law interpreting the mccarranferguson act to inform decisions concerning the applicability of the savings clause of erisa
