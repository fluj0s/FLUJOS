6211c15 shspec213 clearing technology we are pretty well there technologically although things can still be sorted out and neatened up more data keeps appearing of course when you are on top of the mountain you can see alternate routes up just dont forget the way you got there and could get others up one reason you dont like to see long goals lists is that you dont like having to tiger drill every goal it takes an average of minute per goal even when the case is running well if the case is not wellprepared the pc will have persistent dirty needle we used to call this the pcs needle pattern it means that ruds are out and it is not ok this dirty needle that you see on goals lists wont clean up with midruds persistent dirty needle and dirty read an instant read that goes bzzzt on the needle are not the same thing if ruds are in and the pc is wellprepared dirty needle means the list is incomplete or you could have listed from the wrong question eg the wrong prehav question actually if you use the right question and the item is on the list even if it is the pcs first list when you null it the dirty needle if any disappears after pc is prepared the only reason thereafter that dirty needle occurs and midruds dont handle it is that the list is not complete the item is the missed withhold that dirties the needle therefore assuming prepared pc there are two variables that cause dirty needle on nulling 1 wrong question 2 list incomplete this makes it little more difficult you may have to use trial and error to discover what it is details on assessing goals there is new experimental process you can assess the long list of goals then only tiger drill the ones that stay in after the single assessment the pc should let the auditor know if pain turns on pain goes deeper than the meter and it may indicate the presence of the item when felt or few items earlier on the list you can get the pc to list goals from terminals and oppterms using the commands what goals would terminal have and if you were oppterm what goal of yours would be impossible to achieve just having the pc write out goals list is very therapeutic even on raw meat reading something once has minimal restimulation beyond three times you have started running process so you can go over goals list once and the only thing hot enough to give the pc somatics will be the goal so watch for the somatic while on that assessment another method of goals finding is known as the prepcheck you will get an early mest clear with enough use of the method described in hcob 21mar62 prepchecking data when to do what lot of people sit around not looking they do not look that is their motto problem that has shown up is that after two or three problems intensives the pc keeps saying that such and such is his goal and he wants to know what to do about it in other words you tiger drill the pc until his goal reads the vital part is to assess the right problem if you run the right one smoothly run it dont q and keep ruds in the pc will tend to go mest clear and the goal floats into view it could take four or five problems intensives this would be very simple way to do it it may not work on all oases maybe if we added routine 2 button or two to the problems intensives using roll your own prehav see pp 333334 above against problems intensive we might find the goal this way the only thing wrong with problems intensive is to find truly selfdetermined change on the queen elizabeth reg thorpe was auditing lrh and lrh only found two real selfdetermined changes this lifetime so we can assume that most pcs are answering fallaciously we should realize that there is trick built into the problems intensive you get the pc to give you change that he believes to have been selfdetermined then you find the prior confusion and the determination for that change so there is probably something wrong with the question there shouldnt be trick to it you should just use change not selfdetermined change we formerly asked for selfdetermined changes so as not to have him give engrams however the prepcheck buttons are powerful enough to run the pc through engrams he wont get stuck in an engram anyway if he doesnt have missed withhold that is what sometimes makes pcs curl up in ball and go into an engram while you are tiger drilling the missed withhold pull the missed withhold and he will come right out of the dramatization the pcs effort to withhold is what pulls him back into the incident because he cant be in pt so you could ask for times you decided to change then the pc doesnt have to tell you lie to answer bad assessment can give you ta so in handling problems intensives keep your eye on the ta you should get ta in the first twenty minutes on the first button if not drop the first change and do new assessment
