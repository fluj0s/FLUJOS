years the interest in alternatives to the nation s commandand control approach to environmental protection has heightened driving this interest are concerns that the current approach is inefficient and excessively costly and that it is ineffective in addressing certain problems such as nonpoint source pollution and global climate change several blueribbon panels have issued reports on environmental protection needs for the next century including one headed by former twotime administrator of the environmental protection agency william d ruckelshaus the environmental protection system in transition toward more desirable future 1998 and one by the national academy of public administration environmentcom transforming environmental protection for the 21st century 2000 alternative environmental protection approaches range from proposals that would replace the current system to ones that would supplement it elements of the proposals include enhanced information processes greater reliance on marke t mechanisms devolution of federal responsibilities to state and local decisionmakers and substitution of private markets for public actions the proposals for the most part represent mix of techniques and few are really new most of the ideas have been developed and promoted for some time many have been incorporated to some degree in existing programs this report summarizes briefly number of new approaches grouped under the following categories information approaches to improve the quantity and quality of information to enhance the knowledge base underlying environ mental decisions eg risk assessment costbenefit analysis public sector processes approaches to restructure governmental processes for making environmental decisions eg devolution incentives approaches that emphasize incentives as opposed to regulatory or financial penalties for achieving environmental ends market mechanisms approaches that rely on markets and common law for environmental decisions to the extent possible management principles approaches to inculcate environmental values in public or private managerial decisions eg sustainability each approach seems to have some useful applications each has some disciplinary ideological or institutional proponent but none commands the multi stakeholder commitmen t necessary for truly transforming environmental programs there may be consensus that environmental protection programs could and should be improved but beyond modest iterative steps there is as yet consensus on what that would entail nor on how to achieve those steps critical to this lack of consensus is an apparent split in proponents goals those most focused on improving the efficiency of the current process versus those most focused on finding new ways to address sofar intractable environmental problems such as global climate changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760contents introduction 1 environmental management portfolio of new tools

development of environmental protection programs see frank p grad et environmental control priorities policies and the law new york columbia university press 1971 especially pp 47183 for an assessment of why market mechanisms were not more readily adopted during that early development see steven kelman what price incentives economists and the environment boston auburn house publishing company 1981environmental protection new approaches introduction1 since the early 1970s as us environmental policy burgeoned key debate has centered on the proper approach for federal environmental protection programs the dominant approach of choice has been regulatory one often labeled command and control2 in which government decisionmakers set standards or specify particular actions required of potential or actual polluters however concerns about economic inefficiency the difficulty of addressing certain problems such as nonpoint source pollution and other perceived shortcomings of the regulatory approach have from the beginning stimulated interest in alternative environmental protection approaches that would complement supplement or even replace the regulatory regime in recent years the interest in alternatives has taken on new intensity several reasons explain this interest including first while the regulatory approach has been quite successful in reducing pollution originating from large point sources such as manufacturing facilities and sewage outfalls as well as pollution arising from products with relatively few manufacturers such as automobiles and pesticides it has not been so successful in addressing nonpoint sources of pollution such as agricultural and urban runoff nor small dispersed sources from domestic fireplaces to small businesse s second economic and other analyses have suggested that compared to regulation various alternative approaches may be more economically efficient and may encourage technological developments to reduce pollution among other advantages third the federal command and control approach troubles those concerned about the overall size and power of the federal government fourth some argue that the regulatory approach has become captured by one or another set of stakeholders some environmentalists believe that those being regulated strongly influence the process to the detriment of the environment while others perceive regulators as overly responsive to environmentalists additionally the advent of new millennium has seemed at least to some propitious symbolic opportunity for exploring alternatives for selected initiatives and publications relating to the future of environmental protection see appendix ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs2 numerous alternative environmental protection approaches have been propo sed they range from proposals that would radically reshape the environmental protection approach in the nation to propo sals that would finetune existing programs metaphorically some proposals represent new tool boxes for addressing environmental problems others represent individual new tools generally they are not exclusive that is any environmental protection program would likely draw on mix of the tools moreover their newness lies more in application than conception most of these ideas have been developed and promoted for some time many have been incorporated to some degree in existing programs environmental management portfolio of new tools this report summarizes briefly number of new approaches grouped under the following categories information approaches to improve the quantity and quality of information and to organize it effectively so as to enhance the knowledge base underlying decisions affecting the environment public sector processes approaches to revise or create new governmental structures or processes for making environmental decisions incentives approaches that emphasize incentives as opposed to regulatory or financial penalties for achieving environmental ends market mech anisms approaches that rely on markets and common law for environmental decisions to the extent possible management principles approaches to inculcate environmental values in public and private managerial decisions these categories are not necessarily mutually exclus ive not only may the approaches overlap but also the various tools may serve more than one approach as will become apparent the idea of new approach to environmental management in reality consists of mix of ideas and proposals information this group of approaches centers on enhancing the information available to decisionmakers including administrators legislators environmental managers polluters and the public legislatively establishing information generating processes is not novel of course it is the essence of the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa pl 91190 specif ically the environmental impact statements eis provision of section 102 which requires study of environmental effects of alternative approaches to federal actions initially there was question of whether the eis requirement of nepa applied to environmental regulatory decisions in the end only selected environmental regulatory decisions were made subject to the eis requirement proposals for costbenefit analyses risk assessments and the use of sound science represent continuing pressure for generating andor arranging information to improve decisionmaking within this group of information tools are number that proponents believe will benefit decisionmaking in various wayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs3 3 items in bold are discussed at length in the body of the reportin general sound science3 information focused on improving regulatory decisions in particular risk analysis and costbenefit analysis information focused on improving plannerprogram manager decisions in particular green accounting and materials accountingmaterials management information focused on improving consumervoter decisions in particular the toxic release inventory and energy efficiency ratings often these proposals to enhance information for environmental decisions are proffered with the stated goal of improving regulatory decisio ns certainly this has been the primary impetus for developing costbenefit analysis and risk assessment and for much of the concern about sound science some alternatives to regulation may reduce the need for certain kinds of information for example pollution tax may generate price signal that leads to pollution controls without the government needing information on the specific controls used as might be required by regulation on the other hand the alternative may require its own enhanced information base thus implementing pollution tax could depend on developing particular information in order to set such tax at an appropriate level it should be noted that reliable information may be costly to collect maintain and interpret and may raise issues of confidentiality public sector processes this second set of approaches proposes to improve environmental decisions by restructuring the processes by which those decisions are made in the public sector proposals include environmental federal ism state delegation defederalism devolution civic environmentalism creation of an independent costbenefitrisk assessment review body establishment of regulatory budget these proposals are designed primarily to reform and improve the regulatory process not to replace it incentives third set of approaches seeks to shift the emphasis from government regulatory role with its enforcement and compliance emphasis to supportive role based on incentives to encourage environmentally beneficial actions these include grants loans tax breaks procurement policies technical assistance regulatory waivers beyond compliance if the role of government in regulatory approach is that of the stick then for these alternatives the role of government is to offer carrots inducements can include the provision of information technical and financial support or regulatory relief forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs4 voluntary compliance especially if it goes beyond what might be required typically incentive approaches leave the potential or actual polluter to respond as he or she chooses that is to decide whether to seek out and use assistance or to decide whether the amount of reimbursement for costs of pollutionreducing actions is worth it the conduct of research and development to develop information and techniques might be seen as an indispensable antecedent to governmental incentive programs market mechanisms this set of approaches shifts as much as possible of the decisionmaking on environmental protection away from the government to the private sector market mechanisms by which environmental standards can be met including trading banking and offsetting of pollution rights and the clean development mechanism to allow international trading market signals such as through pollution taxes and liability risks under tort law plus information such as from the toxic release inventory private marketsprivate property including common law remedies trespass protections and free market environmentalism what distinguishes all of these alternatives is the reliance on marketplacetype processes to affect decisions with respect to their environmental implications potential or actual polluter can decide what action is best given his or her circumstances based on emission allowances eg in banki ngtrading program cost signals eg from pollution tax liability from imposed risks eg from harm resulting from waste disposal practices or liability from violating private property rights eg when pollution crosses property lines for these alternatives the role of government lies primarily in setting the rules and boundaries on the market andor establishing the courts and rules of evidence for determining legal redress in contrast to the regulatory approach the governme nt does relatively less specifying of environmental requirements that designated sources would have to meet although standardssetting role may be maintained management principles fifth group of approaches relies on defining management processes or values that proponents believe would result in good environmental outcomes sustainability precautionary principle ecosystem management environmental management systems pollution prevention certification good management practices where the privatizing approach would affect decisions concerning the environment by modifying market signals the management process approach propo ses to affect decisions by promoting and reinforcing environmentally oriented values generallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs5 4 see robert w hahn the impact of economics on environment policy journal of environmental economics and management 39 may 2000 375399 5 see for example the conclusion of rena i steinzor the corruption of civic environmentalism environmental law reporter v xxx 10 oct 2000 10921 there can be little doubt that civic environmentalism will be more expensive alternative than the regulatory system if it is carried out in accordance with the civic environmentalists stated goals gathering and organizing the information necessary to impose effective continuedgood management approaches have entailed moral suasion sometimes backed with incentives they are often seen as voluntary alterna tive to regulatory mandates key issue is who can and should define such standards typical options include governmental bodies international federal state local professional societies and private sector consortia experience suggests that translating general values of environmental protection into practical decisionmaking is not always easy however in regulatory setting incentives may be contingent on complying with the standards in other contexts compliance may be largely or entirely voluntary selecting and implementing new approaches what is striking about these propo sals for complementing supplementing or replacing environmental regulation is how few of them are really new and how even fewer represent radically new approaches in part this may simply reflect the truth that there is nothing new under the sun but even more it may reflect the fact the environmental protection system that has grown up over the past 40 years in the us while dominated by federal regulatory approach consists of complex multifaceted and interlocking institutions laws regulations and programs involving all levels of government some aspects of virtually every approach proposed have found at least some niche for trial and some are in fact widely accepted as practical for particular applications for example the market approach of the acid rain program under the clean air act is widely viewed as greatly successful and as potential model for additional programs but it is not widely viewed as model for comprehensively replacing the existing environmental regulatory regimen likewise the toxic release inventory is widely viewed as greatly successful information mechanism but whether it should be expanded is highly contentious for those proposing different environmental protection approaches the quest for alternatives is often driven by conviction that the existing system is piecemeal unduly complex inefficient and too costly implicitly this view suggests that new approach would be simpler neater more efficient and hence less costly and surely more costeffective this search for more efficient less costly approaches has focused on market alternatives because traditional economic analysis suggests that marketbased alternatives are usually more efficient however empirically the relative efficiencies may not always be clearcut4 moreover while the ideas for new alternatives to regulation have attracted much attention and considerable theoretical analysis assessments of the actual costs to develop and implement them are often lacking even where alternatives may in the long run save money for example in private sector compliance costs they may require substantial upfront investments often by government at some level5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs6 5 continued performancebased standards will be very expensive as will the financial support that should be provided to level the playing field for local groups this then brings us to what is in many ways the ultimate dilemma as long as we are in the throes of denying that reinvention will cost money we will not end up with reinvention as advocated 6 the environmental protection system in transition toward more desirable future washington dc center for strategic and international studies 1998 pp 3 5 4 7 ibid p viii 8 ibid in the end virtually all the environmental stakeholders originally participating in the e4e process dropped out one of the main reasons was that they felt the process was failing to address continuing and emerging environmental problems 9 published by the national academy of public administration 2000 two earlier reports by the academy were setting priorities getting results new direction for epa and resolving the paradow of environmental protection an agenda for congress epa and the states these reports were funded by congress through appropriations to epaone recent effort to examine program and policy alternatives was the enterprise for the environment e4e project headed by former epa administrator william ruckelshaus basically the e4e project concluded that there was single new environmental protection approach rather the participants concluded that the existing system must be improved through an iterative deliberate stepbystep process that involves better information flexibility bestavailable scientific and economic information and broad set of policy tools6 as ruckelshaus said in his preface none of us were so certain that we knew how to construct the new system that we were willing to recommend its immediate adoption we recognized that lot of care and adaptive management will be needed along the way thus we were led to recommend steppingstone approach one that allows us to move carefully and systematically from where we are today to where we want to go7 further impetus for the quest for new approach arises from the recognition that the present system seems illequipped to deal with some important environmental problems some of long standing concern like nonpoint source pollution others more newly recognized such as global climate change these problems have proved extremely difficult especially where they involve individual behaviors on the one hand and where they involve global actions on the other the e4e project concluded that tackling these issues was beyond its capabilities8 second major effort to examine program and policy alternatives was series of studies by the national academy of public administration napa culminating in report environmentgov transforming envirionmental prote ction for the 21st century9 in many respects the napa report comes to similar conclusions as the e4e project not so surprisingly as ruckelshaus was on the panel that prepared it the report begins by defining three highpriority environmental protection problems for which the existing regulatory system is proving inadequate and for which the report recommends innovative alternative approaches these three problems are httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs7 10 napa commissioned 17 research papers relating to environmental protection innovation see appendix of environmentcom 11 world commission on environment and devel opment our common future oxford oxford university press 1987nutrient pollution of waters mainly from nonpoint sources dispersed sources of groundlevel ozone and smog and global climate change the napa report directly discusses the need for statutory changes particularly to allow innovation to increase flexibility among mediafocused programs and to develop better information on environmental quality the report analyzes the successes and failures of efforts to make environmental protection programs more efficient and effective10 it assessed the respective roles of all levels of government business and industry the public and the congress the report concludes that the nation will continue to need strong national environmental regulatory agency that the agency needs both to adopt innovations to achieve more efficient environmental protection and to take leadership role in developing alternatives especially market mechanisms and in mobilizing public and congressional support for them and that the federal government needs to be leader in providing credible authoritative environmental information while e4e and the napa report focus on environmental protection the development of the concept sustainability originating in global concerns subsumes environmental protection issues within broader framework of longterm resource management the term sustainable development emerged in its current form in 1987 in the final report of the united nations world commission on environment and development wced11 the definition most widely quoted in the wced report is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs the importance of the concept is that traditional economic analysis often treats growth in economic activity without taking into account possible deterioration of the resource base sustainability analysis focuses on the ability of resources to sustain economic activity over the longrun in this context pollution becomes viewed as degrader of the resource base finally concerns about the federal role itself can drive the search for new environmental protection approach for some the federal government is simply too big and too powerful they would cut down the federal environmental role typically relying on state programs the marketplace andor tort and common law to resolve environmental problems for some others the federal regulatory process has been captured by one or another set of stakeholders for some the polluters for others environmentalis ts their response often involves radical restructuring not just of environmental protection programs but of all governing institutions the existing system is embedded in law institutions and expectations its inertia must be overcome to accomplish change modification or even improvement overall while each approach could contribute to protecting the environment none seems to command an essential breadth of political and technical respect to be seen as ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs8 12 see however the works of stephan schmidheiny eg financing change the financial community ecoefficiency and sustainable development cambridge mass mit press 1996single viable new direction for the 21st century each approach seems to have some useful application each has some disciplinary ideological or institutional proponent indeed many of the approaches have become virtually inseparable from the institutions andor group of individuals promoting them while many have contributed to the conceptual development of alternative approaches the largest share has come from the work of academics and think tanks institutions involved in international development issues have also contributed such as the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd business and industry interests have more commonly reacted to regulatory issues than taken the lead in conceptualizing new approaches12 environmental and health public interest groups have more commonly focused on the need to address environmental problems than on the development of new approaches the white houses council on environmental quality dynamic force in environmental policy development in the early 1970s has been allowed to atrophy and the environmental protection agency whose administrator the napa report suggests might spearh ead the transformation of environmental policy in the 21st century has tended to focus on finetuning the existing system indeed it was congress through the appropriations process that directed the agency to contract with napa to prepare the analyses that led to environmentcom transforming environmental protection for the 21st century what it would take to prompt additional innovation is the question it could be crisis perhaps critical environmental threat for which regulation seems powerless or some fundamental environmental regulatory mistake that threatens economic disaster alternatively it might be as the napa report urges sustained initiative by the future head of epa the new president andor the congress absent crisis or this kind of initiative it is hard to see how the regulatory approach will be supplanted generally until more comprehensive interdisciplinary multistakeholder commitment to some alternative emerges that indeed would seem to be the final lesson of the e4e and the napa projects there may be consensus that environmental protection programs could and shoul d be improved but beyond modest iterative steps there is as yet consensus on what that would entail nor on how to achieve those steps building toward that consensus would appear to be the next neces sary step if environmental policy is to be transformed inhibiting the formation of consensus is split in the way proponents tend to see new approaches for some they are primarily ways to solve the inefficiencies of the existing regulatory problem for others they are primarily ways to address unresolved or new environmental problems those focused on inefficiency fear that expanding environmental protections to new problems would make the burdens of compliance worse while those focused on environmental insults fear that efforts to reduce inefficiencies woul d be accomplished by retreating from environmental protections and ignoring new problems these divergent motiveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs9 13 prepared by michael simpson specialist in life sciences and john blodgett deputy assistant director resources science and industry divisioninhibit joint recognition of opportunities for new approaches to contribute both to efficiency and to effectiveness selected new approaches to environmental protection the remainder of this report consists of brief introductions to selected new approaches to environmental protection each identifies tool or set of related tools describes its basic characteristics notes pros and cons associated with the tool provides some background summarizes current devel opments and concludes with list of readings for further research these introductions are necessarily brief and incomplete their purpose is to expose the reader to these alternatives and to provide sources through which the reader can pursue ideas that he or she finds promising information making environmental decisions requires an understanding of the problem at hand and the ability to predict outcomes from alternative actions common criticisms of the existing regulatory approach to environmental management are that decisionmakers may lack sufficient reliable infor mation to make sound decision that they may rely on invalid data or findings or selectively choose only data supporting preferred outcomes ie junk science or that they may rely overmuch on nontechnical determinants at the expense of sound scientific information presumption that sufficient robust information will be brought to bear objectively on environmental decisions underlies all conceptions of an improved or alternative appro ach what this presumption means in general is often subsumed in calls for sound science particular applications include risk analysis and costbenefit analysis among other methods of generating and organizing information sound science13 the idea of sound science encompasses at least two parts of the policy decisionmaking process the first part is establishing the technical knowledge underlying the issue and assessing possible solutions this involves many activities including development validation and application of research methods environmental monitoring epidemiological studies data collection storage and evaluation laboratory experiments integration of disciplinary knowledge and assessment of the robustness of the data experimental results and interpretive findings the second part of scienceinpolicy is applying the scientific understanding to the policy issue at this intersection of science and policy of scientists and decisionmakers the question about the science moves from what do we know to what do these findings mean in terms of the policy options faced by the decisionmaker to illustrate science can address the question at 95 confidence level what is the noeffect level of arsenic in drinking water the policy question might be what level of exposure to arsenic in drinking water will we consider safe or scientifically what do we know about the effects of emissionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs10 of mercury from fossil fuel combustion where the policy question might be should emissions of mercury be regulated while sound science may necessarily underlie good policy decision it is not sufficient statutory and administrative requirements and social and cultural values are also determinative validating and applying science because policy issues by definition involve conflicting viewpoints both the validity of the science base as well as its interpretation may be challenged scientists have developed processes for ensuring robust results that is scientific information that is widely perceived as reliable crucial components of these processes include publication of both data and results so experiments can be independently repeated to verify results and peer review through which colleagues assess and at times challenge findings and interpretations science is not static new observations and understandings may raise questions about the findings of earlier studies and peer review and the selfcorrecting nature of science help ensure that scienti fic knowledge is updated to reflect the most current and widelyaccepted thinking in the scientific community thus scientific knowledge is always subject to some degree of uncertainty especially in frontier areas such as ecology and the environment even widely agreedupon scientific findings may be accompanied by loose ends incomplete data as well as some data that do not fit uncertainties probabilistic findings ranges in results incomplete studies and not infrequently some contradictory findings and even an occasional reputable scientist who contends in favor of an alternative conclusion the policymaker usually not scientist must meld the technical information with the other factors involved in his or her decision even if the science indicates problem it may not indicate solution the epa administrators 1998 decision to set very fine particulate matter pm25 national ambient air quality standard is illustrative while 19 out of 21 members of the clean air scientific advisory committee recommended that epa regulat pm 25 the body fragmented on what level would be appropriate for the standard thus in setting standard the administrator must not only make decisions about the loose ends of the scientific findings but also must incorporate appropriate policy determinants from the statutory guide lines to social ethos claims of junk science can stem both from disagreements concerning decisionmakers handling of uncertainties and any persisting scientific loose ends and from disagreements about the need for and effectiveness of alternative solutions uncertainty perhaps the single biggest challenge to the decisionmaker is deciding when the robustness of the science outweighs remaining uncertainties the question of when enough reliable information is available to act is in the end policy call as an emerging arena of scientific attention environmental issues have regularly been bedeviled by that question notable examples include ddt and its effects on birds pcbs and their persistence in the environment emissions causing acid rain and the hypothesis that chlorofluorocarbons deteriorate stratospheric ozone and it continues at the center of the climate change debate for scientists uncertainty can be an opportu nity for further research for policymakers uncertainty is void that makes assessing options more difficult but more research takes time and during that time further damages may occur this raises the policy question in the face of potential but uncertain hazards should onehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs11 14 generated by controversy over the availability for review of data used in assessing health risks from air pollutiondefer action until better information is at hand or should one act quickly to forestall possible future damages in part the answer depends on the risks and costs involved but there are other considerations as well key concern is who will generate the better information should that be government responsibility or should it be the responsibility of the producer of the hazard if identifiable one management principle for dealing with uncertainty is the precautionary principle discussed below federal procedures congress and the administration have developed number of procedures and proce sses to ensure that the scientific underpinnings of environmental health and safety decisions are robust and that policy decisions are sound these include creation of scientific bodies to advise policymakers government wide ones include the federallychartered national academy of sciences national research council and the office of science and technology policy in the executive office of the president individual agencies have their own science advisory bodies for example the science advisory board appointed by the administrator of epa as well as specialized ones such as the clean air scientific advisory committee in epa mandated by the clean air act employment of scientific research expertise within agencies includi ng the department of agriculture food and drug administration and environmental protection agency or in parallel to the administrative body occupational safety and health administration national institute for occupational safety and health statutory andor administrative requirements for incorporating science in policymaking decisions for example the criteria document review process spelled out in the clean air act plus statutory requirement that scientific data generated through federal research dollars be publicly available14 as well as requirements in the administrative procedure act 5 usc 551 et seq for public review of administrative decisions for air quality regulations these are replaced by special administrative review procedures in the clean air act 42 usc 7607d executive order 12866 regulatory planning and review requires that each agency shall base its regulatory decis ions on the best reasonably obtainable scientific technical economic and other information concerning the need for and consequences of the intended regulation sec 1b7 both improvements to environmental regulatory programs and the development of alternative environm ental management techniques presume continued enhancement of the science underpinning decisions how to ensure sound science has attracted congressional attention notably in the context of various controversial epa regulatory actions and most particularly with respect to oversight of epas 1998httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs12 15 eg us congress hous committee on science subcommittee on energy and environment the science behind the environmental protectio n agencys

analysis is tool for setting priorities among programs and evaluating management options in the context of environmental issues risk is defined as the probability of occurrence of particular adverse effect on human health or the environment as result of exposure to hazard which may be chemical some other technology or natural hazard such as flooding risk assessment refers to formal or informal procedure produ cing quantitative estimate of environmental risk for example risk assessment is often used to estimate the expected rate of illness or death in population exposed to hazardous chemical risk analysis is used more broadly to include quantitative and qualitative evaluation of all relevant attributes of environmental hazards risks adverse effects events and conditions that lead to or modify adverse effects and populations or environments that influence or experience adverse effects comparative or relative risk analysis and costbenefit analysis are aids to risk management the process of deciding what should be done about hazards for example to reduce risk httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs13 17 the presidentialcongressional commission on risk assessment and risk management framework for environmental health risk management vol 1 and risk assessment and risk management in regulatory decisionmaking vol 2 washington dc 1997 18 setting priorities getting results new direction for the environmental protection agency washington dc national academy of public administration 1995thus risk analysis is tool for risk management and environmental protection agency risk managers increasingly have relied on it to the extent permitted by law in setting priorities across or within program offices epa sometimes has compared risks or risk reduction potential of different regulatory targets in developing regulations epa has used the results of risk analysis to set standards to compare the effectiveness of various control measures and to evaluate risks relative to costs risks avoided ie the difference between risks before and risks after regulation is implemented are the usual measure of benefits for environmental or health and safety regulations reports by the commission on risk assessment and risk management17 and the national academy of public administration18 recommend an expanded role for risk analysis in risk management benefits and costs of risk analysis environmental risk analysis assists decisionmakers by summarizing available data about hazards and potential effects of exposure at its best when reliable data are available scientific understanding is relatively advanced methods are reliable ie when the underlying science is sound and interested stakeholders are involved in the process risk analysis can facilitate decisions quantified robust information about alternative regulatory strategies and their potential consequences implementation and compliance costs risks avoided and other benefits help policymakers and the general public set priorities allocate resources assess options and evaluate existing federal laws and programs also it is critical component of costbenefit analysis risk assessment is not always at its best however the scientific understanding of risk may be undeveloped data incomplete and experiments unfruitful practitioners and stakeholders may disagree on methods and interpretations ensuring that the underlying science for risk assessment is sound requires resources time effort and money to collect data conduct experiments run computer models analyze findings and write reports agency resources expended on analysis may not be available for enforcement program evaluation or research some costs for example collection of data may be shifted to those regulated for example the clean air act requires large emitters of certain air pollutants to monitor emissions another concern has been that the time required to conduct risk analysis may make difficult the meeting of deadlines for implementation of provis ions of major environmental statutes finally quantitative risk assessment by focusing on the data that do exist and on risks that are best understood may thereby ignore or insufficiently account for other risk parameters for example many environmentalists among others have long been concerned that risk assessment often overweighs cancer endpoints compared to other health risks and it often overweighs health endpoints generally compared to ecological risks executive and legislative interest in risk analysis the potential value of risk assessment has both stimulated research in its development and made its use focushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs14 of policy debates presidents have attempted to encourage more consistent use of risk and economic analysis by federal agencies through executive orders most recently president clintons executive order 12866 requires epa to analyze risks costs and benefits for significant rules including all proposed and final rules expected to cost at least 100 million in year congress also has issued general mandates to federal agencies to encourage greater use of risk and cost benefit analysis the unfunded mandates reform act pl 1044 title ii requires all federal agencies to quant itatively assess benefits including the effect of federal mandate on health safety and the natural environment and to compare benefits to costs for all rules with an expected cost of 100 million or more in year however of 110 economically significant rules promulgated in the first 2 years since enactment 78 did not require assessments due to specific exemptions allowed by the act according to the u s general accounting office the 104th congress added mandates for considering risks to two environmental statutes authorizing epas regulatory activities the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and the safe drinking water act the 105th and 106th congresses have continued working on legislation that would foster and in some cases require more rigorous use of risk assessment by regulatory agencies for example s 746 levintho mpson the regulatory improvement act of 1999 106th congress would codify the requirements for costbenefit analysis and risk assessment for major rules and executive oversight of the rulemaking process among its major provisions the bill would have required regulatory agencies to prepare risk assessment if rule involves risk to health safety or the environment provide for independent peer review of risk assessments and costbenefit analyses for

assessors tend to be drawn from various health and environmental disciplines including epidemiology toxicology statistics public health and others costbenefit analysis is primarily the domain of economicscostbenefit analysis19 costbenefit analysis is one way to organize evaluate and present information about the actions that governments take to improve public wellbeing with respect to environmental and health issues risk assessment which presents information in such terms as morbidity and mortality for humans or animals is prerequisite for costbenefit analysis which places monetary values on attributes of human wellbeing20 and like risk assessment its use can be complicated expensive and controversial as set of procedures to measure the merit of some public sector actions in dollar terms costbenefit analysis is counterpart to privatesector profitability accounting the difference is that most public actions to improve public wellbeing do not have established private markets which generate price information on which to judge their value or benefits to compare the public benefit of such actions to their costs benefits and sometimes costs are indirectly estimate d in dollar terms the objective is to determine the alternative for public action that produces the largest net gain to the society in this case gain is not in terms of private sector profit but rather as an estimated surplus of monetized benefits over estimated costs based on this criterion costbenefit analysis attempts to identify the most economically efficient way of meeting public objective other goals of public management are not focused on in this process but in some cases they may be subsumed in the analysis the debate over costbenefit analysis focuses on its possible value in reducing the perceived economic burden and complexity of traditional regulatory approaches greater use of costbenefit analysi s is part of the broader regulatory reform effort calling for increased flexibility in regulatory approaches and increased accountability and scrutiny of regulatory decisions complexities formal costbenefit analysis often demands costly and sometimes disputed expertise and data done carefully it provides an array of information that can inform the decision process done poorly or taken out of context the results can create false sense of clarity and precision methods data expense and prospects for court challenges on use and abuse are concerns driving debate on how greater use of this tool may figure in regulatory reform the tensions in regulatory reform and the role of costbenefit analysis touch on many complex issues these include scientific capabilities in measuring and characterizing longterm and often uncertain health safety and environmental phenomena agency capacity for collecting and using data methods to characterize positi ve and negative effects of regulations equity in protecting the public against health safety and environmental risks burdens on lower levels of government and the private sector in achieving public goals and fundamental questions of regulatory design such as flexibility and location of implementing and decisionmaking authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs16 the role and application of costbenefit analysis by agencies are important focuses of the evolving process of regulatory reform disagreements typically revolve around the practicality and usefulness of strict application of the tool the conflicts involve more questions of how much and to what end than whether since these techniques are already used by federal agencies to differing degrees in assessing many of their regulatory activities application of costbenefit analysis support and criticism costbenefit can be applied to public actions using varying degrees of formality how far analysts go in trying to compare monetized benefits with costs at one level some believe that the only regulations that should be maintained or adopted are those that clearly pass the costbenefit test namely benefits must demonstrably exceed the costs proponents of this position argue that promulgating only those regulatio ns where benefits outweigh or justify costs presumably in monetary terms can help rationalize the regulatory process and improve priority setting in this view such reform would increase the likelihood that regulations will not place burde ns on businesses and consumers that are out of proportion to gains in health safety or environmental protection such change it is maintained could lead to more systematic consideration of more efficient ways to achieve desirable health safety and environmental protection goals excessive regulations would be minimized eliminating rules and enforcement where goals are ill defined and measurement of costs or benefits is uncertain others argue that costbenefit analysis can be an important and useful exercise in assessing the impacts of regulatory actions but the resources demanded for full and rigorous costbenefit analysis can be excessively costly and time consuming with the result that costbenefit analysis can impede legitimate protection proponents of this position fear that efforts to use costbenefit comparisons for establishing regulatory priorities will end up emphasizing only those aspect s of health safety and environmental protection which can be easily translated to dollar terms such an outcome would weigh heavily against intangib or nonmonetary aspects of health safety and environmental protection which is often what these types of regulations are intended to protect or enhance in the first place in this view the effort to make such comparisons could impede the legitimate government role of protecting and enhancing public wellbeing as practical matter expanding the use of costbenefit analysis would imply committing additional agency resources in research monitoring and analysis finally many argue that costbenefit analysis is an incomplete tool for regulatory impact analysis particularly with respect to nonquantitative values and that related methods of analysis such as risk assessment and costeffectiveness are more appropriate proponents of this view argue that one opposes the use of cost benefit in quantitative or qualitative sense in assessing regulatory impacts in instances where it is feasible however there is wide range of opinion regarding how rigorously the method should be used given that costs and benefits in many instances are so difficult or perhaps impossible to measure even in an approximate way costbenefit analysis despite its widespread application is still developing art much of the policy dispute is really about the rigorous use of costbenefit analysis versus the use of other related methods of regulatory impact assessment such as thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs17 21 see epas webpage for the program http19922318220eeepaeednsfpagesaboutee and especially the

imposed on industry and business state and local governments and consumers and taxpayers have generated concern as tool for identifying those costs and comparing them to environm ental and health

corporate behavior tri is credited by righttoknow advocates with reducing releases of many toxic chemicals from manufacturers by more than 50 on occasion manufacturers also have promoted use of these tools especially as an alternative to federal regulation of emissions or manufacturing practices proponents argue that providing information works with free economic market rather than against it

proposals would constrain the federal regulatoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs20 24 prepared by claudia copeland specialist in resources and environmental policy resources science and industry divisionscope for example by establishing regulato ry budget which would be based on costs imposed but by far the most attention to the federal role has focused on its relation to state and local roles environmental federalism24 giving states more responsibility or larger role in environmental management is one of the oldest new ideas in environmental policymaking and implementation variously termed environmental federalism devolution decentralization defederalization or civic environmentalism all of these terms have been used in recent years the concept involves returning some decisionmaking authority from the federal to state and local governments environmental federalism or devolution or accountable devolution as it has most recently been termed is based in part on returning to intergovernmental relationships that predominated before enactment of todays federal environmental laws in the intervening 30 years however both federal and state environmental programs have evolved considerably notably states have enacted laws and developed management capacity to much greater extent than was the case before 1970 development of the federal role in environmental policy regulation and management of pollution was almost entirely the province of state and local governments before the 1970s states had virtually unlimited discretion to protect local environmental quality yet most failed to act during the late 1960s and early 1970s many environmental concerns previously seen as local issues became federal issues and the proper role of each level of government in implementing policies has been debated continuously since then the primary impetus for the major federal environmental statutes was the perceived need for national response to states inaction by providing minimum level of environmental quality throughout the country historically environmental policymakers justified strong federal role on the basis of several considerations 1 the implications of interstate or transboundary pollution which individual states could not effectively control 2 fear that states competing for economic development will engage in race to the bottom if left to their own devices 3 concern that hodgepodge of separate state regulation will impose financial costs on outofstate producers operating in national markets and 4 belief that administrative efficiency and economies of scale can be achieved by developing complex technical standards at the national level the organizing principle of federal environmental laws is that policy is developed at the national level and programs are implemented at the state level for 30 years federal environmental policy was characterized by commandandcontrol strategies with states acting primarily through system of delegated authority administered by epa issues of daytoday program management often strain the stateepa relationships there have been number of thorny issues which are now driving the agenda for change in intergovernmental relationships in environmenta l policy the most contentious are costs program costs and unfunded federal mandates and federal micromanagement of stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs21 current support for increased state responsibility the numerous advocates of increased state responsibility in environmental management reflect spectrum of views on the issue some see the debate in terms of needing to strengthen the existing epastate partnership while others argue for more complete shifting of responsibilities on one end are those in state agencies governors offices and top levels of epa itself who believe that states should have more discretionary authority flexibility to implement federal laws so that states can address their highest environmental priorities and establish resource allocations based on those priorities concurrently these advocates believe that epa should lighten the burden of oversight where states are willing to take on added responsibility they cite several reasons for changing the epastate relationship and increasing state responsibility first the issue of state capacity to manage programs has changed unlike 30 years ago states today have working environmental programs and the federal gover nment is not forcing states to create programs second relying on traditional commandand contr ol methods derived from nationally uniform requirements is less effective in meeting todays changed environmental protection needs the current generation of environ mental problems ranging from sprawl to nonpoint source pollution to watershed managemen t and pollution impacts from people rather than companies points to the need for state and local governments to wield the policy lever they say and points to the need to move beyond onesizefitsall regulatory approaches established centrally on the other end of the spectrum of environm ental federalism proponents are views represented by some academics and economists who may bring more ideological approach to the debate some argue for example that the commandand control regulator strategy that dominates environmental policy has proved inadequate because it has not set intelligent priorities has squandered resources has discouraged environmentally superior technologies and has imposed unnecessary penalties on innovation and investment they maintain that centralized decisionmaking ignores local preferences for varying levels of environmental quality reduces the ability of citizens to monitor government and stifles experiments with policy options that are alternatives to onesizefitsall the goal of devolution they say is to reverse the rising power of the national government which they see as bloated and ineffecti ve and to return authority to states and individuals some economists view these issues in terms of the implications that alternative divisions of decisionmaking responsibility have on efficiency they are interested in questions such as which level of government might best determine the extent of environmental protection and which is most likely to select the least costly methods of control in many cases they believe the answers will dictate moving the locus of decisionmaking to states and localities between those who are advocating primarily an enhanced federalstate partnership and those seeking more complete shifting of roles are other groups who support many of these arguments including some federal legislators who advance policy and budgetary initiatives to restrict or curtail the federal role and those in industry who want less stringent federal regulation federal role would continue all agree but would be restricted to setting national standards monitoring and enforcing compliance providing technical assistance and addressing transboundary pollution problemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs22 policy literature on this topic has continued to grow with reports and recommendations from number of nonpartisan or stakeholder groups such as the national academy of public administration and the national environmental policy institute as well as advocacy groups eg the american enterprise institute cato institute and the progressive policy institute these studies have advocated and endorsed devolving existing environmental management responsibilities to capable state and local governments to tailor regulatory solutions to local problems and concerns while leaving the federal government to address crossboundary and international issues opposition to increased state responsibility while there is considerable support for environmental federa lism there is significant opposition as well environmentalists in particular who have traditionally supported strong federal role that provides core level of environmental protection for all citizens and level playing field across the country believe that federal programmatic baseline is an important counterbalance to potential state backsliding that could result from devolution for these groups concern persists that state capacity to shoulder the responsibility of devolution is less robust than state regulators say although it is hard to either prove or disprove this assertion given flexibility they say states fail to meet highpriority program requirements such as monitoring permitting and enforcement states may set lax standards in order to lure industry or succumb to pressure by industry to adopt weak standards some environmentalists are concerned that states will shift away from enforcement towards compliance assistance and also reduce public involvement and participation environmental federalism today devolution or environmental federalism is occurring today and the basic issue is one of timing and extent debate continues over the degre of oversight that epa exercises and degrees of responsibility authority and accountability that it gives to states in may 1995 epa and states took major step towards devolution when they entered into commitment to an improved partnership called the national environmental performance partnership system nepps in it epa and states agreed that states should establish their own comprehensive environmental plans and identify environmental priorities national minimum standards will remain but epa will allow more flexible approache s to achieve national goals epa oversight will focus on ensuring that states achieve environmental results not on process as of may 2000 34 states have developed performance partnership agreements with epa under nepps in return for the autonomy and flexibility that states seek all of the advocates of environmental federalism acknowledge that accountability for environmental performance is key thus the source of the phrase often used today to describe these developments accountable devolution accountability is necessary to address concerns of critics such as environmentalists who fear that devolution will lead to disintegration of national programs the largest challenge for epa and states is to build foundation of meaningful indicators for transformed performance based system the success of such system depends on the ability to measure environmental progress in lieu of measuring traditional programmatic outputs such as number of enforcement actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs23 25 prepared by claudia copeland specialist in resources and environmental policy resources science and industry divisionfor further reading see henry r

current environmental management system fails to reward excellent performers truly voluntary initiatives by some businesses that are intended to encourage improved environmental performance such as environmental audits and environmental management systems attract some businesses and industries but participation is limited while businesses enter into such voluntary commitments for various reasons

additional information see httpwwwepagovperformancetrackcommandandcontrol regulation some of this literature explicitly recommends that whatever new systems evolve and develop should include incentives to encourage and reward those whose environmental protect ion performance exceeds basic requirements for example the 1995 report of the national academy of public administration setting priorities getting results recommended that epa support legislation to provide flexibility and accountability to businesses and local governments in exchange for betterthanrequired performance similar theme was expressed in the 1996 report of the aspen institute alternative path which recommended that in the future the united states should utilize two parallel environmental regulatory tracks one would be the existing system an alternative would allow volunteers to propose pilot demonstrations of better ways to achieve environmental progress only projects yielding greater net benefit than expected from existing or anticipated regulations could become pilots but participants would receive regulatory flexibility in order to encourage their environmental protection innovations the concept of providing incentives to encourage beyond compliance environmental performance underlies number of epa s recent regulatory reinvention projects and programs these include the ongoing project xl which was largely based on principles in the alternative path report and seeks to encourage up to 50 sitespecific experiments to achieve better environmental outcomes along with operational flexibility and other benefits the common sense initiative csi which lasted from 1994 to 1998 is related to project xl it sought to remove barriers to innovation by implementing multimedia projects in six specific industrial sectors epas newest regulatory reinvention program called the national environmental performance track was announced in june 2000 epa says it is intended to reward companies which exceed minimum regulatory requirements and take extra steps to reduce and prevent pollu tion including having an operational environmental management system benefits for participants will include national recognition regulatory and administrative flexibility more cooperative relationship with epa reduction in record keeping and reporting requirements and flexibility in meeting certain regulatory requirements26 several states including new jersey massachusetts and minnesota also have adopted regulatory reinvention programs which provide qualifying facilities with flexibility under state andor federal rules in exchange for improved environmental performance the types of incentives appropriate or necessary to encourage beyond compliance environmental performance are varied they range from direct financial incentives eg tax subsidies for installing pollution control equipment to indirect financial incentives such as more rapid permitting less stringent standards or monitoring more flexibility to meet standards or less frequent renewal of permits to public recognition in the form of presidential merit award or epa certificate to better relations with regulators corporate

proponents of providing incentives for beyond compliance performance include business and industry participants who favor the prospect of regulatory flexibility and other benefits and top federal and state environmental officials who view such policies as integral to more efficient performancebased managem ent systems in the future opponents include some environmentalists who criticize policies that potentially would allow companies to sidestep regulatio ns or obtain regulatory relief with guarantee of environmental outcome as with number of other recent environmental management tools there is fundamental conflict between businesss desire for flexibility and simplicity and environmentalists desire for certainty and enforceability as tool of environmental policy incentives for beyond compliance are related to number of other ideas intended to move beyond rigid regulatory strategies and towards performancebased approaches especially use of market incentives management practices and devolution or defederalization unlike most of these other new or newer approaches however beyond compliance incentives lack statutory authority fact that some proponents believe is an obstacle these supporters argue that many companies especially small ones will remain reluctant to innovate because they view the transaction costs as being too high in terms of uncertain rules consensus requirements and unclear benefits at the end of the process at the same time there has been little discussion and there is consensus on how to change statutes to address these kinds of uncertainties

alternative path cleaner cheaper way to protect and enhance the environment washington dc 1996 market mechanisms employing market mechanisms in environmental protection has been an evolving policy approach for certain types of problems since the midseventies such mechanisms have the potential to reduce the compliance costs of some environmental protection actions these cost saving potentials are an important reason that the epa introduced greater flexibility in implementing some clean air act regulations and that congress authorized marketbased approach to acid rain control such mechanismshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs26 28 prepared by john l moore assistant director resources science and industry divisionhave also been authorized in the international treaty dealing with possible future actions to slow global climate change this gradual development of supplements to the command and control regulatory approach in practice has also has been preceded and accompanied by growing body of academic and policy community attention proponents of market based approaches include think tanks academics and some leading environmental advocacy groups they argue that properly structured incentive mechanisms can produce significant reduction in pollution control costs while achieving agreed upon environmental standards pollution trading and pollution taxes28 marketbased mechanisms fall into two distinct groups with many variations in each category the first are trading mechanisms which allow businesses to meet facility regional industrywide or national cap on pollutant by shifting their individual compliance obligations within their business operations or to other businesses subject to the same compliance requirements for the case of trading between companies this mechanism operates when companies with low compliance costs control their pollution beyond what is required by regulation and then sell the excess compliance to compani with high control costs the latter companies are thus relieved of some of their pollution control obligations avoiding costly abatement expenditures the net effect is to concentrate compliance at the points of lowest cost thus reducing overall compliance costs environmental protection is achieved in more economically efficient manner second market mechanism is the explicit taxation of polluting activity in order to include in the cost of good or service the social costs environmental or human health damage that the polluting activity may cause by raising the cost of pollutin g inputs or outputs for businesses or raising the cost for consumers using polluting substances eg gasoline combustion businesses or consumers have an incentive to economize on the polluting activity businesses or consumers can respond as they choose with some paying the higher costs and others making changes that avoid the effects of the tax the combined responses to the cost incentive in theory will result in reduction in the polluting activity to point where further reducti ons by businesses or consumers would cost more than paying the tax or be inconvenient or impractical the potential reduction in pollution depends on the level of the tax this is set in theory based on what is needed to meet targeted reduction in pollution alternately the tax can be set to achieve given level of reduction in the incremental monetized damages caused by the pollutant this assumes that complex environmental and human health values and attributes can be translated to monetary surrogates although widely advocated by economists this incentive mechanism has never been employed in us environmental laws or regulations except as fees or charges intended to raise revenue or cover regulatory administrativ costs such charges typically are low enough not to create incentive effects for reducing pollution levels both trading mechanisms and pollution taxes have defined circumstances in which they have been or could be effective in environmental management httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs27 for trading mechanisms like sulfur allowance trading for acid rain control or the epas netting banking and offset programs for some criteria air pollutants several business and institutional circumstances are necessary for effective implementation these programs are likely to be effective when 1 the pollutant is one where transactions and information costs are low typically when industries have long experience with monitoring and controlling pollutant there are large but fairly set number of possible market participants and there are intermediary institutions to facilitate trading 2 security of long term investments in pollution control by companies is highly certain so that unanticipated future changes do not impede long term planning and financial commitments 3 there are several technically and financially feasible options for reducing pollution among different industry segments fuel switching process changes etc and 4 reductions are sought across broad geographical area for pollutant that does not involve local public health or environm ental effects or alternately within one jurisdiction or facility so that third party impacts are minimized thus the advantages of trading mechanisms are their potential for lowercost implementation of environmental controls in situations where set number of large sources can potentially optimize expenditures on abatement through mutually beneficial exchange of the location of control on the other hand for pollution from diffuse and numerous sources trading mechanisms do not appear very practical given the high transaction and information costs needed for implementation taxation as tool for reducing environmental damage is particularly applicable to problems where pollution is the result of small diffuse and numerous sources in these cases meeting environmental objectives requires an overall reduction in the total consumption or use of pollu ting material or activity but the large number of contributors makes traditional regulation or targeted reductions difficult with population gdp material consumption and waste flows all growing mitigating environmental deterioration may be extremely difficult or impossible to manage without the use of incentives some forms of air and water pollution co 2 generation and traffic congestion are examples where taxation or other price signals could be relevant management tool taxes on polluting substances and activities send signal to consumers and businesses to make short and long term alterations without prescribing how or what to modify the advantages of using this tool are its administrative simplicity the flexibility it gives those affected to respond and its long term effects on innovation and technical and behavioral changes while the theory and logic for using taxes to reduce certain types of environmental deterioration are straightforward this approach meets public as well as policy objections on several fronts first those who would pay such taxes may oppose this approach as being unfair if other types of pollution sources are not being taxed and as diverting monies that could be used for pollution abatement investments second if large sums of money are involved how such revenue is used is critical question some argue for use in environmental programs or recycling through income tax relief but questions of tax base stability arise third agreeing on the appropriate level of pollution tax is problematic due to uncertainty about the exact reductions in pollution that may result finally questions of pollution taxes become involved in broader tax policy issues which complicate practical implementation for further reading

united states experience with economic incentives in environmental pollution control policy private markets and legal actions29 under some circumstances environmental protection can be achieved between privat parties without direct statutory and regulatory involve ment some argue that these tools if used more extensively could avoid the inefficiencies of bureaucratic regulation although critics contend that the circumstances are more narrowly delimited than proponents acknowledge in one case if pollution rights are clearly defined between two parties where one is generating pollution bargaining can lead to an economically efficient reduction in the pollution level in second case tort actions based on injuries suffered due to pollution can result in court rulings that restrict defendants or compensate plaintiffs and polluters will consider the benefits of reducing the threat of liability in accounting for costs of pollution reduction finally in third situation private property rights can be used to protect resources vulnerable to the tragedy of the commons in which common ownership leads to overexploitation as each participant seeks to maximize gain markets in pollution rights in the case of bargaining between private parties the potential for finding an economically efficient reduction exists when clearly traceable pollution source operated by one party is causing verifiable damages or loss to another party under specific and sitedependent circumstance s such private transactions can produce economically efficient environmental protection if the right to discharge pollution is clearly defined or alternately the right to be free of pollution is clearly defined negotiations between the parties can lead to an efficient balance between reducing pollution damages and expenditures to reduce pollution this occurs because either party has an incentive to bargain with the other in the case where the polluter has the rights to discharge wastes the negatively affected party can offer to pay the polluter to reduce discharges to the point that the monetary value of remaining damages is below the cost of additional abatement expenditures to the polluting party on the other hand if the party that potentially would be damaged has the right to be free of pollution the party that needs to pollute in order to operate can negotiate level of compensation in order to find balancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs29 between abatement expenditures and purchasing from the other party the right to discharge some pollution depending on equality in bargaining positions an optimal reduction in pollution would result which party draws the greater benefit from the exchange depe nds on who holds the initial pollution rights this type of situation is an example of what is called the coase theorem after classic article by professor ronald coase in which clear assignment of property rights in theory will lead to an economically efficient reduction in pollution through private party bargainin g this outcome however rests on the assumption of barriers to transa ctions such as imperfect knowledge limited rationality or communications costs it assumes equality of bargaining positions clear and provable linkages between polluter and the injured party minimal transaction costs meaning generally limited number of parties and the absence of potential free riders on the agreements reached between the bargaining parties private legal remedies in the second case where pollution rights are ill defined or custom has implicitly assumed that pollution is accepted as part of economic activity legal remedies sometimes can lead to balance between pollution reduction costs on the one hand and avoided injuries to other parties on the other variety of legal theories may be available to plaintiffs such as nuisance negligence trespass inflictio n of mental distress and strict liability for example under the common law doctrine of nuisance as well as under other legal theories courts can award compensation of injuries or injunctions to parties injured by pollution in situations where there is one polluter and the nature of hardships favors the plaintiffs nuisance remedies can be an effective management tool this assumes that plaintiff has the money time and patience to see the action through class actions also help as hypothetical example if air emissions from factor were causing damage to crops on downwind farms the farmers could seek an injunction and compensatory damages for any losses in the value of their crops court could find any number of ways to address the situation depending on the severity of damages to the crops and the economic conse quences of enjoining further pollution from the factory for example if the plant was the mainstay of the local economy and had already undertaken extensive pollution abatement expenditur and the aggregate damages to crops were small court could find against enjoining the factory from further pollution in this type of situation some state courts have chosen to balance the equities and deny injunctions since the resulting hardships to the defendant outweigh the harm to the plaintiffs however where injunctions are denied sometimes courts have awarded past or ongoing compensatory damages to plaintiffs in general nuisance law has had only limited effectiveness in controlling wide spread pollution in addition to the tendency to balance the equities and deny injunctions other factors have limited nuisance law as an effective tool in controlling widespread pollution one important limitation is the lack of eligibility to sue the common law distinguishes between private and public nuisances where the latter may involve small damages to large numbers of people in cases of public nuisances in general only state attorney general or local prosecutor has been allowed to bring law suit against polluters reluctance by governments to bring suits that would harm local industries has mostly limited the role of injunctive relief though some states now allow individuals to bring suits to mitigate public nuisances

in third situation creating markets for transactions of environmenta l goods may lead to efficient outcomes in pollution control trading programs as discussed above constitute type of environmental market in some cases private parties may act through existing markets to achieve environmental protection ends as for example when the nature conservancy buys private land in order to protect it and its resources or when private landowner sells hunting or fishing rights and thereby has vested interest in maintaining healthy populations of the sport game or fish in other cases governmental intervention may be needed to create the market for an environmental good or service as for example when governmental bodies allow the selling of development rights as way of channeling development from environmental sensitive areas to less sensitive areas or when state and federal governments provide for market transactions of water rights market approaches are being actively debated for allocating water resources30 and certain fisheries31 proponents of what is sometimes called envirocapitalism have cataloged numerous other examples that demonstrate the potential power of environmental markets examples include the fossil rim wildlife center in texas the marketing of paddlefish roe in montana the retirement of salmon quotas by the north atlantic salmon fund and wildlife management in zimbabwe32 how to generalize from the anecdotal successes of environmental markets and from failures of common ownership of resources is not easy however key issue is the original endowment of rights firstintime firstinright effectively legitimizes historical patterns of income and property while changing those rights raises questions of due process for example should fishing rights be vested to those now fishing or should those rights be auctioned to give every one an opportunity of entry in the case of sulfur oxides emission allowances33 existing facilities received

decisions with environmental consequences the managers involved can include not only corporate managers but also managers of public lands and resources individual property owners and in some cases regulatory officials as well the commandandcontrol regulatory system specifies what is to be done or accomplished enhancing information and marke tbased systems presume environmentally protective decisions will follow from neutral competence andor self interested responses to the information or the price and cost signals in contrast the management principles approaches seek to achieve environmental protection goals by redirecting managers criteria for making decisions affecting the environment new information changed costprice signals incentives even regulatory standards may be involved but the key elements of management principles approaches involve first inculcating heightened awareness of environmental protection needs in managers and second providing some criterion or yardstick for decisionma kers to assess the environmental implications of choices if manager can accurately anticipate the consequences of decisions and has accepted environmental values environmentally preferable choices should follow voluntarily crucial difference from regulation management principles approaches themselves range from the relatively abstract such as sustainability to the pragmatic such as best management practices for agricultural tillage and environmental auditshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs32 34 prepared by susa n r fletcher senior analyst in international environmental policy resources science and industry divisionsustainability sustainable development34 the term sustainable development emerged in its current form in 1987 in the final report of the united nations world commission on environment and development wced known as the brundtland commission after its chairman then norwegian prime minister gro harlem brundtland the definition most widely quoted in the wced report is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs in the more detailed treatment of the term the report identified requirements for sustainability to include citizen participation in the political system selfreliant and sustained economic system social system that allows for solutions for tensions from disharmonious development production system that respects the ecological base technological system that continuously searches for new solutions an administrative system that is flexible and has the capacity for selfcorrection and an international system that fosters sustainable patterns of trade and finance summing up these components the wced report stated in its broadest sense the strategy for sustainable development aims to promote harmony among human beings and between humanity and nature popular usage has made sustainable development nearly synonymous in many circles with environmentally compatible development in 1992 following up on the brundtland commission report the united nations conference on environment and development unced popularly known as the earth summit was held in rio janeiro the conference produced the rio declaration on environment and development plus 40chapter action plan called agenda 21 referring to the 21st century agenda 21 posits sustainable development as key to most areas of development and discusses both what individual nations should undertake to achieve it and what the international community should do the rio declaration

into economic theory and understanding35 socalled green accounting is the idea of modifying national accounts such as gross domestic product so that resource depreciation is incorporated however

concept of sustainability has been adopted and integrated into the terminology of development in number of european government efforts38 and in the united states there has been extensive activity particularly at the state and local level around this term in 1993 the president established the presidents council on sustainable development pcsd bringing together highlevel participants from government cabinet secretaries business and industry at the ceo level and non governmental and academic entities usually the heads of these organizations the council formed task forces held extensiv

experience when unrecognized tradeoffs are brought to their attention but arriving at means of achieving all stakeholders goals usually requires some compromises as these compromises are identified

involved significant amount of consciousness raising about the tradeoffs involved in community decision making especially those such as environmental ones which economic development activities often

be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically in this context the proponent of an activity rather than the public should bear the burden of proof42 the

management that has been conceptualized in various ways46 the scientific community has viewed ecosystem management largely as identifying environmental conditions before european settlement of north amer ica and examining how subsequent activities and management have altered ecosystems from these conditions the environmental community has seen ecosystem management as using the scientific information on presettlement conditions to set management goals for restoring or preserving ecological processes and biological diversity the federal land and resource management agencie s have adopted ecosystem management to improve their planning processes both expanding the geographic and ecological scope under consideration and broadening the participation of stakeholders47 the usda forest service has recently revised its planning regulations to include ecological sustainability as way to implement ecosystem management48 ecosystem management is one of several approaches that attempt to expand the historic geographic ecological and participatory aspects of land and resource management other efforts some of which have existed far longer than ecosystem management include watershed management landscape management and multiple use management these approaches are all generally similar in attempting to consider interactions among uses on lands and resources typically on broader geographic scales and over longer time periods than traditional management they differ primarily in their geographic basis ecosystems watersheds landscapes or politically defined management units and their emphasis ecological conditions water supply and quality concerns ecological interactions and land and resource uses background policies to manage resources based on an understanding of the broad environmental and social consequences of decisions have existed for decades multipleuse management for the national forests for example has been required by law since 1960 and arguably was the intent in the original 1897 forest management authority watershed management can be traced easily to the water resources council and river basin commissions authorized in 1965 ecosystem management

issues unced included discussions of the rio declaration principles on environmentally sustainable development adopted agenda 21 an action program to implement the principles and opened for signature two treaties convention on climate change and convention on biological diversity ecosystem management for us federal land and resource management agencies was an approach announced by the bush administration to precede the presidents attendance at the earth summit procon analysis the various views of ecosystem management have both support and opposition the scientific community view of ecosystem management involving expanded historic geographic and ecological informati on is seen as leading to better informed decisions by providing baseline for assessing the results especially cumulative impacts of management efforts however some argue that the sciences have not progressed sufficiently to develop such information and that the cost of such data collection exceeds any improvement in decisions there is also some concern that additional information on the conditions and uses of private lands could be used to regulate those lands constraining the private landowners the environmental community views of ecosystem management largely as goal of preserving or restoring biological diversity and ecological processes proponents often assert that because it is generated by scientific research the information is sciencebased goal for land and resource management they also sometimes argue that the improved information and goal of naturalness for federal lands can clarify the role of the federal government as provider of public goods and social values and private landowners as producers of private goods opponents argue that goal of naturalness is unlikely to be limited to federal lands and is likely to be used to restrict private land uses they also argue that while recreating historically natural conditions might be desirable for providing certain environmental values and processes but is only one of many possible options for land and resource management the federal adoption of ecosystem management has been as an expansion of the planning process part of this expanded planning is developing broader historic and geographic information the forest service and the bureau of land management have conducted ecoregional assessments at relatively broad geographic scales that include private land conditions and uses these agencies contend that greater information at expanded scales could lead to better sense of the possible cumulative impacts of federal decisions while private land information might provide clearer understanding of the appropriate role of federal lands within specific region some oppose such data development however as costly exercise with few real benefits also private landowners are concerned about possible regulation of their lands based on information allegedly collected to improve federal

at the individual level are the least intrusive and least consistent end of the environmental policy spectrum because they rely on the good intentions of individuals thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs40 practices encompass stewardship by landowners and leaseholders as they manage private working lands that provide diverse benefits ranging from producing commodities such as trees and row crops to providing habitat and amenities the most familiar applications of good management practices occur in the context of resource management activities however the essential concept of these practices is that good stewardship of the land keeping soil on the land rather than permitting it to erode into nearby streams will benefit both the land resource and environmental quality good management practices are collage of many possible actions that involve physical modifications to the landscape and sound resource management activities that provide environmental benefits while the practices usually have single environmental focus such as improved water quality they typically provide multiple benefits these practices often are voluntarily applied although that is not prerequisite the typical role of the federal government is to provide incentives that encourage participation 1 public cost sharing funds to help pay for planning installation and maintenance 2 education to explain both their benefits and how to properly use and maintain them and 3 technical assistance to help design and implement stewardship activities cornerstone is planning to assemble the most appropriate mix of practices that will help the land user reach his goals while recognizing the physical characteristics and limitations of each site and its resources the focus of application has been on the most modified lands which are usually lands cultivated to produce crops but also include forest lands range and pasture and at the scale of an individual ownership underlying concepts good management practices are designed to maintain restore or enhance the health and integrity of the resource base soils water and air and the plants and animals that depend on them by using tools that range from active to passive and from construction to resource management individual practices have design and other standards but they vary widely in what they actually accomplish because of the dynamic nature of land uses and conditions and users goals the unstated assumption is that resources benefit from these practices not that they should benefit at least to some prescribed level or standard pros and cons supporters cite many aspects of good management practices as the basis for continued and expanded use participation is incentivedriven involves willing participants and attracts those who want to improve their resources participation is driven by personal goals about resource protection and improvement rather than externallygenerated requirements good management can be practiced at many different scales and levels of intensity practices have design standards that must be met each benefits the resources to different degrees but all are improvements over the status quo for resource conditions land users can change their mix of good management practices this flexibility recognizes the dynamic ways in which land users may modify their goals from year to year reliance on good management practices has also been criticized resource problems are not evenly distri buted across the landscape so the relative interest in applying them does not match the distribu tion pattern of environmental problems the result is hodgepodge of practices that inefficiently address resource problems in addressing the resource problems of given area such as watersh ed there ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs41 greater benefit when all landowners participa and when all utilize consistent practices also since participation is voluntary there are few mechanisms to insure that the practices are properly maintained after they are installed even when federal funds help pay for the installation few of these programs have penalties such as requiring the repayme nt of public funds if the practices are not maintained the installation of practices is often publicized but the ephemeral characteristics are not discussed further there are few incentives for public agencies to monitor the condition or performance of these practices after they are in place and in many cases there are penalties for land operators who decide not to maintain these practices historical beginnings good management practices can be traced back to defining events or periods for agricultural land uses the defining event for soil was the dust bowl of the 1930s when dust storms from the midwest blanketed that region and the west the response was development of conservation practices that would allow crop production while reducing soil erosion for forests there was defining period late in the 19th century rather than an event with the recognition that much of the forests were disappearing especially in the east and upper midwest the response was the establishment of the national forest system and the beginnings of efforts to develop sound forest management practices one part of the institutional structure that supports these practices the land grant college system is far older having been created in the 1860s because this system was already wellestablished when these defining events occurred the public policy responses have drawn from this structure the land grant college system has provided major research component to develop new practices and improve existing ones and also major educational component through the usda extension service since the broad needs to protect and improve natural resources on private lands were first recognized both the number of concerns and the tools to address them have expanded newer concerns are often more precise modifications of more general ones raised earlier newer tools include tillage practices forest management techniques and grass and rangeland mana gement techniques emerging technologies such as biotech and geographic information systems are creating new opportunities for good management practices recently interest has grown in considering resource needs from systems perspective that combines many of these factors on scale that is larger than single land holdings and emphasizes interrelationships among resources that resource management experts view as critical to maintaining healthy resources in the broader landscape concluding thoughts the voluntary approach to managing these resources has generated considerable debate about their effectiveness the voluntary approach is viewed by some as gettin g the strongest commitment to installing and maintaining practices because all the participants are willingly involved and have strong desire for success others see limitations in this approach in that the greatest needs or worst problems are not necessarily controlled by willing land owners they view this approach as being less efficient both in terms of committing public resources and in terms of results they also may view it as less enduring as there are few features built into these programs to insure that environmental benefits are maintained one aspect of this debate has been the questions of whether resources to conduct these programs should be distributed moreorless equal ly over the landscape and behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs42 52

direction of us environmental protection policy from an earlier focus on the need to reduce or repair environmental damage by controlling pollutants at the point where they are released to the environment ie at the end of the pipe or smokestack or after disposal congress turned to pollution prevention through reduced generation of pollutants at their point of origin broad support for this policy change was based on the notion that traditional approaches to pollution control had achieved progress but should in the future be supplemented with new approaches that might better address crossmedia pollution transfers the need for costeffective alternatives and methods of controlling pollution from dispersed or nonpoint sources of pollution the act states that it is the policy of the united states that pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible and disposal or other release into the environment should be employed only as last resort and should be conducted in an environmentally safe manner 6602b these principles were adopted 1520 years after the development of complex regulatory structure that governs emissions to the air water and land separately however and their adoption has had little effect on the daytoday functioning of environ mental regulatory authorities further epa and its state counterparts are essentially reactive agencies with little authority to require the use of cleaner production methods or to require the adoption of environmentally preferablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs43 53 there are in fact some cases in which epa has been given and has exercised pollution prevention authority for example in banning the manufacture and sale of asbestos products or of ddt or prohibiting the use of lead in gasoline several statutes including the clean air act and the federal insec ticide fungicide and rodenticide act provide some such authority the broadest authority is probably that provided in the toxic substances control act pl 94469 which gives epa the power to control unreasonable risks to human health and the environment by prohibiting or limiting production or distribution of harmful substances or products containing them use of this authority has been rare 54 us epa office of enforcement and compliance assurance fy98 oeca accomplishments report june 1999 p 4 products given the fundamental respect for private property that permeates american society and an economic system that values free enterprise above most competing values epa and state environmental agencies are unlikely ever to have authority to regulate production methods or production decisions except in extreme cases where production method or product can be demonstrated to pose an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment53 pollution prevention tools in the united states and internationally given these constraints the governments role in pollution prevention has been limited largely to research information gathering and information dissemination tools such as the toxics release inventory and voluntary programs in which industry commits to reduce pollution beyond the requirements of law beyond compliance in return for public recognition and use of an epadeveloped symbol are perhaps the agencys most widely recognized tools in recent years another pollution prevention tool has been the supplemental environmental project sep seps are environmentally beneficial projects that may be proposed by violator during the settlement of an enforcement action in fy1998 epa settlements produced 221 seps valued at 908 million over the 19961998 fiscal years 20 of all judicial and administrative penalty orders included seps seps are often used as pollution prevention tool in reporting on its fy1998 enforcement accomplishments epa estimated that 60 of seps offered human health or worker protection benefits while 52 offered ecosystem protection54 extended producer responsibility there are other possible approaches that combine regulation and pollution prevention the most frequently discussed is an approach referred to as extended producer responsibility epr epr is term applied to efforts in europe japan and elsewhere that hold producers of certain products responsible for managing them at the end of their useful life this management may be accomplished individually by requiring manufacturers to take products back after use or collectively by allowing take back or recycling to be managed by an industrywide organization perhaps the best known example of epr is the green dot system for packaging recovery and recycling established in germany by duales system deutschland dsd under the german ordinance on the avoidance of packaging waste adopted in 1991 and fully implemented in 1993 packaging must be recovered and reused or recycled by retailers and manufacturers since retailers did not wish to collect used packages manufacturers established consortium to operate separate collection system forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs44 55 prepared by james mccarthy specialist in environmental policy resources science and industry divisionused packaging throughout germany the green dot or recycling symbol identifies those packages included in the system this dual system collects material for recycling curbside or at dropoff locations in much the same way local governments or private organizations do in the united states but the system operates nationwide and is paid for by fees that the manufacturer or packager gives to dsd these fees are based on the cost of recovering and recycling specific materials glass plastic paper etc thus manufacturers have an incentive to minimize packaging waste since they must pay for its recovery and packages that are not recyclable are forced out of the system many european countries and japan have adopted systems similar to germanys green dot for managing their packaging waste and the concept is now being applied in germany and elsewhere to automobiles electronic equipment and other products by returning products for reuse or recycling these epr systems provide incentives for the design of products that are easily reused or recycled and minimize the disposal of solid and hazardous waste there are many sources of information on pollution prevention and extended producer responsibility two comprehensive sources are the epa office of pollution prevention website httpwwwepagovp2 and the national pollution prevention roundtable httpwwwp2org for information on extended producer

report on epr policies in the oecd member countries environmental management systems and audits55 over the last 10 years corporations and governments have given great deal of attention to the use of environmental management systems ems as tool to lessen environmental impacts and improve compliance with environme ntal laws the most prominent efforts to facilitate the use of emss have been those of the international organization for standardization iso which has developed series of standards for environmental management systems referred to as the iso 14000 standards voluntary industry standards iso is nongovernmental international industrybased organization its us counterpart the american national standards institute ansi has long history as does iso of setting voluntary industry and product standards to facilitate both domestic and international commerce in the 1990s iso with ansi participation developed set of standards covering environmental management environmental auditing life cycle assessment environmental labeling and environmental performance to be certified or registered under these standards an organization must demonstrate that it has an environmental management system in conformity with iso 14001 conformity with iso 14001 indicates that company or organi zation has system in place for settinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30760crs45 environmental goals auditi ng performance and taking corrective action but the company or organizatio n is free to set its own goals thus compliance with iso 14001 does not necessarily certify environmental excellence furthermore the absence of any meaningful public reporting requirement in the standard means that outsiders have way of judging companys environmental performance under the standard thus comp liance with iso 14001 often discussed as new method of stimulating improved environmental performance is probably not in its current form substitute for environmental regulation but many feel it has the potential to improve corporate performance and benefit the environment environmental audits the same may be said for related tool the environmental audit environmental audits presume that there are environmental regulations against whic h to measure companys performance in the absence of regulations an audit would be relatively meaningless audits have been used extensively in the corporate world as means of improving environmental performance 1995 survey by price waterhouse found that 75 of 369 companies who responded conducted such audits and another 8 planned to do so some argue that audits would be even more widely used were it not for fear that they may provide evidence that could be used against the company in court or in other enforcement proceedings as result there has been lively debate throughout the 1990s as to whether state and federal governments should consider information collected in audits to be privileged or inadmissible in enforcement proceedings about 20 states have provided some such privilege for environmental audit information and some states offer immunity from civil and criminal penalties to persons and entities reporting violations detected in such audits provided that violations detected are promptly reported and corrected us epa and the department of justice have adopt ed policies restricting the role of audit information in enforcement proceedings and reducing penalties for voluntary disclosure of violations but they oppose legislation that they believe would limit their discretion in such matters such legislation was the subject of congressional hearings in the mid1990s but now appears to have less support for further reading see crs report 96332 environmental audit privilege state laws and federal policy james mccarthy apr 11
