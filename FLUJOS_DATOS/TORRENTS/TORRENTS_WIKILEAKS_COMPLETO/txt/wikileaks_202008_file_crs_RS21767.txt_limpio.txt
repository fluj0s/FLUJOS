science and industry division updated may 23 2008 abstract the national aeronautics and space administration nasa estimates that without servicing mission to replace key components the hubble space telescope will cease scientific operations in 2008 in january 2004 thennasa administrator sean okeefe announced that the space shuttle would longer be used to service hubble he indicated that this decision was based primarily on safety concerns in the wake of the space shuttle columbia accident in 2003 many critics however saw it as the result of the new vision for space exploration announced by president bush in january 2004 which focuses nasas priorities on human and robotic exploration of the solar system hubble supporters sought to reverse the decision and proceed with shuttle servicing mission michael griffin who became nasa administrator in april 2005 stated that he would reassess whether to use the shuttle to service hubble after there were two successful postcolumbia shuttle flights the second postcolumbia flight took place successfully in july 2006 in octo ber 2006 nasa approved shuttle mission to service hubble that mission is now scheduled for october 8 2008

postcolumbia flight took place successfully in july 2006 in october 2006 nasa approved shuttle mission to service hubble that mission is now scheduled for october 8 2008 introduction nasa launched the hubble space telescope in 1990 aboard the space shuttle discovery unlike other nasa space telescopes hubble was designed to be serviced regularly by astronauts that design proved fortuitous when it was discovered that hubble had defective mirror that produced blurry images astronauts on the first servicing mission in 1993 were able to install corrective optics allowing years of scientific accomplishments and generating widespread scientific and public support additional servicing missions were conducted in 1997 1999 and 2002 to replace aging hardware and install advanced scientific instruments two more shuttle missions to hubble were scheduled final servicing mission in 2004 known as sm4 and retrieval mission to bring the telescope back to earth in 2010 following the space shuttle columbia accident in february 2003 however thennasa administrator sean okeefe decided not to proceed with either flight current nasa administrator michael griffin crs2 revisited that decision once the shuttle returned to regular flight servicing mission is now scheduled for october 8 2008 retrieval mission is currently planned roughly the size of school bus hubble was designed to make astronomical observations of the universe in the visible ultraviolet and nearinfrared wavelength bands although groundbased telescopes can also make visible and infrared observations hubbles location above earths atmosphere enhances image clarity enabling astronomers to look at fainter more distant objects and further back in time hubble is operated for nasa by the space telescope science institute ststci near baltimore md websites maintained by stsci httphubblesiteorg and nasa httphubblenasagov provide information about the telescope and its discoveries hubble was designed to operate for 15 years milestone that was reached on april 25 2005 nasa had planned to extend the operational period until 2010 at which time the space shuttle would bring hubble back to earth to prevent an uncontrolled reentry that could pose debris risk to populated areas funding constraints however led some nasa officials to conclude that hubbles operations should be brought to end earlier than 2010 the funding wedge created by ending the servicing missions would be used to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21767 build the new james webb space telescope jwst which is being designed for infrared observations the jwst mission was replanned in 2006 and is now scheduled for launch in 2013 rather than 2011 the debate over how long to continue to operate hubble including the linkage with funding for the jwst was under way at the time of the columbia accident servicing missions to hubble during servicing visits to hubble shuttle crews repair or replace aging equipment and install updated scientific instruments hubble has six gyroscopes for pointing the telescope but two are now nonfunctional and one has degraded performance until august 2005 three were required to achieve the accuracy needed for scientific observations new techniques now allow operation on just two gyroscopes so that one is kept in reserve solar arrays generate electricity for the telescope the energy is stored in batteries hubble has propulsion system relying instead on the space shuttle to boost its orbit so that it does not reenter earths atmosphere the tasks for the sm4 mission included replacing all the gyroscopes and batteries and fine guidance sensor emplacing new thermal protection blankets boosting hubbles orbit and installing two new scientific instruments the cosmic origins spectrograph for ultraviolet observations of chemical composition and the wide field camera 3 for observations from ultraviolet through nearinfrared all these tasks are also included in the planned 2008 servicing mission one of hubbles current instruments the advanced camera for surveys malfunctioned in january 2007 and lost most of its capabilities it was installed in march 2002 and was designed for five years of operation astronauts on the 2008 servicing mission will attempt to repair this instrument even though nasas plans did not originally call for that because of the difficulty and because the wide field camera 3 will be more capable although it will have somewhat smaller field of view the mission crs3 will also attempt to repair another malfunctioning instrument the space telescope imaging spectrograph1 the columbia accident and the decision to cancel sm4 on february 1 2003 the space shuttle columbia disintegrated as it returned to earth following 16day scientific mission all seven astronauts aboard perished the shuttle system was immediately grounded nasa established the columbia accident investigation board caib to determine the causes of the accident and recommend corrective actions for more on the columbia accident see crs report rs21408 nasas space shuttle program the columbia tragedy the discovery mission and the future of the shuttle it was quickly apparent that sm4 would be delayed as the caib deliberated nasa decided that the 2010 hubble retrieval mission was too risky compared to the benefits on january 16 2004 mr okeefe informed workers at stsci and nasas goddard space flight center which built hubble and oversees stsci that he was canceling sm4 according to the director of stsci dr steven beckwith mr okeefe cited several factors the shuttle would not have the iss as safe httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21767 haven the changes required to meet the caibs recommendations regarding noniss related shuttle missions would not have application beyond the servicing mission making their expense questionable completing iss construction by 2010 will require all the shuttle flights in that time period hubbles life would be extended for only few years and astronomers have other ground and spacebased telescopes they could use2 reaction to the decision two days before mr okeefe announced his decision president bush directed nasa to embark on new exploration initiative requiring shift in program and funding priorities see crs report rs21720 space exploration issues concerning the vision for space exploration funding for the new initiative would come primarily from canceling deferring or delaying other nasa programs although mr okeefe stated that the hubble decision was based primarily on shuttle safety concerns the timing of his announcement led many commentators to conclude that it was linked to the priority shifts required by the presidents initiative while some media accounts praised the nasa administrator for making difficult decision others called hubble the first victim of the presidents initiative and chided nasa for putting the new exploration goals ahead of the astronomical research performed with hubble3 1

january 26 2004 p 12 and brian berger canceled hubble repair the first victim of new nasa vision space news january 26 2004 p 6 crs4 servicing options initial opposition to the cancellation of sm4 focused on attempts to reverse mr okeefes decision and proceed with shuttle mission the debate centered on comparing the risk of mission to hubble with the risk of mission to the iss shortly after the cancellation decision nasas thenchief scientist dr john grunsfeld an astronaut who was member of the 1999 and 2002 hubble servicing crews commented that if shuttle mission to hubble were mounted it would be necessary to have second shuttle ready to launch in case the first one encountered difficulties4 nasa has had backup shuttle available for each of the shuttle launches since the columbia accident but may not for all future missions if safety modifications continue to work well attention soon shifted to robotic servicing options which dominated the public discussion of hubbles future throughout most of 2004 at senate appropriations va hudia subcommittee hearing on march 11 2004 mr okeefe agreed with request from senator mikulski to ask the national research council nrc to study options for extending hubbles life including both shuttle and robotic missions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21767 in november 2004 congress passed the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 which provided 291 million for hubble servicing mission the conference report hrept 108792 stated that successful servicing mission to hubble should be one of nasas highest priorities the report language did not specify whether the servicing mission should involve the space shuttle or robotic mission the final nrc report on servicing options released on december 8 2004 found it unlikely that nasa will be able to extend the science life of hubble through robotic servicing and that the risk of shuttle mission to hubble is similar to the risk of single shuttle mission to the iss the report recommended shuttle servicing mission and robotic mission only for deorbiting the telescope at the end of its useful lifetime5 the robotic servicing option was off the table shuttle servicing revisited dr michael griffin was sworn in as nasa administrator replacing mr okeefe on april 14 2005 at his senate confirmation hearing on april 12 2005 dr griffin stated that he would revisit the question of whether to use the shuttle to service hubble after the second successful postcolumbia shuttle flight at which time nasa would be able to assess the risk factors associated with essentially new vehicle the nasa authorization act of 2005 pl 109155 enacted in december 2005 called for shuttle servicing mission after the shuttle returned to flight successfully unless such mission would compromise astronaut safety the second postcolumbia flight took place successfully in july 2006 in october 2006 nasa announced that hubble servicing 4 quoted in brian berger canceled hubble repair the

the cradle to grave cost of the servicing mission will be 900 million 500 million to keep the hubble team together from 2004 through 2008 200 million for the gyroscopes batteries and instruments that will be installed 100 million for external tanks and solidrocket boosters for the additional shuttle flight and 100 million for shuttle launch processing6 hubble operations after servicing nasa expects that if the 2008 servicing mission is successful hubble will continue to operate until 2013 rather than being deorbited in 2010 as previously planned according to one nasa official hubbles most impressive accomplishments lie in its future7 the cost of the additional years of operation however may affect funding and scheduling for other astronomy missions for example to offset the funding that congress provided for hubble in fy2005 nasas may 2005 operating plan postponed two other astronomy missions and reduced funding for mars exploration before the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21767 columbia accident the end of hubble expenditures was expected to be source of funding for the james webb space telescope according to nasas fy2009 congressional budget justification hubble costs are expected to be 115 million in fy2011 95 million in fy2012 and 94 million in fy2013 not including certain indirect costs deorbiting hubble plans for deorbiting hubble remain uncertain before the columbia accident the space shuttle was to return hubble to earth at the end of its lifetime but there is longer any expectation of retrieval by the shuttle whether or not the servicing mission in 2008 is successful hubble has propulsion system of its own however so if it is not retrieved propulsion module would need to be attached to it to permit controlled deorbit that is to ensure that any debris falls in an unpopulated area such as the pacific ocean analysis by nasa in 2005 indicated that hubble is unlikely to make an uncontrolled reentry until at least 2020 rather than 2012 as previously believed and the agency now considers the deorbiting issue to be beyond the budget horizon8 boosting hubbles orbit during the 2008 servicing mission will delay the date of reentry even further but at some point deorbiting will be necessary if an uncontrolled reentry is to be avoided 6 clinton parks and brian berger nasas mission to service hubble in 2008 will cost
