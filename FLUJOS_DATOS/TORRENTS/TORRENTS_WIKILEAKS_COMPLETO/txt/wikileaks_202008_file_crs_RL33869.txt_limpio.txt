specialist in american national government government and finance division rescission actions since 1974 review and assessment of the record summary the impoundment control act ica was included as title x of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 signed into law on june 12 1974 88 stat 332 under the ica unless congress takes action to approve rescission request from the president within the 45day review period prescribed by the law the funds must be released with respect to presidential rescission message congress may approve more or less than the amount requested by the president in addition absent specific request from the president congress on its own accord may initiate rescission actions by cancelling previously appropriated funds in subsequent law according to data compiled by the government accountability office gao from fy1974 to fy2006 presidents requested 1178 rescissions under the ica totaling somewhat over 76 billion close to third of the proposals were approved by congress with approximately 40 of the total dollar amount of presidential rescission requests 25 billion enacted by congress the sum of rescissions requested by the president and subsequently enacted exceeded 1 billion in only four of the 30plus years fy1981 fy1982 fy1992 and fy1994 during this period congress initiated 1610 rescission actions amounting to 1435 billion over five times the total of presidentially requested rescission subsequently enacted reflecting trend toward an increasing number of rescissions being initiated by congress the line item veto act of 1996 pl 93344 in effect for less than eighteen months before being overturned by the supreme court in 1998 gave the president enhanced rescission authority by reversing the burden of action regarding rescission proposals cancellations of the president became permanent unless disapproved by congress ultimately requiring rejection by 23 majority in both chambers during this time the president also had authority to cancel new items of direct spending and certain targeted tax benefits as well as items of discretionary spending figures from the congressional budget office indicate that the 82 cancellations made by president clinton in fy1998 including those overturned totaled some 355 million with projected fiveyear savings just under 1 billion president clintons use of the short lived enhanced rescission authority thus was not notably different from the prior annual record of presidential rescissions under the ica framework during his first seven years in office president george w bush sent formal ica rescission requests to congress but some controversy developed over his use of alternative means to propose spending reductions president bush while evidently reluctant to use existing rescission authority contained in the ica has called repeatedly for enactment of measure that would give the president greater authority to reject items of spending such bill passed the house in the 109th congress and was reported in the senate contentious issue is whether such measure might give preference to presidential spending priorities over congressional spending priorities arguably

actions since 1974 review and assessment of the record introduction the federal budget process involves both congress and the executive branch the constitution provides in article i that money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law article ii stipulates that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed the practice of impoundment reflects this sharing of powers between the branches in the implementation of the federal budget the term impoundment refers to executive actions to withhold or delay the spending of funds provided in law the term rescission denotes one type of impoundment that involving permanent cancellation of the funds while instances of presidential impoundment date back to the early 19th century presidents usually sought accommodation rather than confrontation with congress1 this changed during the nixon administration 19691974 when impoundment of funds developed into major conflict eventually involving the courts as well as congress and the president2 this report begins by reviewing the framework for handling rescissions established by the impoundment control act of 1974 ica 88 stat 332 and by amendments to it in 1987 101 stat 786 section with review and analysis of data on rescission requests and outcomes pursuant to the 1974 law follows including comparisons among the respective administrations attention then turns to actions which took place during the brief period that the line item veto act of 1996 liva pl 104130 110 stat 1200 was in force during his first six years as

proposing spending reductions the final section of the report provides some concluding observations impoundment control act of 1974 the impoundment control act ica was included as title x of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 signed into law on june 12 1974 88 stat 332 the act established two categories of impoundments deferrals or temporary delays in funding availability and rescissions or permanent cancellation of the designated budget authority the ica also established new reporting requirements that remain in effect3 the 1974 law required the president to inform congress of all proposed rescissions and deferrals and to submit specified information regarding each such action in special message the president may combine several rescission requests in single impoundment message section 1014 of the 1974 law also stipulated that the president transmit to congress each month cumulative report on the status of impoundment actions in 1975 various of these reporting duties were transferred from the president to the director of the office of management and budget omb via executive order 118454 the ica also required the comptroller general of the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office to oversee executive compliance with the law and report to congress if the president fails to report an impoundment or improperly classifies an action both messages from the president and communications from the comptroller general are published in the federal register and subsequently printed as house documents5 the act further stipulated different procedures for congressional review and control of the two types of impoundment with rescission the funds must be made available for obligation unless both houses of congress take action to approve of the 3 see appendix for further discussion of reporting requirement for presidential impoundment actions and of sources for impoundment data 4 specifically president gerald ford conferred upon the omb director the functions of transmitting copies of the special rescission and deferral messages to the comptroller general and to the office of the federal register and also the responsibility of submitting to congress the monthly cumulative report us president 19741976 ford executive order 11845 delegating certain reporting functions to the director of the office of

approved by congress become available for obligation after about 60 calendar days although the period can extend to 75 days or longer7 the funds may be withheld from obligation until the 45day period elapses or congress disapproves the rescission congress may alter the amount proposed for rescission by the president either increasing or decreasing it as well as approving or disapproving the rescission request in toto section 1017 of the ica establishes expedited procedures for congressional action on any rescission bill introduced with respect to special message submitted by the president in the fall of 1987 as component of legislation to raise the limit on the public debt pl 100119 that also included changes in the grammrudmanhollings act congress enacted several other budget process reforms as well section 206 effectively eliminated presidential deferrals for policy reasons8 section 207 involved the use of rescission authority it provides statutory prohibition against the practice sometimes used by presidents when congress failed to act on rescission proposal within the 45day period of resubmitting new rescission proposal covering identical or very similar matter by using such resubmissions repeatedly the president might continue to tie up the funds even though congress by its inaction had already rejected virtually the same proposal the legislative history of the 1974 act suggests that prohibiting this practice of seriatim rescission proposals may be consistent with the original intent of congress the prohibition on seriatim rescissions in section 207 applies for the duration of the appropriation so that it may remain in effect for two or more fiscal years 9 6 in contrast the original provisions of title x allowed deferral to continue in effect for the period proposed by the president not to extend beyond the end of the fiscal year so as to become facto rescission unless either the house or senate took action to disapprove it such procedures known as onehouse legislative veto were invalidated by the 1983 supreme court decision in ins v chadha 462 us 919 city of new haven v united states 809 f 2d 900 dc cir 1987 held that the deferral authority conveyed to the president in the 1974 law was inseverable from the onehouse veto provision thus the invalidation of the legislative veto also invalidated the deferral authority except for what were considered to be routine deferrals authorized by sources predating the ica 7 in the past omb sometimes expanded the 45day period during which the funds were unavailable by initiating deferral prior to formally reporting the rescission to congress in one case in 1986 nearly six months elapsed between the effective date of specific appropriation and the submission of the icarequired rescission message see crs report rl33365 line item veto constitutional analysis of recent proposals by morton rosenberg p 9 8 section 206 of pl 100119 served to codify the appeals court decision in the new haven case the provision in the 1974 law as amended now authorizes the president to defer funds only for contingencies efficiency or where specifically provided by law section 206 also reaffirmed certain provisions of the 1974 law relating to enforcement responsibilities of the comptroller general who is empowered to sue the executive for violations of the impoundment control act 9 see joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference in us congress increasing the statutory limit on the public debt conference report to accompany continued crs4 rescission actions since 197410 the impoundment control act has been in effect for over 30 years according to an assessment of congressional power over impoundments since 1974 coauthored by former director of the congressional budget office cbo although the courts did much to curb presidential impoundments through title x of the new budget act congress also helped itself to recapture its influence over the impoundment of funds11 in the first few years following enactment of the 1974 law congress approved presidential requests in number of separate rescission bills subsequently congress tended to act upon rescission messages from the president in supplemental and regular appropriations measures rather than in individual rescission bills under the ica unless congress takes action to approve of rescission request from the president within the 45day period the funds must be released in practice however congressional action on rescission requests has often occurred after the expiration of the 45day review period so that funds are formally available for obligation for some time before being permanently rescinded as noted previously congress may approve more or less than the amount requested by the president in addition absent specific request from the president congress of its own accord may initiate rescission actions by cancelling previously appropriated funds in subsequent law such factors can create ambiguities in interpreting data on rescissions proposed by the president and congressional action on them for example are funds originally proposed for rescission in special message but which again become available for obligation before congress permanently rescinds them to be considered as congressional approval of presidents request or as rescission initiated by congress table 1 provides data on rescissions from fy1974 through fy2005 as compiled by gao according to gaos methodology eventual congressional action on rescission proposed by the president is generally considered as approval of presidents request even if the 45day period has elapsed12 data in table 2 reflect the outcome of rescission requests of the presidents since 1974 providing percentages of their respective requests approved by congress both in relation to total dollars requested for rescission and to the number of separate proposals by year and by administration in the early months under the new framework the number of presidentially proposed rescissions increased in particular president ford attempted to rescind funding that congress had added to the presidents

government accountability office 2005 the decline in rescission requests during the carter administration proved only temporary during his first year in office president reagan submitted more rescission proposals 133 than had president carter during his entire administration the largest number of rescission requests in any year 245 in 1985 occurred during the reagan administration as did the greatest amount in terms of total dollars involved more than 15 billion in 1981 somewhat coincidentally president reagan saw the same percentage acceptance overall of his rescission proposals as the total dollar value 36 see table 2 while president reagans rescission crs9 requests focused almost exclusively on domestic programs most of the reagan proposals reflected program cuts rather than targeted terminations via rescissions as during the nixon administration the aggregate percentage approval figure of slightly over third for the reagan administrations requests masks substantial differences from year to year however as one assessment concluded although president reagan was nevertheless reasonably successful in using this rescission device in fiscal years 19811982 obtaining congressional approval for almost 70 percent of the dollar value of his requested rescissions the tool was essentially useless to the president in fiscal years 198387 when congress approved less than 2 percent of the value of his rescission requests15 the absence of any rescission requests in fy1988 for the first time since enactment of the ica reflected special situation in november of 1987 compromise agreement was announced resulting from the budget summit between the white house and congress the summit deal specified twoyear limits on discretionary spending for domestic programs international affairs and defense provisions of the agreement were implemented as part of an omnibus appropriations measure pl 100202 101 stat13291 and reconciliation bill pl 100203 101 stat 1330 apparently president reagan decided not to submit formal rescission requests for fiscal 1988 which might have been perceived in congress as violating the spirit if not the letter of the agreement he did however send message to congress identifying wasteful items earmarked in the fy1988 fullyear continuing resolution with transmittal letter stating the following accordingly i am informally asking that the congress review these projects appropriations and other provisions line by line and either rescind or repeal them as soon as possible i reserve the option of transmitting at later date either formal rescission proposals or language that would make the funds available for more worthwhile purposes for any or all of these items16 president reagan refrained from using the rescission mechanism only temporarily before he left office in january of 1989 the president transmitted package of six new rescission proposals affecting fy198917 the administration of george hw bush had an approval

total proposals accepted during the presidential election year of 1992 however the use of rescissions became controversial and highly partisan political issue to an extent not seen since the conflicts of the nixon administration18 during the first four months of calendar year 1992 president bush requested 128 rescissions totaling almost 79 billion while reportedly attempting to portray the democraticpartycontrolled congress as more interested in securing domestic pork projects for their constituents than in reducing the budget deficit over 7 billion of these proposed rescissions affected the defense department mainly for weapons programs that the administration wanted to terminate or items that congress added to earlier defense budgets19 many of the nondefense rescissions were for small earmarked projects added by congress in response to the four packages of rescissions requested by president bush in 1992 the house and senate appropriations committees devised their own alternative packages conference version with an 82 billion package of rescissions was signed into law on june 4 1992 pl 102298 although the conference agreement contained over 7 billion in defense funds only about 17 billion of that total came from programs that the administration had wanted to rescind in toto the law approved less than 21 billion of the rescissions requested by president bush but added more than 6 billion in congressionally initiated cuts20 as indicated in table 2 the clinton administration ranked at the top of the list of presidents since 1974 with respect to the percentage of rescission proposals accepted 67 and percentage of the total dollar amounts requested that were approved by congress 54 during his first two years 19931994 the democratic party controlled both houses of congress as well as the white house while in the remainder of his term republicans controlled the house and senate yet president clinton achieved his greatest success rate

office 2005 the variations from year to year within administrations as compared with the record of the respective presidents overall constitute noteworthy feature of the data in tables 1 and 2 both the number and dollar amount of rescission requests submitted by the president have fluctuated widely in the 30plus years of experience under the impoundment control act while president clinton had the most success during single year 86 of rescission proposals approved by congress in 1995 none of his requests were approved in 2000 reflecting on rescissions under the ica from the perspective of the mid1990s allen schick concluded rescissions invite conflict between the president and congress every one is presidential demand that congress cancel resources it had previously appropriated by implication rescissions tell congress that it erred the first time around and that it wasted government funds this is not message that appeals to legislators especially when it comes from president who has different budget priorities21 the experience during the 1992 election year provided prelude to very significant development in rescissions since 1974 the increase in number of congressionally initiated rescissions by the end of fy1992 presidents had proposed over 1000 rescissions under the ica with congress approving about third of the 21 allen schick the federal budget politics policy process washington the brookings institution 1995 p 175 crs13 presidential requests along with over 300 congressionally initiated rescissions22 during the period from 19741992 the total amount rescinded came to nearly 1077 billion of which over 80 came from congressionally initiated rescissions in 1993 testimony milton socolar from the gao office of general counsel called attention to this development the data suggest an evolution in the use of rescissions as budgetary tool the share of total enacted rescissions originally proposed by the president has fallen and the share originating in the congress has increased as the congress has come to embrace an equivalent or greater amount of reductions than proposed by presidents the debate has shifted from deciding whether to cut to deciding where to cut emphasis in original23 according to mr socolar however these enacted rescissions often had effect in reducing total spending if an equivalent amount of budget authority was added to another program thereby reflecting shift in priorities rather than reduction in total spending the proportion of enacted rescissions initiated by congress rather than by presidential request has continued to expand see table 3 the share of total dollars rescinded originating with congress exceeded 91 in fy1992 and fy1993 and by fy1997 and fy1998 over 99 since fy1982 the percentage of total rescissions enacted included in presidential messages reached double digit figures in only three years almost 17 in fy1991 nearly 36 in fy1994 and 16 in fy1996 since fy2000 all rescissions enacted have been congressionally initiated president george w bush has submitted rescission requests to congress one factor that may have contributed to the growth of rescissions initiated by congress relates to the limits on discretionary spending dating to the budget enforcement act bea of 199024 as noted previously congress came to include rescission provisions in regular or supplemental appropriations measures an appropriations measure could include rescissions of previously appropriated funds in order to accommodate additional monies for other purposes the rescission mechanism on occasion might have proved useful in efforts to avoid breaching particular spending cap and possibly triggering acrosstheboard cuts 22 see crs issue brief archived ib92077 rescission of funds for

rescissions have occurred for brief period president clinton had new authority to rescind funds under the line item veto act of 1996 president george w bush has refrained from requesting rescissions under the ica but has issued presidential statements calling for cancellation of certain funding president bush also has supported amending the ica to provide for expedited rescissions line item veto act liva of 1996 the line item veto act of 1996 amended the ica to give the president enhanced rescission authority to cancel certain items in appropriations and entitlement measures and also certain narrowly applicable tax breaks the act authorized the president to cancel in whole any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority appropriations any item of new direct spending entitlement or limited tax benefits with specified characteristics contained in bill otherwise signed into law the cancellation was to take effect upon receipt in the house and senate of special notification message cancellation in this context meant to prevent from having legal force in other words provisions canceled never were to become effective unless congress reversed the action of the president by enacting disapproval bill the president was only to exercise the cancellation authority if he determined 1 that such cancellation would reduce the federal budget deficit and 2 it would not impair essential government functions or harm the national interest and 3 he notified the congress in special message of any such cancellation within five calendar days after enactment of the law providing such amount item or benefit the act provided 30 days for the expedited congressional consideration of disapproval bills to reverse the cancellations contained in the special messages received from the president detailed provisions for expedited consideration of the disapproval bill in the house and senate were outlined since the president would presumably veto the disapproval bill 23 majority in both the house and senate ultimately would be necessary to override and disapprove of cancellations the law became effective on january 1 1997 but was subsequently overturned by the supreme court on june 25 1998 clinton v new york city25 liva cancellations by president clinton on august 11 1997 president clinton exercised his new veto authority for the first time by transmitting two special messages to congress reporting his cancellation of two limited tax benefit provisions in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 111 stat 788 and one item of direct spending in the balanced budget act of 1997 pl

cancellation messages were published in the federal register and also as continued crs15 on october 6 1997 president clinton exercised the new authority to veto items in appropriations bills by cancelling 38 projects contained in the fy1998 military construction appropriations act pl 10545 111 stat 114227 on october 14 1997 president clinton vetoed 14 projects in the department of defense appropriations28 on october 16 1997 he used the cancellation authority on provision in the treasury and general government appropriations relating to pension systems for federal employees29 on october 17 1997 the president applied his veto to eight more projects this time in the energy and water appropriations act30 on november 1 1997 president clinton exercised his line item veto authority in two appropriations acts canceling seven projects in the vahud measure and three projects in the transportation act on november 20 1997 the president canceled two projects from interior and five from the agriculture appropriations act on december 2 1997 president clinton exercised his line item veto authority one last time by canceling project in the commercejusticestate appropriations measure all together in fy1997 president clinton issued 11 special messages containing 82 cancellations under the liva the 38 cancellations in the military construction appropriations bill however were rejected with the congressional override of the presidential veto of the bill disapproving the cancellations31 the cancellation of the provision in the treasury bill providing for an open season for federal

overturned the liva in june 1998 according to figures provided by the congressional budget office cbo president clintons cancellations in fy1998 under the liva amounted to about 355 million out of total budget of 17 trillion less than 002 of this total about 30 million came from the 39 cancellations overturned leaving net budgetary effect for fy1998 of 325 million cbo estimated total savings over fiveyear period from the fy1998 cancellations as less that 600 million33 table 4 presents data for fy1998 both from rescission requests under the impoundment control act and from cancellation actions under the line item veto act the figures are not entirely comparable since cancellations under the liva included not only actions affecting items in appropriations acts but also items of new

developments in the george w bush administration as noted previously president bush submitted formal rescission requests under the ica during the first seven years of his administration some controversy occurred however regarding presidential statements calling for cancellation of certain funds on october 28 2005 president bush forwarded to congress package of 23 billion in rescissions as explained in an omb press release unused balances in 55 federal programs would be rescinded in keeping with the presidents pledge to reduce unnecessary spending elsewhere in the budget as hurricane recovery efforts continue34 in press briefing omb director joshua bolten further explained the unobligated balances that i referred to are is money that has not been spent in programs which into accounts into which it as appropriated we have stepped in and where the program was either low priority or where we believe its clear that the amount of money in that account is not necessary to fulfill the purpose of the program weve gone in and proposed to take that money out and use it as savings to the federal treasury35 congress eventually approved 400 million of the proposed 23 billion in cancellations forwarded by the president36 according to omb staff the october package constituted proposal for cancellations not rescission requests under the ica and agencies were told not to withhold funds in anticipation of an impending rescission the comptroller general however deemed it necessary to contact each agency affected by the presidents proposal since gao has responsibility under the ica to monitor possible impoundments of budget authority in letter to then omb director bolten the 34 omb president bush requests rescission and reallocation packages oct 28 2005 available

totaling over 470 million with an attachment table detailing each case in point in what arguably amounted to an indirect admonishment of omb the letter closed with this advice in the future when the president chooses to propose cancellations of budget authority rather than rescissions of budget authority pursuant to the procedures specified in the impoundment control act your office should ensure that agencies appreciate the distinction and do not withhold budget authority from obligation in anticipation of possible rescission agencies that withhold budget authority in this manner violate the impoundment control act37 in an apparent effort to avoid any further confusion an omb memorandum went out to all federal agencies the following month emphasizing the important distinction between proposed cancellations like those contained in the fy2007 budget and rescission requests identified in special messages from the president pursuant to the ica under the ica funds requested to be rescinded may be withheld for 45 days of continuous congressional session in contrast cancellations such as those in the fy2007 budget are proposals subject to the normal legislative process and should not be withheld pending congressional action on the presidents proposed legislation38 the revised version of omb circular a11 preparation submission and execution of the budget issued on june 30 2006 reiterated the differences between rescission under the ica and cancellation proposals by the president to reduce budgetary resources with the latter such amounts not to be withheld from obligation and subject to the normal apportionment instructions39 meanwhile gao found that agencies were not improperly withholding funds proposed for cancellation in the presidents fy2007 budget submission the chairman and ranking minority member of the senate appropriations committee requested such an assessment from gao in march 2006 in letter sent in early august 2006 the comptroller general reported that gao identified proposed cancellations in the fy2007 budget affecting 40 programs according to gao in only one instance were funds mistakenly withheld by an agency and the funds were released following gaos inquiry about them40 the george w bush administration has offered public explanation as to why the president chooses to propose cancellations rather than formal rescissions under the ica as noted already an apparent advantage of the rescission request option is that under the ica the funds identified in special message from the 37 gao comptroller general

while evidently reluctant to use existing rescission authority provided in the ica has repeatedly called for enactment of measure that would give the president greater authority to reject items of spending and that also would pass constitutional muster41 on march 6 2006 president bush sent draft bill titled the legislative line item veto act of 2006 to congress42 and the measure was introduced the next day as hr 4890 and s 2381 109th congress title notwithstanding the bills would have amended the impoundment control act of 1974 ica to incorporate typical expedited rescission framework intended through procedural provisions to require an upordown vote on presidential requests to cancel certain previously enacted spending or tax provisions in testifying on hr 4890 edward lorenzen policy director of the concord coalition stated president bush has never used his authority under current law to submit rescissions of earmarks or other spending he considers low priority so it is unclear whether granting him this additional authority would have much of an impact at all43 the house passed hr 4890 by vote of 247172 on june 22 200644 but floor action on companion measure did not occur in the senate before the 109th congress adjourned45 on january 24 2007 the senate failed to invoke cloture in order to vote on similar expedited rescission provisions offered by senator judd gregg as floor amendment to hr 2 the fair minimum wage act of 200746 some concluding observations according to gao data from fy1974 to fy2006 presidents requested 1178 rescissions under the ica totaling somewhat over 76 billion close to third of the proposals were approved by congress with approximately 40 of the total dollar amount of presidential rescission requests 25 billion enacted by congress the sum of rescissions requested by the president and subsequently enacted exceeded 1 billion in only four of the 30plus years since the ica was enacted fy1981 fy1982 fy1992 and fy1994 41 see

initiated 1610 rescission actions amounting to 1435 billion over five times the total dollar amount of presidentially requested rescissions enacted the trend toward an increasing number of rescissions being initiated by congress has already been noted whether considering rescissions requested by the president presidential rescission proposals enacted by congress andor rescissions initiated directly in congress from fy1974 to fy2006 the totals appear modest compared with annual budget outlays topping 25 trillion in fy2006 and federal budget deficits exceeding 300 billion in three of the last four years47 acting cbo director donald marron provided this assessment at 2006 hearing presidents have made very little use of the authority to recommend rescissions from 1976 through 2005 presidents proposed about 73 billion in rescissions about onehalf of 1 percent of the more than 15 trillion in total discretionary budget authority legislated in those years48 supporters of changing the ica framework to make it easier for the presidents rescission proposals to prevail point to limitations in the current process as contributing to the low number of rescissions in the last 30 years under the ica there is requirement that congress even consider presidents rescission requests funds proposed for rescission by the president in special message must be made available for obligation unless congress acts to approve the presidents requested rescissions within 45 days of continuous session the ica moreover allows the president to request rescissions only of discretionary spending portion of the budget which accounts for 38 of annual outlays while 62 of outlays go to mandatory spending controlled by law other than appropriations acts including net interest49 the record of cancellations during the brief time in fy1997 and fy1998 that the 1996 liva was in effect arguably serves to rebut such criticisms of the current ica process as discussed above the liva reversed the burden of action regarding rescission proposals cancellations of the president became permanent unless disapproved by congress ultimately requiring rejection by 23 majority in both chambers to override presidential veto of disapproval bill during this period the president also had authority to cancel new items of direct mandatory spending and certain targeted tax benefits as well as items of discretionary spending cbo figures indicate that all the cancellations made by president clinton in fy1998 including those overturned totaled some 355 million with projected fiveyear savings just 47

the budget for fiscal year 2006 by philip d winters crs21 under 1 billion when the cancellations disapproved by congress are excluded the estimated amount to be saved over five years was less than 600 million50 the brief experience in the clinton administration does not necessarily reflect how enhanced rescission authority might be exercised by other presidents in other circumstances still president clintons use of the 1996 lineitem veto statute is consistent with how little the 1974 laws rescission system has been used 51 another concern in terms of budgetary impact of rescissions under the ica is that funds rescinded do not necessarily reduce outlays monies rescinded may simply allow for increased spending elsewhere as acting cbo director marron testified in 2006 under current practice rescissions seem to have been used primarily to pay for other spending rather than to reduce spending overall52 some proposals to modify the ica framework have sought to avoid this outcome the liva provided for lockbox mechanism to ensure that deficit reduction would result from cancellations in 2006 the legislative line item veto act hr 4890 109th congress as passed by the house and title i of the stop over spending act s 3521 109th congress as reported in the senate both specified that amounts rescinded would be dedicated only to deficit reduction and not be used as an offset for spending increase elsewhere53 although many observers do not view modifying the ica framework to give the president expanded rescission authority as an effective means to achieve significant savings or deficit reduction number of studies indicate that governors use the stronger item veto mechanism to favor executive priorities over legislative priorities54 in 1995 during hearings on the line item veto act then cbo director robert reischauer testified that rather than generating much budgetary savings granting the president item veto or enhanced rescission authority would have more important impact in giving presidential spending preference over congressional spending presidents could use expanded rescission authority to redirect greater resources to their own spending agendas55 similar perspective on possible effects of proposals such as those to expand the presidents rescission authority appeared in testimony by gao assistant comptroller general harry havens in 1992 according to mr havens the most significant impact would likely be in the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches and not in budgetary savings various itemveto or rescission 50

president in an area that was reserved to congress by the constitution and which has historically been one of clear legislative primacy56 the experiences in 1992 with the george hw bush administrations rescission proposals and the congressional response as discussed above arguably prove illustrative regarding the subject of competing spending priorities between the president and congress using the existing ica framework president bush transmitted four special messages proposing 128 rescission and totaling almost 79 billion the house and senate appropriations committees reviewed the presidents request and each chamber reported and passed substitute packages conference version containing 82 billion was signed into law containing less than 21 billion of the presidents proposals but over 6 billion in congressionally initiated cuts during senate floor debate on its substitute rescission package in 1992 senator robert byrd chairman of the appropriations committee referred to the presidents recent reference to the wasteful spending of congress and stated the following so to hear the chief executive speak on that occasion to the effect that only congress is guilty of wasteful spending and the president singled out some examples of what he considered to be wasteful spending and the senate has gone along with some of them but the president did not say anything about wasteful spending in the executive branch let bring few examples of wasteful spending to the attention of my colleagues and to the attention of the american people57 senator byrd then proceeded to describe examples of what he termed wasteful executive branch spending included in the senate substitute such as grant from the national science foundation to study sexual aggregation of fish in nicaragua or from nih to study the incidence of dental fear in the population58 supporters of the existing ica framework might note that in 1992 the president was able to gain public attention for his proposed rescissions when congress crafted an alternative package of rescissions largely congressionally initiated and saving more than the presidents requested rescissions the spending priorities of congress ultimately prevailed arguably upholding the power of the purse reviewing the history of impoundments law review article in 1974 stated every president from george washington to richard nixon almost certainly has impounded appropriated funds59 the framework established by the ica in 1974 has provided the opportunity for greater accountability in reporting of rescissions and

for increased congressional oversight and control of impoundment actions although budgetary savings realized from rescissions since 1974 appear modest any budgetary tool that helps restrain spending even in small way may prove useful in time of large budget deficits crs24 appendix impoundment data and reporting requirements until the 1970s accurate and systematic data concerning impoundments were often lacking60 congress first attempted to facilitate the availability of relevant data by stipulating reporting requirements in the federal impoundment and information act of 197261 however there was an initial delay in ombs compliance with the law and subsequent concerns in congress about the completeness of the information provided 62 on march 8 1973 congress sought to tighten up the requirements by requiring quarterly reports on impoundment actions from omb63 the impoundment control act of 1974 established the current reporting requirements as noted above the law requires the president to inform congress of all proposed rescissions and to submit certain information regarding each such action the president may combine several rescission requests in single impoundment message the law also requires the comptroller general of the government accountability office gao to oversee executive compliance with the law and report to congress if the president fails to report an impoundment or improperly classifies an action both the messages from the president and the communications from the comptroller general are to be printed in the federal register and issued as house documents64 section 1014 of the 1974 law also stipulated that the president transmit to congress each month cumulative report on the status of impoundment 60 for example the senate subcommittee on the separation of powers under the late sen sam ervin in 1968 requested complete listing of impoundment actions since 1945 from the bureau of the budget but received only listing of selected examples see

executive order 1184566 although president george w bush has submitted rescission requests to congress there were two deferral requests from the administration in fy2001 and the monthly cumulative reports from omb appeared through september 2001 there have been cumulative reports on rescissions and deferrals since june 17 2002 because there have been presidential messages omb stated in the last report that as of june 1 2002 funds were being deferred67 therefore according to omb pursuant to pl 93344 until such time as the president transmits special message on congress on subsequent rescission proposals or deferrals cumulative reports are required to be transmitted to the congress68 for number of years omb prepared informal reports at the end of each fiscal year which provided convenient resource for compiling aggregate data on rescissions these yearend reports also proved useful as research reference documents since the october cumulative report would commence with the new fiscal year and would not capture actions occurring during september the final month of the previous fiscal year these reports were apparently discontinued in the 1990s69 the house appropriations committee also has compiled data on rescissions in interpreting the respective sources it is necessary to keep in mind that the appropriations committee includes in rescissions approved by congress congressionally initiated actions to cancel funds previously appropriated even in the absence of rescission request by the president the approach used by the appropriations committee makes sense from the perspective of tracking the status of appropriations law and any amendments thereto on the other hand omb in reporting rescissions pursuant to the 1974 law only considers the outcome of rescissions proposed by the president what was requested by the president and what action was taken by congress if any 65 the cumulative reports are published in the federal register and issued as house documents 66 specifically president ford conferred upon the omb director the functions of transmitting copies of the special rescission and deferral messages to the comptroller general and to the office of the federal register and also the responsibility of submitting to the congress the monthly cumulative report us president 19741976 ford executive order 11845 delegating certain reporting

level of interest in rescissions gao decided in 1992 to regularize the data collection and reporting processes with respect to rescissions beginning with submission dated april 30 1992 gao has periodically provided to congress updated rescission data in standardized format one table shows by fiscal year from 1974 to the present the aggregate number and amount of rescissions proposed by the president enacted by congress and initiated by congress with grand totals for each category second table indicates by fiscal year from 1974 to the present by administration the aggregate number and amount of rescissions proposed and enacted as well as those congressionally initiated with grand totals for each category gao acknowledged that the 1992 compilation reflected number of revisions and adjustments to previously submitted historical tables for example we have added several rescissions which were not styled as such in the applicable legislation credited certain rescissions to different fiscal year than we had previously credited them and added additional rescissions which our initial search for various reasons did not discover70 in the letter accompanying the tables gao noted that should the need for further adjustments be identified they would be included in future submissions there was also discussion of scope and methodology for the compilations by gao of the historical data on rescissions71 the most recent submission from gao covers the period from fy1974 to fy200572 most of the figures presented in this report are derived from that 2005 compilation since rescissions were requested in fy2006 discussion sometimes refers to the first six years of the george w bush administration although the formal gao update covering fy2006 has not yet appeared 70
