concentrated nature of federal spending in 2006 the four largest agencies of 51 listed produced 82 of to tal outlays and the six larg est of 19 budget functions produced 84 of total outlays most of the spending by the largest agencies and within the largest budget functions is ither mandatory spending such as social security medicare and income support fense spending or ne t interest spending on federal debt among the largest spending agencies or functions minor reordering has occurred over the six years of data in this report net interest fell as share of total spending and in dollars slipped slightly because of lower interest rates and slow growth in federal debt early in the period net interest began growing again in 2005 the defense function spending grew as money was added for the war on terror and the wars in afghanistan and iraq for the largest agencies the department of health and human services moved from the second spot to the first replaci ng the social security administration as health care costs continued to accelerate the department of defens military moved from fourth to third while the treas ury slipped into four th as net interest payments fell many of the smaller agencies experienced substantial changes in their ranking such as homeland security which moved from 15th to 8th based on its lead role in the war on terror and its funding for hurricane recovery in 2005 and 2006 the concentration of federa l spending in broadly popul ar or necessary activities makes congressional efforts to find nd implement large spending reductions difficult without substan tial reordering of the publics priorities as reflected in the governments allocation of resources or consensus among policy makers to reduce popular spending programs spending reduction efforts seem destined to remain small the result is likely limited effect on overall federal spending or deficit reduction this report will be updated as ne w budget data become availablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33228contents u t l s b g n c y2 u t l s b b u d g t f u n c t i n4 c h n g i n g r n k n d s h r v r t i m 5 b u d g t f u n c t i n s s p r c n t g s f g d p 7 n t

report are fiscal yearsfederal spending by agency and budget function fy2001fy2006 the federal budget is large and of ten confusing compilation of facts proposals estimates and expectations this report compiles portion of the extensive budget information available to focus on the high degree of concentration of federal spending within re latively few areas or agencies total federal spending has grown greatly over the last 21 years from 9464 billion in fy 1985 to 26549 billion in fy20062 in current dollars in constant fy2000 dollars outlays grew from 13957 billion in 1985 to 23136 billion in 2006 est as percentage of gross dom estic product gdp ou tlays have declined from 229 of gdp in 1985 year of recession to 203 of gdp in 2006 in between outlays fell to 184 of gdp in fy2000 year of rapid economic growth before climbing to the 2006 level the government spends this money on an immense number of activities through large number of federal agencies to pr ovide some sense of what this money is spent on and in what amounts this report ranks federal spending by federal agency and by the office of management and b udgets ombs 19 budget functions which omb uses to characterize spending by br oad categories for the years 2001 through 2006 the data are arranged by size from rgest to smallest for agencies and budget functions the data are shown in dolla rs and as percentage s of total spending for budget functions the data are also shown as percentages of gross domestic product gdp the data are from the budget of the united states government for fiscal year 2007 from the omb and from the final monthly treasury statements for various years from the treasury the data clearly show two general patterns to federal spending the first is that most federal spending is and has been over this period concentrated in limited number of agencies and in about third of the budget functions the second pattern is that except for handful of agencies usually smaller ones the relative rank of the various spending categories has change d relatively modestly and slowly over the six years the combination of these two patterns indicates that the distribution of federal spending although always in some flux has been fairly stable over these years one other observation related to the concen tration of federal spending is worth noting other than defense spending the spending of the largest agencies or budget functions is mostly composed of mandato ry or required spending such as social security medicare medicaid federal civilian and military retirement programs andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33228crs2 3 omb budget of the united states govern ment for fiscal year 2006 february 2005 historical tables p 15interest on the debt ombs short defin ition of mandatory spending states that mandatory and related programs include direct spending and offsetting receipts whose budget authority is provided by law other than appropriations acts3 this puts somewhere between 60 and 70 of tota l federal spending outside the annual appropriations debate even the 30 to 40 of the budget that is subject to nnual appropriations is not completely discretionary much of the annual appr opriated amounts are necessary to fulfill legal commitments that the government had entered into in previous time periods such as contracts or other obligations unless congress and the president are willing to eliminate programs and the payroll costs for federal employees that run them certain amount of the annual appropriations is needed for federal salaries in additi on approximately half of the annual appropriated amount goes to defense spending an activity that is difficult to reduce during time of war in effect much less than the 30 to 40 of the budget considered discretionary can be reduced through ppropriations alone tables 1 and 2 rank federal spending by agency including spending for the legislative and judicial branches by amount spent in fy2006 from largest to smallest the other independent agency category in the tables combines the outlays of multitude of relatively small agencies the international assistance program is collection of activities not included in specific agency table 1 contains outlays in millions of dollars and table 2 shows the agencies by their percentages of total outlays in 2006 for example the national science foundation ranked 25th had outlays of 55 billion and accounted for 02089 of total outlays tables 3 and 4 duplicate tables 1 and 2 respectively but are ranked by the 19 federal budget functions in stead of departments and agencies as with the departments and agencies the functions ar arranged in descending order by amount spent in 2006 the natural resources nd environment budget function in 2006 for example had outlays of 331 billion which were 12 of total outlays and ranked 12th out of the 19 budget functions in addition table 5 shows the budget functions by their share of gdp the natural re sources and environment budget function used 027 of gdp in 2006 in 2006 to tal outlays were 2033 of gdp outlays by agency tables 1 and 2 contain 2001 through 2006 outlays listed by the largest amount spent by an agency the department of health and human services hhs to the smallest amount spent by an agency the general services ad ministration and on to those agencies with negative outlays in which the agencys outlays are offset by collections credited to the agency see footnote 5 this ordering of federal spending clearly shows the persistent centration of federal spending in few agencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33228crs3 4 some of the money spent by ssa treasury hhs defense and the other departments and agencies includes internal payments within th government itself to avoid counting these internal payments in total ou tlays which represent governme nt expenditures to the public they are offset either against the spending of the government recipient or are subtracted from outlays through the undistributed offsetting r eceipts category negative outlay am ount found at the bottom of the list in each table the treasury is somewhat of special case without the inclusion of total interest payments on federal debt in its totals its outlays drop in 2006 from 464 billion to 58 billion and 22 of total outlays adding the net interest portion of total interest to this noninterest portion of treasury outlays produces modified 2006 treasury spending of 285 billion 107 of total outlays an amount substantially larger than the next largest agency the department of agriculture 5 negative outlays usually as offsetting rece ipts keep the totals from exceeding 100 of total outlays see footnote 5 6 negative outlays or offsetting receipts genera lly refer to collections by one agency from continuedwhen combined the four largest departments and agencies hhs the social security administration ssa defe nsedod and the treasury spent 2136 billion or 815 of the total outlays in 20064 the smallest of these four the treasury 4643 billion spent almost five times as much as the department of agriculture 954 billion which ranks righ t below the treasury in spending the department spending the most hhs 6143 billion spent 10 times what the tenth largest the department of transporta tion 601 billion spent in 2006 the two largest hhs and ssa each spent over 22 of total outlays in 2006 the dod almost reached 19 of total outlays in 2006 the treasury spent 175 of total outlays the next department in order agriculture spent 35 of total outlays showing the large gulf between the four larg est agencies and all others in the amounts spent the next 14 departments or agencies in the table spent over 10 billion but less than 100 billion in 20065 their combined spending was 6634 billion 250 of total outlays the 11 departments and agencies spending more than 1 billion but less than 10 billion including the judicial and legislative branches produced total outlays of 639 billion and 24 of total outlays in 2006 these 11 combined spent slightly more than the office of personne l management alone ranked ninth in the list the final group of agencies with positive outlays group of 16 each spent less than 10 billion this groups combined outlays were only 65 billion and just 024 of total outlays in 2006 the amount spent by these 16 for fy2006 was little more than the amount spent by the partment of commer ce 64 billion and approximately what hhs spent on av erage in just under four days the sum of the percentages of total outla ys spent by the agencies with positive outlays equals 1092 of tota l outlays for 2006 the remaining six agencies with negative outlays also called offsetting outlays or offsetting receipts plus the negative outlays from the undistributed of fsetting receipts category produced 2431 billion in outlay offsets 92 of total outla ys adding these offsetting outlays to total positive outlays produces to tal net outlays for 2006 of 26549 billion6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33228crs4 6 continued another agency and collections from the public that have businesslike or marketlike nature these are then credited to appropria tion or fund accounts offsetting receipts are deposited in receipt accounts but are used to offs et outlays rather than being added to total federal receipts 7 undistributed offsetting receipts uor are not defined or measured the same way in the two sets of tables in tables 1 and 2 the uor include almost all of the outlay offsets in the government accounts very few are offset against the spending in the departments and agencies in tables 3 4 and 5 many of the offsets are included within the various functions producing amounts in the functions th at are essentially net outlays the uor in these three tables represents relatively sm all amount of offsets th at are not distributed among the functions for various reasonsoutlays by budget function as mentioned earlier tables 3 and 4 list the budget functions ranked in descending order of outlays for 2006 for th six fiscal years 2001 through 2006 the data in these tables make similar point to those in tables 1 and 2 the bulk of federal outlays are concentrated in re latively few large functions although not showing quite the same concentration as the agency listing the six largest budget functions out of 19 account for 844 of total outlays these six functions include the major mandatory spending pr ograms of the federal government plus defense and net interest sp ending substantially increased spending within the community and regional development function resulting from federal hurricane recovery efforts reduced slightly the concen tration of federal spe nding in the largest six functions in fy2006 in 2005 the six rgest functions cont ained 852 of total spending which fell to 844 of total spending in 2006 the smallest of the six largest budget functions net inte rest produced over 85 of total outlays in 2006 and its share is expected to keep rising while the seventh largest function in the list ducation training employment and social services produced almost 45 of total outlays thr ee other of the remaining budget functions individually produced more than 2 of total outlays the 12 smaller budget functions excluding offs etting receipts gene rated 18 of total outlays in 2006 and funded all other federal activities the six largest functions use such large share of total spending that even if they were reduced by the amount of the undistributed offsetting receipts which in the budget function listing is mostly federal agency payments of the employer share of federal employee retirement they w ould still account for almost 82 of total outlays7 total federal outlays were 203 of gdp in 2006 the largest budget function social security was 42 of gdp as w ith their share of total outlays the six largest functions accounted for most of fe deral spending as share of gdp by substantial amount the largest six co mbined were 172 of gdp in 2006 the remaining 12 functions with positive outlays made up 37 of gdp in that year undistributed offsetting recei pts were 05 of gdp table 5 shows the budget functions as percentages of gdp for each of the six yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33228crs5 changing rank and share over time some of the agencies and few of th budget functions shifted their rank over the 2001 to 2006 period while many gained or lost share of total outlays or gdp without change in rank these change s resulted from policy choices and external forces such as the war on terrorism and changing economic conditions respectively acting on the budget the four agencies with the largest outlays in 2006 were also the four largest in 2001 although their order changed with hhs and ssa swapping rank as did dod and treasury health care costs grew faster than social security moving hhs to the top while slower fede ral debt growth and lower interest rates early in the period and higher defense spending raised dod military above treasury the combined share for the four largest agencies fell from 840 in 2001 to 816 in 2006 the fall in the treasurys share of total spending due to the fall in net interest outlays explains almost all of the decline for these four agencies reduction in the ssas share contributed to the fall while growth in the dods share more than covered the ssa reduction the reversal in 2005 of the fouryear fall in net interest within the department of the treasury and the expectation that net interest and gross interest will continue growing has increased the chances of higher future concentrations of federa l spending in these four agencies along with interest payments social security and federal health spending are also expected to rise as shares of total outlays the outlays of the three largest agenci combined were 632 of total outlays in 2001 rising to 640 in 2006 which was down from their peak of 659 of total outlays in 2004 these three agencies hhs ssa and dod produced almost two thirds of total federal spending over this period231 229232237 235 234 221227248 231235243 188 156165180191 192 175184 166208 170164 124 117115

from 15th to 8th place in the list of agencies8 one of the larger changes in rank moved the executive office of the president from 35th place in 2001 to 26th place in 2006 the executive office of the presidents responsibility for the iraq relief reconstr uction fund produced most of the rise in its rank the small business administration sba shifted from producing offse tting outlays negative outlays in 2001 to positive outlays in 2002 through 2006 moving it to 30th place out of 45 departments or agencies with positive outlays in 2006 the postal service went the other way dropping in the rankings from 28th to 49th and from having positive outlays in 2001 to having offsetting outlays in 2006 it first had negative outlays in 2003 the six largest budget functions social security defense income security net interest medicare and health contain almost as much federal spending and most of the same activities as the top four agencies the combined share for these six budget functions was 861 in 2001 and 844 in 2006 excluding the net interest function from the top six still produced threequarters or more of total outlays 750 of total outlays in 2001 nd 758 of total outlays in 2006 the concentration of fede ral spending can be expect ed to increase in the near future as the federal programs for the elderly such as social security and medicare expand in res ponse to the comin g retirement of the babyboom generation the expected faster growth in federal debt resulting from persistent deficits along with higher interest rates may also raise net interest spending as share of total outlays in 2006 spending for hurricane recovery incr eased spending outside the largest four departments and six functions by enough to drive down their cumulative share of total outlays207232

the five years growing from 164 in 2001 to 199 in 2006 the defense function reached 204 of total outlays in 2005 see table 4 for listing of the 19 budget functions showing their share of total outlays

spending has grown faster than the economy over these six years its growth in 2006 in relation to gdp was smaller than most of the other years in the period of the overall increase national defense increased its share by 10 of gdp increases in the shares of three other functions medicare health and education training employment and social services produced much of the remaining increase in total

cumulative share of gdp was 159 in 2001 and 171 in 2006 the changes for the most part occurred over limited range none of the functions changed its share of gdp by more than 1 the national defense function increased its share by exactly 1 most of the functions had changes of less than 04 of gdp many much less changing the scale in figure 3 to show total outlays over the period ie extending the

defense spending grew rapidly in the early years of the period from historically low levels as the funding for the war on rror grew but leveled off in 2005 and 2006 income security rose from 27 of gdp in 2001 to 31 of gdp in 2003 before falling back to 27 of gdp in 2006 funding in this function increased with the economic sluggishness in the early years of the decade net interest fell from 20 of gdp in 2001 to 14 of gdp in 2003 and 2004 before rising to 17 of gdp in 2006 trend that is likely to continue and may accelerate the slow growth in federal debt nd low interest rates in the early 2000s reduced the share of gdp used for net interest medicare continued its fairly steady increase as share of gdp although social security fell slightly as share of gdp over these years this trend is unlikely to continue for long the coming retirement of the baby boom generation beginning early in the next decade will increase under current policy spending for social security at rate fast enough
