draft introduction ii introduction the federal interagency community has develo ped 15 allhazards planning scenarios the national planning scenarios or scenarios for use in national federa l state and local homeland security preparedness activities the scenarios are planning tools and are representative of the range of potential terrorist attacks and natural disa sters and the related impacts that face our nation the objective was to develop minimum number of credible scenarios in order to establish the range of response requirements to facilitate preparedness planning since these scenarios were compiled to be the minimum number necessary to develop the range of response capabilities and res ources other hazards were inevitably omitted examples of other potentially highimpact even ts include nuclear pow er plant incidents1 industrial and transportation accidents and fre quently occurring natural disasters entities at all levels of government can us the national planning scenarios as reference to help them identify the potential scope magnitude and complexity of potential major events entities are not precluded from developing their own scenarios to supplement the national planning scenarios these scenarios reflect rigorous analytical effort by federal homeland security experts with reviews by state and local homeland s ecurity representatives however it is recognized that refinement and revision ove r time will be necessary to ensure the scenarios remain accurate represent the evolvi ng allhazards threat picture and embody the capabilities necessary to re spond to domestic incidents how to use the national planning scenarios capabilitiesbased planning in seeking to prepare the nation for terrori st attacks major disasters and other emergencies it is impossible to maintain the highest level of preparedness for all possibilities all of the time given limited resources managing the risk posed by major events is imperative in an atmosphere of changing and evolvi ng threat it is vital to build flexible capabilities that will enable the na tion as whole to prevent respond to and recover from range of majo r events to address this ch allenge the department of homeland security dhs employs capabili tiesbased planning process that occurs under uncertainty to identify capabilities suitable for wide range of challenges and circumstances while working within an economic framework that necessitates prioritization and choice as first step in the capabilitiesbased planning process the scenarios while not exhaustive provide an illustration of th potential threats for which 1 severe incident at nuclear power plant whether or not it is terroristinitiated could result in release of radioactive materials to the environment with adverse consequences to public health scenarios for such severe incidents have not been included in this scenario set because 1 current federal regulations from the nuclear regulatory commission and the dhs fede ral emergency management agency fema mandate robust emergency planning and preparedness for each nuclear plant to include the full range of response organizations and 2 scenarios for nuclear plants cannot be generically extrapolated to other type s of facilities eg chemical plants national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft introduction iii we must be prepared the scenarios were designed to be broa dly applicable they generally do not specify geographic location and the impacts are meant to be scalable for variety of population and geographic considerations hspd8 implementation the scenarios will be used in the implementation of the homeland security presidential directive hspd8 national preparedness including the development of the national preparedness goal and the national exercise program in helping to develop the national preparedness goal the scenarios provide th foundation for identifying the capabilities across all mission areas and the target levels of those capabilities needed for effective prevention response and recovery to majo r events such as t hose outlined in the scenarios examination of the scenarios lead s to certain common func tions that must be accomplished the need for response organizations to move quickly and in coordinated manner and the requirements to quickly trea t mass casualties and to assist displaced residents are examples this commonality implies flexible adaptive and robust capabilities to cope with di verse events and hazards in addition the scenarios will be used as th design basis for exercises in the national exercise program as common foundation fo r exercise development the scenarios reduce the possibility that agencies exercising the same basic type of event will exercise greatly different consequences which may lead to vastly different capability requirements and preparedness expectations while not meant to be allinclusive the scenarios provide basic set of common homeland security events and their related impacts that can be employed at the national level or by states and localities although certain areas have special concernsfor example continuity of government in washington dc viability of financial markets in new york and trade and commerce in other major citiesthe scenarios have been developed in way that allows them to be adapted to local conditions agencies will not be limited to this set of scenarios and they will continue to be able to exercise scenarios that are not specifically included in the planning set however when exercising the basic events in cluded in the scenario set the scenarios provide mutual starting point general considerations for the scenarios future development of prequels the goal of the part i of the scenarios is to flesh out response capabilitie s and needs not threatbased prevention activities for the terr orist attack scenarios dhs in coordination with the federal interagency community has developed detaile d prequels to the scenarios including information on the perpetra tor the universal adversary ua to help further prevention related planning and preparedness efforts the ua prequels are published as part ii and part iii of the scenario set national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft introduction iv scenario outline each scenario in the national planning scen arios follows the same general outline which is as follows scenario overview general description detailed attack scenario or detailed scenario when ua is not present planning considerations geographical consider ationsdescription timelineevent dynamics meteorological conditions where applicable assumptions mission areas activated implications secondary hazardsevents fatalitiesinjuries property damage service disruption economic impact longterm health issues intelligence disclaimer while the scenarios developed generally refl ect possible terrorist capabilities and known tradecraft neither the intelligence commun ity nor the law enforcement community is aware of any credible specific intelligence th at indicates that such an attack is being planned or that the agents or devices in question are in possession of any known terrorist group relative grouping of scenarios depending on the ultimate use various schemes have been used in the past to rank scenarios based on probability number of casualties extent of property damage economic impact and social disruption because the scenarios represent range in casualty numbers and property damage the scenarios do not include all events that would produce high morbidity and mortality multiple events as there is possibility that multiple incide nts will occur simultaneously or sequentially organizations should always consider the need to respond to multiple incidents of the same type and multiple incidents of different types at either the same or other geographic locations in preparedness planning efforts these incidents will invariably require the coordination and cooperation of homeland security res ponse organizations across multiple regional state and local jurisdictions national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft introduction v economic impacts any decision in response to one of the disasterterrorist scenarios to close the us border with canada or mexico would have potential ly enormous economic consequences thus any key decision to close border must ta ke into account those costs in assessing economic loss associated with the incident such calculation might determine that the costs of closing the border would outstrip whatever would be gained by closing the border especially in those cases pandemic influenza plague where closing the border would not effectively stop the spread of disease but perhaps only impede its advance for limited period of time national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft introduction vi mission areas the following mission areas were used to assi st in scoping the response requirements generated by the scenarios preventiondeterrence the ability

geographical considerationsdescription this scenario postulates 10kiloton nuclear detonation in large tropolitan area the effects of the damage from the blast th ermal radiation prom pt radiation and the subsequent radioactive fallout have been calculated based on detonation in washington dc and the details are presented in appendix 1a however the calculation is general enough th at most major cities in the united states can be substituted in relatively straightforward ma nner enough information is presented in the appendix to allow for this kind of extrapolation1 the radioactive plume track depends strongly on the local wind patterns and other we ather conditions in situation where the wind direction cycles on re gular basis or other wind an omalies are present caution should be exercised in directly using the fallout contours presented in the appendix if the incident happened near the us bor der there would be need for cooperation between the two border governments additio nally the ind attack may warrant the closure of us borders for some period of time if the detonation occurs in coastal city the fallout plume may be carried out over th water causing subsequent reduction in casualties on the other hand the surrounding wate r will likely restrict the zones that are suitable for evacuation bridges and tunnels th at generally accompany coastal cities will restrict the evacuation causing delay and an increase in the radioactive dose that evacuees receive this delay may be substan tial and the resulting dose increase may drive decision to shelterinplace or ev acuateinstages this assumes that the authorities have an effective comm unication channel with the public timelineevent dynamics the response timeline will begin the instant the detonation occurs initially only survivors in the immediate area will conduct rescue nd lifesaving activities later minutes to hours rescue team s will begin to arrive and provide assistance these initial efforts are likely to be uncoordinated with the current state of education training and equipment it is likely that many of these respon ders will subject themselves to very large perhaps incapacitating or fatal doses of ra diation as various command posts are set up which may take hours to days the res ponse will become mo re coordinated the productivity of rescue and direct lifesavi ng activities will decr ease significantly as function of time and will be very low within couple of days for nuclear detonation the actual occurre nce of injuries does not stop when the immediate blast effects have subsided th most critical components of the post detonation response may not be the lifesaving efforts that assist the victims directly injured by the detonation instead it is likely that the most effective lifesaving activities will be those that address the evacuation or shelterinplace decisions for the potential victims in the immediate fallout path the effective communication of instructions to the affected population and the efficient decont amination of the evacu ated population as soon as possible following the explosion screen ing and decontamination efforts need to 1 consequence report for 10kiloton nuclear tonation in washington dc february 10 2004 national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 1 nuclear detonation 10 kiloton improvised nuclear device 13 be established timely decontamination of highly contaminated individuals is expected to drastically reduce casualties starting almo st immediately and continuing for the first few days selfdirected evacuation will occur and is likely to be the most prevalent protective action taken decontamination of pe ople will be most im portant early in the incident but will continue throughout the entire proce ss including site cleanup and remediation longterm activities associat ed with environmen tal decontamination monitoring and sampling will last many years decontamina tion will be by far the most expensive economic impact of the ind attack within the first few hours to days monitori ng must be performed to delineate fallout boundaries normalize and verify predictive models and provide assurances that populated areas are safe after public contamin ation and initial evacuation issues have been addressed incident management res ources will shift to s upporting ground surveys conducting sampling efforts and managing the disposition of human remains medical followup activities will need to be conduc ted on those people exposed to the radiation or fallout and on thos that may receive drugs to reduce exposure to internal contamination these drugs are in extremel short supply and are not effective on most radioactive isotopes documentation of these cases will provide significant challenges but will be required for longterm health reasons and to address legal issues the exposure to large doses of radiation w ill produce an increased longterm risk of cancer for the exposed people see appendix 1a and appendix 1b these cases will need to be monitored and treated for many years assumptions the explosion produces nuclear yield of 10 kilotons from device that uses heu as the fissile material the prompt effects of the detonation c over an approximately circular area of devastation and the degree of destruction tapers off with increasing distance from ground zero the device is detonated at ground level the computer code used for calculating casualty projections assumes that the population exposed to the fallout radiation is not evacuated or sheltered for the first 96 hours this is because the code is not able to track the complexities that would otherwise arise this is certai nly not recommended protective action immediate protective actions will greatly re duce fatalities and injuries from the exposure to the radiation the weather is clearthere is light ze and light breeze with snow or cloud cover casualties are calculated without consider ing the shelterings hielding effects of buildings this is true for both the blast and radiation effects casualties are calculated without consid ering the hazards of secondary effects such as building collapses or secondary fires national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 1 nuclear detonation 10 kiloton improvised nuclear device 14 panic and the lack of traffic contro l signals may contribute to traffic fatalitiesinjuries in either directed or selfdirected evacuation workers may be reluctant to perform thei r jobs due to fears of radiation or contamination electricity and other servi ces are disrupted across much of the affected area service will be restored to all but the immediate detonation area within 10 to 20 days following the explosion services in the immediate area of the explosion will not be available for significantly longer time due to radioactive contamination of the area and the extent of the damage there will be disruption of communications making it difficult to provide safety information to the public in timely manner the largest radiation concerns following an ind incident will be the prompt radiation gamma and neut ron and the gamma dose received from the ground shine radioactive particles deposited on the ground as people are evacuated from the fallout areas mission areas activated preventiondeterrence law enforcement will attempt to prevent th importation of nuclear device components as well as the assembly delivery and det onation of the device after the detonation officers will provide reconna issance protection and dete rrence measures at the boundaries of the site perimeters will need to be established to prevent entry into the contaminated zone this will require trai ned personnel and spec ialized equipment officers will respond to reports of potential threats provi increased surveillance at vulnerable sitesevents inve stigate threats enforce cu rfews and exclusion boundaries and manage other law enforcement issues eg looting theft of private property it is likely that the national guard and perhaps the military will be involved directly in these areas declaration of martia l law may be considered emergency assessmentdiagnosis the detonation will be instantly recognized as nuclear blast by both local observers and national assets this will initiate severa l response and contingency plans and bring federal assistance due to its location it is likel that the local emergency operations center eoc will be significantly affected by the detonation should it survive intact and operational it will be stressed to its lim its actions of incident command and eoc personnel should include dispatching respons units making incident scene reports detecting and identifying the source establishing perimeter collecting information making hazard assessments and predictions coordinating hospita l and urgent care facilities coordinating count and state response requests and coordinating monitoring surveying and sampling operations demand for these assets will be great it is likely that state and other local eocs in surrounding ar eas will be needed to support response efforts national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 1 nuclear detonation 10 kiloton improvised nuclear device 15 emergency managementresponse one of the most critical factors that may reduce subsequent fatalities and injuries following detonation will be the speed and ap propriateness of the evacuationshelterin place decisions that are made and the eff ectiveness of the dissemination of this information this is largescale incident with many casualties and radiation exposures in the downwind hazard area actions of in cidentsite eoc and jic personnel should include alerting activating and notifying prov iding traffic and access control protecting atrisk and special populations supporting requests for assistance directing and controlling critical infrastruc ture assets and directing publ ic information activities there will be radiological emergency response teams from federal and various state and local governments that will converge on the area to provide general assistance support rescue and recovery efforts help delineate and survey the areas for contamination assist in decontamination activities and provide radiological information to local decision makers the location and removal of injured and disabled people will be significant undertaking that will be greatly complicated by the need to k eep the radiation dose of the individual workers as low as reasonably achievable lara certainly rescue operations will quickly reach th point of diminishing return s victims will continue to absorb radiation doses while waiting on rescue and this will result in an increased likelihood of fatality in limited manpower s ituation where the total integrated dose that can be absorbed by the finite number of trained and equipped response workers is fixedas it is likely to be during the first fe w hours after the incidentthe value of these rescue activities will need to be weighed against the value of preventing or reducing future exposure of people in the highdose fallout regions downwind it is essential that emergency response work ers be educated trained and equipped to deal with this situation emergency workers enteri ng highradiation areas in the first few days after the detonation are likely to receive thal doses of radiation personal protective equipment ppe is used to control contam ination but does not protect workers from external radiation doses if work ers are exposed to contaminated particles in the air ie resuspension then device to protect them from breathing this contamination is required eg respirator or selfcontai ned breathing apparatus personal electronic dosimetery and turnback levels ie dose leve ls that have been calculated to account for the time it takes the worker to evacuate th radiation zone while still not exposing the worker to doses that exceed safe value are essential for all workers entering the contaminated area hazard mitigation the extent of radioactive fallout contamina tion will present major challenge one of the biggest factors that may reduce the subsequent fatalities and injuries will be the speed and appropriateness of evacuationshelterinplace protective action decisions that are made and the effectiveness of the dissemination of this informa tion close to the site of detonation there will be little time to institu any protection for the population from the fallout radiation as the distance increases there will be more time to get instructions disseminated on evacuation or shelterinp lace guidelines however information distribution will be greatly hampered by power outages and damaged electronic national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 1 nuclear detonation 10 kiloton improvised nuclear device 16 equipment since information dissemination will be difficult it is likely that self evacuation will be the dominant protective action taken in th short term 24 hours after detonation authorities ma resort to loudspeakers mount ed on vehicles to help disseminate information as the distance from the detonation increases the time to react increases the total possible dose from the fallout decreases the population density decreases and the likelihood of the infrastruc ture remaining intact increases all these factors imply that protective actions will have greater effect in reducing injuries as the distance from the detonation increases however by far the greatest factor impacting the reduction of the effects of the detona tion on the general population will remain the speed and appropriateness of the decisi ons that are made and the effectiveness of the dissemination of this information another critical mitigation activity will be the prompt decontamination of people being evacuated local fire departments may be best equipped to deal with personnel decontamination which will consist of the re moval of contaminated clothes and washing in water however the water supply may be limited unfortunately fire departments will be taxed dealing with essent ial firefighting and rescue du ties clean clothes andor blankets will be needed for modesty and in cold weather exposure reasons it should also be noted that the pub lic will strongly resist leavi ng personal items eg wallets keys purses pictures jewelry be hind in the contaminated zone actions of incidentsite personnel should in clude isolating the incident scene and defining the hazard areas establishing incident command pres erving the scene providing mitigation efforts fighting fires decontaminating responders and equipment and conducting site remediation and monitoring evacuationshelter evacuation andor sheltering of downwind populations will be required actions of the incidentsite localarea and eoc pers onnel should includ monitoring and decontaminating evacuees protecting school s and day care facili ties and providing shelterreception facilities victim care tens of thousands will require decontamination and both shortterm and longterm treatment in addition the evacuated popula tion will require shelter and food for the indefinite future health care facilities and emergency workers in the affected area will be overwhelmed to adequately address the care and treatment of victims trained medical health care workers from outside the affected area will be needed actions of incident site eoc and localarea hospital pe rsonnel should include the following making and communicating pr otective action decisions providing emergency medical services ems implementing medical triage treatment and stabilization of casualties performing search and rescue fire police and ems performing patient screen ing and decontamination national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 1 nuclear detonation 10 kiloton improvised nuclear device 17 implementing decisions to administer prophylaxis to the ffected populations transporting injured patients reporting patient status treating walkin radiation victims collecting and identifying human rema ins coroner and morgue functions including the potential for remains to be residually radioactive providing nextofkin notifications the level of care that can be expected may be significantly lower than would normally be expected this may well contribute to largerthanexpected number of casualties officials and care providers s hould discuss these issues before any such incident takes place triage will be major issue for care provide rs among other things this will require the determination of which victims may benef it from medical attention and which have received radiation doses that make it unlikely th at they will survive while there are post exposure methods to measure dose levels these methods ar unlikely to be widely available during an incident of this nature this is due to the extremely limited national capability for these tests and to the complex ity of the laboratory procedures required in this situation it is lik ely that the best that can be done is to note the delay between the exposure and the onset of visible symptoms eg vomiting as rule of thumb the sooner the onset of the symptoms the highe r the dose received and the less likely the victim is to survive investigationapprehension there will be national political pressure on government officials to expedite the attribution process and for th subsequent response for nuclear detonation attribution activities at the detonation site will rely larg ely on scientific forensic techniques and will be provided by specialized national teams in addition the inte lligence community will be pressured for information relating to the incident actions of incidentsite personnel will include site control and criminal inves tigation federal authorities including the military will probably conduct apprehension activities recoveryremediation decontaminationcleanup approximately 8000 square kilometers 3000 square miles may be contaminated to some level including urban suburban rural recreational industrial and agricultural ar eas expected radiation levels will limit the total time workers can spend in the affected area quickly leading to shortage of willing qualified and trained workers when worker reaches this limit heshe must be rotated to job where dose is received or sent home the volume of contaminated material that will be removed will overwhelm the national hazardous waste disposal facilities and will severely challenge the nations ability to transport the material this effort will be the most expensive and timeconsuming part of recovery and will likely cost many billi ons of dollars and take many years national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 1 nuclear detonation 10 kiloton improvised nuclear device 18 site restoration large area centered on ground zero will be destroyed there will be varying degrees of damage in an approximately 100squarekilometer 40 squaremile area some degree of decontam ination will be required in very large area that will have to be determined by the authorities they will have to weigh the costs of the cleanup agai nst the political realit ies of the situation implications it is extremely difficult to estimate the true implications of terrorist use of nuclear device on us city the personal loss of loved ones would be immeasurable the health consequences to the population directly impacted would be severe the physical damage to the community would be extreme the costs of the decontamination and rebuilding would be staggering but these losses do not begin to address the true implications of this type of an incident th detonation of an ind in us city would forever change the american psyche as we ll as its politics nd worldview the real implications may only be addressable by hi storians many years after the incident secondary hazardsevents the detonation will cause many secondary zards the intense heat of the nuclear explosion and other subseque nt causes will produce numer ous fires located throughout the immediate blast zone damaged buildi ngs downed power and phone lines leaking gas lines broken water mains and weakened bridges and tunnels are just some of the hazardous conditions that will need to be ssessed depending on the type of industries present such as chemical or petroleum production industrial stor age facilities and manufacturing operations there could be sign ificant releases of hazardous materials another secondary effect of nuclear explos ion is the electromagnetic pulse emp that will be produced by the ionization and subsequent acceleration of electrons from the air and other materials by the intense radiation of the detonation this emp is sharp high voltage spike that radiates out from the detonation site it s the potential to disrupt the communication network other electronic equi pment and associated systems within approximately 5kilometer 3mile ra nge from the 10kilo ton ground blast the range of these effects is highly dependent on th details of the detonation and the type of electronics involved however the duration of the emp is ve ry short and there are residual effects standalone equipment that is undamaged from the pulse will continue to function afterward however most electronic devices depend on exte rnal infrastructures eg the electrical power grid cell towers broadcasting stations computer networks switching stations in order to function these infrastructure s are far more vulnerable to emp than most standalone electronic devices it is possible that these infrastructure systems will be damaged at significantly larger distances than isolated electrical equipment there likely will be significant damage to the general public support infrastructure with potentially cascading effects these systems include transportation lines and nodes eg air water rail highway power generation and distribu tion systems communications systems food distribution and fuel storage an d distribution there will be concerns about the safety and reliability of many structures eg dams vees nuclear power plants national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 1 nuclear detonation 10 kiloton improvised nuclear device 19 hazardous material storage facilities structur may be damaged that are used to provide essential services eg hospitals schools in addition to the direct physical health effects caused by the nuclear detonation the subsequent trauma may have significant ps ychological impact on survivors this may impede the ability of local offi cials to mount an initial response to the incident there will certainly be economic political law forcement civil liberty and military consequences that will likely change the very nature of the country fatalitiesinjuries full description of the fatalities and injuries for nuclear detonation is difficult and complicated there will be casualties directly associated with the blast which will cause translationtumbling the human body being thrown and subsequent impacts of people and other objects nuclear detonation will also produce great deal of thermal heat energy that will cause burns to exposed skin and eyes under certain circumstances these burns may occur over large distances th ere are two general cat egories of nuclear radiation produced in detonation first is the socalled promp t nuclear radiation arbitrarily defined as being emitted within th first minuteit is actually produced as the device detonates or shortly thereafter for 10kiloton blast this radiation may expose unprotected people within distan ce of few kilometers c ouple of miles to extremely large gamma ray andor neutron doses in addition detonation of nuclear device near the surface of the ground will result in great deal of fallout i n the form of dirt particles that is radioactively contaminated this fallout will settle out of the radioactive cloud over period of time mostly in the first week s by far the most dangerously radioactive fallout will be deposited near the detonation site and will happen within the first couple of hours after detonation fa llout will exponentia lly decay with time but may expose many people to large doses and will certainly contaminate large areas of land for years many fatalities and injuries wi ll result from combination of these various effects historically early emergency response effort s have been focused on the lifesaving needs close to the emergency site however for nuclear detonation other actions need to be taken downwind where the plume will deposit radioactive fallout perhaps the greatest potential impact on saving lives will be ac tivities immediately following the detonation that address the reduction of the future radiation dose that will be received by the population in the fallout zone immediately downwind of ground zero decision makers may have to weigh the benefits of focusing on this problem versus that of the direct lifesaving activities in the blast area it mu st be noted that all people including the emergency response workers entering the high radiation areas near th blast site have significant probability of receiving large likely fatal radiation doses authorities will be faced with making these realtime decisions as well as many other decisions with insufficient and often cont radictory information the largest radiation concerns following an i nd incident will be the prompt radiation gamma ray and neutron and the gamma dose received from the ground shine radioactive particles deposited on the ground as people are evacuated from the fallout areas these effects are likely to have significantly larger impacts on the population than national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 1 nuclear detonation 10 kiloton improvised nuclear device 110 internal doses internal doses tend to expos the body to relatively small radiation doses over long period of time which produces di fferent effects than large radiation doses received during short period of time s ee appendix 1a the figures used for casualties in the appendix are based on ac ute external radiation doses but are conservative ie high the conservative nature of the calculation will tend to compensate for not explicitly including the internal radiation dose effects as the distance from ground zero increases past 20 kilometers 12 miles the injuries due to acute radiation exposure ie from prompt radiation and th subsequent fallout will decrease and lowerlevel contaminati on evacuation and sheltering issues will become the major concern in general at di stances greater than 250 kilometers 150 miles from ground zero of 10kiloton nuclear detonation acute health concerns will not be significant issue however contam ination of people and the environment will still be concern years later there will still be health conseque nces in the form of increased probabilities of cancers in the exposed population the number of these cancers will likely run into the thousands and will extract large human social and financial cost for more information see appendix 1a and appendix 1b property damage it is likely that the blast and subsequent fi res will destroy all buildings in the immediate area of the detonation histori cally decontamination of site s involves the removal of all affected material often this includes th surface of the ground to depth of several inches over the entire area that has been contaminated therefore most buildings in the immediate downwind fallout path will likely ve to be destroyed in the decontamination effort as the distance from the detonation si increases the contamination level will decrease at some distance the buildings will not have to be dest royed and removed but will still require decontamination of all aff ected surfaces this decontamination process will take years and will be extremely expensive the decontamination will produce far greater challenge and cost much more th an the actual rebuildi ng of the destroyed structures approximately 8000 square kilome ters 3000 square miles of land will have to undergo varying degrees of decontamination this effort will last for many years and will cost many billions of dollars to complete for more information see appendix 1a and appendix 1b service disruption service disruption will be extensive in the area near ground zero and in the fallout path for several miles downwind servic in these areas will not be restored for years because the land affected will not be returned to us until the decontamination is complete and the structures rebuilt service disruption will be much less dramatic in areas that are less severely contaminated or not contaminated at all national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 1 nuclear detonation 10 kiloton improvised nuclear device 111 the electrical power grid is likely to be damaged by transients produced by the destruction of substations as well as other power production and distribution installations and perhaps by the emp of the tonation it is likely th at the grid damage may cause power outages over wide areas perh aps over several states but these outages should be repaired within seve ral days to couple of week s the communi cation systems in the area will suffer similar damage and will likely be repaired within similar timeframes city water mains will likely survive without major damage this is because they are largely underground and therefore somewhat pr otected it is possible that some lines will be broken directly by the detonation and also some damage sustained in subsequent building collapse however this damage should be relatively minor and localized the city water supply is unlikely to become subs tantially contaminated with radiation via water main breaks but it is possible that some small amount of radioactive and non radioactive contamination ma enter the lines contamina tion of the water supply by radioactive impurities in the water neutron activa tion will not be significant issue it is possible that radioactive fall out may be deposited into the watershed used by the city this will have to be measured before the water can be used all government services will be impacted over some geographical area these services may include but are not limited to education mail law

by the department of energy doe national nuclear security administration nnsa office of emergency res ponse and sandia national laboratory summary this appendix describes set of possible consequences calculated for 10kiloton nuclear blast including its prompt effects occu rring within the first minute and fallout it should be emphasized that the results of this calculation ar strongly dependent on the initial assumptions this report is intended to assist in preparing to address the consequences of terrorist attack so the assumptions used in this calculation are conservative and produce an upper limit on the number of fatalities and casualties that might be expected the results of the calculation reported in this appendix are from the detonation in the central business district of washington dc of 10kiloton uranium235 guntype nuclear device table 11 summarizes selected input parameters for the calculation the actual meteorological data used in the calculation consisted of wind speed direction and temperature as function of ltitude these data were deter mined as typical by examining both surface wind and upper air measurements reco rded at the citys airport over the course of year the detonation is assumed to take place during working hours 1000 am on weekday the population distribu tion is based on us census nighttime data with two additional population densities added in order to represent the workday influx into the center of the city specifically 481000 people we re added inside 5kilometer 3mile radius of the detonation site and 220000 additional people were added

mechanisms producing thes effects can be categorized as blast radiation and thermal energy figures 11 through 14 and tables 11 through 13 summarize the effects of the 10kiloton nucl ear detonation the rings in figure 11 represent blast overpressure contours from th explosion blast fatalities and injuries result from translationtumbling the hu man body being thrown translationimpact items impacting the human body lung damage and eardrum rupture the calculations assume that people are exposed to the blast wave in the most hazardous orientation and therefore the number of casua lties reported is an upper lim it table 12 tabulates the casualty estimates for the population with in the contour rings of figure 11 additional fatalities and casualties are likely to occur from thermal burns which have not been calculated the relative contributions of the casualties due to blast and thermal injuries strongly depend on th details of the local envi ronment and cannot easily be modeled or incorporated into the calculations to firs t approximation it is reasonable assumption that the overestimation of blast in juries provides reasonable estimate of the likely numbers of blast and thermal injuries combined figure 12 shows selected prompt effects of the detonation as function of distance from ground zero these include the peak overpress ure thermal fluence and both moderate and severe building damage severe damage means the building either collapsed or cannot be further used without essentially reconstructing it mode rate damage means that unless major repairs are made the struct ure cannot be used for its intended purpose there are two main sources of the ionizing radi ation that cause radiat ioninduced injuries and fatalities the first is the prompt radiation produced by the detonation itself and which by arbitrary definition occurs within the first minute afte r the detonation the second is the radiation emitted by the radioactiv fallout both of these taken together will hereafter be referred to simply as r adiation exposure the contours in figures 13 and 14 represent the dose equivalent in roen tgen equivalent man rem that would be received by unprotected individu als who remain in the radiation area for 24 hours acute effects and 96 hours chronic effects respectively foll owing 10kilo ton nuclear detonation results used to define the contours in the figures are tabulated in tables 12 and 13 for casualties due to radiation expos ure both acute and chronic health effects are considered chronic health effect that lead s to fatality will be counted as fatality even though that individual may survive fo r weeks months or even years before succumbing results shown in figures 13 and 14 are cumulative within contours meaning that the casualty and fatality counts of the outer contours include the number of casualties and fatalities reported for th inner contours respectively also the casualty values include the fatalities numbers many of the injured will suffer from multiple effects eg blast radiation exposure thermal burns the combination of effects is not considered or integrated into this report however comparison of tables 11 and 12 shows that the majority of the cas ualties are due to radiation exposure and not blast effects final draft national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 the assumption that

typical meteorological values for the entire city area the sounding provides wi nd speed direction and temperature as function of altitude set of typical surf ace 10meter elevation wind speeds and wind directions as measured at the citys main airport were also used average wind data were determined from the natural resources conservation service nrcs at the us department of agriculture for year s 1961 through 1990 the cal culation assumes cloud or snow cover and assumes 10kilometer 6mile visibility with light haze population us census data for the city area were used as the primary database to draw conclusions about the exposed population and the subsequent fatalities and casualties census data reflects the nighttime population which fo r washington dc is about 571000 in addition the workday influx of people from suburbs into the downtown area was considered since detonation of nuclear vice would most likely occur during business hours so as to inflict greater number of casualties for this calculation 481000 people were uniformly distributed w ithin 5kilometer 3mile radius of the detonation additionally 220000 people were uniformly dist ributed within an 11kilometer 7 mile wide annular area see fi gure 15 these values were determined from several city government and business sources the oak ridge national laboratory orn l geographic information science and technology group has developed daytimenighttime population database for washington dc using countytocounty wo rkflow numbers from census data ornl estimates the nighttime census data and daytime population to be 571476 and 1066666 respectively so that th ere is an influx of 495190 pe ople during the day these results are in excellent agreement with th additional population distribution assumed in this calculation the population densities for the top 20 us c ities as of 1990 are shown in table 16 this information can be used to approxima the prompt casualties resulting from the energy released within the first minute afte r the detonation for these cities for 10 kiloton nuclear detonation at ground level th present results are versatile enough that they may be extended to any major city in the united states with only few relatively straightforward changes to first approxima tion the prompt casualties can be scaled by ratio of the population densities for example the expected casualties in new city from 10kiloton nuclear detonation would be thos in this city times the ratio of the population density of the new city to that of this city the results retain most of the relevant features

one location to national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 1 nuclear detonation 10 kiloton improvised nuclear device 125 the next if these factors were accounted fo r they would produce result that is site specific and less generally applicable to other locations figure 12 provides general description of the effects of nuclear detonation on various building types the reader may use these figures to determine the damage to particular building of interest for example the lower left graph in figure 12 shows that at distance of 11 k ilometers 07 miles from ground zero approximately 40 of wood frame houses s2 are severely damaged while at distance of 13 kilomete rs 08 miles only approximately 5 of wood frame houses receive similar damage prompt radiation and fallout radiation casualties following nuclear tonation may be caused by prompt nuclear radiation radiation from the radioactive fa llout or both prompte ffect calculations are based on empirical relationships and are ta ken from capabilities of nuclear weapons em17 in this calculation prompt radiation is defined as that occurring within the first minute after detonation and incl udes neutrons xrays and ga mma rays originating from the nuclear reactions producing the yield in the nuclear device and the radioactive decay that the resulting fission daught er produces during this time nuclear surface burst will produce signific ant downwind radioactive fallout up to about 160 kilometers 100 miles this fallout is due to the large qu antity of material eg dirt asphalt concrete steel close to the device when it detonates much of this material is vaporized in the detonation and is carried up by the rising fireball the fireball mixes the radioactive fission products and this vaporized material the fireball cools as it rises and the vaporized material and the fi ssion products coalesce to form particles these particles are carried off and dispersed downwind where the larger heavier particles fall to the ground first this dispersal is complicated process that depends on many factors including the amount of heat energy in the fireball the amount and composition of the vaporized material and the size of th particles formed as well as the weather conditions the radioactive fissi on products in the fallout ma emit alpha beta or gamma rays or combinations of these neutron radi ation is predominately produced in the prompt phase and is not significant compone nt of the fallout radioactivity less local fallout is produced by nuclear detonation where the fireball does not touch the ground the yield of device and thus the quantity of fission products produced is unaffected by the height of detonation howe ver since there is much less surrounding material to be vaporized there is less ma terial with which th fission products can coalesce therefore smaller particles are fo rmed and carried much further essentially around the world by the air currents since this radiation is dispersed over much larger area it poses much less danger in the local ar ea tens to hundreds of miles immediately downwind from the detonation health physics the output from the airrad program is in the form of system of grids reporting the dose at equally spaced time intervals between the time of first and last fallout deposition thus time history of groundshine surface exposure to the gamma radiation at each grid point is obtained dditionally nuke determines the dose received from both national planning scenarios for official use only version 213

radiation doses is then applied to the lethality and injury criteria for each population grid point to termine the total number of fatalities and casualties the criteria for lethality and injury for

90607 however medical facilities are likely to be highly stressed after nuclear detonation and this level of heroic care is unlikely to be maintained this limited care may well prod uce more fatalities at lower levels of exposure it is also true that the average victim of nuclear detonation in major downtown area during working hours may not accurately reflect the demographics of the populat ion at large this may also affect the casualties table 19 dose ranges and associated pathophysiological effects for acute radiation exposure9 9 baum et 1984 em1 february 1988 national planning

external gamma radiation from fission products deposited on the ground is the most significant health hazard and is expressed as wholebody dose there will be some beta radiation skin exposure but in most cases this is not biologically significant the dose from the detonationproduced ai rborne debris cloud as it passes by is negligible radioactive decay can be characterized by simple function of time the approximate rule is that for every sevenfold increase in time after the explosion the dose rate decreases by factor of 10 for example one week seven days after the detonation the dose rate from the fallout on th ground will be 110th its value on the day of the detonation seven weeks later it will be 1100th by multiplying the collective dose in person rem to the population that survives beyond 60 days by 5104 one can estimate the number of excess latent cancer fatalities lcfs10 by referring to the expected cancer rate among americans radiation protection factors in order to calculate the health effects to the population from the numerous effects of 10kiloton nuclear device certain assumptions were made about where people are located and oriented with respect to the blast in mo st cases these assumptions were intentionally set conservatively therefore the number of casualties and fatalities reported here is an upper limit blast fatality and casualty data are based on the assumption that people are facing in the most hazardous orientation and do not account for any protection provided by buildings or other structur similarly the benefit of shielding by buildings or structures from the prompt neutron and gamma radiation or from the subsequent radioactive fallout was not considered howeve r this overestimation of casualties that results from not including the be neficial effects of buildings as shielding is somewhat offset by not including the detrimental effects of buildings such as casualties resulting from building or structure collapse in reality large fraction of the population will be indoors typically only 15 of the population is outside at any give n time during the workday exce pt in the case of special events estimates for radiation protection fact ors of buildings vary widely table 110 provides some insight into the radiation shield ing effects that various types of structures provide for gamma and neutron ra diation transmission factor is defined as the ratio of the dose received while in structure to that which would have been received outside and can be thought of in terms indicating how much radiation passes through the structure it gives measure of how much being indoors protects people from radiation for example if person with protection received 100 rad of gamma rays person in concrete blockhouse shelter with 9inch wa lls would receive only 10 to 20 rad values of the transmission factor vary from 1 where protection is offered to 0 where the radiation is completely shielded protection factors vary for numer ous reasons

110 transmission factors for vari ous structures glasstone5 table 111 provides data on when dose is received an protected person leaving the fallout zone after the first hour of detonati on receives 55 of the dose that person who remains unprotected in the blast zone for an infinite amount of time receives together with information on shelter shieldi ng factors table 111 can be used to show that remaining shelteredinplace for the first few hours after detonation and then evacuating may greatly reduce persons radi ation exposure compared to person who evacuates immediately for example suppose sheltered people stay in place for period of 72 hours and then evacuate if the shelter provide s protection factor of 10 t ransmission factor of 01 the sheltered group will receive only 86 of th total possible longterm dose up to the time at which that group evacuates unsheltered people would have received 86 of the total dose in that same interval according to table 111 there is only an additional 2 of dose potentially delivered from 72 to 100 hours after detonation assuming evacuation can be achieved in less than 28 hours indivi duals who shelter and then evacuate receive 86 plus 2 or about 10 of the maximu m possible dose meanwh ile individuals who evacuate in the first 24 hours re ceive 55 of the maximum possible dose of course if only high transmission factor sheltering is available evacuation should take place immediately national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 1 nuclear detonation 10 kiloton improvised nuclear device 130 table 111 can also be used to estimate the dose received by first responders working in areas between the delineated contours of figur 13 and 14 for example an evacuation worker remaining in the zone between 280 and 380 rem between 24 and 48 hours after the detonation will receive 83 minus 80 or 3 of the to tal possible longterm dose this together with the information in tables 12 and 13 can be used to estimate the doses responders may receive of course in real event actual measurements of radiation exposure should be used emergency workers responding near the blast zone must have realtime dosimetery and be tr ained to use it for their own personnel protection in the early period following groundlevel nuclear detonation it will simply be impossible for responders to pproach ground zero

gamma emissions are of primary c oncern inhalationshielding factors have been included in table 112 for completeness alpha and beta radiati ons generally do not penetrate the skin and cannot do internal da mage unless the material ie the fallout that emits these particles is internalized internaliza tion can occur via ingestion inhalation direct absorption through the sk in or open wounds although the radioactive fallout particles generated by the explosion ar an inhalation concern the data in table 1 12 show that buildings typically do not provide sign ificant filtration of or protection national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 1 nuclear detonation 10 kiloton improvised nuclear device 131 from radioactive particles in the 1 to 10mi cron range which is the size range that is the greatest health threat first responders may don ppe to prev ent internalizati on of fallout but ppe does not reduce the gamma or neutron dose from external sources of radiation the effects on the health of the population that internalizes fallout after the detonation are not considered in this appendix this has been done because the tota l number of impacted persons in this category will be relativel small compared to the numbers of people exposed to large acute external doses ther efore the effects of accounting for these internal contamination cases on the numbers of external cases presented here is smaller than the uncertainty in those numbers timeline of fallout dimensions and population statistics figure 13 shows the acute dos contours for those exposed for 24 hours following the detonation instead of producing such figure fo r several different times after detonation graphs have been created that can aid in dete rmining the extent of the fallout and the dose received for other times figure 17 shows th maximum distance for fallout contour as function of time comparing this to th data shown in figure 13 the 150rem dose equivalent contour extends out to 30 kilometers 19 miles downwind from ground zero which corresponds to the range of the 150rem dose equivalent as shown in figure 17 if one were interested in knowing the range of the 150rem dose equivalent contour after 60 hours figure 17 shows it to be 33 k ilometers 21 miles then returning to figure 13 one can scale ie expand or shrink the contour lines accordingly thus by using figures 17 and 13 together one can ob tain estimates of the affected regions for arbitrary times after the detonation another way to look at this is that unsheltered persons remaining in place for 40 hours after the detonation will receive dose equivalent to at least 150 rem if they are downwind of the detonation and are within 32 kilometers 20 miles of ground zero and do equivalent to at least 210 rem if they are within 24 kilometers 15 miles of gr ound zero figure 18 is si milar to figure 17 except it shows the total area enclosed within the contour rather than the maximum downwind distance national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 1 nuclear detonation 10 kiloton improvised nuclear device 132 summary of

generate the figure as before these numbers assume that the entire exposed population is not evacuated and remains unsheltered for the duration shown this assumption will produce large overestimation of the total dose but should still be useful in establishing the worstcase scenario together with table 18 these result s can be used to estimate radiationinduced casualties and fatalities for different exposure durations in real situation where the shelterinplace or evacuati on decision is made soon after the detonation and is effectively communicat ed to the population these numbers

emp effects an emp is generated by massive electrical currents in the air caused by ionizati on of the air in region known as the source region the ioni zation is caused by the intense radiation immediately following nuclear explosion si gnificant emp effects may extend out to the 2psi contour but are genera lly localized in this region outside the source region the emitted energy is small and susceptible equipmentsuch as electrical equipment that is connected to long runs of cable piping ove rhead power and telephone lines etcis primarily at risk small isolated equipmen t outside the immediate source region should have higher survival rate the effects of an emp include large induced vo ltages in electrical equipment which can damage the equipment if unprotected when considering the extent of emp effects detonations that occur at an altitude belo w several kilometers are considered surface bursts this definition is im portant to note because wher eas the source region for surface burst of 10 kilotons is on the order of 44 kilometers 26 miles highaltitude burst with the same yield could cause disruptions over several states although the emp is shortduration ev ent lasting few nanoseconds 109 seconds unprotected electrical equipmen t subjected to this pulse has high probability of being permanently damaged standalone or selfc ontained communications systems that are brought in from outside the impacted area wi ll be unaffected by the emp however the blast and emp may impact cell towers and other communications or repeater systems and thus may indirectly affect the system s brought into the area after the detonation this may make it difficult for first responders to communicate with each other or for officials to communicate with the public cratering

improvised nuclear device 138 appendix 1b estimated realistic results this appendix reflects set of possible results from the 10k iloton nuclear detonation described in the scenario above the assu mptions used in appendix 1a are very conservative and produce results that can with high degree of confidence be expected to set the upper limit for what can be expect ed in this section the assumptions are less conservative and produce results that are arguably more realistic unfortunately these results are not directly supported by comput er code or any other calculation instead they result from extrapolati ons interpolations and estima tions based on the conservative calculation of appendix 1a on the results of actual nuclear detonations over population centers eg hiroshima and nagasaki and on the results of the us nuclear weapons testing program the estimates presented here strongly depend on the assumptions used and how those assumptions are applied the various numbers presented in this section do not directly correlate with those shown in th appendix and should not be directly compared for instance in the appendix atte mpt has been made to separate the number of burn victims from those of blunt trauma or to account for the blast and radiation shielding effects of buildings thes changes would require very complicated calculation that is beyond the capabilities of the computer codes used however in this section educated estimations ve been used in an attemp t to address these types of issues the following results will be tabulated in zo nes corresponding to areas delineated in appendix 1a zones 1 2 3 and 4 correspond to the rings of radius 076 kilometers 047 miles 082 kilometers 051 miles 10 k ilometer 062 miles and 12 kilometers 074 miles respectively of figure 11 in appendix 1a for the purposes of this section people in these zones would not necessarily experience the same physical effects from the blast that are described in the appe ndix for example the effects of the blast wave will be reduced by shielding factor and the attenuation eg drag reflection due to the buildings and structur so the physical effect s hown in appendix 1a of 71 psi overpressure for the outer edge of zone 2 w ill not be assumed here instead the outer edge of zone 2 will have fixed radius of 082 kilometers 05 miles but will be subjected to lower pressure similarly this will be true for the other zones equivalent dose measured in rem in z ones 5 6 7 and 8 correspond to the areas defined by the 380rem 280rem 210rem and 150rem contours of figure 13 again in this section people inside these areas will not be assumed to have been subjected to these dose levels these z ones are used only to delineate specific geographical locations and gi ven number of

kiloton improvised nuclear device 140 the number of fatalities in each zone has been separa ted into large time segments immediate less than 1 day less than 4 days and less than 8 weeks the numbers given for total fatalities include the immediate fatalities and subsequent fatalities up to and including projected cancers that may occur many years after the incident for the purposes of estimating the immediate fatal ities and immediate injuri blunt trauma plus other effects burns and prompt radiation it is assumed that buildings located at reasonable distance 05 kilometers or 03 miles from the blast provide substantial protection from both t he blast and prompt radiation effects closer to the detona tion the mitigation is minimal while it contributes significantly as the distance from the detonation in creases the assumption was made that the average shielding benefit from the blast and prompt radiation is 30 on the outer edge of zone 1 and i ncreases to 90 by the outer edge of zone 4 note that this table uses the term injuries and t casualties as in the append ix the injuries category excludes fatalities while casualties in cludes them these injured people may die later and will then be included in delayed fatalities categories or may recuperate the delineated injuries category does not include eye or fallout injuries which are tabulated separately an attempt has been made to separate the injuries from blunt trauma plus other effects defin ed as including puncture wou nds glass cuts etc from those sustained from burning and radiation obviously many victims will have multiple categories of injuries but the dominant category is listed there is also category for multiple injuries that is used for situations where the health effects of two or more types of injury classes are of roughly the same magnitude the fallout injury estimates presented here excl ude emergency response workers who may enter these zones after the detonation it is essential that em ergency response workers ar educated trained and equipped to deal with this situation workers entering the very high radiation areas much of zones 1 through 4 and the areas of zone 5 within few miles of ground zero in the first few days after the detonation are very likely to receive large doses of radiation ppe is used to control the spread of contamination and does not protect workers from external radiation doses if the workers are exposed to contaminated particles in the air ie resuspensio n then devices to protect them from breathing this contamination are required personal dosimetery and rnback levels are essential for all workers entering the entire area affected by the fallout without thes precautions large fraction of emergency response workers will be exposed to large in zones 1 through 5 likely lethal doses these estimations assume that it takes 24 hours to evacuate 90 of the population is in zones 1 through 8 and onefourth of the population is evacuated in each of the four 6hour time periods the effects of flash blindness w ill decrease with time hours to few days but retinal burns will cause permanent damage the detonation occurred at approximately 1000 am in the morning on work day it is ground blast which will tend to shield the direct lineofsight of the device from most observers therefore lower level of eye damage will occur nd will be caused largely by reflections on average pedestrians tend to walk in random directions with respect to the detonation site and tend to be looking down as they walk to estimate eye damage it is assumed that buildings and other structures will shield many of these pedestrians most pedestrians in zone s 1 through 4 will suffer severe injuries or fatalities from other causes and are therefore not counted he re it is assumed that most commuters 90 will already be at work of those that are not at work abou t half will drive into the city of those that drive approximately half will not be moving toward the city perhaps on beltway of those that are moving toward the city approximately 75 will be shielded by buildings trees retaining walls etc eye damage that occurs while driving creates the possibility for an increased number of fatalities and injuries due to accidents evacuation will be required for the vast majority of people in all delineated zones for people in zones 1 through 5 this evacuation r shelteringinplace if those instru ctions can be diss eminated and an appropriate shelter can be located is absolutely esse ntial and must take place immediately or it will have significant impact on the number of lives that will be lost the in zones 1 and 2 indicates that the assisted evacuation of these people will cost the lives of many emergency responders in the initial couple of days perhaps the best solution would be to help those able to selfevacuate from these zones in zones national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 1 nuclear detonation 10 kiloton improvised nuclear device 141 that will be subjected to lower levels of fallout the timescale of the evacuations are somewhat less critical but still must take place as soon as possible because the fallout will take longer to reach these areas and the total radioactive activity in these areas is expected to be less it is expected that many evacuated people will need shelter food and medical attention for mont hs after the detonation those that are not able to adjust may require care for years of those that are evacuated all will need to be checked for contamination for most bath and change of clothes will provide sufficient decontamination but many will require fast efficient expert decontamination and subsequent verification the assumptions used in this section for exam ple ground blast and buildings shielding the effects of the detonation will serve to restrict most fires cause d directly by the heat of the detonation to region that has largely already been destroyed by the blast wave much of this region will burn in subsequent fires the exception will be fires caused by highly flammable materials that are exposed to the direct thermal emissions from the detonation and secondary fires that are caused from traffic accidents ruptured gas lines etc it is suggested that fires in zones 1 and 2 simply be contained at suitable outer boundary and not directly fought because fightin g these fires will likely subject firefighters to unacceptable radiation doses national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 2 biological attack

new influenza virus subtype emerges and causes infection in people termed genetic shift if this new virus subtype for which there is little to immunity in the population spreads efficiently between people it can cause pa ndemic while influenza outbreaks occur annually pandemic is unique event rates of influenza illness as well as its severity are likely to be high because most or all of the hum an population will be susceptible having had prior exposure to this new infl uenza subtype in addition persons not generally at high risk may develop severe or fatal disease experience with influenza pandemics duri ng the 20th century vari ed markedly the 1918 pandemic caused over 500000 deaths in the united states the 1957 pandemic caused about 70000 deaths and th 1968 pandemic caused about 34000 deaths pandemic impacts on health society and economic func tions and pandemic re sponse activities will differ quantitatively and qualitatively for moderate and severe pandemic scenarios therefore to best guide planning and prepar edness two scenarios are presented based on experience with the 1 918 pandemic severe and the 1957 and 1968 pandemics moderate predictions can be made on the relative

stra ins have originated in asia and the h5n1 avian influenza in asia represents the greatest current pandemic threat however the likely us origin of the 1918 pandemic and recent outbreak s of other pathogenic avian influenza strains that caused human infecti ons in europe canada and the united states illustrate the uncertain geographic origin of pandemic national planning scenarios for official

neighboring countries and those shar ing extensive travelt rade links will be affected first extensive international travel will accelerate spread compared with past pandemics once communitybased outbreaks begin to occur in the united states national spread will be rapid given the large am ount of travel within this country large urban areas will likely be affected earliest but within one to two months virtually all communities will experience outbreaks so remote communities may be able to prevent the introduction of disease by tota l restrictions on entry from outside the community but such instances will be exceedi ngly rare because outbreaks will occur in all areas few if any medica l personnel medical equipment or similar resources will be available for redistributionstate city and local governments as well as health care systems will have to cope using existi ng resources stockpiled medical supplies ventilators ppe antiviral drugs and stockpi led vaccine if any will be distributed to states and indian tribes pro rata on an international level countries with limited health care resources domestic influenza vaccine production and little to stockpiled antiviral drugs will likely request aid from the united states and other industrialized c ountries however current limitations in us influenza vaccine ma nufacturing capacity drug production and stockpiling and limited stocks of relevant medical equipment will make it extremely difficult if not impossible to provide any mate rials in response to international requests it is likely that there will be notable internati onal political ramifications of this inability to meet even portion of the requests from developing countries for relevant aid timelineevent dynamics appendix 3a provides timeline for spr ead of the 19571958 influenza pandemic to and within the united states the amount of time between recognition of an initial outbreak caused by new influenza subtype that is transmitted between people and the occurrence of large outbreaks in the united states is unclear nd depends on several factors these include where the initial outbreak occurs eg remote rural area or an urban transportation hub how early it is detected the imp act of containment measures implemented around the initial cases and outbreaks the effectiveness of travel restrictions and screening and the season results of ma thematical modeling suggest that travel restrictions and screening ev if they are 99 effect ive are unlikely to delay introduction of pandemic disease into the unite d states by more than month or two large disease waves in the united states associ ated with prior pandemics occurred in the fall and winter in 1957 for example clusters of cases occurred in military camps and other closed settings during june and july community outbreaks occurred until children returned to school in august and the first wave of disease peaked in mid october however past experience is too limited to support confiden t predictions that disease wave will not occur during the summer community pandemic influenza outbreaks generally will last about 6 to 8 weeks the speed at which the pandemic disease sp reads to the united states is important because it will take at least three months and up to six months before the first doses of national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 3 biological disease outbreak pandemic influenza 36 new pandemic vaccine are produced domestic vaccine surge production capability for 600 million doses two per person will be need ed within 6 months of the onset of pandemic nevertheless because of limited curre nt usbased vaccine production capacity the large majority of the population will not have access to vaccine before the pandemic arrives even if some doses are availa ble thus there must be mechanism for allocating the vaccine among the populationfor deciding who will be at the head of the line assumptions susceptibility to the pandemic infl uenza subtype will be universal clinical disease attack rate 30 hi ghest rate among school aged children 40 declining rates with age 20 among working aged adults number seeking

preventiondeterrence most scientists consider influenza pandemics in evitable efforts to decrease the spread of influenza in animals and to decrease the ri sk that human and animal influenza strains will coinfect person or animal and form new pandemic virus may reduce the risk this might extend the time period before th next pandemic occurs animal influenza surveillance and rapid implementa tion of control measures when infection is identified is important vaccination with annual influe nza vaccine may decrease pandemic risk and will stimulate increased influenza vaccine production improving pandemic response capacity national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 3 biological disease outbreak pandemic influenza 37 when new influenza subtype emerges that is capable of efficient and sustained transmission between people containment putting out the spark and preventing pandemic will be extremely difficult mathematical models indicate that combination of early detection and rapid response with eff ective case detection antiviral treatment and prophylaxis of potential contacts and neighboring populations measures to decrease contact between people and vaccination if available could prevent pandemic the sensitivity of surveillance and the ability of poor countries to implement an effective response are barriers to successful containment2 decisions have been made regarding the extent of us participation in whol ead containment effort or potential use of antiviral drugs and vaccines from us stockpiles preparedness preparedness activities are cr itical across range of areas improved global surveillance and earlier detection of new subtypes that infect and spread between people will facilitate containment and earlier development of pandemic vaccine vaccine preparedness includes expanding usbased production capac ity developing new production methods improving vaccine to enhance immune response and shortening the time to production of new vaccine antiviral drugs are being st ockpiled and stockpiles of other essential materials such as needlessyringes ppe nd masks are currently being considered targets for health care system prepare dness supported by health resources and services administration hrsa cooperativ agreement include increasing staffed hospital bed capacity by 1520 coordinatio n between local hospitals and health care organizations and education and training health care burden estimates for the peak weeks of pandemic outbreaks suggest that in moderate pandemic about 25 of hospital beds and almost 40 of intensive care unit icu beds will be needed to care for patients with influenza estimates for seve re pandemic are about 10 fold greater with demand for hospital and icu care exceeding 100 of current staffed hospital bed capacity thus preparedness for more seve re pandemic will need to be qualitatively different and include strategies to massively expand the ability to provide hospitallike care for example through the establishmen t of makeshift hospitals in schools and armories increased ability to provide intens ive care also is important particularly for persons in rural areas which include about 20 of the us popul ation but only about 17 of adult and 9 of pediatric icu beds3 the sns maintains 5000 ventilators this is quantity far less than the potential need in more severe pandemic research can lead to the development of new interventions and capabilities that will improve pandemic response for example changing vaccine formulations by adding an adjuvant or administering vaccine intradermally may im prove the immune response decreasing the amount of vaccine antigen required for each dose and potentially 2models of pandemic

communication of information to the public is an important component of hazard mitigation recent public health emergenc ies such as the anth raxletter attacks in october 2001 and the 2003 severe acute resp iratory syndrome sars epidemic have demonstrated that the publics response depends in part on the type of public health information provided the perceived and actual reliability and scientific soundness of such information the source of the information and the timeliness of the information evacuationshelter evacuations will have meaningful effect on the spread of disease and may be counter productive by spreading infection to as yet unaffected areas and by overburdening services in site that soon is likely to experience an outb reak of disease isolating ill persons at home if hospital care is not neede d can decrease the transmission of infection national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 3 biological disease outbreak pandemic influenza 310 but requires that health care nd other services can be delive red as needed quarantine of exposed persons is not likely to affect th spread of influenza because of the short incubation period 14 days and the ability of asymptomatically persons to transmit disease victim care in both moderate and severe pandemics most ill persons will be treated as outpatients with overthecounter medications antiviral drugs will be used for treatment in defined target groups among both outpatients and those admitted to hospital because the effectiveness of antiviral treatment is greater when started earlier in the illness drugs will need to be dispensed from outpatient clinics ers and at other pointofcare sites in the moderate pandemic scenario less than 1 of ill persons will require hospital care whereas in the more severe scenario almost 10 will require ad mission treatment will primarily be supportive patients with pneumonia may require supplemental oxygen including mechanical ventilation shortages of ventilators in severe pandemic may occur secondary bacterial pneumonias fr equently complicate influenza and may be caused by resistant pathogens shortages of effective antibiotics eg vancomycin for highly resistant strains are possi ble patient care also ma be compromised by shortages of other hospital supplies part icularly if transportation systems are disrupted in more severe pandemic note that hospitals stock limited inventory and rely on daily delivery of supplies to prevent the spread of influen za in the hospital infected patients will be kept in isolation or when isolation capacity is exceeded will be cohorted in wards advance instructions will be needed for fa mily members taking care of influenza patients at home there is also need to plan to deal with the large number of fatalities that will occur in relatively short period of time mortuary and burial services may become overextended causing delays in funeral services this in rn will

studies and disease surveillance the current influenz surveillance system described in the emergency assessmentdiagnosis section has distinct limitations implications secondary hazardsevents the greatest secondary hazard will be th problems caused by shortages of medical supplies eg vaccines and antiviral drugs equipment eg mechanical ventilators hospital beds and health care workerspoten tially exacerbated by resulting disruptions national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 3 biological disease outbreak pandemic influenza 311 in supply chains and reduction in essentia l services such as transportation and telecommunications having detailed system for allocating resources and maintaining provision of medical supplies potentially can reduce such difficulties this system should be in place well before an in fluenza pandemic actually occurs of particular concern is the lik elihood that health care systems particularly hospitals will be overwhelmed one method of mitigating such an impact is to have plans in place that effectively allocate scarce hospitalbased resources among incoming patients this will require incoming patients to be triaged accordi ng to need availability of resources and expected outcomes in effect hospital st aff and patients will have to accept different standards of care during an influenza pandemic for example nursetobed ratios will have to be decreased meaning that each nur will have to look after more occupied beds noncredentialed staff nd volunteers will provide so care patients might not be given all of the treatment that they and their physicians would normally expect to be used such as mechanical ventilation make shift hospitals establis hed in schools or other settings will be unlikely to pr ovide the same level of care as in regular facilities in addition to the acute anxiety caused duri ng the most severe phases of the pandemic there will be other be havioral health concer ns severe shortages in medical personnel and supplies mean that people will not be able to obtain psychotropic medications methadone or other needed medicines hi ghly vulnerable populations such as people with human immunodeficiency virus hiv will be uniquely affected another important secondary hazard is the disruption that might occur in society in more severe pandemic institutions such as schools and workplaces may close because large proportion of students or employees are i ll or may close as public health measure to decrease the spread of illness in these set tings and in communities essential services may be limited because workers are absent from work due to illness the need to care for sick family members or fear of becoming inf ected at work the complexity of networks supply chains and justintime inventories make it likely that ab senteeism among some groups will have ripple affect with much broader impacts this risk may be decreased by critical industries developing continuity of business plans that include crosstraining workers travel between cities and count ries may be sharply reduced not only due to fewer staff personnel available to operate the transportation system but because fewer people will want to or be able to travel fatalitiesinjuries estimates of health impact are provided in ta bles 31 and 32 esti mates for the impact of moderate

disruption some service disruption is likely in more vere pandemic particularly during the peak weeks of disease outbreaks in communities disruption may be minimal in moderate pandemic although the complexity of systems and infrastructures make them vulnerable to disruption if certain critical functions are not performed in pandemic of any magnitude the health care system will be severely

pestis the causative agent of plague is gram negative bacterium of the enterobacteriacea family the disease is zootic in certain sylvatic reservoirs such as rats squirrels and mice in addition cats dogs and goats can serv as incidental hosts and be source of infection to humans the two most common forms of plague in humans are bubonic and pneumonic but both can progress to septicemic form similar to gram negative sepsis bubonic plague occu rs following the bite of an infected flea rapid onset of symptoms of fever chills and headache occur within 1 to 7 days of exposure bubonic plague is not transmitted from human to human however about 5 of bubonic cases develop into pneumonic plague which is transmittable human to human by droplets the general fatality rate for untreated bubonic pla gue can be as high as 50 but with aggressive antibiotic treatment the case fatality rate is usually about 5 pneumonic plague occurs fo llowing the inhalation of pestis organisms as few as 100 to 500 organisms and fulminant symptoms of fever chills cough hemoptysis and chest pain develops within 1 to 4 days the case fatality rate may be as high as 100 if aggressive antibiotic therapy is not initiated within 24 hours of th onset of symptoms in this scenario members of the universal adversary ua disseminate plague via an agricultural sprayer while driv ing through major metropolitan city

places and trying instead to conduct business on the phone as result the phone systems at financial institutions may become complete ly tied up with far fewer transactions than normally occur the fear of plague has raised memories of the anthrax incidents of 2001 which may cause many citizens to be afraid to open their mail fatalitiesinjuries the total number of illnesses at the end of th fifth day is approximately 28383 the total number of fatalities is 9553 assumptions affecting these figures include length of incubation period following primary exposure rate of secondary transmission incubation period following secondary exposure and timing and effectiveness of the intervention eg respiratory precautions and antimicrobial treatment property damage although the actual physical damage to prope rty will be negligible there will be an associated negative impact of buildings an d areas that were or could have been contaminated by the primary exposure or by subsequent casualties this may result in people shying away from or refusing to visi t locations with n egative reputation potentially constituting significant economic loss national planning scenarios for official use

city and other areas calls to hospitals doctors offices emergency call centers and public health offices could incr ease drastically responding to the medical transport needs of casua lties may overwhelm emergency service representatives hospital beds will fill rapidly and staff w ill need to work longer hours persons who use medications for chronic hea lth conditions may have difficulty obtaining refills because of demands on pharmacies because the biological agent is known to be contagious and readily transmitted from one individual to another closing or restricti ng modes of transportation such as railroads may be necessary to reduce the spread of the disease assuming that the major city is one of the major air transport nodes in the united states handling passenger volumes that exceeded 83 million in 2001 735 million domes tic and 95 million in ternational and handling nearly 15 million tons of cargo in 2001 the closure or restricted use of the airport would create large perturbations in the passenger and cargo aviation system worldwide the major city area is also one of the key rail transportation centers in the united states with approximately 60 of th nations rail traffic traveling through the area finally the major city transit aut hority cta which operates mass transit rail and bus service throughout the city and its 38 suburbs carries 15 million passengers on typical business weekday food prices in the major city area are likely to soar because of th threat of reduced supply however any transportati on restrictions that might be implemented are not likely to cause serious shortages in the initial week following the inci dent moreover many people may be afraid to venture out thus av erting at least initially any hoarding or panic shopping economic impact there is potential for selloff in the econom ic markets depending on the success of the dissemination techniques and the virulence of the biological agent fatalities could be considerable therefore the expected earnings during victims life will be lost resulting in decline in consumer spending and loss of revenue for the metropolitan area automatic teller machines atms especially driveup machines may run out of cash before they can be replenished an overall national economic downturn is possible in the wake of the attack due to loss of consumer confidence longterm

success or failure of chemical attack wind speed wind speed determines how fast primary cloud moves high winds can disperse vapors aerosols and liqui ds rapidly thereby shrinking the target area and reducing the populations exposur to the agents the best wind speed for an attack is between 4 and 6 knots temperature higher air temperatures may cau the evaporation of aerosol particles thereby decreasi ng their size and increasing the chance that they will reach the lungs the best air temperature fo r an attack is between 65ºf and 75º f humidity high humidity may lead to the largement of

evenly dispersed the lct 50 dose of chemical that kills 50 of the subjects for sarin is 100 milligrams per minute per cubic meter of air mgminm3 therefore for this scenario the assumption is that 95 of the building occupants will die hvac system vents will discharge 30 of the agent into the atmosphere over the course of an hour by which time responde rs should be able to disable the hvac systems the aegl3 downwind hazard area will cover about oneeighth of square mile from each site with the effects level 16 times that size current building codes require 6 to 10 air changes per hour with 15 to 25 fresh air this means that if the agent had the same density as air which it does not the agents density is 49 times that of air then the amount of agent not absorbed by people or building materials would be disc harged into the atmosphere in 24 to 66 minutes having heavierdensity agent means that the agent will linger longer in the building any agent remaining in the buildings when the hvac

general description earthquakes occur when the plates that form under the earths surf ace suddenly shift causing binding and pressure and most earth quakes occur at the boundaries where the plates meet fault is fracture in the eart hs crust along which two blocks of the crust have slipped with respect to each other the verity of an earthquake can be expressed in several ways the magnitude of an earthquake usually expressed by the richter scale is measure of the amplitude of the seismic waves the moment magnitude of an earthquake is measure of the amount of energy releasedan amount that can be estimated from seismograph readings the intensity as expressed by the modified mercalli mm scale is subjective measur that describes how strong shock was felt at particular location the richter scale is logarithmi c so recording of 7 for ex ample indicates disturbance with ground motion 10 times as large as recording of 6 quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest quake normally felt by people earthquake s with richter valu of 6 or more are commonly considered major great earthquake s have magnitude of 8 or more the mm scale expresses the intensity of an earthquake s effects in given locality in values ranging from i to xii the most commonly used adaptation covers the range of intensity from the condition of i not felt except by very few under especially favorable conditions to xii damage total lines of sight and level are distorted objects thrown upward into the air evaluation of earthqua ke intensity can be made only after eyewitness reports and results of field invest

shaking of mm scale intensity of viii or greater strong enough to cause considerable damage to ordinary buildings and great damage to poorly built structures soil liquefaction occu rs in some areas and adds to the destruction since even earthquakeresistant structures may fail when liquefaction occurs the primary cause of damage is the resultant ground shaking from the fault rupture quicksandlike

tropical weather sy stems consisting of dangerous winds and torrential rains hurricanes often spawn tornadoes and can produce storm surge of ocean water that can be up to 24 feet at its peak and 50 to 100 miles wide the most destructive companion of hurri canes is the storm surge typical hurricane is 400 miles in diameter and has an average forward speed of 15 miles per hour mph in range of 0 to 60 m ph the average lifespan of hurricane is 9 days in range of less than 1 day to more than 12 days the highest wind speeds occur 20 to 30 miles from the center hurricane forc winds cover almost 100 miles and gale force winds of 40 mph or more may cover 400 miles in diameter fully developed hurricane may tower 10 miles into the atmosphere hurricane is categorized by its sustained wind intensity on saffirsimpson hurricane scale which is used to estimate the poten tial for property damage and flooding major hurricanes are placed in categories 3 4 and 5 with sustained wind intensities between 111 mph to greater than 155 mph the most da ngerous potential storm would be slow moving category 5 hurricane making landf all in highly populated area the national hurricane center nhc provides the following description for category 5 hurricane winds are greater than 155 mph 135 kilo tons or 249 kilometers per hour 155 miles storm surge is generally greater than 18 feet above normal complete roof failure occurs on many re sidences and industrial buildings as well as severe and extensive window and door damage mobile homes are completely destroyed some complete building failures occur with small utility buildings blown over or away national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 10 natural disaster major hurricane 102 shrubs and trees are blown down all signs are blown down lowlying escape routes are cut by rising wa ter 3 to 5 hours before arrival of the center of the hurricane major damage occurs to lower floors of all structures locate d less

this scenario category 5 hurricane hits an mma detailed scenario this scenario represents category 5 hurricane that makes landfall at an mma sustained winds are at 160 mph with storm surge greater than 20 feet above normal as the storm moves closer to land massive ev acuations are required certain lowlying escape routes are inundated by water anywhe re from 5 hours before the eye of the hurricane reaches land planning considerations geographical considerationdescription the overall terrain of the mma is genera lly lowlying land with topography ranging from flat to gently rolling hills the coastal plain extends inland for approximately 100 miles there are numerous bays inlets and rivers within the region timelinesevent dynamics after more than 25 inches of rainfall in th past 4 months the mma and the region to include multiple states are saturated and rivers are at above normal levels for this time of the year near the end of july tropical storm has developed in the atlantic the storm has been gaining strength as it has moved west at 10 mp h after 5 days in the open waters of the atlantic on august 11 the tropical storm was upgraded to hurricane the nhc warns that there are steering curre nts that would cause this hu rricane to turn away from making landfall in the continen tal united states the nhc also warns that conditions are favorable for the storm to intensify over the warm atlantic waters by august 15 the hurricane has steadied at dangerous category 4 level on the saffir simson hurricane scale models indicate track that incl udes possible landfall along the coast adjacent to the mma on the morning of august 17 forecasters at the nhc are not sure whether the storm will strengthen or weaken over the ne xt couple of days evacuation decisions are made difficult by th is unpredictability of the storms future intensity the governor and local officials order the evacuation of tourists and people living in certain designated low lying areas along the coast national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 10 natural disaster major hurricane 103 on august 14 the governor and local officials have broadened their evacuation orders to include the evacuation of all citizens within 5 to 10 miles of the coast in the areas projected to be within the pa th of the storm over the 2day period 1 million people have been ordered to evacuate from mma and coastal regions interstates and other evacuation routes are clogged with extremely heavy traffic on the morning of august 17 the hurricane r eaches its peak with sustained winds at the inner wall of the eye of the storm recorded at 160 mph at approximately 930 am the hurricane makes landfall with direct hit on the mma and coastal resort towns the mma has been hit hard with over 20 inches of rain since the afternoon of august 15 storm surge of 20 feet has accompanied the storm forward movement of the storm system is slowed down by strong highpres sure weather pattern outer bands of the storm still extend well into the warm waters t hus feeding its destructive center in the afternoon the hurricane begins loosing stre ngth over land but continues to be an extremely dangerous and strong storm the hurricane has spawned tornadoes that have added to its destructive power by august 18 the hurricane has moved out of the mma and surr ounding region but has left path of destruction in its wake th storm has now been downgraded to tropical storm with winds reduced to 60 mph near the barely discer nable remnants of an eye while the storm has weakened the combinati on of already saturated land and high winds have caused widespread tree damage and power outages in multiple states the rain associated with the storm has caused rivers to overflow their banks and several rivers systems experience record flood levels assumptions local state and federal officials have the benefit of forecasts that predict major hurricane will make landfall at th mma with this information state and local officials have time to execute evacuation plans evacuation routes are not available 5 hours before the storm surge waters and rainfall block highways leading from the mma most of the local fire police and othe r response personnel and officials are victims of the storm and unable to coor dinate immediate response resources as result of the storm surge flooding and wind destruction some 100000 disaster victims are not able to immedi ately return to perm anent housing within the mma state and local capabilities for triaging and treating casualties in the disaster area are overwhelmed most primary medical treatment facilities are damaged or inoperable the port facility is closed completely for 1 month and requires months of

challenge because 137cs is highly water soluble and is chemi cally reactive with wide variety of materials including common building mate rials such as concrete and stone approximately 36 city blocks will be contaminated to varying degrees contamination will settle on streets sidewalks and building surfaces and will be found in several kilometers of the subway system city one building interiors will become contaminated due to ventilation systems doors windows because negative building pressure can draw aer osols in through very small op enings and foot traffic personal propertyincluding vehicles and items inside buildingswill also become contaminated but many items can be adequate ly decontaminated for free release summary of decontamination and cleanup activities is as follows some demolition will likely be re quired but most surfaces may be systematically decontaminated to w levels lengthy costly process officials may focus decontamination work first on critical infrastructure such as major thoroughfares the subway and the water treatment plantin order to restore basic functi ons as quickly as possible streets with cracks are cut refilled and resurfaced some must be completely removed and repaved most sidewalks must be surface cleaned roofing materials are mostly re moved and roofs are resurfaced surface soil and vegetation are removed for disposal and replaced with fresh material exterior surfaces are decontaminated with an assortment of chemical treatments eg stripping vacuum blas ting scabbling and collected wastes are hauled off for disposal contaminated building in teriors are mostly stri pped of surface coatings carpet drapery furniture etc and are refurbished workers try to capture decontaminati on wastes for disposal but much will escape into storm drains with each spring rain sewers become contaminated some are cleaned of hot spots but othe rs may be left fairly contained if cleaning them is not justified though concentrations are low

closing us borders which would have an immediate effect on mexico and canada economic impact although technologies exist to decontaminate ar eas these technologies were designed for smaller isolated areas and the process may take several years decontamination destruction disposal and replacement of lost infrastructure will be costly ie hundreds of millions of dollars per site economic losses in the area due to lost business productivity tax revenue and property will be significant the entire contaminated area may be economically depressed for years additionally an overall national economic downturn may occu r in the wake of the attack due to loss of consumer c onfidence virtually all commercial insurance policies exclude radioactive contamination so th federal government will be left

mandeliv ered ieds to inflict the greatest number of causalities detailed attack scenario during an event at large urban entertainmen tsports venue three suicide bombers are strategically prepositio ned inside the arena the detonation of their devices will instill mass panic and chaotic evacuation of the arena occupants evacuating the arena are most likely to move toward one of several locations portion of the occupants will remain in the immediate area around the venue clogging ingress for emergency responders some will head toward public transportation while others will head toward parking lots to re trieve their vehicles and depart the area the main thrust of the attack is at the evacu ation points in the area of the main evacuee collection area most likely on main street outside the venue the ua has placed large vehicle bomb lvb disguised as fire departmentems service vehicle it is conceivable to disguise 10000 pounds of explos ives in such vehicle but the actual amount could be scaled down and still achieve severe effects blast dispersal and damage patterns are determined based on the amount and type of explosive used simultaneous to the detonation of the lvb second set of

geographical considerationsdescription the incident is primarily designed for an ur ban environment but could be adapted for more rural area events such as county fairs and other large gatherings casualty estimates would be reduced as function of reduced target population and less population density at target points the primary urban cation would be dow ntown highcapacity entertainment center such as the mci center in washington dc or the superdome in new orleans louisiana the complex would be located within short distance of an underground public tran sportation station timelineevent dynamics initially suicide bombers detonate their devices approximately 1 hour after the start of the entertainment event the detonation of additi onal ieds is delayed approximately 10 to 15 minutes after the initial suicide bombings in or der to allow for detect ion evacuation and response of ems providers the detonation of the lvb at the hospital site will be the hardest to time for maximum effect and may need to be coordinated by some communication among cell members in any case the hospital device should be detonated before the arrival of casualties from the entertainment venue the timing of some of these events with th exception of the evacua tion stimulus is not critical the more people who evacuate the ve nue the more potential explosivesrelated casualties are produced if evacuation of th venue is delayed tonation of the lvb near the venue can be expected to produce incr eased casualties inside the structure due to collapse secondary and ter tiary blast effects increas ed exposure to products of combustion thermal effects and crowd surge assumptions the disguised lvb contains large amount of readily attainable commercial explosive material such as anfo or other explosive ma terial the estimated lethal air blast range for this vehicle 4000 pounds of anfo is 300 feet 91 meters fatalities from secondary and tertiary blast injuries can be r easonably expected at 15 times that distance blast overpressures of approximately 8 psi can be predicted out to 190 feet 57 meters this force is sufficient to cause the failure of brick wall panels overpressures of 10 psi

suspects that the cattle have case of infectious bovine rhinot racheitis or bovine respiratory s yncytial virus not certain of his diagnosis he contacts state animal health auth orities on november 9 the animal health department sends foreign animal disease fad diagnostician to the farm suspecting fad the diagnostician makes determinatio n of highly likely for specific highly contagious fad samples are sent to the fo reign animal disease diagnostic laboratory faddl at the plum island new york anim disease center as precautionary measure the diagnostician immediatel places the ranch under

on november 8 in third state slaughter house worker notices that several animals from new shipment of cattle have arrived in generally poor condition the cattle are feverish and will not eat he attributes the symptoms to shipping fever and isolates them late in the day another worker finds that their condition has deteri orated after noticing their excessive salivation he investigates and finds clinical symptoms of disease he notifies the plant manager w ho contacts the contracted vete rinarian early on november 9 the veterinarian inspects the ailing animals and is concerned that they may have specific fad the veterinarian notifies th state animal hea lth commission which dispatches fad diagnostician on examining the animals the dia gnostician determines that specific fad is highly likely he rranges for tissue samples from the infected animals to be sent to faddl plum island the diagnostician di scusses the need to activate first assessment and sampling am fast with state

in many sectors of the economy including but not limited to agricultur longterm matters will be centered mostly on foreign trade economic factors will include th value of the affected lives tock the cost to federal state and local governments to identify cont ain and eradicate the fad the cost of disposal and remediation the loss of revenue suffered by related industries the loss of revenue suffered by the retail industry due to public perception that the fad poses disease risk the loss of export markets immedi ately on confirmation that the fad exists and the cost to renew the livestock lost to euthanasia longterm health issues the inevitable development and use of new technologies to include rapid detection improved traditional vaccinesadvanced molecular vaccines and new

for multiple events yes recovery timeline months scenario overview general description this scenario illustrates that an organized attack by the universal adversary ua can disrupt wide variety of internetrelated services and undermine the nations confidence in the internet leading to economic harm fo r the united states in this scenario the ua conducts cyber attacks against critical infras tructures reliant upon th internet by using sophisticated c2 network built over long period of time detailed attack scenario the ua seeks to cause internal untraceable disruptions in the united states to distract the populace and decision makers for mont hs the ua believes cyber attack can effectively meet the goals of information extraction undermining user confidence in the internet disrupting the underlying internet infr astructure will have significant economic impact by severely reducing the publics confidence in the us financial infrastructure and affecting online banking ecommerce and other internetbased services the ua has spent several years to assemble joint military and intelligence team this team includes groups that discover and exploi t computer vulnerabilities create attacks related to those discoveries conduct reconnaissance and battle damage assessments and conduct actual cyber operations the primary ta rget is the confidence of the american people the attack campaign is conducted in three phases phase 1 attack preparation objective construct an attack network with underlying encrypted c2 mechanisms with which to launch future at tacks this phase will initiate about 2 years prior and continue until approximately 1 week prior to the dday event it will continue until several hundred thousand bots1 are populated in the attack network 1 bot is common parlance on the internet for software program that is software agent bot interacts with other network services intended for people as if it were real person one typical use of bots is to gather information wwwwikipediaorg national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 15 cyber attack 152 event 11 deploy mole software attack mechanism write personal firewall and distribute it via trusted computer security software provider ch as zonealarm the software would include an autoupdate function with autoupdate software can be morphed on command but will appear benign to anyone initially inspecting and approving it even on wellrun systems people rarely check old software the autoupdate function will check if its time to start the attack or just get the latest version when conducting autoupdates the so ftware will only connect to known addresses and servers reservi ng communications with the botnet2 until it is time for the actual attack when loaded onto victims computer the software will participate in the botnet event 12 design and build bot attack mechanism write bot to scan and depl oy using wide variety of vulnerabilities as they are identified v ulnerabilities and the ability to exploit them have very short life span relative to 2year planning cycle the bot will communicate using the same c2 technology as the mole software but will not do so until it is time to launch the attack event 13 trading and bartering attack mechanism the internet underground has it s own culture for trading and bartering for almost anything includi ng compromised systems compromised hosts including routers will be acqui red from the underground and the new bot will be installed the hosts will also be repaired to prevent other unwanted infiltration event 14 build the c2 network using traditional widely available tools and techniques attack mechanism use traditional scanning and probing tec hniques in addition to the newly created tools to build the c2 network and botnet phase 2 overwhelm network security personnel objective this goal of this phase is to wear down the firstresponder capabilities of the internet service provider isp community just prior to dday the attacks will occur for 2 to 3 hours during periods when first responders are normally not at work eg 200 am or holidays attacks should repeat randomly across the isp and the core internet services community with the intent of demoralizing the first responders these events will all take place in the last few days before d day event 21 forge address resolu tion protocol arp replies attack mechanism forge arp replies with random internet protocol ip and mandatory access control address informa tion this is done using the widely deployed zombies poison arp caches causing failures that are very difficult to trace and troubleshoot 2 botnet is jargon term for collection of software r obots or bots which run auto nomously wwwwikipediaorg national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 15 cyber attack 153 event 22 undermine dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp attack mechanism randomly generate dhcp release requests on behalf of other systems on networks that have zombies deployed randomly generate dhcp requests with the intent of consum ing network addresses this will cause local system and network administrators to spend valuable time tracking down problems on local networks phase 3 massive network outages objective attack major internet services to undermine consumer and government confidence in the functionality of the internet this phase will also last only days event 31 attack dns functionality attack mechanism conduct distributed denial of service ddos attacks against the websites and their upstream providers these attacks will use zombies from both inside and outside organizations unleash the botnet built over the past 2 years in massive ddos attack planning considerations geographical considerationsdescription the problems are experienced across the countr as well as internationally overseas trade could be affected due to the mistrust in the us internet infrastructure and the problematic us economy timelinesevent dynamics year or two is needed for preparation the attack is executed over period of months to ensure extended press coverage and undermine confidence in the internet assumptions initial reconnaissance is ither undetected or detected but not effectively acted upon the ua can avoid tipping off us intelligence by using usbased hosting companies as it gathers resources for the attack c2 issues of timing several nearly simu ltaneous attacks can be worked out by uas organizational structure mission areas activated preventiondeterrence the strength of private sector companies wi ll be tested in regard to prevention and deterrence national planning scenarios for official use only version 213 final draft scenario 15 cyber attack 154 infrastructure protection although physical infrastructure is not at great risk internet software dete riorates and numerous systems must be repaired this requi res software expertise time and money to correct if not already impacted numerous systems would have to shut down emergency assessmentsdiagnosis the attack will be difficult to recognize ach attack will end before anyone would have enough time to completely diagnose the problem emergency managementresponse emergency response will be sp lit between technically bri nging systems back online and instituting business continuity process and controlling the public perception of the situation to restore confidence and prevent panicky behaviors hazard mitigation all isps domain name serversystem dns operators and other organizations will need to evaluate their network topologies di versity integrity of b ackup processes and other methods of attack prevention companies will also have to consider methods to improve the firstresponder capabilities victim care primarily victim care will be based on eco nomic assurance c itizens will look for government assurances that the internet is stable an d viable method for conducting business and other financial operations investigationapprehension using intelligence and law enforcement source s and methods the inve stigators will need to determine the likely technical source and the identity of the perpetrators implications fatalitiesinjuries significant fatalities or injuries are expected alt hough collateral effects eg involving hospitals emergency services resp onses and control systems may have limited fatal consequences property damage property damage is exp ected although those control systems that are dualhomed may cause physical damage service disruption service
