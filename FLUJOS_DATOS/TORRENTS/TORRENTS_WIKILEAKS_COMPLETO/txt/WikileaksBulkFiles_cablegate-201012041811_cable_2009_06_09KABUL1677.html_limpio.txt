subject helmand governor mangal upbeat hopeful in meeting with ambassador classified by ambassador karl w eikenberry for reasons 14 b and c 1 u helmand governor gulabuddin mangal was upbeat yet realistic during june 16 call on ambassador eikenberry at the us embassy the ambassador gave mangal set of photos taken during last months grand opening of the bost commercial airfield in helmand mangal thanked the ambassador and promised to share the photos with helmand leaders mangal said many helmandi leaders had sent messages of support for the ambassadors speech and that local media had rebroadcast the speech several times the ambassador was encouraged by this news telling mangal that he wrote the speech himself based on both his knowledge of the new us strategy in afghanistan and his desire to bolster the confidence of helmands residents in the united states and the international community 2 sbu mangal offered brief overview of the security situation in helmand since he was appointed in early 2008 describing security throughout the province as bad and pointing specifically to the complete lack of security in provincial capital lashkar gah he said fear among afghan national security forces ansf both the afghan national army ana and afghan national police anp led them to fire shots randomly in the streets he added there was complete lack of coordination with coalition forces mangal said narcotics traffickers operating with impunity lived within 100 meters of the police station in the capital mangals arrest of these characters was met with strong resistance from the local chief of police and national directorate of security nds chief who had warned him that taking on drug traffickers was too dangerous mangal said he proceeded anyway because he knew that they were not stronger than the law mangal admitted that the crackdown on narcotics traffickers in the city had created problems and that his effectiveness as governor has suffered because of it nevertheless he said he would never give up on maintaining security and by extension prosperity in helmand mangal also said coordination between ansf and nato forces had improved greatly under his watch he reported good relationship with rcsouth deputy commanding general nicholson and said he senses commitment from the united states to continuing coordination against drug trafficking mangal thanked the united states for its continuing counter narcotics support 3 sbu mangal spoke of the success of the food zone program which he hopes will be renewed for second year he reported he has achieved buyin from many community leaders including the line minister of health tribal elders and religious leaders who issued fatwah reminding helmandis that drugs are prohibited in islam he also touted his public awareness campaign which has included posters telling youth of the dangers of drugs and informing farmers of alternative livelihood options mangal assured the ambassador that poppy production would fall to zero this year 4 cnf mangal reminded the ambassador that five districts in helmand are currently under control of enemy forces he expressed hope that those would soon be under giroa control with help from the incoming marine expeditionary brigade meb he recalled successful marine operations in garmsir last year which is now secure district and said elders at bost were very complementary about the us efforts however when the ambassador asked him to assess the british mangal said people are not optimistic mangal stressed he admires british sacrifices and what they have done but that the public is not happy because of unfulfilled goals mangal said sangin district looks like military compound due to the high number of uk troops and opined this should not be necessary to maintain security there he also complained that the uk has done nothing to advance reconstruction goals in the province he qualified these observations by saying that he admires the new techniques of british special forces and hoped they would change everything by continuing to fight narcotics traffickers 5 c referring to the successful counter narcotics operation at marja last month mangal told the ambassador that some people had misinformed president karzai note mangal was referring to tribal leaders who reportedly misinformed karzai that the operation had resulted in civilian casualties rather than supporting the success of the operation end note mangal proudly said he told kabul 00001677 002 of 002 karzai directly that the operation had targeted enemies and accomplished major success he also said civilian casualties had in fact occurred but not as many as karzais friends reported mangal said karzais friends of which there are many in helmand kandahar and urugzan often tell him the wrong things 6 c mangal at first deflected the ambassadors inquiry on the status of his relationship with karzai saying only that i am working hard at doing my job he added that karzai had attempted to replace him with sher mohammed akhunzada known warlord and criminal only three months after mangals appointment last year mangal described discussion he had with karzai at the time in which he said to karzai if you trust you must give three more months to prove myself karzai according to mangal backed down telling mangal his anger was really directed at british forces mangal opined that karzai remains jealous of his good relationship with isaf and coalition forces but recognizes that mangal is the best pick to make progress in helmand mangal admitted that his relationship with karzai has suffered since he was governor of laghman the ambassador said the fact that karzai assigned mangal to such an important province was signal of confidence and trust but recognized that tensions would always exist due to karzais personal connections the ambassador said he can see mangals strong relationship with leaders in helmand and reaffirmed that british confidence in mangal is very high he also reassured mangal that united states sees him as superb governor in dangerous role who is both wise and brave he said afghans and the international community alike see mangal among the rising generation of leaders in new afghanistan 7 sbu the ambassador told mangal that new isaf commander general stanley mcchrystal is longtime professional colleague and personal friend and promised to brief general mcchrystal on the history of helmand before his first visit for the us and uk helmand is one of the top two or three provinces for our strategy in the next year which is reflected in the deployment of our marines there the ambassador said in his new civilian role he would increase the focus on reconstruction governance and development including programs that increase capacity and reduce unemployment he stressed that in order to combat unemployment we will work hard on agricultural productivity and programs that help farmers bring those products to market road development small scale irrigation systems will also be emphasized at the same time we will take all measures we can to reinforce programs to establish better governance and to increase communication with karzai the ambassador encouraged mangal not to lose faith he invited mangal to stop by any time he is in kabul and said on his next visit to helmand they would walk through the bazaar together mangal thanked the ambassador for his kind words and vowed to keep pushing forward change in helmand eikenberry
