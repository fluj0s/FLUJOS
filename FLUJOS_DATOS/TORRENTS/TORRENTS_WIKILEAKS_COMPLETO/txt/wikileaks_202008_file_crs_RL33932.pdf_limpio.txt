logging is pervasive problem throughout the world affecting countries that produce export and import wood and wood pr oducts i llegal logging is generally defined as the harvest transport purchase or sale of timber in violation of national laws in some timb erproducing countries in th developing world illegal logging represents over half of timber production and exports the world bank estimates that illegal logging costs gove rnments approximate ly 15 billion annually in lost royalties illegal logging may stimulate corruption co llusion and other crimes within governments and has been linked to the purchase of weapons in regional conflicts in africa illegal logging howev er benefits perpetra tors by reducing the cost of legal and regulatory compliance of timber harvesting sometimes resulting in higher profits illegal logging in protected areas can lead to degraded forest ecosystems loss of biodiversity and indir ectly to deforestation and the spread of agrarian activity in some developing countries several relevant multilateral and international agreements address illegal logging and illegal timber trade these range from voluntary agreements that for example allow consumer countries to ex change data with producing countries to legally binding multilateral agreements that enable signatory governments to seize illegal products and exercise financial and criminal pe nalties on those who possess or transport illegally produced timber the united states is the worlds larges t wood products consum er and one of the top importers of tropical hardwoods so are concerned that us demand for tropical timber from countries in latin amer ica and southeast asia may be driver of illegal logging others assert that if there were illegally logged wood in the global market the value of us exports of timber could increase substantially the united states has specific domestic laws that address all aspects of illegal logging logging within the united states is addr essed by several laws and regulations some federal but many state that depend on what species is logged and where and how it is done in 2003 the united states developed an initiative to help developing countries stop illegal logging this initiative aims to remove legal and institutional barriers to combating illegal logging promote technology to improve monitoring the legal trade in logging and create incentives to abolish illegal logging practices in rural communities the united states also addressed illegal logging in free trade agreement fta with peru the agreement requires that the peruvian government enforce its international treaty obligations and increase monitoring and enforcement of illegal logging in its country illegal logging is addressed by cong ress in the 2008 farm

estimates that illegal logging costs governments approximately 15 billion nnually in lost royalties3 illegal logging is concern to many because of its economic implications as well as its environmental social and political impacts4 some are concerned that us dema nd for tropical timber from countries in latin america and southeast asia may be driver of illegal logging the united states is the worlds largest wood products consumer and one of the top importers of tropical hardwoods for example th united states is the largest importer of peruvian mahogany which some estimate to be 80 illegally logged5 some others contend that illegal logging activities devalue us exports of timber according to one study illegal logging of roundwood and its wood products presses world wood prices on average by 716 annually if there were illegally logged wood in the global market it has been projected that the value of us exports of roundwood sawnwood and panels could increase by an average of

economist may 23 2006ecological impacts of illegal logging several ecological impacts can be associated with illegal logging practices these impacts depend on how illegal logging practices are defined and where they occur if illegal logging is characterized as largescale destructive logging it can potentially lead to the conversion of fore sts to grassland depletion of plant species eg tree species such as mahogany nd in some cases depletion of animal populations that depend on the habitats being logged if logging illegally occurs in protected areas important bi ological resources eg ra re plant and animal species may become threatened if logging is not done according to mandated management plans it can potentially lead to collateral damage whereby other tree species and younger trees are damaged risk of fire is increased and potential for sustainable harvesting of timber is lowered in some instances in the tropics logging has been characterized as the initial stimulus for roadbuilding which leads to gr eater access to primary forests if illegal logging occurs in protected areas improved access to these areas through logging roads may lead to further activities such as clearcutting ranching and agricultural development in the area socioeconomic impacts of illegal logging illegal logging can have economic impacts in the countries where it occurs in several countries where illegal logging ta kes place the volume of timber extracted illegally is greater than the official harvested total further illegal logging and trade are connected to other illegal activities ch as corruption tax evasion and money laundering among other things15 if illegal logging is prevalent in country there may be low propensity to invest for example illegal logging may signal that law enforcement is lax and that corruption is prevalent these factors may deter long term investment in these countries and may increase costs for investors already involved in the country one definition of illegal logging is extracting timber without reporting it to government officials w ithout reporting gove rnments cannot assess taxes on the wood being extracted which resu lts in loss of revenue for the country for example indonesia estimated that it s losses from illegal logging are 3 billion annually which is equi valent to more than 45 of the total value of its legitimate exports of wood and wood products valued at 65 billion annually16 illegal logging can arguably have positive economic impact illegal logging can create jobs in impoverish ed areas provide shortterm lowcost timber and satisfy

certification is the process by which the performance of ontheground forestry operations is assessed against predetermined set of standards governments and citizens perceive that illegal logging is beneficial to the community some will not seek the enforcement of ws or will attempt to legalize illegal timber to preserve revenues17 illegal logging can affect local communities in the countries where it is occurring local communities may depend on forests for nontimber forest products eg fruits and medicines as well as for habitat and cover for wild game and fish illegal logging in these areas may convert forest ecosystems to less useful ecosystems such as grasslands or savannahs in some parts of the world illegal logging has been termed conflict logging similar in m eaning to conflict diamonds for example money earned from the illegal trade in wood has been traced to the purchase of weapons used in conflicts such as th one between liberia and sierra leone18 international initiatives and institutions several relevant multilateral and international agreements relate to illegal logging and illega l timber trade these range from voluntary agreements that for example allow consumer c ountries to exchan ge data with producing countries to legally binding multilateral agreements that enable signatory governments to seize illegal products and exercise financial penaltie s on illegally produced timber this section reviews some of the agreements that have been implemented and some international institutions involve d in addressing illegal logging19 wood certification programs two primary wood certification programs affect wood consumed in the united states20 the forest stewardship council fsc is an independent international nongovernmental organization that certif ies that wood come s from wellmanaged forests that meet an established set of criteria one key criterion is that the chain of custody information is provided this info rmation strives to contain the names and locations of each handler of the wood from the forest it came from to the shop where the product is being sold approximate ly 220 million acres are certified under the fsc program worldwide

canada the eu and elsewhere for reference there are nearly 10 billion acres of forested land on the earth22 some contend that certification pr ograms if managed and monitored consistently could reduce illegal logging most certified forests are in europe and north america only 8 of the total certifie d area is in developing countries 2 in asia and the pacific 3 in latin america and 3 in africa23 others however argue that obtaining certification in devel oping countries is prohibitively expensive for most logging operations costs for managing forests to maintain certification disorganized bureaucracy and lax rules ma ke certification in developing countries difficult24 some argue that certification is not worth it because the demand for certified tropical wood is not consistent fro m year to year and the cost to obtain certification makes wood less compe titive on the market to increase the demand for certified wood and to stimula interest in certificati on some have suggested that importing countries require cer tified wood for government projects five countries in the european union including great br itain have implemented or are trying to implement policies that would require stat efinanced construction projects to use certified wood united nations the united nations forum on forests is an intergovernmental forum that promotes the sustainable deve lopment management and c onservation of forests it aims to provide multiyear program of work to develop policies regarding forests with the goal of developing lega l framework on all types of forests

however provisions establishing an environmental committee to address complaints and requirements for enforcing multilateral environmental treaties eg cites and domestic laws are included many contend
