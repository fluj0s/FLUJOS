rfs requiring the blending of bi ofuels such as ethanol in the nations fuel supply the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa pl 110140 significantly expanded this mandate the rfs mandate has been major impetus to the development of the us ethanol industry as result ethanol production capacity and the demand for corn as biofuel feedstock have grown dramatica lly over the past few years in 2005 the united states produced 39 billion gallons of ethanol requiring roughly 14 billion bushels of corn in 2007 those numbers had increased to 65 billion gallons and 23 billion bushels in 2007 roughl onequarter of the us corn crop was directed to ethanol productionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22870crs2 1 rick perry governor of texas letter to the honorable stephe n l johnson administrator us environmental protection agency april 25 2008 2 for more information see crs report rl33290 fuel ethanol background and public policy issues by brent d yacobucci 3 42 usc 7545o7increasing demand for corn for biofuels the rise in energy prices and other supply concerns in grain markets have led to rapid increases in corn and other grain prices these higher grain prices ve raised concern globally ove r food prices and availability because of these concerns there is growing interest among some policymakers to amend or eliminate the rfs under the provisions of epact and eisa the administrator of the environmental protection agency epa has th authority to waive the rfs requirements in whole or in part in response to petition by state or fuel provider or on his own motion on april 25 2008 texas governor rick pe rry sent letter to epa administrator stephen johnson petitioning for 50 waiver from the rfs requirements1 epa must approve or disapprove th waiver within 90 days of recei pt of the petition by july 24 2008 in his letter governor pe rry states that he initiated the petition because of the negative effect of the requirements on th texas economy and on global food prices current rfs requirements currently the rfs requires the blending of 90 billion gallons of renewable fuel in transportation fuels in 2008 increasing to 36 billion gallons in 2022 of this mandate an increasing share must be met with adva nced biofuels biofuels produced from feedstocks other than corn starch incl uding cellulosic biofue l and biobased diesel substitutes however these advanced biofuel mandates do not begin to be phased in until 2009 and 20102 as has been the case in previous years in 2008 the vast majority of the mandate is expected to be met with us co rn ethanol and smaller amount of sugarcane ethanol from brazil the 90billiongallon mandate for 2008 is roughly double the mandated amount in 2007 47 billion gallons and roughly 30 higher than 2007 consumption 68 billion gallons in future years corn ethanols share of the rfs is effectively capped at 15 billion gallons per year the eisa amendments to the rfs specifically mandate the use of cellulosic biofuel 16 billion gallons by 2022 and biomassbased diesel fuel 10 billion gallons annually by 2012 waiver provisions as amended by eisa section 211o7 of the clean air act3 gives the epa administrator the authority to waive in whol or in part the total volume of renewable fuel mandated by the rfs if in his determination there is inadequate domestic supply to meet the mandate or if implementation of the requirement woul d severely harm thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22870crs3 4 42 usc 7545o7ai 5 under epact only states could petition epa for the waiver eisa amended the rfs to allow fuel providers to file petition and to give the epa administrator authority to initiate the process on his own motion 6 epa regulation of fuels and fuel additives re newable fuel standard program final rule may 1 2007 72 federal register 2389924014 7 72 federal register 23928 8 as of may 1 2008 epa had not yet established the public comment period for the texas waiver requesteconomy or environment of state region or the united states4 further under certain conditions the epa administrator may waive in whole or in part the specific carveouts for cellulosic biofuel and biomassbased diesel fuel general waiver on the petition of state or fuel provider or at his own discretion5 the administrator may waive the overall rfs requirement for given year if waiver is granted any adjustment applies to total national requirement regardless of who initiates the waiver petition all fuel suppliers quotas would be reduced by similar percentage as the law is written epa may not waive the requirement for an individual state or supplier w ithin state but must reduce the entire national mandate to grant the waiver the epa administrator must determine in consultation with the secretaries of agriculture and energy th at one of two conditions has been met there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or implementation of the re quirement would severe ly harm the economy or environment of state region or the united states however it is unclear how ep will interpret these criteria in its may 1 2007 final rule for 2007 onward6 epa explicitly stated that it would not establish more specific criteria for the waiver while epa realizes that the criteria provid ed by the statute are quite general the rationales of severe environmental or economic harm or inadequate domestic supply are sufficient for basic framework upon which petition can be built and evaluated each situation in which waiver may be requested will be unique and promulgating list of more specific criteria in the abstract may be counterproductive7 within 90 days of receipt of the waiv er petition epa must act to approve or disapprove the petition af ter public notice and opportunity for comment8 if epa does grant waiver the waiver expires after one year but may be extended by the epa administrator in consultation with the secretaries of agriculture and energy cellulosic biofuel waiver as part of the rfs eisa established specific mandate for the use of cellulosic biofuels ethanol or other fuels produced from woody or fibrous materials such as grasses trees etc the cellulosic carveout starts in 2010 at 01 billion gallons and increases to 160 billion gallons by 2022 current cellulosichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22870crs4 9 however the amount may not represent more than 15 of the total required amount for that yearbiofuel production is virtually nonexistent but several dem onstrationscale projects have broken ground or are expected to break ground relatively soon if the epa administrator determines that the projected production volume of cellulosic biofuel for given year is less than the mandated amount he may reduce the carveout if he is going to do so the ad ministrator must reduce the required amount by november 30 of the preceding calendar year if the administrator does reduce the mandated amount of cellulosic bi ofuel he may also reduce the total volume required for that year under the rfs by an qual or lesser amount but he is not required to do so unlike the general wavier only the epa administrator may initiate decision on cellulosic biofuel waiver biomassbased diesel waiver similar to the cellulosic biofuel carveout eisa also established specific mandate fo r the use of biomassbased diesel fuel currently most of this fuel is biodies diesel fuel substitute produced from soybean oil and other vegetable oils throug h process called tra nsesterification but other fuels some of which are termed renewable diesel would also qualify the biomass diesel carveout starts in 2009 at 05 billion gallons and increases to 10 billion gallons by 2012 approximately 450 million gall ons of biodiesel were produced in the united states in 2007 if the epa administrator in consultation with the secretaries of energy and agriculture determines that there are significant market circumstances including feedstock disruptions that would make the pr ice of biomassbased diesel fuel increase significantly the administrator may re duce the amount mandated for up to 60 days9 the administrator may extend the waiver for more than an additional 60 days reductions in the rfs if the administrator waives significant share of the above requirements he must reduce the re quired volumes in all subsequent years specifically he must reduce the applicable amount s in future years if he waives any of the above requirements by 20 or more for two consecutive years or 50 or more in single year for example if the administrator reduced the overall rfs requirement by 60 billion gallons in both 2017 and 2018 then he woul d be required to reduce the total rfs requirement by 60 billion gallons in 2019 and beyond the one exception is that these reductions in the rfs would not apply to the requirements before calendar year 2016 effects of waiver questions have been raised over how wa iver approval would affect food and fuel markets as these markets are extremely comp lex there is simple answer the effects of waiver would likel depend on many factorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22870crs5 10 in addition to the rfs mandate biofuels are so subject to tax incentives for their production and use most significantly fuel providers w ho blend ethanol into gasoline receive tax credit of 51 cents for every gallon of ethanol they bl end in addition small ethanol producers receive tax credit of 10 cents per gallon on the first 15 million gallons they produce in give year biodiesel and renewable diesel producers receiv tax credit of up to 100 per gallon of fuel they produce for more
