policy guidance regarding title ix and athletics the agency specifically noted that participation rates for women in college sports are far below those of men and that on most campuses the primary problem confronting female athletes is the absence of fair and adequate level of resources services and benefits6 federal law regarding title ix intercollegiate athletics consists of three basic components 1 the title ix statute which was enacted in the education amendments of 1972 and amended in the education amendments of 19747 2 the department of education regulations which were originally issued in 1975 by hew8 and 3 eds policy guidance regarding title ix athletics the athletics policy guidance is primarily comprised of two documents 1 1979 policy interpretation that established the controversial threepart test9 and 2 1996 clarification of the threepart test which reinvigorated enforcement of title ix in intercollegiate athletics10 in addition ed issued further clarifications in 2003 and 200511 despite the public attention generated by the threepart test it is important to note that the test itself forms only small part of the larger body of title ix law general overview of the title ix statute and regulations is provided below while the athletics policy guidance and the legal debate surrounding title ix and the threepart test are described in greater detail in subsequent sections in addition to this substantial body of title ix law and policy one other federal statute the equity in athletics disclosure act12 also applies to intercollegiate athletics under this statute colleges and universities are required to report statistical data broken down by sex on undergraduate enrollment and athletic participation and expenditures

federal funds from discriminating in their education programs or activities specifically the statute declares person in the united states shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance subject to certain exceptions 13 the original title ix

title ix implementing regulations which shall include with respect to intercollegiate athletic activities reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports14 this provision was added after congress eliminated section that would have made revenueproducing sports exempt from title ix15 it is important to note that under title ix the receipt of any amount of federal financial assistance is sufficient to trigger the broad nondiscrimination obligation embodied in the statute this nondiscrimination obligation extends institutionwide to all education programs or activities operated by the recipient of the federal funds even if some of the education programs or activities themselves are not funded with federal dollars 16 for example virtually all colleges and universities in the united states are recipients of federal financial assistance because they receive some form of federal aid such as scientific research grants or student tuition financed by federal loans once particular school is deemed recipient of federal financial assistance all of the education programs and activities that it operates are subject to title ix thus if college or university receives federal assistance through its student financial aid program its nondiscrimination obligation is not restricted solely to its student financial aid program but rather the obligation extends to all of the education programs or activities conducted by the institution including athletics and other programs that do not receive federal funds the provision regarding receipt of federal funds therefore is the pr imary mechanism for comp elling institutions to comply with title ix in their athletic programs 17

operated by recipients of federal funds the scope of title ix is quite broad while the statute lays out only the general prohibition against sex discrimination the implementing regulations specify the wide range of education programs or activities affected indeed the regulations bar recipients from discriminating on the basis of sex in student admissions recruitment scholarship awards and tuition assistance housing access to courses and other academic offerings counseling financial assistance employment assistance to students health and insurance benefits and services athletics and all aspects of educationrelated employment including recruitment hiring promotion tenure demotion transfer layoff termination compensation benefits job assignments and classifications leave and training 18 despite the wide array of programs and activities subject to title ix it is the provisions on athletics that have generated the bulk of public attention and controversy in recent years under 14 pl 93380 844 15 1979 policy interpretation supra footnote 6 at 71413 16 department of justice civil rights division title ix legal manual 51 jan 11 2001 available at httpwwwusdojgovcrtcorcoordixlegalpdf 17 for brief period from 1984 to 1988 title ix enforcement in college athletics was suspended as result of supreme court ruling that title ix was programspecific meaning that the statutes requirements applied only to education programs that received federal f unds and not to an institutions programs as whole grove city college v bell 465 us 555 574 1984 because few university athletic programs receive federal dollars college sports were essentially exempt from title ix coverage after this decision in the civil rights restoration act of 1987 pl 100 259 however congress overrode the supreme courts interpreta tion of title ix by passing legislation to clarify that title ixs requirements apply institutionwide and are not programspecific thus reinstating title ixs coverage of athletics 20

assistance are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of sex in their sports programs specifically the regulations declare person shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of be treated differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic intercollegiate club or intramural athletics offered by recipient19 in addition recipients are barred from providing athletics separately on the basis of sex except under certain circumstances such as when team selection is based on competitive skill or the activity is contact sport 20 finally the regulations require institutions that provide athletic scholarships to make such awards available in proportion to the numbers of male and female students participating in intercollegiate athletics21 an important principle embodied in the title ix regulations on athletics is the principle of equal opportunity under the regulations recipients such as colleges and universities must provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes22 when evaluating whether equal opportunities are available the department of ed ucation ed examines among other factors the provision of equipment and supplies scheduling of games and practice time travel and per diem allowance opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors provision of locker rooms and practice and competitive facilities provision of medical training facilities and services provision of housing and dining facilities and services and publicity 23 in addition ed considers whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes24 in order to measure compliance with this last factor ed established the threepart test that has been challenged by opponents of existing title ix policy to clarify how to comply with the intercollegiate athletics requirements contained in the title ix regulations ed issued policy interpretation in 1979 and subsequent clarification of this guidance in 199625 combined these two documents form the substantive basis of the policy guidance on the threepart test which has generated the bulk of the questions and concerns surrounding title ix and intercollegiate athletics ed also issued further clarification in 2003 but this document made only minor alterations to the 1979 policy interpretation and the 1996 clarification 26 in addition in 2005 ed issued yet another clarification that established new way in which colleges may demonstrate compliance with the interest test prong of the threepart test27 these guidance documents are discussed in greater detail in the section below 19 id at 10641a 20 id at 10641b under the

g9g158g146g141g138g151g140g142g561 as noted above ed has set forth its interpretation of the intercollegiate athletics provisions of the title ix statute and implementing regulations in two documents the 1979 policy interpretation and the subsequent 1996 clarification these two documents which remain in force were designed to provide guidance to colleges and universities regarding how to achieve title ix compliance by providing equal opportunity in their intercollegiate athletic programs to that end both of the guidance documents discuss the factors that ed considers when enforcing title ix 28 under the 1979 policy interpretation hew established three different standards to ensure equal opportunity in intercollegiate athletics29 first with regard to athletic scholarships the compliance standard is that such aid should be available on substantially proportional basis to the number of male and female participants in the institutions athletic program 30 second hew established standard that male and female athletes should receive equivalent treatment benefits and opportunities in the following areas equipment and supplies games and practice times travel and per diem coaching and academic tutoring assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors locker rooms and practice and competitive facilities medical and training facilities housing and dining facilities publicity recruitment and support services 31 finally in terms of meeting the regulatory requirement to address the interests and abilities of male and female students alike the compliance standard is that such interests and abilities must be equally effectively accommodated32 in order to determine compliance with the latt er accommodation standard ed considers three additional factors 1 the determination of athletic interests and abilities of students 2 the selection of sports offered33 and 3 the levels of competition available including the opportunity for team competition34 it is the criteria used to assess this third and final factor that form the basis of the threepart test the threepart test the debate over the test and its proportionality requirement eds title ix review commission and eds response to the commissions report are discussed in detail below 28 1979 policy interpretation supra footnote 6 1996 clarification supra footnote 10 29 although the policy interpretation focuses on formal intercollegiate athletic programs its requirements also apply to club intramural and interscholastic athletics 1979 policy interpretation supra footnote 6 30 id at 71414 this requirement however does not mean that schools must provide proportional number of scholarships or that all individual scholarships must be of equal value the only requirement is that the overall amount spent on scholarship aid must be proportional id at 71415 31 id such benefits opportunities and treatment need not be identical and even finding of nonequivalence can be justified by showing of legitimate nondiscriminatory factor s according to the policy inte rpretation some aspects of athletic programs may not be equivalent for men and women because of unique aspects of particular sports or athletic activities the policy interpretation specifically cites football as an example of such sport idat 7141516 32 id at 71414 33 according to the policy interpretation the regulation doe s not require institutions to integrate their teams nor to provide exactly the same choice of spor ts to men and women however where an institution sponsors team in particular sport for members of one sex it may be required either to permit the excluded sex to try out for the team or to sponsor separate team for the previously excluded sex id at 7141718 34 id at 71417

must provide the opportunity for male and female athletes to participate in competitive sports ed measures an institutions compliance with this requirement through one of the following three methods 1 whether intercollegiate level participation opportunities for male and female students are provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their respective enrollments or 2 where the members of one sex have been and are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes whether the institution can show history and continuing practice of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the devel oping interest and abilitie s of the members of that sex or 3 where the members of one sex are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes and the institution cannot show continuing practice of program expansion such as that cited above whether it can be demonstrated that the interests and abilities of the members of that sex have been fully and effectively accommodated by the present program 35 these three methods for determining whether in stitutions are complying with the title ix requirement to provide nondiscriminatory participation opportunities for both male and female athletes have come to be referred to as the threepart test in its 1996 clarification which addresses only the threepart test ed provides additional guidance for institutions seeking to comply with title ix according to the 1996 clarification an institution must meet only one part of the threepart test in order to prove its compliance with the nondiscrimination requirement36 thus institutions may prove compliance by meeting 1 the proportionality test which measures whether the ratio of male and female athletes is substantially proportional to the ratio of male and female students at the institution 2 the expansion test which measures whether an institution has history and continuing practice of expanding athletic opportunities for the underrepresented sex or 3 the interests test which measures whether an institution is accommodating the athletic interests of the underrepresented sex 37 in addition the 1996 clarification reiterates that ed examines many other factors beyond those set forth in the threepart test when it evaluates an institutions title ix athletics compliance38 the 1996 clarification also provides more detailed examination of the factors that ed considers under each of the three tests as well as examples illustrating how the various factors affect finding of compliance or noncompliance39 the 2003 clarification and the 2005 clarification which provide additional guidance regarding the threepart test are discussed separately below 35 id at 71418 36 1996 clarification supra footnote 10 37 dear colleague letter from the department of education s

critics contend that proportionality amounts to an unfair system of quotas because womens enrollment in postsecondary schools has increased dramatically in the decades since title ix was enacted rising 30 percent from 1981 to 199940 critics argue that proportionality results in reverse discrimination forcing schools to cut existing mens teams in order to create new slots for women 41 proponents of proportionality respond that title ix does not require quotas because schools that cannot demonstrate proportionality can still comply with title ix if they pass one of the two remaining parts of the threepart test supporters also reject the notion that title ix forces schools to eliminate mens teams arguing that costly mens sports like football are to blame for cuts in less popular sports for both men and women in addition supporters note that instead of cutting mens sports schools can achieve proportionality by adding womens teams 42 critics counter that even though the threepart test offers an alternative to the proportionality approach in theory in reality maintaining proportio nality is the only sure way to avoid lawsuit furthermore say critics even though schools can technically comply with the proportionality standard by adding womens teams budget realities often force institutions to cut mens teams instead proponents however respond that the vast majority of schools that add womens teams do not eliminate mens teams changing the proportionality test say proponents would be tantamount to repealing law that is widely credited for dramatically increasing womens interest participation and success in sports 43 in 2001 the general accounting office gao released study of intercollegiate athletics the gao report included the following findings the number of women participating in intercollegiate athletics at 4year colleges and universities increased substantiallyfrom 90000 to 163000between school years 198182 and 199899 while the number of men participating increased more modestlyfrom 220000 to 232000 44 womens athletic participation grew at more than twice the rate of their growth in undergraduate enrollment while mens participation more closely matched their growth in undergraduate enrollment45 the total number of womens teams increased from 5595 to 9479 gain of 3784 teams compared to an increase from 9113 to 9149 teams for men gain

net decreases in the number of teams for women the largest net decreases in the number of teams occurred in gymnastics for men the largest decreases were in wrestling47 in mens sports the greatest increase in numbers of participants occurred in football with about 7200 more players football also had the greatest number of participantsapproximately 60000 or about twice as many as the next largest sport wrestling experienced the largest decrease in participationa drop of more than 2600 participants 48 in all 963 schools added teams and 307 discontinued teams since 199293 most were able to add teamsusually womens teamswithout discontinuing any teams49 among the colleges and universities that added womens team the two factors cited most often as greatly influencing the decision were the need to address student interest in particular sports and the need to meet gender equity goals or requirements similarly schools that discontinued mens team cited lack of student interest and gender equity concerns as the factors greatly influencing their decision as well as the need to reallocate the athletic budget to other sports 50

until recently when ed appointed commission to study changes in title ix athletics policy the agency had historically favored the proportionality approach among the factors that ed considers under the proportionality test are the number of participation opportunities provided to athletes of both sexes according to ed as ge neral rule all athletes who are listed on teams squad or eligibility list and are on the team as of the teams first competitive event are counted as participants51 ed next determines whether these participation opportunities are substantially proportionate to the ratio of male and female students enrolled at the institution but for reasons of flexibility ed does not require exact proportionality 52 according to the 1996 clarification the proportionality test acts as safe harbor in other words if an institution can demonstrate proportional athletic opportunities for women then the institution will automatically be found to be in compliance53 if however an institution cannot prove proportionality then the institution can still establish compliance by demonstrating that the imbalance does not reflect discrimination because the institution either 1 has demonstrated history and continuing practice of expanding women s sports opportunities prong two or 2 has fully and effectively accommodated the athletic interests of women prong three 47 id 48 id at

harbor language in the 1996 guidance noting that the safe harbor phrase had led many schools to believe erroneously that achieving compliance with title ix could be guaranteed by meeting the proportionality test only ed reiterated that each of the three prongs of the test is an equally sufficient means of complying with title ix and one prong is favored54 finally the 1996 clarification explicitly declares that nothing in the threepart test requires an institution to eliminate participation opportunities for men and challenges the notion that the threepart test requires quotas55 rather the 1996 clarification states that the threepart test gives institutions flexibility and control over their athletic programs56 furthermore the 1996 clarification notes that the policy interpretation in general and the threepart test in particular have been upheld by every court that has reviewed the guidance documents57

proportionality standard virtually unchanged since shortly after the statute was enacted three decades ago several years ago the agency considered whether or not to alter its athletics policy to that end ed appointed the commission on opportunity in athletics in june 2002 to review title ix and to recommend changes if warranted the commission which held series of meetings around the country to discuss problems with and improvements to title ix issued its final report containing findings and recommendations in february 2003 58 in its report the commission noted that it found strong and broad support for the original intent of title ix coupled with great deal of debate over how the law should be enforced but that more needs to be done to create opportunities for women and girls and retain opportunities for boys and men59 ultimately the final report contained 23 recommendations for strengthening title ix including 15 recommendations that were adopted unanimously when the commission issued its final report however two dissentin g members of the panel refused to sign the document and instead issued minority report in wh ich they withdrew their support for two of the unanimous recommendations and raised concerns about several other unanimous recommendations60 the secretary of education indicated that he intended to consider changes only with respect to the unanimous recommendations of the commission among the unanimous recommendations of the commission are suggestions that ed 1 reaffirm its commitment to eliminating discrimination 2 clarify its guidance and promote consistency in enforcement 3 avoid making changes to title ix that undermine enforcement 4 clarify that cutting teams in order to achieve compliance is disfavored practice 5 enforce title ix

athletics policy64 several months later ed issued new guidance that essentially left the existing title ix policy unchanged in its 2003 clarification which provided further guidance regarding title ix policy and the threepart test ed reiterated that all three prongs of the threepart test have been and can be used to demonstrate compliance with title ix and the agency encouraged schools to use the approach that best suits its needs in addition the 2003 clarification declared that complying with title ix does not require schools to cut teams and that eliminating teams is disfavored practice the 2003 clarification also noted that ed expects both to provide technical assistance to schools and to aggressively enforce title ix finally the guidance indicated that ed will continue to allow private sponsorship of athletic teams 65 in 2005 ed issued yet another clarification of the threepart test66 in the 2005 clarification ed provided additional guidance with respect to part three of the threepart test under that test known as the interests test an institution may demonstrate compliance with title ix by establishing that it is accommodating the athletic interests of the underrepresented sex the new guidance clarified that one of the ways in which schools may demonstrate compliance with the interests test is by using an online survey to establish that the underrepresented sex has unmet interests in athletic participation such survey must be administered periodically to all students that are members of the underrepresented sex and students must be informed that failure to respond to the survey will be viewed as an indication of lack of interest as result the survey must be administered in way designed to generate high response rates the 2005 clarification emphasized that schools have flexibility to demonstrate compliance under any one part of the threepart test and that schools who choose to demonstrate compliance through the interests test have the option to do so in several ways among the factors that ed considers when determining whether the school has accurately measured student interest are surveys requests for the addition of varsity team participation in club or intramural sports participation rates in local high schools and athletic organizations and intercollegiate participation rates in the schools region even if schools population of the underrepresented sex is found to have an unmet interest in sports the institution will not be found to have violated title ix unless ed also finds that there is sufficient ability to sustain team and reasonable expectation of intercollegiate competition in the sport within the schools normal competitive region 67 64 ed also recently amended the title ix regulations in

until recent decision in 2005 none of these cases involved college or high school sports but they did help to shape the legal landscape surrounding title ix athletics policy for example in 1979 the supreme court held that title ix includes private right of action68 this decision strengthened title ix enforcement because it means that an individual can sue in court for violations under the statute rather than wait for ed to pursue complaint administratively the court further strengthened title ix enforcement in 1992 when it ruled that individuals could sue for money damages in title ix lawsuit 69 finally in decision that was later overturned by congress the court ruled that title ix did not apply to an entire educational institution but rather applied only to the portion of the institution that received federal funds70 in 2005 the court handed down its decision in jackson v birmingham board of education 71 in this case which involved girls basketball coach who claimed that he was removed from his coaching position in retaliation for his complaints about unequal treatment of the girls team the court held that title ix not only encompasses retaliation claims but also is available to individuals who complain about sex discrimination even if such individuals themselves are not the direct victims of sex discrimination 72 reasoning that title ixs enforcement scheme would unravel if retaliation went unpunished73 the court concluded that when funding recipient retaliates against person because he complains of sex discrimination this constitutes intentional discrimination on the basis of sex in violation of title ix74 although the supreme court has decided only one case that directly involves title ix athletics the lower federal courts have heard multiple challenges to the statute and regulations in fact all of the federal courts of appeals that have considered the athletics policy interpretation the threepart test and the proportionality rule have upheld eds title ix regulations and policy 75 in general these courts have noted that the regulations and guidance represent reasonable agency interpretation of title ix and they have ruled that the threepart test does not unfairly impose quotas because institutions may select from two other methods besides proportionality in order to comply with title ix indeed in 1993 the first circuit reached this conclusion in cohen v brown university landmark title ix case that was the first federal appeals court decision 68 cannon v univ of chicago 441 us 677 1979 69 franklin v gwinnett county

summary of the cohen decision as well as description of the national wrestling coaches association lawsuit which has been dismissed and recent cases involving the question of whether high school sports associations discriminate when they schedule boys and girls sports in different seasons g5g152g145g142g151g561g159g495g561g4g155g152g160g151g561g23g151g146g159g142g155g156g146g157g162g561 in the cohen case female athletes at brown university sued under title ix when the school eliminated two womens sportsgymnastics and volleyballand two male teamsgolf and water poloin costcutting measure77 although the cuts made far larger reductions in the womens athletic budget than in the mens the cuts did not affect the ratio of male to female athletes which remained roughly 63 percent male to 37 percent female despite student body that was approximately 52 percent male and 48 percent female78 in their lawsuit the members of the womens gymnastics and volleyball teams charged that browns athletic arrangements violated title ixs ban on genderbased discrimination79 when the district court ordered the university to reinstate the two womens team pending full trial on the merits brown appealed by challenging the validity of both the title ix guidance in general and the threepart test in particular the first circuit however affirmed the district courts decision in favor of the female athletes80 in reaching its decision to uphold the validity of the threepart test the first circuit emphasized that eds interpretation of title ix warranted deference according to the court the degree of deference is particularly high in title ix cases because congress explicitly delegated to the agency the task of prescribing standards for athletic programs under title ix81 thus the court adopted eds threepart test as an acceptable standard by which to measure an institutions compliance with title ix as have all other appeals courts to subsequently consider the issue82 next the court in cohen turned to the question of whether the university had met any one part of the threepart test because there was large disparity between the proportion of women at brown who were students versus the proportion w ho were athletes and because the university had not demonstrated history of expanding womens sports the court focused its inquiry on whether or not brown had met part three of the test by effectively accommodating student interest the university argued that when measuring interest under this standard the relative athletic interests of male and female students should be the proper point of comparison rather than the relative 76 991 f2d 888 891 1st cir 1993 77 id at 892 78 id 79 id at 893 80 id at 891 81 id at 895 82 see eg chalenor v univ of north dakota 291 f3d 1042 8th

argued that its female students were less interested in sports than its male students and that its title ix compliance should thus be measured by this standard under eds construction of the accommodation test however institutions must ensure participation opportunities where there is sufficient interest and ability among the members of the excluded sex to sustain viable team and reasonable expectation of intercollegiate competition for that team 84 noting that this standard does not require institutions to provide additional athletic opportunities every time female students express interest the court upheld the district courts finding that the existence and success of womens gymnastics and volleyball at brown demonstrated that there was sufficient inte rest in and expectation of competition in those sports to rule in favor of the female athletes with regard to the third prong of the threepart test85 in subsequent appeal in the cohen case the court explicitly noted that browns view of the accommodation test which seems to assume that women are naturally less interested in sports than men reflects invidious gender stereotypes and could potentially freeze in place any existing disparity in athletic participation86 finally the court rejected the universitys constitutional challenge ruling that title ix does not violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment87 in subsequent appeal in the cohen case the court emphasized this point aspect of the title ix regime at issue in this case inclusive of the statute the relevant regulation and the pertinent agency documents mandates genderbased preferences or quotas or specific timetables for implemen ting numerical goals race and gender conscious remedies are both ppropriate and constitutionally permissible under federal antidiscrimination regime although such remedial measures are still subject to equal protection review 88

students have begun filing lawsuits that challenge the decision of certain state high school sports associations to schedule girls sports in nontraditional seasons that differ from the season for corresponding boys sports arguing that the scheduling disparity violates the equal protection clause of the constitution and title ix in michigan for example federal district court ruled that the michigan high school athletic associations mhsaa scheduling of high school sports seasons in mich igan discriminated against female athletes on the basis of gender and thus violated the constitution

meanwhile disturbed by the decline in the number of mens wrestling teams at colleges and universities across the country the national wrestling coaches association nwca together with former wrestling teams at several institut ions filed lawsuit against ed in 2002 arguing that the title ix regulations were adopted illegally and that title ix unfairly discriminates against men92 in the lawsuit the nwca argued 1 that eds establishment of the title ix regulations and policy guidance was procedurally defective 2 that ed exceeded its authority under the title ix statute when enacting those regulations and guidance and 3 that eds regulations and guidance discriminate against male athletes thereby violating the title ix statute and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment 93 in response to the lawsuit ed backed by the bush administration moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that 1 the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the case 2 judicial review was unauthorized under the circumstances of this particular case and 3 the suit was barred by the statute of limitations94 the national womens law center nwlc filed an amicus brief in support of ed arguing that the suit was improper because there was guarantee that institutions would reinstate mens sports teams even if the title ix regulations and policy were changed the nwlc further observed that arguments similar to those made in the nwca lawsuit had been rejected by every federal appeals court to consider the issue of title ix 95 ultimately the nwca lawsuit was dismissed from federal court on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked the proper standing to bring the case96 the dismissal was affirmed by an appeals court97 and the supreme court effectively upheld the dismissal when it refused to review the case98 given the results in the nwca case and in other title ix cases brought before the federal courts of appeals it seems likely that the courts will continue to defer to ed with regard to title ix athletics policy in the near future as noted above ed has indicated that it intends to continue to use the threepart test to enforce title ix however congress could if it disapproves of eds title ix athletics policy respond with legislation to override the current regulations and guidance 90 cmtys for equity v mich high school athletic assn 377 f 3d 504 6th cir 2004 the supreme court
