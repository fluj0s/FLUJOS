patricia butenis for reasons 14 b and d 1 snf summary islamic revolutionary guard corps quds force irgcqf officers are active in iraq conducting traditional espionage and supporting violent extremists as well as supporting both legitimate and malign iranian economic and cultural outreach iraqis and their government have demonstrated increasing willingness to push back against malign iranian influence in the last year working with the iraqis we have succeeded in stopping some irgcqf activity through military operations and diplomatic engagement while we prevented some irgcqf officers from entering iraq through explicit warnings that we would target them unilaterally however under the security agreement effective january 1 all operations in iraq must be conducted in conjunction with iraqi security forces isf and our previous unilateral warnings carry less weight as coalition forces continue the period of responsible drawdown we will rely increasingly on the goi to keep the pressure on the irgcqf we intend to support the goi in these efforts through continued diplomatic engagement intelligence sharing and our security partnership of coalition forces working by with and through the isf end summary background 2 snf irgcqf leadership took advantage of the vacuum which surrounded the fall of saddam hussein and the entry of coalition forces into iraq in 2003 using the opportunity to send operatives to iraq when little attention was focused on iran in january 2007 coalition forces raided an unofficial iranian consulate in erbil detaining five iranians who claimed to be diplomats but in reality held diplomatic status they were suspected of operations aimed at killing coalition and iraqi security forces refs and b the original targets of the raid irgcqf officers abbas hoseyni of the erbil office and hormat faruqi of the sulaimaniyah office escaped and fled to iran the iranian government immediately pulled back most irgcqf officers from iraq and shuttered its consulates in erbil and sulaymaniyah until mid2007 consulates in basrah and karbala remained open since 2007 iran has submitted diplomatic visa applications for hoseini and faruqi to return to iraq in 2008 the embassy and mnfi convinced the goi not to approve these applications making it clear if they returned to iraq they would be targeted by coalition forces 3 snf since 2008 the mfa has passed names of iranians applying for diplomatic visas to the us embassy for vetting background checks have revealed that about 20 percent have possible ties to the irgc or irans ministry of intelligence and security mois ref c the mfa has informed us that it denies visas to all new suspected intelligence officers but we have not been able to verify such claims in january 2009 the mfa passed list of 35 names to the usg of iranian diplomats already in country before the vetting process began of those eight had ties to irgc or mois strategy 4 snf as us forces continue period of responsible draw down we will seek to ensure that the goi understands that irgcqf activity harms iraq which should be selfevident if the irgcqf continues to conduct malign activity that targets iraqi citizens and infrastructure qactivity that targets iraqi citizens and infrastructure engagements with political and security leadership at the national and provincial level intelligence sharing and security cooperation will be key to explaining the dangers of irgcqf activity and providing iraqis the information they need to defend their own interests the following are diplomatic political military intelligence and public information options which either the goi can pursue unilaterally or in concert with the usg to target irgcqf activity in iraq diplomacy baghdad 00001103 002 of 003 5 snf we intend to continue working closely with the mfa to deny visas to iranian intelligence officers we may also consider suggesting that the mfa use another diplomatic tool albeit one with more consequences the persona non grata designation the mfa may be reluctant to take this step because iraqi diplomats in iran would face retaliation and the dispute would inevitably become public since the fall of saddam the goi has avoided most public disagreements with iran security partnership 6 snf the role of the isf in countering irgcqf in iraq is critical yet complex we can encourage the iraqi army to take the lead on kinetic action against irgcqf agents with iraqi police monitoring and reacting to suspicious activity at the local level we intend to continue to strengthen our partnership with the isf to counter proiranian elements who have infiltrated the security forces such as kataib hizbollah and asaib ahl alhaq while the us combat mission will end by august 31 2009 we will continue to assist the ministry of defense mod with training equipment mentoring and other bilateral militarytomilitary programs and engagements military sales such as the recent iraqi interest in purchasing f16s and plans to transition from ak47 to m4 rifles will increase us influence through training and support in iraq for years to come although the mod will continue to consider weapons purchases from other sources as well border controls 7 s the department of border enforcement dbe can help limit irgcqf activity by combating smuggling and scrutinizing people and cargo crossing legitimate routes from iran into iraq xxxxxxxxxxxx corruption at the ports of entry poes unwillingness of inspectors to do their jobs and poor leadership and professionalism at the supervisory level keep the dbe from being fully effective the usg can assist however personal identification secure comparison and evaluation system pisces which checks travelers biographic data is already in use at many land and air poes around iraq additional training at sea ports airports and land borders could help iraqi officials detect smugglers of cash weapons weapons components and other contraband an iranian irgcqf officer was briefly detained at baghdad international airport in november 2008 when his name was flagged in pisces in january 2009 krgs minister of the interior karim sinjari praised pisces and asked for the system at two more land border entry points the krg shares with iran khalil ibrahim and hadjer meran 8 s as of april 2009 there were 200 pisces units in operation at 15 different poes in iraq current guidance states that every traveler entering or exiting iraq is processed through pisces on occasion however travelers will pay small fee to enter or exit without going through pisces if potential match is found to someone on the stop list the screen freezes and only inis can unlock the screen and conduct secondary inspection inis notifies the goi or usg when the identity of wanted person is confirmed pisces is operated by immigration officers assigned to the department of travel and nationality and the goi will continue to use pisces after the military drawdown collection and storage of biometric data is another tool the qcollection and storage of biometric data is another tool the goi is already using at poes although biometric automated toolset bat system is run by us forces and will not stay in iraq after their departure 9 snf timely example of cooperation with dbe in countering iranian lethal aid smuggling occurred april 14 dbe brigade in maysan province partnered with multinational divisionsouth mnds forces captured an unmanned boat carrying explosive devices floating in the huwayza marsh the patrol found three explosively formed projectiles efps and other military equipment mnds said it was the first time the dbe had reported success against this type of smuggling intelligence sharing baghdad 00001103 003 of 003 10 snf coordinating with goi intelligence agencies to stop irgcqf activity is complicated by the fact that the iraqi intelligence establishment is extremely fragmented intelligence offices affiliated with the ministry of the interior moi dbe and the ministry of state for national security affairs msnsa do not trust each other and often work in opposition the usg could further assist iraqi intelligence by negotiating and approving bilateral usiraqi intelligence sharing agreements and further providing the goi with intelligence that demonstrates the involvement of irgcqf officers in lethal assistance to extremists us forces in iraq have established positive relationships with their isf counterparts and are developing appropriate intelligencesharing mechanisms the usg can also assist the goi to further develop its intelligence infrastructure to monitor malign iranian influence and counter the irgcqf inis currently interacts closely with the office of regional affairs ora the establishment of defense attachs office at the embassy will also help facilitate intelligence sharing and is under consideration by chief of mission public information 11 snf highlighting nefarious iranian activity to goi leadership and the iraqi public has had significant impact on increasing goi willingness to confront iran as well as public rejection of iranian attempts to dominate iraqs political and economic sectors provincial elections demonstrated that perceived fealty to iran is political liability for iraqi politicians and they are increasingly sensitive to it continued usg assistance in uncovering and publicizing iranian attempts to influence events in iraq will make the country much more inhospitable environment for irgcqf operatives comment 12 snf the iranian government may sense that the drawdown of us military forces in iraq presents an opportunity to expand irgcqf activity although the broader regional dynamic will undoubtedly also influence iranian decision making without the ability to conduct unilateral military action against irgcqf operatives in iraq we will leverage our evolving diplomatic intelligence security and military partnerships with iraq to maintain pressure many usg agencies will be involved in assisting the iraqis in this critical area and must actively engage in order to counter irgcqf officers and their lethal aid butenis
