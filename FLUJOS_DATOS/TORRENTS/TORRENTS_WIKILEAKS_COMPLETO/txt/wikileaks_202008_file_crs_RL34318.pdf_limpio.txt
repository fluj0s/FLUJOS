immunodeficiency syndrome aids epidemic in the early 1980s many individuals living with the disease have had difficulty finding affordable stable housing as individuals become ill they may find themselves unable to work while at the same time facing health care expenses that leave few resources to pay for housing in addition many of those persons living with aids struggled to affo rd housing even before being diagnosed with the disease the financial vulnerability associated with aids as well as the human immunodeficiency virus hiv that causes aids results in greater likelihood of homelessness among persons living with the disease further recent research has indicated that those individuals living with hiv who live in stable housing have better health outcomes than those who are homeless or unstably housed congress recognized the housing needs of persons living with hivaids when it approved the housing opportunities for persons with aids hopwa program in 1990 as part of the cranstongonzalez national affordable hous ing act pl 101625 the hopwa program administered by the department of housing and urban development hud funds shortterm and permanent housing together with supportive services for individuals living with hivaids and their families in addition small portion of funds appropriated through the ryan white hivaids program administered by the department of health and human services hhs may also be used to fund shortterm hous ing for those living with hivaids in fy2008 congress appropriated 300 million for hopwa in the consolidated appropriations act pl 110161 this is the most funding ever appropriated for the program exceeding the next highest appropriation in fy2004 by approximately 6 million hopwa funds are distributed to states and localities through both formula and competitive grants hud awards 90 of appropriated funds by formula to states and eligible metropolitan statistical areas msas based on population reported cases of aids and incidence of aids the remaining 10 is distributed through grant competition funds are used primarily for housing activities although grant recipients must provide supportive services to those persons

immunodeficiency syndrome aids disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv weakens the immune system leaving individuals with the disease susceptible to infections as of 2006 aids had been diagnosed and reported in an estimated 448871 individuals in the fifty states the district of columbia and territories1 these estimates do not include those diagnosed with hiv where the disease has not yet progressed to aids or those who have not yet been diagnosed as hiv positive but are currently living with the disease currently there is cure for hivaids and in the early years of the aids epidemic those persons infected with aids often died quickly in recent years however medications have allowed persons living with hiv and aids to live longer and to remain in better health despite improvements in health outcomes affordable housing remains important to many who live with hivaids this report describes recent research that shows how housing and health status are related and the effects of stable housing on patient health it also describes the housing opportunities for persons with aids hopwa prog ram the only federal program that provides housing and services specifically for persons who are hiv positive or who have aids together with their families in addition the report describes how small portion of funds appropriated through the ryan white hivaids program may be used by states and local jurisdictions to provide shortterm housing assistance for persons living with hivaids

adequate affordable housing for persons living with hiv and aids has been an issue since aids was first identified in us patients in the early 1980s the inability to afford housing and the threat of homelessness confront many individuals living with hivaids from the early years of the epidemic those individuals who have been infected with hivaids face impoverishment as they become unable to work experience high medical costs or lose private health insurance coverage in recent years the incidence of hivaids has grown among low income individuals who were economically vulnerable even before onset of the disease 2 not surprisingly researchers have found cooccurrence between hivaids and homelessness homeless persons have higher incidence of hivaids infection than the general population while many individuals with hivaids are at risk of becoming homeless 3 research has found that rates of hiv among homeless people may be as much as three to nine times higher than 1 us department of

positive and homeless have been found to be more likely than those who are hiv positive and housed to engage in behaviors associated with the spread of hivaids in one study the use of injectable drugs sharing needles and exchanging sex for drugs or money were more likely among both homeless individuals and those who were unstably housed compared to those with stable housing5 those who were considered unstably housing lived in transitional housing in jail drug treatment or halfway house or were doubled up in someone elses home 6 when housing improved for individuals in the study their odds of engaging in these behaviors were reduced another study found that homeless persons living with hivaids were almost twice as likely to engage in unprotected sex compared to those who had housing7 individuals were considered housed if they lived in house or apartment alone or with others medical care facility or correctional institution 8

of national consensus on policy concerning acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids and to study and make recommendations for consistent national policy concerning aids in april 1990 in its second interim report to the president the commissi on recommended that congress and the president provide federal housing aid to address the multiple problems posed by hiv infection and aids 9 about the same time that the commission released its report in march of 1990 the house committee on banking finance and urban affairs held hearing about the need for housing among persons living with hivaids witnesses as well as committee members discussed various barriers to housing for persons living with hivaids among the issues confronting those persons that were discussed at the hearing were poverty homelessness and discrimination 10 in attempting to secure housing 11 another issue discussed at the hearing was the 4 daniel p kidder richard j wolitski and scott royal et access to housing as

g345g561eligibility for subsidized housing for persons living with the disease question raised during the hearing but left unresolved was whether persons living with hiv or aids met the definition of handicap in order to be eligible for the ction 202 supportive housing for the elderly program which also provided housing for persons with disabilities12 another concern was that persons living with hivaids often had difficulty obtaining subsidized housing through mainstream hud programs such as public housing and section 8 due to the length of waiting lists individuals often died while waiting for available units 13 in the 101st congress at least two bills were introduced that contained provisions to create housing program specifically for persons living with aids these proposed programs were called the aids housing opportunity act which was part of the housing and community development act of 1990 hr 1180 and the aids opportunity housing act hr 3423 the bills were similar and both proposed to fund shortterm and permanent housing together with supportive services for individuals living with aids and related diseases the text from one of these bills hr 1180 which included the aids h ousing opportunity act was incorporated into the cranstongonzalez national affordable housing act s 566 when it was debated and passed by the house on august 1 1990 in conference with the senate the name of the housing program was changed to housing opportunities for persons with aids hopwa in addition the several separate housing assistance programs that had been proposed in hr 1180 one for shortterm housing one for permanent housing supported through section 8 and one for community residences were consolidated into one formula grant program in which recipient communities could choose which activities to fund the amended version of s 566 was signed by the president on november 28 1990 and became pl 101625 the cranston gonzalez national affordable housing act the hopwa program is administered by the partment of housing and urban development hud and remains the only federal program solely dedicated to providing housing assistance to persons living with hivaids and their families 14 the program addresses the need for reasonably priced housing for thousands of lowincome individuals those with incomes at or below 80 of the area median income hopwa was last reauthorized by the housing and community development act of 1992 pl 102550 although authorization for hopwa expired after fy1994 congress continues to fund the program through annual appropriations

with at least 1500 reported cases of aids and that have higher than average per capita incidence of aids are eligible19 states are not eligible for bonus funding although hopwa funds are allocated to the largest ci ty within an msa these recipient cities are required to allocate funds in manner that addresses the needs within the metropolitan statistical area in which the city is located20 states that receive funds are to use them to benefit areas outside of eligible msas in fy2008 87 msas including the district of columbia received funds while 39 states and puerto rico received funds for use

housing if they are either hiv positive or if they are diagnosed with aids26 in general clients must also be low income meaning that their income does not exceed 80 of the area median income27 hud

when person living in hopwasupported housing dies his or her family members are given grace period during which they may remain in the housing 29 this period may not exceed one year however individuals who are hiv positive or living with aids may also be eligible for other hud assisted housing for persons with disabilities however infection itself may not be sufficient to meet the definition of disability in these other programs for example in the case of housing developed prior to the mid1990s under the section 202 supportive housing for the elderly program and those units developed under the section 811 supportive housing for persons with disabilities program an individual who is hiv pos itive or has aids must also meet the statutory definition of disability in which hivaids status alone is not sufficient to be eligible for housing 30 the projectbased section 8 and public housing programs may also set aside units or entire developments for persons with disabilities the definition of disability for these programs does not exclude persons who have the diseas of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or any conditions arising from the etiologic agent for aids31 however the definition does not indicate whether the status of being hiv positive or having aids is alone sufficient to be considered disabled

have died is used to distribute funds 2006 government accountability office gao report found that the cumulative measure resulted in disproportionate funding per living aids case depending on the jurisdiction in 2004 the amount of money grantees received per living aids case ranged from 387 per person to 1290 43 according to the report if only living aids cases were counted in that year 92 of 117 grantees would have received more formula funding while 25 would have received less44 in each of the presidents budgets from fy2007 thr ough fy 2009 the administration proposed to change the way in which hopwa funds are distributed the fy2009 budget stated that whereas the current formula distributes formula grant resources by the cumulative number of aids cases the revised formula will account for the present number of people living with aids as well as differences in housing costs in the qualifying areas the presidents fy2007 and fy2008 budgets contained nearly identical lang uage huds budget justifications for fy2009 elaborated somewhat on the administrations proposal to change the hopwa distribution formula huds explanation indicated that new formula would use the number of persons living with aids and that eventually when consistent data on the number of persons living with hiv become available that measure might also be used in determining the distribution of hopwa funding 45 discussions regarding the hopwa formula and its use of cumulative aids cases to distribute funds are not new in 1997 gao released report regarding the performance of the hopwa program in which it recommended that hud look at recent changes to the formula used by the ryan white care act now called the ryan while hivaids program to determine what legislative revisions are needed to make the hopwa formula more reflective of current aids cases 46 at the time of the gao report congress had recently changed the care act formula to use estimates of persons living with aids instead of cumulative aids cases47 in 42 us department of housing and urban development annual performance plan fy2008 september 2007 p 48 httpwwwhudgovofficescforeportspdfsapp2008pdf 43 us government

the gao language in its report accompanying the fy1998 hud appropriations act pl 10565 and directed hud to make recommendations to congress about its findings regarding an update to the formula48 in response to the fy1998 appropriations act hud then issued report to congress in 1999 that proposed changes that could be made to the hopwa formula49 the proposed formula in huds 1999 report would have used an estimate of persons living with aids instead of all cumulative aids cases together with housing costs to dist ribute formula funds it also would have included protection for existing grantees those recommendations were not adopted by congress legislation to change the hopwa formula was introduced in the 110 th congress in the 109th congress two bills s 2339 and hr 5009 would have changed the way that hopwa formula funds are allocated by counting the number of reported living cases of hiv disease instead of cumulative aids cases neither bill was enacted

however the statute provides that grantees may use ryan white funds to provide support services for persons living with hiv and aids these services are defined as those that are needed for individuals with hivaids to achieve their medical outcomes 55 in 1999 the hivaids bureau of the health resources nd services administration hrsa within hhs released policy guidance regarding the type of housing that ryan white grantees could provide for their clients56 according to the guidance grantees may use funds for housing referral services and for emergency or shortterm housing ryan white funds must be the payer of last resort meaning that other sources of funds for housing must be exhausted before using ryan white funds initially the policy regarding use of ryan white funds for housing did not require that specific time limits be placed on shortterm housing in its report regarding the new guidance hrsa stated although we are restricting the policy to transitionaltemporary housing we dont define transitionaltemporary because we dont know ye t what the recent changes in medical treatment of hivaids mean to the evolution of the epidemic it is foolish to adopt any definition of short term 57 however when the ryan white program was reauthorized in 2006 the new law limited the amount of grants to states and urban areas that could be used for support services to more than 25 by requiring that at least 75 of funds be used for core medical services58 previously the law did not limit the amount of funds that could be used for support services in december 2006 in response to the more restrictive funding limits established for support services in the 2006 reauthorization hhs issued proposed polic notice to limit the amount of time that any client could spend in ryan whitefunded transitional housing to 24 months in lifetime effective retroactively 59 this would have meant that those individuals who had already exhausted the 24 month time period would not be able to receive housing benefits after receiving over 200 comments regarding the policy proposal hhs eventually removed the provision requiring retroactive application of the 24month lifetime limit and released final policy notice on february 27 2008 60 the policy took effect on march 27 2008 in 2007 hrsa reported that 476 ryan whitefunde d service organizations provided housing services for individuals living with hivaids61 in 2006 an estimated 42178 persons living with aids received some sort of housing service note that this estimate includes duplicated services 55 42 usc 300ff14d1 and 300ff22c1 at the time that hhs established its housing policy the statute stated that funds could be used for the purpose of delivering or enhancing hivrelated outpatient and ambulatory health and support services including case management and comprehensive treatment services the statute was amended to read as stated in the text of this report as part of the ryan white hivaids treatment modernization act of 2006 pl 109415 56 the use of funds for housing was established in hivaids bureau notice 9902 the notice is reproduced in us department of health and human services health resources and services

more likely to be hiv positive than those who are housed in addition recent research has found that the health outcomes of homeless individuals living with hivaids may be improved with stable housing for example in study of hiv positive individuals living in new york city that was conducted over twelve years from 1994 to 2006 those who were unstably housed meaning that they were either living on the street in shelter in some form of transitional housing or temporarily living in someone elses home were less likely to access and retain medical care for their disease than those receiving some form of housing assistance 63 in addition preliminary findings from two recent studies have found favorable health outcomes for hiv positive individuals who are stably housed in one of these studies called the housing and health study hud together with the cdc provided hiv positive individuals who were homeless or at severe risk of homelessness with hopwafunded rental housing the study considered individuals to be at severe risk of homelessness if they frequently moved from one temporary housing situation to another those individuals in the comparison group received services including assistance with finding housing but did not receive hopwafunded housing64 despite the differences in rental assistance provided between the treatment and comparison groups both groups had statistically significant increase in stable housing65 although 4 of all participants were stably housed when the study began 82 of hopwa assisted renters and 52 of individuals in the comparison group retained housing 18 months after the start of the study perhaps due to the fact that the comparison group also had some success in achieving and maintaining housing both groups saw some improvements in health outcomes findings from the study show that individuals in both groups had fewer emergency room visits fewer hospitalizations reduced opportunistic infections those infections that occur due to weakened immune systems reduced participation in sex trade and reductions in depression 62 us department of health and human services health resources and services administration ryan white hivaids

study identified homeless individuals with chronic illnesses including hiv for participation among those identified to participate in the study 36 were hiv positive the treatment group received housing funded through either hopwa or huds supportive housing program for homeless individuals while the comparison or usual care group received available supportive services but separate assistance with rent the group receiving housing assistance had higher rates of intact immunity compared to the comparison group and were more likely to have undetectable viral loads 12 months after the study began 66 in addition the treatment group spent fewer days in emergency rooms nursing homes and hospitals during the 18 month period the researchers followed participants 66 like the preliminary
