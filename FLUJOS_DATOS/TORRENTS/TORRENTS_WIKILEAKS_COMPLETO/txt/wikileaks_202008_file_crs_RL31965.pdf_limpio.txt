federal agencies to identify programs that are vulnerable to improper payments and to estimate annually the amount of underp ayments and overpayments made by these programs the estimates are to be reported to congress by march 31 following the end of the fiscal year improper payments include any payments that should not have been made or were ma in an incorrect amount payments to ineligible

coming under the rubric of the agenda is improved financial performance28 aspects of the financial management initiative with respect to the financial performance initiative there is concern with enhancing the quality and timeliness of financial info rmation central elemen t here is the accelerated timetable for submission of the audited fina ncial statements as described above to assist in working toward production of agen cy financial statements just six weeks after the end of the fiscal year agencies are now required to produce interim financial statements during the fiscal year and as noted above s ubmit their audited financial statements with their annua l performance reports in combined performance and accountability report second focus involves reducing errone ous payments usually overpayments of benefits akin to improper payments as recently addressed in the improper payments information act in an initial effort to estimate erroneous payments in major benefit programs prior to enactment of the new law 15 agencies reported to omb their estimates of erroneous paymen ts for 2001 which totaled over 30 billion the largest estimated amounts reporte d included 121 billion for erroneous payments in medicare 92 billion for ea rned income tax credit 33 billion for housing subsidy programs and 16 billion for supplemental security income according to the discussion in the budg et programwide erroneous payment estimates can only help stem the loss to th federal government in waste fraud and abuse too much of which is taking place without an accounting29 the third area of major emphasis for the financial performance initiative entails strengthening asset management financial statements suggest that the federal government owns some 700 billion in asse ts consisting of property plant and equipment inventories and related proper ties and loans receivable the assets reported in the balance sheet are not comp rehensive however si nce national defense assets and land holdings are not captured improving asset management is integral to efforts to improve financial management30 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31965crs8 31omb performance and management assessments washington

on quarterly basis by omb the scorecard uses trafficlight mo tif of green for success yellow for mixed results and red for unsatisfactory for each initiative there are multiple standards for success or core criteria which an agency must meet in order to get green rating there are likewise listings for each initiative of conditions amounting to fatal flaws if an agency displays any one of these it receives red yellow grade applies when an agency is free of red c onditions and has achieved some but not all of the core criteria the four core criteria for getting to green on the improving financial performance initiative are as follows financial management systems meet federal financial management system requirements and applicab federal accounting and transaction standards as reported by the agency head accurate and timely fina ncial information integrated financial and performance management systems supporting dayto day operations and unqualified and timely audit opinions on the annual financial statements material internal control wea knesses reported by the auditors31 on the most recent scorecard reflecting status on march 31 2003 only one agency the national science foundation had met all the core criteria and received grade of green for improving financial performance six agencies received yellow while 19 were accorded red indicating fa ilure on at least one of the requisite conditions32 in addition to the current status grades on the scorecard agencies are also given progress score for each initiative green for implementation proceeding as planned yellow for some slippage and red warning of an initiative in serious jeopardy most agencies received higher marks for progress than for current status with respect to improving financial performance 19 receive d green five yellow and only one red33 omb hopes that status grades for agencies will at least move to yellow by july 1 200434 possible policy concerns the general objective of improving financial performance in the federal government is noncontroversial li kewise virtually nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31965crs9 35for example hr 5521 106th congress the accountability of tax dollars act of 2000 was an earlier version of the measure enacted in 2002 also see us congress senate committee on governmental affairs report of senator fred thompson chairman on management challenges faci ng the new administration committee print 106th cong 2nd sess washington gpo 2000 p 3 regarding the problem of overpaymentscriticism has been directed to the majo r components of the initiative delineated so far striving toward more timely and accurate financial in formation reducing erroneous payments made by the governme nt and bringing greater order to the management of fede ral assets appear beyond reproach legislative action on the two financia l management measures in the 107th congress previously discussed might be viewed as cong ressional endorsement of sort for two of the three components of the initiative the accountability of tax dollars act by expanding the audited fi nancial statements re quirement to over 75 more agencies in the executive branch arguably conveyed s upport for the goal of timely and accurate financia l information the improper payments information act provided statutory mandate for collecting information already underway voluntarily in some agencies via the erroneous paymen t component of the initiative it should be noted however that expanding the agency coverage of audited financial statements and reducing instances of incorrect pa yments had both received congressional attention in the 106th congress as well prior to announcement by president bush of the agenda 35 in order to reap full benefits from more timely and accurate financial data some say such information needs to be taken into account by government decision makers both within the executive branch and congress the financial statements may prove of interest for various facets of congressi onal oversight likewise some say the clearer identification of overpayments and underpayments may lead to administrative actions to correct deficiencies in program implementati on at the same time congress may use the information for overs ight hearings or for consideration of possible amendments in the authorizing legislation to remedy existing statutory weaknesses which may ve become evident conclusion the accountability of tax dollars act of 2002 and the improper payments information act of 2002 constitute the latest in series of financial management reform measures enacted in the last 25 years the improving financial performance initiative in the presidents management agenda has focused attention in the executive branch on meeting the core criteria for achieving green mark on the scorecard while 19 agencies received green score for progress on the financial performance initiative only one has received green for current st atus of financial performance by meeting all four of the core criteria as of march 31 2003 despite ombs recent concern with impr oving federal financial management much remains to be done before all agencies comply with the four core requirements for example the first criterion stipulates that agency heads must be able to report that their financial management systems meet federal management system requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31965crs10 36omb financial management status report and governmentwide 5year financial management plan may 1 2002 p 38 available elect ronically at http www
