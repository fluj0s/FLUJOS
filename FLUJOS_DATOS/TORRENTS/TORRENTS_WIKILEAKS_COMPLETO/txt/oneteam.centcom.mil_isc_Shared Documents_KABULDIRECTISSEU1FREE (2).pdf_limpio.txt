northern provinces of balkh badkhshan faryab baghlan kunduz and kaspisa have been relatively secure until recently the resident population in these provinces is generally antitaliban insurgents have not been able to take root in most parts of these provinces or attract any substantial local following but recently insurgents seem to be singling out these provinces hitting them hard to create insecurity and weaken the central government should the insurgents succeed in destabilizing the north this would pose serious strategic challenge to the karzai administration and its allies insurgents began targeting the northern areas of afghanistan last year in the first wave of violence there was series of deadly attacks that claimed the lives of more than one hundred police civilians and foreign security forces the first northern province to be hit was kapisa just northeast of kabul these first attacks were probably carried out by local hizbe islami elements or by insurgents coming into kapisa from kunduz province further north on the border of tajikistan kunduz has also been the target of recent insurgent attacks for example suicide bomber attacked kunduz may 19 and killed ten people including german soldier seventeen people were wounded in the blast earlier in april another suicide bomber detonated outside district police office in kunduz and killed nine officers and injured dozens nearby in balkh baghlan and badakhshan the provinces bordering or close to kunduz have also experienced suicide bombings mazare sharif balkhs capital was hit particularly hard in july three civilians and one isaf soldier were killed in blast recall that the area around mazare sharif was the only area in afghanistan that never succumbed to the taliban during their rule in the 1990s and up until 2001 this area remained free of taliban control because it was the stronghold of the northern alliance the insurgent force during the talibans brief reign of power recall that qaeda assassinated the northern alliances leader ahmed shah masood on september 9 2001 two days before the attacks on new york and washington even now the area remains loyal to northern alliance leaders including former president of afghanistan burhanuddin rabbani who still has substantial following in the province in september faryab another northern province came under attack when taliban militants killed two police officers in the provinces pushtun kot district this brought the number of police officers killed in faryab in the trailing 30dayperiod to over dozen in these provinces the taliban is likely the main force behind most of the attacks while most of the taliban militants are believed to come from outside the area from the east for example they are suspected of having at least some local support balkhs governor ata mohammad noor indicated that authorities now have reason evidence suggesting locals have been involved in the deadly attacks at least in his province the talibans northern bases given the general resistance of the local population to the taliban the taliban has to be careful about where it locates its bases in these areas as most of the locals are probably unwilling to protect them or grant them refuge this means the taliban has some logistical challenges in order to mount ied and suicide attacks into these generally insurgentunfriendly areas the situation in the north has deteriorated to the extant that support to the central government has been seriously eroded kabul direct living afghanistan 3 kabul direct october 2007 volume 1 issue 1 the natoled isaf military command has suggested that to stage raids into faryab for example the taliban uses bases located in badghis province gen warnecke german natoled isaf force commander indicated that the taliban bases in badghis are located in qara jangal what makes qara jangal hospitable is the fact it hosts substantial pushtun population the ethnic group in afghanistan from which the taliban draws its most loyal support this area located on the border of the ghaisar district of faryab was notably not one of the districts chosen to be rehabilitated in the governments disarmament demobilization and disintegration program that was implemented in 2005 another suspected taliban stronghold in badghis is thought to be in the murghab district as is the case with qara jangal this taliban base is also likely located here because of the substantial local pushtun population in kunduz taliban bases are located in the chahar dara and qala zal districts and again in areas characterized by substantial local resident population loyal to them in kapisa the taliban base is in nijrab while in badakhshan it is located in argu argu interestingly is also believed to be the site of base of operations for the hizbe islami afghans other leading insurgent party hizbe islami northern bases while the taliban focus on carrying out ied and suicide attacks hizbe islami elements contribute to the deterioration of the north in other ways for example former hizbe islami officials now hold key positions in many northern provinces the governors of takhar kunduz and badakhshan for example are all former hizbe islami commanders or members well respected analyst who agreed to talk on condition of anonymity because of security fears told kabul direct that he once overheard one of these former hizbe isalmi governors express hatred for foreign and especially american forces to the analyst the governors remarks suggested that while former hizbe islami elements may claim to have repudiated the views and politics of their former brothersinarms they still are likely to have the same mindset in private and share the same goals for afghanistan these goals he was careful to note are not likely the goals of the central government in kabul in which they are officially participating how bad is the situation the situation in the north has deteriorated to the extent that support for the central government is being seriously eroded according to many observers consider the remarks made recently by afghanistans former president rabbani he told radio azadi that things were now so bad in the north he doubted whether the central government could ever win back the support of the local people at this point burhanuddin rabbani head of jamieat islami afghanistan suggested that locals are seriously disaffected in his area too in october he went on the record to say that he has more support in his area than the government in kabul according to former defense minister of the karzai administration marshall qasim fahim kabul has basically two choices left it can work out powersharing arrangement with the warlord commanders mainly former northern alliance to stabilize the region or it can continue to fight the insurgents on the battlefield and risk losing the battleground in spite of the declining security situation afghan and the international security forces have so far resisted adding these northern provinces to their list of areas now under insurgent control this does not mean that the government is not taking the situation in the north seriously but most observers would caution that should kabul not be able to reestablish security soon in the north these provinces could be lost live afghanistan with kabul directkabul direct living afghanistan 4 kabul direct october 2007 volume 1 issue 1 taliban resurgence an interview with taliban former foreign minister wakil ahmad mutakwail 38 was the foreign minister of the taliban when the group controlled afghanistan earlier he served as the spokesman for the talibans leader mullah omar who also claimed the title amir or leader of the faithful it was to amir omar that osama bin laden the leader of qaeda swore fealty an afghan citizen mutawakil is now confining his activities to the cultural sphere he says he is longer in close touch with the taliban leadership but he was happy to speak about them and remains committed to the vision of an islamic state this interview was conducted at his family home west of kabul in october 2007 kabul direct how do you see the taliban since they were driven from power in 2001 what is their strategy wakil ahmad mutawakil after the fall of the amarati eslami afghanistan the coalition forces and the interim government of afghanistan signaled that any highranking officials of the taliban regime should be killed or imprisoned this is why the taliban went on the defense at first they contained their guerrilla war to the new powers unfortunately this changed kabul direct yes in the past two years violence and brutality have increased one expected this what is your assessment of the current situation in afghanistan and the role being played by the taliban mutawakil what is happening in afghanistan indicates that the government has not yet taken seriously the need to confront the armed opposition in general and the taliban movement in particular the antigovernment elements in afghanistan were not given an opportunity to transition from militant opposition to political participation they were not allowed to have any presence in kabul not an office or even an address yet the taliban and other opponents of the karzai administration are reality and they will remain one they need to be accommodated by the government kabul direct do you not think that the government of afghanistan has accepted that the insurgents have power base and are security threat but for political reasons are not admitting this publicly mutawakil yes the evidence is the governments recent willingness to begin peace negotiations with these elements perhaps this means that finally the administration understands that these dissatisfied and unhappy elements are not going to go away on their own and that it is better to meet them at the negotiating table as opposed to confronting them on the battlefield the importance and value of the opposition has to be understood and dealt with it wont just go away on its own kabul direct how do you explain the longevity of the taliban how did it come back to life after being crushed in 2001 is what we are seeing now analogous to when the taliban was able to seize control of 90 percent of afghanistan during the 1990s mutawakil many factors contributed to the resurgence of the taliban in afghanistan first and foremost the taliban have the will to fight and win the war when afghans are told that foreigners who do not respect their values have entered the country and are free to enter their houses to probe and investigate to destroy their homes with bombardments it is easy to find recruits willing to take up arms kabul direct living afghanistan 5 kabul direct october 2007 volume 1 issue 1 secondly the karzai government has too many corrupt undeserving and uneducated officials these officials are not respected by the people and only create animosity toward the government the rampant unemployment and poverty also enable the taliban to strengthen their bond with the afghan people kabul direct should we then count the people of the south and east of the country as taliban supporters should we now assume these areas are under the facto control of the taliban mutawakil it is important to distinguish between people who are dissatisfied with the current administration and those who are actively participating in the insurgency people can be dissatisfied with the government but not be at the point of wanting to engage in armed confrontation these people in other words are not active supporters of the taliban they are sympathizers silent supporters they wont fight themselves but they will allow the taliban to hide and operate in their areas kabul direct you pointed out the domestic reasons why the taliban might be seen as legitimate opposition force what about the external factors are any of afghanistans neighbors aiding or abetting the insurgency mutawakil if you look at the history of afghanistan you can see our neighbors have not been inactive some of our neighbors might have an interest in some movements in afghanistan yes but we can solve our problems without help from our neighbors too they are only taking advantage of our current situation kd some experts believe that since 2001 the taliban has splintered into three distinct groups in other words they suggest that the taliban is longer unanimously under the command of mullah omar is that your assessment mutawakil it is the government and coalition forces who speak of this split or rift in the taliban leadership they want to divide the taliban into different factions we have not heard of these divisions from the taliban themselves kabul direct but did we not see evidence of some type of division when qari yosuf ahmadi came forward to say that the taliban was ready for peace talks only to have zabihullah mujaheed come out to disavow this idea mutawakil i was coming to your specific question regarding the taliban leadership what we saw in the case you cited was confused spokesman as opposed to rift or factional problem inside the taliban the taliban is not the only organization to have people misspeak on its behalf we see this from the government too but regarding the unity of the leadership if the taliban has not announced any internal division then you should assume it is still unified movement under one leader that is my understanding of the taliban early on this was not the case when the taliban formed it was not an organized movement it was bunch of people from different organizations and institutions and there was diversity of ideas and viewpoints but now and until you hear the taliban themselves announce the emergence of new leader or division you should regard them as single and unified entity across the country kabul direct so were you essentially saying that in the past the taliban has tolerated viewpoints that were distinct from mullah omars mutawakil from my knowledge of how the taliban operates at the start of any project there are always many ideas about how things should be done they debate among themselves until they work out decision but once they arrive at decision then everyone has to abide by it kabul direct has the taliban changed its goals and strategy since 2001 mutawakil yes there have been changes when the taliban were in power they wanted to oust the warlord commanders who were responsible for the civil war in the 1990s they also wanted to bring justice according to what is prescribed in islamic sharia but now that they are not in charge from what i can gather from their internet messages and their occasional access to radio and tv is that they want to force the foreign troops to withdraw from afghanistan and they want to replace the current government with one that will impose sharia law kabul direct living afghanistan 6 kabul direct october 2007 volume 1 issue 1 kabul direct you refer to the talibans limited access to the media as though they do not have access now that had before yet the taliban themselves during their reign severely curtailed other peoples access to the media and did not even allow television but now they are happy to use what they themselves prohibited and denied their citizens before mutawakil yes the taliban did ban television broadcasting during their reign but radio was permitted and some newspapers were published after their fall and until just recently the taliban had access to radio or tv and so they had to use the internet to communicate kabul direct are you saying that the talibans usage of the internet and the mass media has not been based on any strategy mutawakil when we were in power i mean the taliban as the amarate islami afghanistan we did have website in the foreign ministry one opposed the internet the problem was the communication system itself kabul direct you talked about the insurgency in afghanistan which is mostly being fought by the taliban how similar to qaeda is the taliban mutawakil the major difference is that qaeda is worldwide organization with global agenda the taliban is very much local organization focused on afghanistan kabul direct recently some western analysts have suggested that iran is supporting the taliban is there any evidence of this in your mind mutawakil obviously iran is opposed to the foreign troops in afghanistan and iraq but the islamic republics willingness to confront these foreign forces does not mean it would be willing to support the taliban kabul direct so as former foreign minister for the taliban do you see the possibility that tehran is supporting the taliban mutawakil at the beginning when the islamic movement started in kandahar both pakistan and iran reached out to establish ties with the taliban because of pakistans long border with afghanistan and because of the close relations pakistan had established with the afghan mujahideen during the jihad against the soviets pakistan easily gained the trust of the taliban the relationship between the taliban and iran however hit low point in 1998 when the taliban killed eight iranian diplomats in mazire sharif eventually the taliban did manage to repair relations with tehran at least to the point where the two countries could trade between each other politics is not always smooth relations might be good today but this does not mean that all problematic points have been resolved both the taliban and iran share the goal of wanting the foreign troops to withdraw from afghanistan they might want to cooperate to bring this about i cant say to what extent such cooperation is going on as i dont know what irans strategy is with respect to afghanistan on the other hand i cant reject the idea on principle that iran is supporting the taliban either kabul direct aside from iran and pakistan are there other organizations or countries from which the taliban might be drawing financial logistical or economic support mutawakil there likely many peoples movements which support the taliban but i have reason to believe any outside government is involved in this support their support comes from humanitarian organizations in islamic countries i would think kabul direct how big threat is the taliban to the karzai administration is this why president karzai is now eager to meet with mullah omar at place of the talibans choosing in order to work out peace arrangement mutawakil the government of afghanistan should have tried to reach out from the beginning as early as the bonn accords afghans need to gather around the peace table the taliban seems to to be trying to make karzai realize that they are interested in governing while both the taliban and iran share the goal of wanting the foreign troops to withdraw from afghanistan they might cooperate to bring this about kabul direct living afghanistan 7 kabul direct october 2007 volume 1 issue 1 kabul direct the talibans only condition for peace is the withdrawal of foreign forces from afghanistan do you think this is real solution mutawakil my personal view is that both sides the government and the taliban should not insist on any preconditions for these talks the two sides should meet discuss the reality of the situation and work out the problems kabul direct what is the appeal of the taliban for pashtun youth especially mutawakil there is not much difference between the people and the taliban and so they shelter them given them food etc their major drawback to the people is that villages that harbor them are often bombed people hate the taliban in some places because they blame them for causing the destruction of their homes these people say that if the taliban were not present their homes might not have been bombarded kabul direct what about an early peace negotiation between the taliban and the government do you see any possibility of something happening in the near future mutawakil i dont sense any immediate readiness for peace on the taliban side but i do think it is now time to begin negotiations kabul direct what about suicide terrorism can you explain why the taliban has adopted this tactic mutawakil the war in afghanistan is not symmetrical the taliban adopted this tactic to make up for the lack of symmetry on the battlefield it was tactic copied from palestine and iraq but keep in mind that this type of attack is not limited to islamic countries kabul direct how do you see the relations between the taliban and qaida are they in close touch do they follow common strategy mutawakil they do have close ties during taliban rule in the late 1990s qaida was the guest of the taliban but now they are allied in coalition both of them are champion movements kabul direct and what about the taliban and hizbe islami are they allied too mutawakil from what i know of the situation the groups are not cooperating 100 percent they are not allies though they have similar mottos and goals kabul direct as former leader of the taliban do you think that it is legal under islamic law for an islamic movement to be taking up arms against legitimatelyelected islamic government mutawakil the elected government in afghanistan is the third state since the fall of the taliban it is not the first one which should have come to power by elections after the taliban was ousted by military force in 2001 there was military occupation of afghanistan power was not transferred to the interim state by elections after the bonn accord the situation for the taliban was death or at best life in prison these policies have inspired the insurgency kabul direct would not the withdrawal of foreign troops drive afghanistan into chaos and breakdown mutawakil got forbid afghanistan will never breakdown if the foreign troops withdraw i think we will face many problems the war will likely continue and be very much more devastating what i suggest is to reach deal one that encompasses all of afghanistans realities the taliban cannot simply be ignored or left out in the wilderness kabul direct and what you suggest to end the war in afghanistan mutawakil i think the two sides need to talk without preconditions the taliban has already announced it is up for this the taliban must have some responsibility it needs to have some power in the government the taliban should be allowed to open offices in the capital kabul and taliban officials should be granted immunity kabul direct living afghanistan 8 kabul direct october 2007 volume 1 issue 1 asseing hizbe islami threats questions to qazi amin waqad qazi mohammad amin waqad was the first elected leader of the hizbe islami afghanistan islamic party of afghanistan waqad was close personal friend and political ally of hizbe islami leader gulbaddin hekmatyar graduate of the islamic law faculty at kabul university waqad is member of the national front party opposed to the karzai administration as scholar he has become noted expert on jihad in afghanistan waqad lives north of kabul in traditional afghanistani household he talked with kabul direct at his home on oct 1 2007 kabul direct how do you assess the hizbe islami under the supervision of gulbudeen hekmatyar qazi mohammad amin waqad at the outset hizbe islami was led by academics and intellectuals who won support from people from all over afghanistan the party started out as an islamic youth movement to counter the leftists and communists that dominated the universities of the 1960s kabul direct yes this was how hizbe islami began but my question was how strong is the party now under the leadership of hekmatyar waqad i will get to that when the taliban captured kabul in 1996 hekmatyar was the premier of the mujahidin government to evade capture he had to flee first he went north but there he couldnt get along with the northern alliance he wouldnt submit to their leadership so he fled afghanistan altogether he took refuge in iran and from tehran remained an enemy of the taliban government and its allies until its downfall in 2001 it was major mistake not to invite hekmatyar to the bonn accord meetings in 2001 this cast him as opposition figure with respect to the new afghan government today he remains in the opposition camp and draws his support mostly from the refugee camps of pakistan shamshatoo camp outside peshawar for example where 20000 to 30000 afghans still live is one of his bases in the camp the party runs madrassas provides welfare services to the people and publishes magazine called tanwir the camp is so completely under the control of the hizbe ismali that the part runs the shura ejariea or governing council there kabul direct is the council at shamshatoo under hekmatyars control or the partys local leadership waqad it is directly controlled and led by hekmatyar kabul direct how many of his old commanders are still loyal to hekmatyar waqad many of the old hizbe isalmi commanders are still members of the groups governing council some are in afghanistan working with the karzai government many hold highlevel positions in the karzai administration kabul direct what about all the rumors that the insurgency in northern afghanistan is being led by hekmatyar and his loyalists waqad if hekmatyar is willing to destroy the insurgency by resorting to suicide bombing or ied attacks then his ground to maneuver will remain limited to kunar norirstan kunduz and the kabul direct living afghanistan 9 kabul direct october 2007 volume 1 issue 1 southeastern provinces in these provinces the taliban also has strong presence but i have to point out that the ekhwan muslemin or muslim brotherhood movements of which hizbe islami is part do not believe in using suicide bombers this is tactic introduced by qaida and the taliban hekmatyar and even more importantly his base of support do not subscribe to the idea that suicide bombing is permissible under islam i doubt even hekmatyar himself could convince one of his followers to carry out such mission as they do not believe in the legitimacy of such an act hekmatyar opposes the government as does mullah omar and the taliban but there are major differences in their approaches should one of them the taliban or hizbe islami join the government they would then be on opposite sides today the only basis of any alliance is that they are both opposed to the karzai administration aside from that they have nothing in common not their ideology not their interpretation of islam not their vision or their politics kabul direct why has hekmatyar chosen to remain an enemy of the present afghan state waqad as i told you the first point of contention was when hekmatyar was excluded from the bonn conference now he believes that it is the presence of foreign troops in afghanistan that stands between him and the government but i think this could change i believe hekmatyar wants to make peace with the government more than the taliban the government should negotiate settlement with him i think they would have more realistic chance with hekmatyar than with the taliban kabul direct dont you think that the withdrawal of foreign troops would only drive afghanistan back to the place it was in the 1990s to state of warlordism waqad without foreign troops i do think it is realistic to assume that some of the neighbors would interfere in afghanistan it is notable that in hizbe islami the consensus is not to demand withdrawal of the foreign troops this is only hekmatyars demand not everyone in the party shares his idea kabul direct you talked about shamshatoo refugee camp as one of hekmatyar strongholds aside from shamshatoo do you see any other camp in pakistan in which hekmatyar has the same level of support where he can recruit soldiers waqad yes of course in every place and camp where there are hizbe islami elements hekmatyar has presence but todays hizbe islami is not as strong or as wellmanaged as it was in the 1990s kabul direct what about hekmatyars outside support are iran and pakistan supporting him or is his support coming from elsewhere waqad he enjoys the support of both iran and pakistan he is probably hiding in the areas of pakistan along the afghan border kabul direct what about iran what role does tehran play waqad well he is not disconnected from iran some of the neighboring countries do have points in common with him and are willing to help him because of this kabul direct what do you think about president karzais proposal for peace talks with hakmatyar and the taliban kabul direct living afghanistan 10 kabul direct october 2007 volume 1 issue 1 waqad karzais stance regarding peace negotiations is very much rooted in his optimism he has not had much experience in politics or in confronting jihadi movements kabul direct do you think his stance is unwise waqad yes by taking the peace negotiations too seriously he strengthens hekmatyar and the taliban in the minds of the public what he should do is strengthen the government here i am in kabul and yet i am not allowed to have any role in the government when hekmatyar sees that someone like the first elected leader of hizbe islami is not being utilized he cant help but be pessimistic about his own future should he agree to make peace with the government regarding the hizbe islami members now in government the party has two to three ministers five governors deputy minister and many other highranking officials but the problem is these hizbe islami officials in the present government only empower their own relations kabul direct aside from the above mentioned points what exactly is hekmatyar trying to accomplish with his opposition waqad hekmatyar cannot accept that another person is above him and he must follow that guy kabul direct you mean he wants to be president waqad indeed kabul direct so why wouldnt he participate in the democratic process so he can be elected to this position waqad he has security fears because of the foreign forces if president bush would treat hekmatyar the same way he does karzai and his team hekmatyar would certainly join the peace process in afghanistan kabul direct but negotiations have been proposed several times waqad the proposals were not inviting enough if hekmatyar had been convinced that he would be given position commensurate with his rank and ability he would have joined the government kabul direct does hekmatyar believe in the democratic process waqad hizbe islami was more democratic then any other jihadi party during the antisoviet jihad in afghanistan the leaders of hizbe islami have always been elected hekmatyar still has the ability to recruit new soldiers even among young people who may not be aware of his past kabul direct you dont think hekmatyars vision is unacceptable to most of the youth waqad indeed it is but he can still find receptive audience in the seminaries in pakistan in his own seminaries kabul direct what is hekmatyars relationship with the various deobandi seminaries waqad the seminaries led by mavlana fazal rahman and mavalana sami haq have real relationship with hekmatyar mavlana fazl rahmani rejects the ideology and tactics of the muslim brotherhood of which hizbe islami is part but jamat islami of pakistan is very close with hekmatyar in pakistan the thinking on afghanistan has changed people are told that afghanistan is occupied by foreigners and governed by crusaders this attitude empowers hekmtyar and other antigovernment elements they can take advantage of these youthful notions many of the old hizbe islami commanders members of its operative council are now in afghanistan and working with karzai government many hold highpositions in the karzai administration kabul direct living afghanistan 11 kabul direct october 2007 volume 1 issue 1 kabul direct last year hekmtyar talked about having close relations with the taliban but in 2007 we have not heard him making the same claims has the relationship changed waqad during the five years the taliban controlled afghanistan hekmatyar was unable to bridge his differences with the taliban i think he has better chance of being able to work out his differences with the government than he does the taliban again hizbe islami is generally comprised of highlyeducated people reasonable people the only reason hizbe islami has any relationship with the taliban is because both stand in opposition to the karzai government that is really the only thing the two parties have in common kabul direct do you think hizbe islami and hekmtyar are close to qaedas leadership waqad yes indeed hekmatyar needs logistic and economic support without help from qaida he could not continue his confrontation kabul direct if he is supported by qaida then what is his difference with the terrorist organization waqad the taliban and qaida do not accept the governments of many countries even islamic ones like saudi arabia as being legitimate hizbe islami members who are also members of the muslim brotherhood do not believe in confronting these muslim governments kabul direct but if he is supported by qaida then he is certainly willing to go along with their view right waqad yes but only because hekmatyar needs their financial and logistical support at the moment this might not have been the situation had the government worked out an accord with hekmatyar back in 2001 when he returned from iran there is still more basis for him to work out deal with the government than for him to have relationship with qaida or the taliban kabul direct what should the government do to reach positive peace agreement with hekmatyar waqad there should be serious discussion of peace talks the government can take advantage of saudi arabia pakistan and other influences to pressure hekmatyar the karzai administration should not leave this task to inexperienced afghan intelligence officials it also does not require military response kabul direct what do you propose for the betterment of the current satiation in afghanistan waqad everything ends in the present afghan government the karzai administration must prove its capacity in both politics and administration the administration needs to carve out deals with pakistan and iran as well it needs to bring the insurgents into the fold it should start small and bring them in gradually this cant be done overnight finally the government has to earn the peoples trust by meeting their expectations because afghanistan is traditional society whatever the government does has to conform to afghan norms kabul direct kabul direct is the first place where afghan expert s decide what news analysis is important and how afghans see afghanistan subscribe now kabul direct living afghanistan 12 kabul direct october 2007 volume 1 issue 1 qaida in afghanistan waheed mujda explains waheed mujda is former highranking foreign ministry official of the taliban and an expert on qaeda before joining the taliban he was member of hizbe islami the organization led by rebel leader gulbaddin hekmatyar who established his reputation as an antisoviet mujahideen commander in the 1980s mujda studied economics at kabul university and recently wrote book afghanistan and the five year reign of the taliban he spoke with kabul direct about the war on terror and qaida in afghanistan on september 28 2007 in his office west of kabu l kabul direct what is your assessment of qaida what has the organization done since 911 and what is it capable of doing waheed mujda the attacks of 911 and the us response drastically changed qaeda the leadership was forced into hiding independent nuclei then formed around the world keeping the organization alive at least in spirit while they brand themselves as qaeda or are identified as such these nuclei do not have generally close ties with the central leadership they might have the same goals and objectives as qaeda but they also have their own local agendas we can see this in afghanistan where the local variation is disconnected from the central command structure and make their own decisions depending on the situation on the ground kabul direct was the use of these subgroups planned or did it just happen mujda after the us began its war on terror against qaeda and the taliban for hosting qaeda the leadership of qaeda left kandahar and took refuge in eastern afghanistan once safe in the eastern region bin laden sent letter to mullah omar asking his permission to train youths for jihad what bin laden was really asking omar was whether he could deploy suicide bombers in afghanistan having sworn his fealty to omar as leader of the faithful bin laden needed to get omars permission to do this remember that qaeda had already used suicide bombers to get rid of ahmad shah masood the leader of the northern alliance two days before the attacks on new york and washington qaida never expected that the us would respond to 911 as forcefully as it did bin laden had convinced mullah omar during the planning stages that if the us attacked afghanistan the americans would only meet the same fate that the soviet union did the mujahidin would be able to beat american superpower too and if the us did not invade afghanistan its superpower status would still be diminished it would be seen as weak what the qaeda leaders never imagined is what actually happened qaeda never prepared for the idea that the 911 attacks would launch war against muslims worldwide and further oppress them of course the us and western response has also raised qaedas profile even if it is not apparent who supports qaeda now clearly it has support the us response increased the popularity of qaeda kabul direct living afghanistan 13 kabul direct october 2007 volume 1 issue 1 kabul direct how would you gauge the relationship between qaida and the taliban is bin laden still mullah omars sworn ally mujda afghans especially those sunni afghans who follow the hanafi school of jurisprudence did not respect the other schools of sunni jurisprudence for example the school followed by bin laden and the salafis or wahhabis whatever you want to call them wahhabi islam is not traditional among afghans who are by and large hanafis but this changed during the antisoviet jihad when wahhabis flooded the country to fight jihad abullah azzam the spiritual leader of the anti soviet jihad advised his fighters to pray in the hanafi style to show respect for the afghan tradition at first it was only the ikhawan muslimin or muslim brotherhood parties like hizbe islami under hekmatyar that were close to the wahhabi mujahideen but later when wahabbis and deobandis began to dominate the jihad the fighters stopped respecting these afghan traditions the deobandis who rejected the ideas of movalana abel ala movdudi are the afghans that you now see allied with qaeda kabul direct can you elaborate on how these alliances formed mujda first the us pressure on muslim countries created cause around which to unify reason to put aside any ideological conflicts in the face of real enemy before jihad if hanafi sunni in afghanistan referred to mavdodi as reference people would say he was misled or had gone astray but now that it is not the case now people are unified and are acting as allies regarding bin ladens sworn fealty to mullah omar he made this pledge when the taliban ruled afghanistan when bin ladin accepted mullah omar as his amir mullah omar became the spiritual leader of qaeda bin laden is still the political leader of the organization but as the spiritual leader mullah omar has authority over bin laden you could see this was so when before 911 mullah omar told bin laden he had to stop speaking to the media because bin laden had sworn to obey omar thats exactly what he had to do mullah omar also exerts power politically he was the person who appointed junabail namangani the uzibk to be the commander of the arab fighters in afghanistan that said it is still qaeda that forced the taliban to have unified and global vision kabul direct you said qaeda has only grown more popular in the islamic world how would you rate its popularity among afghans in the land where qaeda was first conceived mujda outside kabul in the eastern and southern provinces of afghanistan you can see and feel its strength in these parts nobody can save you if you criticize either qaeda or their local arm the taliban not even the governments security forces kabul direct why do these afghans feel attached to qaeda mujda for many reasons i think the most important factors are the incompetence of the afghan government and the oppressiveness of the us actions not just in afghanistan but in the islamic world in general its war on terror kabul direct what do you make of reports of the sunni rebellion against qaeda in iraq mujda well we saw peace in northern afghanistan too in recent years but now the situation has deteriorated again in the mountainous and remote regions people dont object to the rules and regulations imposed by qaeda and the taliban kabul direct but are not qaeda and taliban mostly involved in terrorizing the people i have kabul direct living afghanistan 14 kabul direct october 2007 volume 1 issue 1 not heard that afghans are willingly accepting them mujda there are published reports that the taliban are collecting oshor from people in the badghis province of eastern afghanistan you cannot collect oshor unless you control region this surfaced when it was reported that two taliban in the process of collecting oshor started fighting that they were fighting was not all that newsworthy rather the significance of this was that they were collecting oshor you cannot collect oshor unless you have subjugated the people kabul direct have you heard about any active qaeda terror training camps still being run in afghanistan mujda yes you can see them in the qaeda videotapes i think i also think qaeda still has camps in kunar and nuristan provinces and in the wazirstan region of pakistan of course kabul direct where is qaedas main base in afghanistan mujda most qaeda forces are in the kunar province from the beginning the salafis were always able to connect with the people of this province i believe these bonds remain strong kabul direct do you think the sunnis in afghanistan will ever rebel against qaeda as some sunnis in iraq have mujda the situation in afghanistan is much different in iraq qaeda promoted sectarian violence among sunni and shiites the leaders of qaeda are responsible for the deterioration there for reducing iraq to sectarian conflict it is not surprising that qaeda now has negative image there that iraqis hate it qaeda has not made the same mistakes in afghanistan in an eid message recently mullah omar asked his followers to respect the different schools of jurisprudence in afghanistan he told his followers to respect the hanafi school the popular school in afghanistan and he told his followers to respect the shiite tradition mullah omar does not want to lose popular support like qaeda did in iraq he will not let the taliban push afghanistan into sectarian war the situation is very different in afghanistan kabul direct dont you think the radical elements of qaeda in iraq will eventually try to radicalize their counterparts in afghanistan after they finish in iraq say mujda even during taliban rule qaeda wanted to have influence beyond afghanistan qaida had designs on all of central asia for example i know this because i was working in the talibans foreign ministry at the time and i was there when mullah omar appointed tahir uldash to be the amir of central asia and the caucasus i saw the letter uldash wrote to foreign ministry in response asking to be consulted on any matters that concerned his area kabul direct what is your prediction how are things going to turn out for qaida the us and its allies mujda the situation will continue to deteriorate with the present government failure seems to be the only option war on terror cant ever be won but i dont think afghans can solve their problems alone i think afghanistan still needs help from the international community afghanistans problems are connected to what is going on in iraq lebanon palestine and other parts of the islamic world unfortunately the situation is very complicated the situation will continue to deterioratea war on terror cant ever be won afghanistans problems are connected to what is going on in iraq lebanon palestine and other parts of the islamic world disclaimer
