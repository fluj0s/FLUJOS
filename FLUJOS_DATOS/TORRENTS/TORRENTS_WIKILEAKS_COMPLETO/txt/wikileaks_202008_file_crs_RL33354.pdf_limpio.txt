spend more than 10 of its federal pssf funds for administrative purposes but there was limit on use of the state pssf funds often described as matching funds that could be spent for administrative purposes beginning with fy2008 pl 109288 extends the 10 limit on spending for administrative purposes to include all funds spent under the program both federal and nonfederal or matching reporting on use of funds federal law and policy emphasize planning the use of pssf funds along with the child we lfare services and other child welfare or related programs to ensure that comprehensive range of child and family services is developed in each state see appendix c planning and reporting in keeping with this emphasis states are required to annually send information to hhs on their planned use of funds under the pssf child welfare services and other child welfare and related programs beginni ng on june 30 2007 p l 109288 requires states to annually submit actual in addition to planned ex

programs data on the use of funds are to be submitted on standard forms which were previously used to report planned expenditures only and include for each program spending by service activ ity or assistance provided and the number of people served the populations targeted for services and the geographic areas served the new law also requires the us department of health and human services hhs to compile the forms show ing this planned and actual use of funds and to submit them to the senate finance and house ways and means committees by september 30 of each year targeting the use of new pssf funds the fy2006 mandatory funding authorization for the pssf was raised from 305 million to 345 million by the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 but this additional 40 million was not appr

that may be funded under such grant include familybased comprehensive longterm substance abuse treatment and replication of successful models for such treatment early intervention and preventative services counseling fo r children and familie s mental health services and parenting skills training what is regional partnership regional partnerships must be established by collaborative agreement between two or more entities for example providers of child welfare services including the state child welfare agency the state agency administering federal substance abuse pr evention and treatment funding local law enforcement agencies juvenile justice offi cials judges and sc hool or cour t personnel providers of community health and mental h ealth services and tribes including tribal child welfare agencies the state child we lfare agency doesnt need to be the lead agency in the partnership applying for th funds but with one exception it must be member of each partnership the agency does not need to be part of the partnership if tribetribal child welfare agency is member of the partnership considerations in awarding grants hhs must first give consideration to the level of need demonstrated in the gr ant application of regional partnership once that initial consideration is made added weight must be given to those applications from regional partnerships showing the effect of methamphetamine abuse and addiction on the child welfar system in the partnership region size and duration of grant aw ards and reports on activities grants must extend for minimum of two years but can not be made for more than five years the annual funding to the grant ee must be at least 500000 but may not be more than 1 million finally grantees will be required to sub mit annual reports on their activities and to incorporate information related to their performance on certain indicators to be developed by hhs in consu ltation with representatives of states and tribes receiving funds further hhs mu st annually send information regarding the use of this grant funding to the senate finance and house ways and means committees evaluation of targeted spending prior law required hhs to annually reserve 6 million in pssf funds to s upport research technical assistance and training related to the program and for ev aluation of the program or other programs designed to achieve the same purposes pl 109288 further stipulates that hhs must annually spend less than 1 million of those reserved funds for research evaluation and technical ssistance related to supportin g monthly caseworker visits of children in foster care and separa tely less than 1 million annually for research evaluation and technical assist ance related to the competitive grants to increase the wellbeing and improve the permanency of children affected by methamphetamine or other substance abusehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33354crs7 4 in fy2005 50 million in pssf funding was set aside for tribes and about 90 tribestribal organizations received allotments those allotments ranged from little above 10000 to about 911000 by contrast tribal allotments under the child welfare services program title ivb subpart 1 are not provided by setaside but are taken out of the amount allotted by formula to the given state in which the tribal children live and based on the tribal population under age 21 and there is funding threshold for fy2005 57 million in child welfare services funding was allotte d to more than 350 tribestribal organizations and the allotment amounts ranged from less than 10 to just over 1 million tribal pssf program funding and access under prior law tribal pssf programs we re funded with 1 setaside of the programs mandatory funding plus 2 setasid of any disc retionary funds provided for the program and in recent years tribes have received annual pssf funding of roughly 5 million beginning with fy2007 pl 109288 raises the tribal setaside to 3 of the programs mandatory funding plus 3 of any discretionary funding provided for pssf however it would apply the 3 setaside of mandatory funds only after the 40 million in targeted funds are reserved for the purposes described above thus the ma ximum funding authorized to be made available to tribes out of the pssf would be 152 million and the minimum funding would be 92 million based on these set aside rules and the expected funding provided in the revised continuing ppropriations resolution 2007 pl 1105 tribal pssf funding in fy2007 is expected to be 118 million tribal allotment of pssf funds are based on tribes relative share of individuals under the age of 21 among all eligible tribes nd allotment may be less than 10000 for fy2006 about 90 tribes received pssf funds or less than third of the tribes that received funds under the child welfare services program pl 109288 permits group of tribes to form consortium and to have their pssf allotment determined based on their combined share of children under the age of 21 the effect of this provision should be to expand access to pssf funds by permitting tribes with smaller populations to band together or to band with larger tribe to ensure their allotment amount is equal to or greater than the 10000 threshold4 finally pl 109288 limits the prior law authority of hhs to exempt tribes from any pssf state plan requirement that the department determines would be inappropriate for that tribe based on th tribes size and resources the law now provides that hhs may continue to exempt tribes from requirements that limit the use of the federal pssf funds for administrative purposes to more than 10 and the requirement that provides that significant portions of pssf federal funds must be spent on each of the four service cat egories communitybased family support family preservation timelimite d reunification and adopti on promotion and support however tribes are required to comply w ith all other plan re quirements including assurances that the funds received will not supplant other federal or nonfederal funds available for those purposes as well as ot her planning and re porting requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33354crs8 amendments to the child welfare services program under prior law the child welfare serv ices program title ivb subpart 1 of the social security act was authoriz ed to receive funding of 325 million annually on an indefinite basis pl 109288 continue s this same funding authorization level but limits it to five years fy2007fy2011 thus placing this program on the same reauthorization calender as the promoting safe and stable families program for fy2006 the child welfare services prog ram received an appropriation of 287 million under pl 1105 fy2007 funding for the program was expected to again be 287 million purposes pl 109288 deleted length prior law definition of child welfare services along with brief program purpose statement however it largely incorporated the intent of those prior provisions in new purpose section the law now describes the purpose of the child we lfare services program as to promote state flexibility in the development and expansion of coordinated child and family services program that utilizes communitybased agencies and ensures all children are raised in safe loving families by 1 protecting and promoting the welfare of all children 2 preventing the neglect abuse or exploitation of children 3 supporting atrisk families through services which allow children where appropriate to remain safely with their families or return to their families in timely manner 4 promoting the safety permanence and wellbeing of children in foster care and adoptive families and 5 providing training prof essional development and support to ensure wellqualified child welfare workforce new aspects of this language include both the assertion that the program is intended to promote state flexibility in the development and expansion of coordinated child and family services program and the inclusion of an explicit program purpose related to providing training development and support to ensure wellqualified child welfare workforce limitation on admini strative spending the total cost of the child welfare services program is shared by th federal government 75 and the state 25 prior law placed limit on the amount of program funds states could spend for administrative purposes beginning with fy2008 pl 109288 limits the use of program funds for those purposes to more than 10 which applies to both federal and nonfederal progra m funds the law also defines administrative costs to include cws programrela ted procurement payro ll management personnel functions except supervision of caseworke r services management maintenance and operation of space and property data processing and co mputer services accounting budgeting auditing and certain travel ex penses under this definition spending on caseworker services is not considered an administrative cost revised limitation on use of federal funds under prior law the state could not spend more of its federal program funds on t hose foster care maintenance payments adoption assistance payments or to provide child day care that was necessary solely for the employment or employment related training of parentrelative of child than the amount of federal funds it d received under this program in fy1979 in fy1979 funding for the program was 565 million or roughly 20 of the fy2006 funding level by contract pl 109288 provides that beginning with fy2008 state may spend any federal cws funds for foster care maintenance payments doption assistance payments or child day care unless it canhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33354crs9 5 the childrens bureau has indicated that it expects states to address

these purposes in fy2005 if state can show this then its new annual limit on sp ending of federal cws funds for these three purposes combin ed is the amount of the federal cws funds it spent on them in fy2005 limit on use of nonfede ral matching funds for purposes of providing their required 25 of the child we lfare services program cost ie their matching dollars states have been per mitted to count their own spending for foster care maintenance payments without an limits beginning with fy2008 pl 109 288 prohibits states from using any foster care maintenance payment expenditures for the purpose of providing their nonfe deral matching do llars under the cws program unless the state can show that it used foster care maintenance payment spending to meet the matching requireme nt for cws funds in fy2005 if state can show this then the amount of the foster care maintenance payment spending that it counted under the program for matching purposes in fy2005 is the maximum amount of foster care maintenance payment spending it may count in the program in fy2008 and every following year state plan requirements under the child welfare services program states are required to develop plan that assures the state will meet federal requirements pl 109288 dds several new requirement s it requires states to describe how they consult with and involve physicians or other appropriate medical professionals in asse ssing the health and wellbeing of children in foster care and in determining appropriate medical treatment for them further later than one year after the enactment of pl 109288 that is by late september 2007 states must have procedures in place to ensure conti nued availability of ch ild and family services in the wake of disaster in addition pl 109288 requires states to describe by the first day of fy2008 their standards fo r the content and frequency of caseworker visits to children in foster care which at minimum must include monthly visit by the caseworker that is wellplanned and fo cused on issues pertinent to case planning and service delivery to ensure the safe ty permanency and wellbeing of the children5 related requirements ar described below under monthly caseworker visit standards pl 109288 includes separate requirement to clarify th at for children in foster care who have permanency goal of another planned permanent living arrangement such an arrangement may include placement in residential education program it also eliminated certain requirements that have little or meaning today these eliminated provisions required state to assure that

table prepared by the congressional research service crshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33354crs36 appendix b legislative history of the promoting safe and stable families program at least since the creation of the current federal child welfare program structure by the adoption assistance and child we lfare act of 1980 pl 96272 congress has remained consistently c oncerned about the number of children in foster care and the lack of stability and permanence in their lives during the 1990s congress created new program pl 10366 now called the promoting safe and stable families program whic h responded to some of those concerns by the end of the 1980s there were widespread concerns about rapidly growing foster care caseload believed to be spurred by the spread of crack cocaine use and belief that too few preventive services were resulting in too many children being unnecessarily placed in foster care at the same time number of states often with the support of private foundations had begun to offer model of family preservation services that provided families with shortterm intensive services early research suggested these services would significantly reduce the number of children unnecessarily placed in foster care in this climate congress began discussions about in creasing federal support for preventive services including intensiv family preservation several years of legislative efforts lead initially to 1992 agreement between the house and senate on new capped entitlement funding for 1 innovative services to children and families eg fa mily preservation services 2 substance abuse prevention and treatment and 3 respite care the agr eement would have entitled states to their share of 165 million for these purposes in fy1993 rising to 575 million in fy1998 and for every succeeding year the fy 1998 amount adjusted by an inflation factor the legislation provided specific llotment of the total funds for each purpose with the largest share reserved for innovative services conference agreement to accompany hr 11 102nd cong hrept 1021034 alt hough this legislation was approved by both the senate and the house as part of an omnibus package the revenue act of 1992 it was vetoed by president george h w bush for reasons unrelated to the child welfare provi sions and so did not become law original enactment one year later however child welfare advocates succeeded in including new entitlement f unding for family preservation and support services in the omnibus budget rec onciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 which created subpart 2 of title ivb of the soci security act proposed by the clinton administration the 1993 legislation drew mu ch of its inspiration from the earlier legislative work but made several notable changes among those it included less entitlement funding and deleted specific llotment of funds for substance abuse prevention and treatment and respite care both of which could nonetheless be funded out of the program th at was approved as enacted the family preservation and s upport services provisions of pl 10366 entitled states to receive certain portion of federal funds rising from 60 million in fy1994 to less than 255 million by

less than 25 of the states total family preservation and family support services program with nonfe deral funding finally the new law also provided that funds were to be set aside annually to low state highest courts to assess their need for improvements to their handling of child welfare cases 5 million for such grants in fy1995 and 10 million for each of fy1996fy1998 and separately to allow

in fy1994 and 6 million in each of fy1995fy1998 asfa amendments congress returned to child welfare issues when it passed the 1997 adoption nd safe families act asfa pl 10589 that legislation sought to make childs safety the primary concern in all child welfare decisions and also to move foster children to permanent family more quickly with an eye toward childrens development and their concept of time members of congress were concerned that states maintained goal of family reunification long after it was apparent that such goal was inappropriate or in cases where reunification might in fact jeopardize the child s safety they were also troubled by reports that the number of adoptions out of foster care had remained virtually unchanged for years while the number of children in care had risen dramatically11 asfa renamed title ivb s ubpart 2 of the social security act the promoting safe and stable families program in addition as one part of asfas mu ltiple amendments related to the safety of child ren congress added re quirement that the safety of children be the paramount c oncern in administering and conducting service programs under the pssf program as part of its focus on expediting decisions around finding permanent hom for children in foster care and encouraging adoption as one method of doing this congress fined two additional service categories for which states were required to use significant portions of their pssf funding timelimited family reunification services and adoption promotion and support finally congress set nnual increases in th mandatory

parental rights tpr proceedings for any child who has been in foster care for 15 of the past 22 months unless the state can show good cause why it should not do this childs adoption cannot be completed wit hout termination of parental rights and courts are generally reluctant to grant tpr in cases where the family has not first been offered needed reunification services thus the new timelimited reunification funding category sought to ensure that asfas efforts to expedite permanency were not defeated by lack of available or provide d services likewise the addition of the adoption promotion nd support services category was consistent with other asfa amendments that enc ouraged adoption as way of attaining permanent family for children 2001 amendments program reauthorization language introduced in 2001 largely mirrored language suggested by the bush administration and initially sought to raise the annual manda tory funding level of the program to 505 million however congress subsequently changed this provision and the administration also changed its budget request to instead aut horize discretionary f unds above the prior mandatory funding level12 as enacted the promoting safe and stable families amendments of 2001 pl 107133 authorized 200 million in discretionary funding for the program in each of fy2002fy2006 and maintained the prior authorized mandatory

added four findings to th statute and provided four program objectives each linked to one of the four service categories funded by the program it amended the definition of family preserva tion

subsets of each other each of the pssf rvices categories have different target populations and as the legislative history shows they were created by congress to meet separate if related goals family support services have the broadest target popul ation and in philosophy aim to bolster the functioning of any family in given community family preservation services are generally unde rstood to serve far narrower group of families those where childre n are at imminent risk of removal to foster care meaning in most cases that child has already experienced abuse or neglect and including some families where child has been removed to foster care and reunification efforts are underway federa l child welfare funding for family support and family preservation services was instituted at time when congress was particularly concerne d about the burgeoning foster car caseload the services were intended to prevent the need for foster care placement whenever possible and the new funding for these services was the cente rpiece of the child welfare legislation in which they were enacted pl 10366httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33354crs42 15 the statute provides that states must spend significant portion of funds of each of the four categories hhs has interpreted this to mean that state must spend 20 of the funds allotted to it on each service category unless the state can provide an especially strong rationale for not doing this see acyfcbpi0401 feb 2 2004 16 james bell associates analysis of states annual pr ogress and services reports and child and family services plans

recent years have not been compiled or analyzed on national basistimelimited reunification rvices may be understood as subset of family preservation services and are explicitly meant to serve the needs of children and families who have been separa ted for 15 months or less because the child is placed in foster care adoption promotion and support services aim to encourage families seeking to adopt from fost er care and to support those who have done so such services might also be understand as subs et of family support services or in the case of adoptive families in crisis as family preservation service federal funding for these services was not the central creation of the adoption and safe families act asfa pl 10589 rather congress increased pssf funding to some extent and require d states to spend money on timelimited reunification and adoption pr omotion and support to augment asfas central goals of promoting safety and permanency for children at the time congress remained deeply concerned about the size of the fo ster care caseload but asfa helped shift the focus of this concern from policies pr imarily intended to prevent entries into foster care to policies that sought to safely expedite exits from care state planned spending by category federal statute as interpreted in hhs policy requires states to spend at l east 20 of their pssf funds on each of the four service categories15 collectively states reported that they intended to spend their fy2002 pssf funds as follows 29 for family support 30 for family preservation 21 for time limited reunification and 20 for adoption promotion and support given that family support and family preservation have received dedicated funding the longest and that thei r service goals and target populations are more expansive program evaluators note that the two newest services categories timelimited family reunifica tion and adoption promotion and support have become wellestablished in the continuum of pssffunded services16 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33354crs43 at the same time because states may c hoose to include the same given activity in more than one service category this spreading of resources across categories could ideally mean that states have full range of child and family services available to those who are not yet in need of extens ive child welfare services those who need such services to ensure that children and their parents can safely live together rather than be separated via foster care placement those for whom the services are needed to ensure short foster care stay and pe rmit early reunification and those for whom the services support successful creation and functioning of permanent adoptive families effectiveness of services congress required hhs to evaluate the effectiveness of pr ograms funded under title ivb subpart 2 as part of its initia l approval of funding for family preservation and family support services in the early 1990s hhs used those funds to support three largescale evaluations one looked at overall implementation issues for the program second looked at the effectiven ess of two particul ar models of family preservation services both providing rela tively intensive casework and the third looked at the effectiveness of very wide range of family support services findings from these evaluations are discussed below similar largescale evaluations of timelimited reunification services or of adoption promotion and support services have been made however these services may in part be subsets of some kinds of family preserva tion and family support programs further congress amended the statutory language on evaluations in 2001 pl 107133 to include speci fic research priorities among these are promising program models in the pssf service categories particularly timelimited reunification services nd postadoption services as noted earlier the 2006 amendments pl 109288 require hhs to use some of its setaside funds to fund research ev aluation and technical assistance related to supporting improved quality and qua ntity of caseworker visits of foster children 1 million annually and to providing services or activities to improve the outcome of children affected by their parents or other caretakers abuse of methamphetamine or other substance intensive family preservation services when congress began discussion of funding these services in the early 1990s great deal of optimism existed about the ability of intensive family preservation services to costeffectively reduce the number of placements in foster care since that time multiple program evaluations have not shown that intensive family preservation services lower placement risk for the children and families they serve when compared to children and families receiving standard inhome casework services in addition both children and families w ho received standard inhome casework services and those receiving intensive fa mily preservation services were found to have similar relatively low levels of maltreatment recurrence after initiation of the services and to exhibit similar levels of family functioning in other words receipt of intensive family preser vation services did not re duce outofhome placement orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33354crs44 17 there have been multiple evaluations and sy nthesis reviews of st udies including studies that used the most rigorous evaluation design random assignment not all of these studies made all of the findings mentioned in this pa ragraph however the finding that intensive family preservation services do not reduce pla cement when compared to children receiving regular casework services is wellestablished this report discusses findings of the multi site hhsfunded evaluation of family preserva tion services which was conducted by westat chapin hall center for children and james bell associates the report studied three sites in louisville ky memphis tn and seven counties in new jersey where homebuilders model was applied and four th philadelphia pa where specialized intensive family preservation services model was used overall the findings were similar across these sites us

functioning beyond what normal casework services achieved17 these evaluations did not compare nor were they designed to compare the placement outcomes for families receiving services versus outcomes for those who received services and they should not be understood as proof that the families served did not benefit from or need the services instead the evaluations were designed to test whether particular manner of deliverin g the same kinds of caseworker activities eg anything from he lp paying utility bill to counseling about effective and appropria child discipline coul d produce better outcomes for children and families the mostscrutinized intensive family preservation services delivery model homebuilders provides that services mu st be initiated quickly within 72 hours of crisis that precipitated imminent child removal that they must be intensive caseworkers are to be assigned more than two families to work with must be available to those families 24 hours day seven days week and are expected to swiftly offer any or all of full range of material and clinical aids needed and they are to be of short duration 46 weeks as these characteristics suggest the target population for the delivery of services vi the homebuilders model is families where children are at imminent risk of removal this is especially critical to the models theory of effectiveness which rests on an aspect of crisis theory and posits that family in crisis is at juncture where it is particularly amenable to change in practice and for variety of reasons providing intensive family preservation services to families and children who are imminent risk of foster care removal has proven difficult in the foursite study contracted by hhs and jointly conducted by westat the chapin hall center for children and james bell associates the evaluators found that even though special precautions were taken to ensure only families at imminent risk were studied very small percentages of the control group children those are children who were randomly assigned to receive regular caseworker services rather than intensive family preservation services were actually placed in foster care within 30 days of their assignment to the study the share of control group children who were not placed in foster care during this time period ranged from 89 to 95 this was very similar to the share of experimentalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33354crs45 18 ibid pp 91 through 94 while the low ra of foster care placement strongly suggests that the evaluation did not successfully target families in which children were at imminent risk of removal the evaluators note that ev looked at over the 18month period during which the study followed families those that received intensive family preservation services did not have reduced likelihood of pl acement finally even t hough placement was not imminent for these families they do appear to have been at greater risk for placement and thus arguably in need of services indeed 18 months after the study was initiated anywhere from about onefifth to more than onethird of the families receiving family preservation services as well as those in the control group who did not receive services had experienced at least one placement 19 ibid pp 911920group children not placed in foster care during the first 30 days after their assignment to the study 89 to 9918 given that targeting intensive family preservation services on children at imminent risk for removal has been problem for most or all of the evaluations of this service delivery model and that for the multisite hhs study the evaluators developed special tools meant to ensure only families most at risk were included in the study researchers suggest that optimal targeting may never be achieved these evaluators also questioned whether many families coming into contact with child welfare services and referred to fa mily preservation services understand themselves to be at crisis point noting that the lives of families served are often full of difficulties externally imposed and internally generated they suggest that the imminent removal of child might simp ly be understood as part of set of ongoing problems rather than as crisis for families with chronic problems they suggest short term dose of services matter how intense would be unlikely to resolve all or many of the chronic concerns noting that the intensive family preservation services provided did not harm families the evaluators also made it clear that services for many families whose children are not in foster care are still needed however given the heterogeneity of the child welfare needs of these families child behavioral problems child abuse child neglect suspected child abuse or neglect etc they suggest that single service delivery model providing access to relatively general services is unlikely to work for everyone19 what next for family preservation services the federal statute does not provide that specific family preservation services delivery model must be used by states and hhs explicitly declined to do this when it issued program regulations in addition the discouraging evaluation data on intensive family preservation services is not new some suggestions of the current findings were available even as the program was being federa lly implemented in the middle 1990s states then have had ample time to adjust or otherwise change their models of service delivery although much remains to be learned about what the mo st effective services and delivery of those services might be res earchers have suggested more study of the effectiveness of specific caseworker activities more effective and more selectively delivered parent training classes which ar staple

fewer than onehalf of those states beyond the substantial number of child ren and families arguably in need of services who do not receive them caseleve l analysis of findings in the initial child and family services review cfsr show s that states were less successful in meeting the needs of children and families served in their own homes than those with children in foster care this analysis found that in the onsite review of cases inhome cases were significantly more likely than foster care cases to receive an area needing improvement rating for numbe r of key indicators related to ensuring the wellbeing of children and families these items in which inhome cases were significantly more likely to receive this rating than foster care cases include those related to assessing child and family needs and providing needed services involving childrenfamilies in case planning adequate faceto face worker visits with children and ensuring that children receive services to meet their educationalmental health and physical health needs inhome cases were also significantly more likely to be rated lower on the safety item related to reducing risk of harm to children served than were foster care cases 22 this same study also reported on common challenges to better state performance and while these may apply to either foster care or inhome cases number are directly related to the indicat ors listed above and for which the onsite case reviews revealed specific weakness for inhome cases common challenges23 associated with those indicators and identified for many states include the agency doesnt consistently provi sufficient services to address risk of harm to children particularly in the inhome services cases the agency doesnt consistently monitor families to assess serviceparticipation and change in risk factors to protect children in their homes and prevent removal the agency doesnt consistently pr ovide appropriate services to meet the identified needs of children and parents fathers mothers and children age appropriate are not sufficiently involved in case planninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33354crs48 24 see also us department of health and hu man services office of the inspector general state standards and capacity to track frequenc of caseworker visits with children in foster care oei040300350 dec 2005 this repor t does not deal with inhome

statewide reports of the number of caseworker visits actually received by children and that of 20 states that coul d produce these reports seven showed that fewer than half of the foster care children were visited monthly on average most but not all of those states had monthly visit standard for children in foster care 25 the child and family services review is intended to comprehensively review

services reviews by emilie stoltzfusthe frequency of facetoface contacts between workers and children isnt consistently sufficient to ensure childrens safety and well being24 the agency is not consistent in pr oviding services to meet childrens identified educationrelated needs the number of dentistsdoctors in the state willing to accept medicaid is not sufficient to meet the need there is lack of mental health services for children and the agency doesnt consistently conduct mental hea lth assessments in sum while children in foster care are much discussed as the barometer of states child welfare performance states inhome case loads are generally more sizeable than their foster care caseloads and the data suggest that not all families are receiving needed services nor are those r eceiving services having their needs fully met25 family support services where family preservation services may be requested once family has come to the attention of the child welfare agency eg child maltreatment alle gation andor finding made family support services seek to reach families that have not reached that threshold the central object of these services is to ensure child never experi ences abuse or neglect and to improve the functioning of parents on beha lf of their children typically these services have been provided by community agencies or groups rather than by the state or local public child welfare agency and the target fa mily group is much broader than those typically served by the child welfare ag ency although family support services may be described and implemented as intended for families atrisk of child abuse or neglect in theory they are designed to benefit any family in particular community or neighborhood overall families that receive family support services such as parent training or child development cla sses would seem much more likely to seek out or volunteer for the serv ice as opposed to families that may be offered these same services or may be ordered by the court to participate in them for family preservationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33354crs49 26 abt associates national evaluation of family support programs volume the

and types of services there were certain differences between the programs thus they concluded that the full range of family s upport programs has not been truly evaluated descriptive differences they note are that evaluated programs were more likely to target their services to specific population and to use home visits as their primary mode of service delivery and they were less likely to use

annually review and report on progress toward achieving these goals and to make any necessary adjustments to the plan that reflect changed circumstances states must continually be engaged in this planning and review process that is every five years the state must establish new fiveyear plan and begin annual progress reviews nd reports of that plan beyond these requirements the 1993 legislation encouraged states to take planning seriously by permitting each state to use up to 1 million of its first year grant fy1994 for planning purposes and providing that this spending on planning did not

reauthorized in 2003 pl 10836 that legislation raised the programs author ization level to 80 million for fy2004 and such sums as necessary for each of fy2005fy2008 however the program has never recei ved more than the 43 million that was appropriated for it in fy2005 for fy2006 the program received 42 million and under pl 1105 it is expected to receive the same sum in fy2007 child welfare services authorized by title ivb subpart 1 child welfare services is the oldest fe deral program supporting state child welfare activities and was first authorized as part of th original 1935 social security

on responses from 46 states regarding use of child welfare services funds and 44 states regarding use of pssf funds including the district of columbia terr itories and tribes the funds may be used to support broad range of services to children and families which are intended to protect children who have been abused or ne glected or are at risk of maltreatment and may take various forms ranging from c ounseling and other s upports for parents intended to improve child wellbeing prevent child buse and neglect and preserve family to removal of the children from their homes and provision of services to parents to enable safe and appropriate return of childre n to their own homes when efforts to reunite are not appropriate or do not succeed child welfare services may include termination of parental rights placement of the children for adoption and provision of post adoption services states may use child welfare services generally for wider range of activities than are permitted under pssf and 2003 general accounting office gao study found that despite considerable overlap in the purposes stat used the bulk of their child welfare services and pssf grants to fund significantly different activities for instance while states reported spending both child welfare services and pssf funds to support family supportpre vention family preservati on family reunification and adoption support and preservation services they reported using just 11 of their child welfare services funds for thes purposes compared to 82 of their pssf funds states expended the largest share of child welfare funds 71 for child welfare worker salaries administration and management child protective services and foster care maintenance payments pssf expenditures for those purposes equaled just 8 of state pssf spending35 the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee have exercised jurisdiction over child we lfare services since 1990 the program has had discretionary f unding authorization level of 325 million but it has never received more than 295 million in given year for fy2006 the program is funded at 287 million and under pl 1105 it is expected to r eceive the same level of funding in fy2007 other child welfare and related programs several additional child welfare programs primarily support research or demons tration projects related to adoption as well as to services to help cer tain families at special risk of child abuse or neglect each of these programs is f unded by discretionary appropriations and any appropriated funds are distributed on comp

family support goals of pssf include early head start head start and the healthy start initiative like family support programs in general the populati ons served by these programs are much broader than those generally served by the child welfare population and these programs are not furt her described here37 some nondedicated federal funding used for pssf purposes many states also make use of federal f unding streams that are not specifically or exclusively provided for child welfare pur poses but for which federal law includes certain child welfare activities as purposes or permissible uses of funds measured by state use of the funds for child welf are purposes the largest of these are the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant the social services block grant ssbg and medicaid an urban insitute survey of state fy2002 spending on child welfare found that in that year state child we lfare agencies spent about 47 billion from these federal fundi ng streams of which some 28 13 billion 13 billion was used to support prev ention activities eg prevent teenage pregnancy prevent drug use prevent child abuse family reunification efforts and inhome support as well as child protectiv services screening and investigating reported child maltreatment 38 while state child welfare agencies have in recent years had access to considerable tanf ssbg and medicai d funds because these funds are not appropriated solely for child welfare agenci they cannot necessarily count on their continued availability instead their access to these federal funds is generally conditioned on the funding decisions made by others in the state eg discretion about how funds are used may rest with the state legislature or in different state executive agency and may further be limited by federal legislative and administrative changes to these programs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33354crs57 39 see crs report rl33866 medicaid schip and health insurance fy2008 budget issues by

109th congress an overview by gene falk melinda gish and carmen solomonfears 41 for fy2006 congress appropriated an additional 550 million in ssbg funds however this money was in response to hurricane needs and the bulk of the money 94 was distributed to five states determined most affected by the hurricanes see crs report 94 953 social services block grant title xx of the social security act by melinda gishfor instance the current administration continues to seek new limits on state use of certain medicaid services for ra nge of purposes including child welfare39 the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 enacted cer tain language intended to clarify how states may use medicaid f unds for targeted case management tcm on behalf of children in foster care further the ability of state child welfare agencies to use tanf funds may be affected by in creased work requirements included in the deficit reduction act which are expected to necessitate greater state spending of tanf on job related costs such as training and child care40 finally congress has greatly reduced th amount of funding for ssbg which includes among its five primary purposes preventing or remedying neglect abuse or exploitation of children and adults ble to protect their own interests or preserving rehabilitating or reuniting families annual funding for ssbg stood at 28 billion when the congress enacted new child welfare services funding now called the promoting safe and stable families program in 1993 in 1996 however pl 104193 reduced the ssbg entitlement cap and funding has since declined to 17 billion
