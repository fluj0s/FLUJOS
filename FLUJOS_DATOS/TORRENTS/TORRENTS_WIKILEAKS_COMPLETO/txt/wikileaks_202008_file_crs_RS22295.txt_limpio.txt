states in order to use their airstrips for what became the usled operation enduring freedom oef in afghanistan uzbekistan reportedly made number of requests during sofa negotiations including for us security and assistance pledges and for primary focus on humanitarian and searchandrescue missions rather than air attack or air refueling although the uzbeks allowed some special operations missions the usuzbek sofa was signed on october 7 and the air campaign against afghanistan began an hour later1 the usuzbek sofa provided for use of uzbek airspace and for up to 1500 us troops to use sovietera airbase termed karshikhanabad or k2 90 miles north of the afghan border near the towns of karshi and khanabad in exchange the united states provided security guarantees and agreed that terrorists

base monetary reimbursements were specified3 the duration of the sofa was openended but included provision that it could be terminated by either party with 180day notice according to some reports problems in negotiating the uzbek sofa further spurred the united states to seek alternative airfield access at the manas international airport in kyrgyztan4 air force secretary james roche has stated that k2s missions were special operations combat search and rescue and theater lift and other sources have mentioned intelligence functions the air force reported in early 2005 that c130s flying out of k2 carried an average of about 60 passengers and about 50 tons of cargo per day to bagram kandahar and other locations in afghanistan and that about 1000 army and air force personnel were deployed there excluding contractors more than 40000 us air force flights departed and landed at k2 since late 2001 according to the us embassy5 emerging strains in usuzbek relations uzbekistan was the only central asian state that joined the coalition of the willing in februarymarch 2003 that endorsed usled military operations in iraq kazakhstan joined later6 however us uzbek relations became strained in 20042005 partial us aid cutoff in fy2004 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22295 because of uzbek human rights violations and president karimovs growing fears that the united states was fostering democratic revolutions in soviet successor states added to these strains among other strains uzbek officials had expected ample compensation for use of k2 and complained that such compensation was delayed and inadequate including 2003 us reimbursement of services payment of 157 million in coalition support funds for the use of k2 through december 2002 congress in may 2005 approved 425 million in military construction funds fy2005 emergency supplemental appropriations 2 an oct 12 2001 usuzbek statement on combating terrorism called for both sides to consult in the event of threat to uzbekistans

romania cross the caucasus states of georgia and azerbaijan span the caspian sea north of iran then cross into central asia after offloading cargo at bagram the c17s would fly to k2 refuel and retrace

unspecified operational assistance for operation iraqi freedom rand 2005 crs3 pl10913 hrept 10972 for upgrading runways and taxiways at k2 but the project was delayed by increased strains in relations7 the termination of the sofa although the administration initially responded cautiously to civil violence in may 2005 in uzbekistans city of andijon where many witnesses and others claimed that the uzbek government killed hundreds of unarmed civilians the state department soon endorsed international calls for credible investigation of the killings this and other us criticism of human rights abuses in uzbekistan appeared to contribute to restrictions placed by the karimov government in midjune on night flights and on c17 and other heavy cargo lift out of k28 on july 5 2005 the presidents of uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan signed declaration issued during meeting of the shanghai cooperation organization sco regional security body composed of russia china and all the central asian states except turkmenistan that called for coalition members supporting operations in afghanistan to decide on the deadline for the use of the temporary infrastructure and for their military contingents presence in those countries9 despite signing the declaration none of the central asian countries that hosted us and other coalition bases called for immediately httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22295 closing them and some observers speculated that the states were seeking higher rents for the bases however the day after refugees who fled from andijon to kyrgyzstan were flown to romania on july 28 2005 uzbekistan delivered demarche to the us embassy in tashkent requesting that us use of k2 end within six months besides anger at the united states for supporting the refugee move uzbek legislators in late august contended that us operations at k2 should end because they attract international terrorism damage the environment and are longer necessary since afghanistan is stable they also accused the united states of fomenting the overthrow of the government and of failing to reimburse the country for 168 million spent to support k210 on november 21 2005 the united states officially ceased antiterrorism operations to support afghanistan at k2 the uzbek government reportedly also informed belgium spain netherlands and sweden in midnovember that their basing and overflight privileges would be suspended after the european union denied travel visas to uzbek officials who were implicated in violence in andijon in january 2006 uzbekistan reportedly threatened to end the german role at termez including because us troops were transiting through the base and demanded more foreign assistance from germany the country is said to pay 3 million euros per year for basing privileges 7 beginning in late 2003 the uzbeks submitted six draft leases for k2 according to lt col meppen he states that us negotiators were mystified by uzbekistans repeated attempts to extract monetary concessions particularly after explaining that in other theaters sovereign nations paid for american troops to stay on their soil after rejecting these draft leases centcom and the air force decided in april 2005 that alternatives to k2 might be necessary 8 angeles times june 13 2005 for details see crs report rs22161 unrest in uzbekistan 9 washington post july

asia fbis july 5 2005 doc cep8002 crs4 implications for uzbekistan and regional security many observers judge that uzbekistans security relations with the united states appear seriously set back by its decision to terminate the k2 basing agreement and to curtail other military cooperation with the united states according to 2004 us defense department assessment thenuzbek defense minister qodir gulomov had been very intent upon westernizing the armed forces including increasing interoperability with nato forces building noncommissioned officer corps and restructuring recruitment and retention11 however such plans appeared scuttled in recent months as uzbekistan solidified ties with russia and china as the predominant suppliers of equipment and training that bolsters karimovs rule this trend was bolstered after the european union on october 3 imposed arms export and visa sanctions on uzbekistan in midnovember 2005 russia and uzbekistan signed treaty on allied relations that calls for both sides to have access to each others military installations and for mutual defense consultations in the event of threat to either party gulomov was replaced as defense minister in late 2005 by an intelligence official12 like russia china has backed uzbekistan fully in declaring that events in andijon httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22295 are matter of uzbekistans internal affairs and hence offlimits to international inquiry examples of closer uzbekchinese ties include karimovs visit to china in late may and the signing of an accord on chinese investment in the uzbek energy sector perhaps marking growing security cooperation china and russia held their first military exercises in china in august 2005 which were observed by uzbekistan and other central asian members of the sco some observers question the capabilities of russia and china to adequately address terrorist threats in the region given their inadequate efforts before usled coalition operations began in afghanistan13 implications for us interests us policy since signing cooperative security agreements with the central asian states the administration has averred that the united states seeks permanent basing presence in the region however it also has argued that regional access will be needed as long as conditions in afghanistan require it as well as for future contingencies and to be involved in training and joint exercises for the long term14 the overseas basing commission obc in its may 2005 report concurred with the administration that existing bases in kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan have been useful for supporting oef the obc has considered that there could be some possible merit in establishing csls military facility with few or us troops but which may contain prepositioned equipment and contract personnel in the region but has urged congress to seek further 11 department of defense background briefing on uzbekistan feb 24 2004 see also the uzbek governments looking toward the future

vital us interests in the area that would require longterm us presence15 democratization and the global war on terrorism according to the administration recent events in uzbekistan brought two policies the united states has pursued in tandem combating global terrorism and supporting democratization and human rights into conflict undersecretary of state nicholas burns on august 2 2005 asserted that the administration made clear choice and that was to stand on the side of human rights even though the administration knew that the uzbek government would then demand that k2 be vacated other observers suggested that the administration appeared less prepared for the uzbek demand uzbekistan not only requested that k2 be vacated but curtailed other antiterrorism cooperation including militarytomilitary exchanges and training these programs also aimed to inform uzbek troops about civilmilitary relations in democracy uzbekistan suspended other us funded democratization programs including those carried out by the peace corps the usfunded international research and exchanges board and the eurasia foundation the defense department argued that the closure of k2 created some logistical httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22295 problems but did not markedly affect coalition operations in afghanistan or other aspects of the global war on terrorism defense secretary rumsfeld made sudden trip to kyrgyzstan and tajikistan on july 2527 2005 and announced that he had obtained assurances that these countries would continue to support coalition operations in afghanistan thus seemingly highlighting the flexibility of lily pad approach to foreign military basing and the continuation of major us influence in the region some operations at k2 were transferred to manas and some to bagram afghanistan16 the united states may even gain regional influence according to some observers they point to recent statements by us and kazakh officials about boosting bilateral ties as evidence that kazakhstan continues to vie with uzbekistan for regional dominance they also argue that the united states may gain more moral credibility in the islamic world other observers are less sanguine that the closure of k2 will have minimal effects on us strategic interests they argue that the future of us and coalition basing in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan may not be assured including because both the states had endorsed the july 2005 sco call for afghanistanrelated bases to be closed they warn that the closure of k2 might thus mark the first success of russian and chinese push to consolidate their influence and largely eliminate the us security presence17 congressional concerns many in congress long have voiced concerns about how us assistance is used by the uzbek government since fy2003 annual foreign operations appropriations acts have disallowed aid to the government of uzbekistan unless the secretary of state reports that uzbekistan is making substantial progress in democratization and respect for human rights in fy2004 the state department indicated that up to 18 million in military and economic aid to uzbekistan could be withheld because of lack of such

human rights were among those affected the state department reprogrammed or used notwithstanding authority to allocate some of the affected aid so that about 85 million was ultimately withheld during an august 2004 visit to uzbekistan gen myers criticized the cutoff of imet and fmf programs as shortsighted and not productive since it reduced us military influence reportedly he stated that defense department nonproliferation aid would amount to 21 million in fy2004 and pointed out that fourteen patrol boats worth 29 million were being transferred for fy2005 reportedly about 20 million in foreign operations appropriations were withheld because of lack of progress in democratization and respect for human rights18 among recent legislative proposals some in congress support cutting off

and visas for uzbek officials involved in human rights abuses in september 2005 the defense department informed congress that it intended to provide uzbekistan 23 million to pay the bill for the use of k2 from january 2003 through march 2005 in response senators biden dewine graham leahy mccain and sununu sent letter to defense secretary rumsfeld urging that this planned payment be disbursed only after uzbekistan renewed antiterrorism cooperation with the united states they also warned that quick payout might give the impression that the united states overlooks massacres and rewards dictator who evicts us forces hres 475 delahunt introduced on september 29 2005 called for suspending the payment and for us support for trying karimov in the international criminal court on october 5 2005 an
