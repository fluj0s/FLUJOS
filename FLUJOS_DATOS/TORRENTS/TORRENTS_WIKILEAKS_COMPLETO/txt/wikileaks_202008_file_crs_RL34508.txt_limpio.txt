resources science and industry division natural gas markets overview and policy issues summary the functioning of the natural gas market in 2007 appeared relatively stable and infrastructure development continued at an appropriate pace tighter demandsupply balance for 2008 however has generated more upward spot price movement in this latest period from the beginning to the end of the 20072008 heating season the average wellhead price rose more than 30 according to energy information administration estimates in the foreseeable future weather and economic performance appear most likely to influence prices natural gas provided about 22 of us energy requirements in 2007 it will continue to be major element of the overall us energy market for the foreseeable future given its environmental advantages it will likely maintain an important market share in the growing electricity generation applications along with other clean power sources as congress seeks to address energy security issues the increasing importation of liquefied natural gas lng is also matter deserving careful attention in 2007 lng imports reached record high and plans are to increase this fuel source this report provides an update to congress on recent natural gas market developments and trends that have implications for important energy policy considerations such as prices natural gas use for power generation and liquefied natural gas imports from 2006 to 2007 the average wellhead price reported to the us energy information administration eia remained essentially unchanged at 639 per thousand cubic feet mcf down 001 the average citygate price increased about 3 to 698 per mcf domestic production grew up about 08 trillion cubic feet and domestic consumption increased more than 1 trillion cubic feet this was the first increase in enduse consumption since 2004 according to eia natural gas use for electric power generation increased in 2007 by 105 and for the first time became the largest sector for natural gas consumption in the period covered by eia records residential use increased 82 with weather as major factor commercial and industrial consumption also increased by 6 and 2 respectively the industrial growth reversed decline of 15 from 2005 to 2006 on the supply side onshore production in areas such as the rocky mountains and the barnett shales of texas grew and liquefied natural gas lng imports increased lng imports reached record level of 08 trillion cubic feet eias short term energy outlook anticipates the henry hub spot price increasing almost 20 in 2008 reflecting strong demand relatively low working gas in storage and domestic production growth of almost 3 the henry hub spot price did increase about 20 between the first quarter 2007 and first

17 natural gas markets overview and policy issues introduction natural gas markets in north america remained relatively stable compared to oil markets in 2007 the situation has tightened and prices have regained some upward momentum in 2008 this report examines current conditions and trends in the us natural gas markets key market elements examined include prices consumption production imports and infrastructure expectations about the future as reflected in recent official forecasts are also incorporated here natural gas remains an important and environmentally attractive energy source for the united states its share of the power generation market has grown domestic supply has remained stable and even increased in recent months new developments in alaska increase the likelihood that pipeline from the north slope will proceed the natural gas industry continues to attract capital for new pipeline and storage infrastructure liquefied natural gas lng imports hit record level in 2007 even as import facilities continue to have low utilization rates weather and the economy remain important factors in natural gas prices as well given the generally adequate functioning of natural gas markets congressional interest in the near term is likely to focus on unexpected price volatility or importation or other supply issues in the longer term industry pressure for increased access to public lands for exploration and production is expected to continue receiving congressional attention this report reviews key factors likely to affect market outcomes these factors include weather the economy oil prices and infrastructure development tables a1 to a4 in the appendix present selected highlight statistics that illustrate current market status briefly important developments in natural gas markets include the following the growth in natural gas for power generation has contributed to increased consumption and reduced seasonal variation in use because gasforpower peaks in summer versus the total natural gas use winter peak in 2007 for the first time the power generation sector used more natural gas than any other sector crs2 the first quarter 2008 average spot price at henry hub increased 20 from the first quarter 2007 to 892 per thousand cubic feet mcf versus 6 yeartoyear increase from 2006 to 20071 during the 20072008 heating season october to march average wellhead prices increased more than 30 according to eia estimates2 storage levels towards the end of the heating season dropped below five year averages in the first storage report after the 20072008 heating season working gas storage was at 1234 billion cubic feet the lowest level since april 30 20043 this may indicate that slack in the supply side is decreasing the united states had record lng imports in 2007 and increased lng imports appear likely natural gas infrastructure development continued to advance with many pipeline and storage projects successfully completed in 2007 and more underway in 2008 including lng import facilities industrial natural gas use had small rebound in 2007 background unlike the global oil market natural gas markets remain generally regional with global trade in lng growing for the most part north america has continentwide market that is integrated through pipeline network that connects the lower48 states the most populous provinces of canada and parts of mexico prices throughout this integrated market are influenced by demand which may be influenced by weather economic conditions alternative fuel prices and other factors supply and the capacity available to link supply sources and demand loads transmission and distribution systems the us natural gas market is the major component of the north american natural gas market it accounts for about 81 of north american consumption and about 69 of north american supply the key price point in north america is henry hub henry hub is major pipeline hub in erath louisiana that is used as the designated pricing and delivery point for the new york mercantile exchange nymex gas futures contract and 1 energy information administration eia shortterm energy and summer fuel outlook april 2008 table 5c 2 eia natural gas weekly update april 10 2008 p 3 3 ibid p 3 crs3 other transactions the price difference between other locations and henry hub is called the basis differential when there is spare capacity available to move natural gas from henry hub or the gulf of mexico region in general to the relevant price point area the basis differential tends to be low approximating the costs of fuel used to move the gas to the location when capacity availability is tight basis differentials can grow because the driving force can become the value of the natural gas at the delivery point rather than the cost of getting the natural gas to that point natural gas prices also incorporate costs for distributing the gas from the wholesale marketplace to retail customers these rates are generally determined by state regulators and involve both 1 the approval of costs and rates of return and 2 the allocation of costs among customer classes eg residential commercial industrial although the north american natural gas market remains distinct regional market it is increasingly connecting to global gas marketplace through international lng trade oil prices still affect us natural gas prices and this relationship is changing market conditions the key elements of the market are prices consumption and supply this section provides highlights from recent market developments relating to these factors prices prices remained fairly stable between 2006 and 2007 early 2008 prices have increased at faster pace than in 2007 according to eia figures average spot prices at henry hub increased about 6

crs9 market trends there are several trends under way in natural gas markets of interest to policy makers they include decrease in seasonal demand swings growth in gasforpower use small rebound in industrial use of natural gas growing international trade in lng continuing progress in natural gas infrastructure development seasonality consumption of natural gas in the united states remains highly seasonal for three important sectors reflecting the importance of space heating residential and commercial use of natural gas peaks in winter reflecting the importance of air conditioning load

combination of these seasonal patterns has led to decrease in the overall seasonal swing and the development of secondary peak in the summer due to gasforpower use interestingly while some continue to call for more storage because of the growing consumption of natural gas the decrease in the seasonal swing through decrease in the high month volume and an increase in the crs10 low month volume means that less storage may be able to serve the annual cycling needs of the us markets those trading natural gas may want additional storage for arbitrage uses but the fundamental needs related to system reliability may decrease somewhat with decrease in the difference between the minimum and maximum consumption rates another noteworthy seasonal feature observed in 2007 by eia found that natural gas price volatility is considerably higher in colder months than in other times14 increasing gasforpower use the natural gas consumption sector with the greatest increase from 2006 to 2007 was electric power deliveries to electric power customers increased by 615 bcf more than 45 of the consumption growth for the year for the first time electric power use of natural gas became the largest enduse sector for natural gas15 perhaps even more striking is the relative increase in electric generator use of natural gas during winter in 2007 fercs division of energy market oversight noted that novembermarch volumes increased 14 between winter 200506 and winter 20060716 industrial gas use rebound industrial natural gas use in 2006 was approximately 13 lower than the 7507 bcf consumed in 2002 in 2007 industrial use increased by 2 over the 2006 level the decrease in price to industrial users may have played role in this effect global lng trade in 2007 lng monthly imports varied from high of 987 bcf in april to low of 208 bcf in december because little of the lng is imported under long term contracts us importers compete on the global lng spot market for deliveries in december 2007 european natural gas prices were in the 10201066 per million btu range us prices varied above and below this new england citygates were at 1216 per million btu and henry hub was at 715 the algonquin citygate figure represents several citygates in new england thus some import points could compete successfully in the global spot market for lng and others could not17 there is excess physical capacity at existing lng import facilities to handle more than three times the record imports of 2007 14 eia an analysis of price volatility in natural gas markets august 2007 p2 15 this excludes

been placed into service page forecasts there are few noteworthy elements of recent eia forecasts for the natural gas markets in its short term energy outlook eia forecasts 1 increase in natural gas use for 2008 relative to 2007 weather changes and economic conditions are the reasons eia mentioned for the slowed growth prices are also likely to reinforce short term slowdown in use eia forecasts record us consumption of 234 trillion cf in 2009 eia forecasts increased us production in 2008 of almost 3 primarily from growth in deepwater gulf of mexico and unconventional gas production lng imports are expected to decline about 14 from 2007 eia forecasts supply area natural gas prices henry hub to increase almost 20 in 2008 to 834 per million btu in eias long term forecast through 2030 the reference case forecasts natural gas prices at the wellhead gradually decreasing to 527 per mcf during the 2015 to 2020 period before gradually increasing to 642 per mcf 2006 dollars in 2030 eia forecasts natural gas consumption growth to 244 trillion cubic feet tcf in 2015 declining to 234 tcf by 2030 most of this increased use and the drop come from growth then decline in natural gas for power generation eia forecasts the arrival crs12 of alaska natural gas to the lower48 via pipeline in 2020 with deliveries reaching 24 tcf per year by 2030 this is two year delay from eias 2007 forecast18 uncertainties eias forecast of gradual reductions in natural gas prices depends on certain assumptions embedded in the forecast these factors have uncertainty associated with them as discussed next weather weather affects natural gas consumption through both the significant space heating loads in the residential and commercial sectors and the cooling load served by gasfired power generation eia incorporates national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa weather forecasts in its short and long term forecasts to the extent that actual heating degree days exceed the temperature scenario from noaa that will tend to increase demand for natural gas in the relevant heating seasons and increase prices for natural gas during those periods similarly if the actual cooling degree day requirements exceed those incorporated in the eia scenario then this will increase natural gas use in the cooling season via increased gasfired power for air conditioning and increase the price for natural gas in the relevant cooling season oil prices natural gas prices and oil prices have long had correlation as the extent of oilgas fuel switching has declined this linkage has changed during 2007 as crude oil and petroleum product prices increased relative prices for natural gas became lower than the historical pattern in the recent past natural gas and oil product price competition tended to exhibit itself most clearly around the new york metropolitan area where there remained fair amount of fuel switching capability this fuel switching capability tended to keep natural gas prices at the new york citygate in range bounded on the high side by distillate fuel oil prices and on the low side by low sulfur residual fuel oil prices in 2007 the relevant natural gas prices tended to be below this range see figure 2 18 eia annual energy outlook 2008 p10 crs13 figure 2 comparison of natural gas and competing oil product prices source ferc division of market oversight office of enforcement oe energy market snapshot national version december 2007 data january 2008 p 23 the shift to outside this fuel price range suggests that the consumers had done all the fuel switching to natural gas that remained feasible then as oil prices moved above the relevant range gasongas competition could have become the market force determining the natural gas prices economy economic growth affects consumers demand for natural gas and their ability to purchase it eia appears to have incorporated an economic outlook for 2008 that expects less growth than in its recent forecasts given the relative stability in the residential and commercial sector demand any change in economic outlook would most likely affect industrial natural gas use most directly but it could also affect commodity prices and world oil prices recent developments since the end of 2007 several noteworthy developments have occurred in the natural gas markets eia reports natural gas price increases in 2008 for the 20072008 heating season novembermarch the average spot price at the wellhead increased more than 30 from the beginning to the end of heating season to 806 per million btu19 storage levels towards the end of the heating season dropped below five year averages in the first storage report after the 20072008 heating season working gas storage was at 1234 billion cubic feet 19 eia natural gas weekly april 10 2008 p 3 crs14 the lowest level since april 30 200420 this may indicate that slack in the supply side is decreasing the opening of the rockies express natural gas pipeline out of the rocky mountain production region appears to have relieved transmission congestion there this improved the net back price within the production area21 the wellhead price in the rockies area increased from 482 per million btu in november 2007 to 841 in march 200822 this improves the incentives for producers to find and develop new supplies in this area the natural gas pipeline from the north slope of alaska has made progress in january 2008 the governor of alaska announced that one of the pipeline project applications under the state alaska gasline inducement act agia was judged complete in april 2008 two of the north slope gas producers bp and conocophillips announced that they had joined together to start potentially competing effort the denali alaska gas pipeline which has an open season target date date when capacity will be offered to potential shippers of 2010 and an inservice target of 2018 stated by the producers as 10year target23 in early april the independence trail pipeline that serves the independence hub platform in the gulf of mexico was taken out of service for pipeline repairs that could take until midyear to complete independence hub produces almost 1 billion cubic feet per day roughly 10 of us gulf of mexico production in may the north american electric reliability corporation concluded the natural gas supply outlook for the summer of 2008 is healthy24 generally these developments indicate that the nations natural gas market is functioning in tune with fundamental supply and demand conditions 20 ibid p3 21 the net back price is the price producer receives based on the price at the enduse market minus the cost of transmission to that market 22 ibid p4 23 denali presentation april 8 2008 24 north american electric reliability corporation 2008 summer reliability assessment may 2008 p 12 crs15 conclusion despite the problems arising in some parts of the energy system natural gas fuel markets in north america have operated relatively well the smooth natural gas market situation of 2007 appears to have evolved into different tighter circumstances for 2008 if gasongas competition declines and natural gas prices shift back into competitive range with petroleum products this will intensify the adverse effects of high oil prices the decline in seasonal consumption swings primarily due to the increased use of gasforpower can improve the efficiency with which the nations natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure is used construction of new pipeline and storage infrastructure has continued to progress in way apparently consistent with supply and demand fundamentals finally lng infrastructure development also continues the low current capacity factors at the capitalintensive existing lng import facilities may indicate that the us lng purchasing power is not proving as competitive in the international lng market as project developers or those reviewing the projects had anticipated the location of lng facilities has an important effect on this potential competitiveness and this factor may require greater consideration for future projects how weather and the economy perform will play an important role in whether prices continue to increase or downward pressure develops for natural gas as commodity crs16 appendix table a1 selected natural gas market statistics prices mcf 2007 2006
