graduation completion and dropouts this repor t will provide background on high school graduation completion and dropout rates in the united states first it will discuss the nclba provisions related to the calcu lation and reporting of these indicators second the re port will present the latest data on high school outcomes the third section of the report will describe the federal programs designed to improve these outcomes and finally the report will discuss and analyze issues that may arise as congress considers the reauthorizati on of these programs and provisions federally mandated

standards must also include at least one additional academic indicator public schools and local educational agencies leas must meet statespecified levels on this indicator in order to make ayp in the case of high schools this dditional indicator must be the graduation rate the nclba defines the graduation rate as the percentage of students who graduate from secondary school with regular diploma in the standard number of years esea section 1111b2cvi the standard number of years is determined by each state and is generally based on the structure of schools usually three or four years the nclba does not require minimum graduation rate or that states increase their rate over time the law also does not require states to report graduation rates to the education departme nt ed it simply requires each state to place the statewide graduation rate on its report card to the general public5 title i impact assessment the nclba also charged the secretary of ed with assessing the impact of title i on stat districts schools and students esea title ie portion of this research is to be an independent study of assessments used for state accountability purposes and fo r making decisions about the promotion and graduation of students esea section 1503a th statute goes on to specify that the research should address the eff ect of assessment and accountability systems on among other things changes in the gr aduation rate the secretary was given authority to award contract to an independent research entity and not more than five years to complete the study6 dropout rate dropout

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33963crs4 7 us department of education dropout rates in the united states 2004 november 2006 8 ibidfor purposes of calculating an annual sc hool dropout rate under this subpart school shall use the annual event school dropout rate for students leaving school in single year determined in accordance with the national center for education statistics co mmon core of data ccd esea section 1829 the nces defines an event dropout rate as the percentage of students who were enrolled in grades 9 through 12 during given school year were not enrolled in school during the following school year nd had not earned high school diploma or completed state or dist rictapproved education program7 nces event dropout rate the nces calculates an event dropout rate in the following manner the denominator of the rate is the october 1 membership count for the grades for which the dropout rate is being calcula ted for example the dropout rate for grades 9 through 12 would use deno minator that equals the october 1 enrollment count for grades 9 through 12 the numerator dropouts is all individuals who were enrolled in school at some time during the previous school year were not enrolled on october 1 of the current school year have not graduated from high school or completed state or districtapproved edu cation program and do not meet any of the followi ng exclusionary conditions transferred to another public school district pr ivate school or state or districtapproved education pr ogram temporary absence due to suspension or schoolapproved ducation program or death8 it is important to note that this met hod does not include individuals outside of the public school system nor individua ls who may have dropped out during preceding school year for the 20012002 school year nces was able to calculate rates for 45 states and the district of co lumbia this is the most recent school year for which data have been made available five st ates did not follow the nces reporting rules that year consequently nc could not calculate national event dropout rate using the ccd cps completion rate education sciences reform act the education sciences reform act of 2002 esra reauthorized the nces and charged it with collecting compiling and disseminating statistics on secondary school completion among other data put simply the nces high school completion

diploma or equivalent credential including ged9 the nces high school completion rate differs from the title i graduation rate discussed above in three key respects unlike the title ia graduation rate the nces completion rate includes all those with high school credential that is whereas the graduation rate stipulated in the nclba includes only those obtaining regular diploma the high school completion rate includes those obtaining an equiva lency certification such as district or states ponsored general edu cational development ged certificate the nces completion rate is not restricted to those completing high school in standard number of years rather it is restricted to those in specific age group that is those 18 to 24 years old and is simply the proportion of the group who hold high school credential whereas the title ia graduation ra is tabulated by each state from districtreported administrativ data the nces completion rate is estimated using survey data from large nationally representative sample average freshman graduation rate in addition to the previously describe d high school outcomes required by the esea and esra nces has recently begun calculating fourth high sc hool indicator the average freshman graduation rate afgr similar to the title i graduation rate required by the nclba ayp provisions the afgr is an estimate of the percentage of public high school st udents who graduate on time with regular diploma in estimating the afgr nces uses statistical averaging to stabilize the denominator that is the number of rolled students according to nces the averaged freshman graduation rate provides an estimate of the percentage of high school students who graduate on time by dividing the number of graduates with regular diplomas by the size of the incoming freshman class 4 years earlier expressed as percent the rate uses aggregate student enrollment data to estimate the size of an incoming freshman class and aggregate counts of the number of diplomas awarded 4 years later the size of the incoming freshman class is estimated by summing the enrollment in eighth grade in one year ninth grade for the next year and tenth grade for the year after and then dividing by three10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33963crs6 10 continued 2006 11 ibidthe counts of enrollments by grade and graduates for the afgr are taken from the ccd subfile called the state nonfiscal survey of p ublic elementarysecondary education graduates include those students w ho are reported as diploma recipients and do not include ged recipients except in states that have inschool ged programs that lead to re gular diploma although enrollments are reported by grade some states report ungraded students nces adjusts for this by redistributing these students across grades in proportion to the graded enrollment of the state11 table 1 summarizes the four high school i ndicators described above each of these rates provides different perspec tive on high school outcomes and applies to different policy issues the title i graduation rate mandated by the nclba is intended to be part of rger school lea and state accountability system with statutory requirement that this indicator be reported to ed or congress this rate is mainly intended to shed light on school performance and enhance public notification on the state and local level the event dropout rate has histor ically been nces best attempt at producing national standard for meas uring high school outcomes although data reporting has impr oved in recent years this indicator continues to fall short of consistency and comp leteness the cps completion rate has long been the most straightforward consistent nationwide estimate of the nations educational attainment however it cannot and was never intended to be used for accountability purposes finally the average freshman graduation rate is the recent culmination of major undertaking by nces along with body of expert researchers to produce national estimate of high school completion like the c ps rate using data derived from the local level like the event dropout rate to produce an accountability friendly indicator like the title i rate

educational attainment as clearly seen in figure 1 the united states has achieved dramatic increase in secondary school particip ation since the beginning of the twentieth century according to the us census burea u in 1910 only 135 of the adult population had completed secondary school by midcentury onethird 343 of the population had completed 12 ears of school and by centurys end 841 of the adult population held high school diploma it is important to note that the completion rates displayed in figure 1 are not calculated in the same manner as the nces completion rate described in the previous section these historic rates differ from th nces rate in two critical ways first the rates in figure 1 prior to 1993 are for those completing 12 years of schooling rather than those obtaining high school diploma second the population base for the rates in figure 1 are those 25 years ol d and older as opposed to the nces rate which is based on the populati on between 18 and 24 years old source

from states to nces and should ed be required to disseminate these data to congress and the public in timely manner t h reporting of data appears to have improved as result of the nclb amendments

graduation rates32 several other groups have so advocated for more accurate reporting and better data quality33 ed and the aspen commission joined the national governors association in ca lling for data reporting on high school outcomes to be disaggregated by student subgroups similar to the ayp requirements since the strength of the esea account ability system depends on accurate data reporting congress may cons ider strengthening the requirements around reporting of high school outcomes program targeting are current programs well targeted in light of their objectives the data presented in this repor t indicate that for white nonhispanics high school attainment has b ecome nearly universal in th last two decades these data further suggest that perhaps the educational system is reaching something like ceiling effect making further prog ress toward 100 high school completion increasingly difficult at the same time th data in table 2 show that certain groups in the population still have way to go hi spanic immigrants have by far the lowest rates of high school completion but hispanic nonimmigrants and black non hispanics also have rates significantly lower than whites and asians

aspen institute washington dc february 2007clear that existing programs are optimally targeted to atrisk individuals in these groups some argue that our level of knowledge about the risk factors associated with dropping out could provide for much more precise targeting of the federal effort34 atrisk versus ou tofschool youth should the federal effort to encourage high school completion and preven t dropouts be divided between those at risk of dropping out and thos who have already dropped out some argue that dol programs should focus on those who have already left school and the ed programs should focus on retaining atrisk students who havent dropped out yet while this may seem to be logical prog rammatic organization others argue that this view of the dropout problem fails to reco gnize that youth do not cleanly move from being students to being dropouts an unde rlying issue pertains to whether one believes dropouts are more i ndicative of problems with the educational system or family and economic hardships the latter may be more difficult to address with discrete dropout programs unintended c onsequences of testing do nclba assessments and accountability provisions encourage students to drop out of school some argue that more frequent and early tes ting of students may cause some to avoid the shame and discouragement associated with poor perform ance such students may also be subtly encouraged to leave school by administrator s and teachers whose attention is focused on meeting ayp targets the aspen commission report calls attention to this problem and argues that schools must be held accountable for graduation rates as well as student achievement to avoid the problem of pushing out lowperforming students to raise assessment scores35 as mentioned earlier in this report the nclba required the secretary of ed to conduct national asse ssment of the title i programs and their impact on seas leas schools and students two preliminar reports have been released but neither have discussed the effect of assessments on dropouts congress may call for additional information on this issue as it considers amending the current esea assessment and accountability provisions
