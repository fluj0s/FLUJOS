impact of united states v booker brian t yeh and charles doyle american law division january 29 2008 abstract judges have long been critical of the automatic prison terms commonly referred to as mandatory minimum sentences which were enacted pursuant to the antidrug abuse act of 1986 in part to stem the drug trade now some judges are saying that with the combination of democratic leadership and the growing republican support for modest change this may provide the best chance in years for review of the system if the 110th congress revisits the sentencing laws which according to senate judiciary staï¬€ members is quite likelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33318 order code rl33318 sentencing levels for crack and powder cocaine kimbrough v united states and the impact of united states v

powder cocaine kimbrough v united states and the impact of united states v booker summary pursuant to the antidrug abuse ac t of 1986 congress established basic sentencing levels for crack cocaine offenses congress amended 21 usc 841 to provide for 1001 ratio in the quantities of powder cocaine and crack cocaine that trigger mandatory minimum penalty as amended 21 usc 841b1a establishes mandatory minimum 10year term of imprisonment and maximum life term of imprisonment for offenses involvi ng 5 kilograms of cocaine or 50 grams of cocaine base in addition 21 usc 841b1b establishes mandatory five year term of imprisonment for offenses involving 500 grams of cocaine or 5 grams of cocaine base federal sentencing guidelines established by the united states sentencing commission the guidelines reflect the st atutory distinctions until recently the guidelines were binding the judge had discretion to sentence defendant but only within the narrow sentencing range that the guidelines provided the supreme court in united states v booker declared that the guidelines must be considered advisory rather than mandatory in stead of being bound by the guidelines sentencing courts must treat the federa l guidelines as just one of number of sentencing factors set forth in 18 usc 3553a which include the need to avoid undue sentencing disparity since booker some courts ve concluded that although the guidelines treat 1 gram of crack like 100 grams of powder cocaine judge who does not believe that crack cocaine is 100 times worse than powder cocaine may now impose lower senten ce than the one recommended by the guidelines arguably at least so long as the sentence does not go below the mandatory minimum appellate courts that have ruled on the issue believe their discretion is more circumscribed in kimbrough v united states the supreme court addressed this issue and held that federal trial court may impose sentence below that called for under the guidelines 1001 ra tio based on its conclusion that the ratio is greater than necessary or ma foster unwarranted disparity the crackpowder disparity issue may be resolved either administratively or legislatively the us sentencing commission has recommended that congress adjust the statutory ratio and its most r ecent amendments to the guidelines eliminate the 1001 ratio for future sentencing guide line purposes except at the point at which the statutory mandatory minimums are tri ggered the sentencing commission has also decided to make these amendments retroactively applicable thus allowing eligible crack cocaine offenders who we re sentenced prior to november 1 2007 to petition federal judge to reduce their sent ences although these amendments alter the crackpowder disparity within the sentencing guidelines change to the statutory 1001 ratio found in 21 usc 841b1 woul d require legislati on several related bills have been introduced in the 110th congress including hr 79 hr 460 hr 4545 hr 4842

oncebinding federal sentencing guidelines the guidelines set by the united states sentencing commission are now only advisory3 until recently the guidelines refl ected statutory scheme that made crack cocaine defendants subject to the same sentence as those fendants trafficking in 100 times more powder cocaine thus th sentences for crack cocaine offenses were three to over six times longer than those for offenses involving equivalent amounts of powder cocaine4 since booker several courts ve addressed the question of whether the 1001 ratio produces disparities that justify sentence lower than that recommended by the guidelines the supreme court resolved that issue in kimbrough v united states by holding that federa l trial court may impose sentence below that called for under th guidelines 1001 ratio based on its conclusion that the ratio is greater than necessary or may foster unwarranted disparity5 the pre booker era for federal sentencing be gan with the sentencing reform act of 19846 which established sentencing system under the united states sentencing commissions federa l sentencing guidelines7 the previous system tailored sentences to the i ndividual defendants judges

discretion sentence defendant8 the sentence was supposed to be based on the defendants character as much as his conduct thereafter the discretion given to the j udge was passed on to the parole commission to determine how much of the judges sentence the defendant ultimately served9 under the guidelines the judges role at sentencing was more uniform and unvaried10 the judge could inquire into number of factors including the defendants conduct nd criminal history the judge then weighed each factor according to the sentencing commissions ma ndate and calculated an offense level for the defendant11 the judge had discretion to sentence the defendant but with little ground for departure only within th narrow sentencing range that the guidelines provided for each offense level12 the sentencing reform act also abolished the parole commissions role13 crack cocaine became prevalent in the mid1980s and received widespread media attention following the death of the university of maryland allamerican basketball player len bias from the use of cocaine14 crack cocaine was portrayed as violenceinducing highly addictive plague of inner c ities and this notoriety led to the quick passage of federal senten cing law concerning crack cocaine in 198615 this legislation created two mandatory sentencing ranges for drug offenses16 the lower bracket spanned periods of impri sonment ranging from mandatory minimum of 5 years to maximum of 40 years th higher bracket spanned periods ranging from mandatory minimum of 10 years to maximum of life17 congress prescribed the threshold quantities of both crack and powdered cocaine required to bring particular offense within either bracket18 despite the chemical identity of crack and powder cocaine congress set widely disparate threshold quantities for the two drugs requiring 100 times more powder cocaine than crack cocaine to trigger inclusion inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33318crs3 19 see id congress set the threshold quantities for the lower range at 500 grams of powder cocaine and 5 grams of cocaine base and the threshold quantities for the higher range at 5 kilograms and 50 grams respectively thus for sentencing purposes congress treated 1 unit of crack cocaine on the same level as 100 units of powder cocaine relative to the difference between crack and powder cocaine powder cocaine is derived from coca paste which is in turn derived from the leaves of the coca plant crack cocaine is made by taking cocaine powder and cooking it with baking soda and water until it forms hard substance these rocks can then be broken into pieces and sold in small quantities each gram of powder cocaine produces approximately 89 gram s of crack united states sentencing commission cocaine and federal sentencing policy may

spawned by drug users as well as the h ealth threats to infants born to addicted mothers20 the sentencing commission also incorporated this ratio into the drug guidelines although it later concluded that the 1001 powder to crack ratio produces sentences that are greater than necessa ry to satisfy the purposes of punishment because it exaggerates the relative harmfulness of crack cocaine the majority of crack offenders have low drug quantities low criminal histories and history of violence the sentencing commission also concluded that ratio providing for sentences that are greater than necessa ry creates an unwarranted disparity inappropriate uniformity racial disparity and disrespect for the law21 over the years congress has had sec ond thoughts about the disparity in drug sentences to achieve more equitable bala nce as part of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 congress enacted safety valve provision which provided an avenue for lowering mandatory minimum sentences in limited category of drug cases22 during the same year congress directed the sentencing commission to study the cracktopowder ratio and submit recommendations relative to whether the ratio should be retained or modified23 the sentencing commission recommended revision of the 1001 quantity ratio in 1995 finding the ratio to be unjustified by the small differences in the two forms of cocaine24 congress rejected the recommendation of the sentencing commission and did not change the law25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33318crs4 26 see us sentencing commission cocaine and

excessive27 it recommended that the 1001 ratio be reduced to 51 by increasing the threshold quantities for offenses involving crack cocaine nd decreasing the threshold quantities for offenses involving powder cocaine28 again congress took action and did not amend the law in 2001 the senate judiciary committee asked the sentencing commission to revisit its position regarding the 1001 ra tio and in the subsequent year the sentencing commission issued its third report29 in this report the commission again proposed narrowing the gap that separa ted crack cocaine offenses from powder cocaine because 1 the severe penalties fo r crack cocaine offenses seemed to fall mainly on lowlevel criminals and african americans 2 the dangers posed by crack could be satisfactorily addre ssed through sentencing enha ncements that would apply neutrally to all drug offenses and 3 r ecent data suggested that the penalties were disproportionate to the harms ssociated with the two drugs30 unlike the previous report the commission did not recomme nd reduction in the powder cocaine threshold the commission did recommend elimination of the fiveyear mandatory minimum for simple possession of crack

arrested fanfan when they discovered 125 kilograms of cocaine and 2816 grams of cocaine base in his vehicle46 jury in the district of maine found that he possessed 500 or more grams of cocaine with the intent to distribute in violation of 21 usc 846 at sentenci ng the court determined that fanfan was the ring leader of significant drug conspiracy which combined with his criminal history resulted in sentence of 188 to 235 months under the guidelines however four days before the june 28 2004 sentenci ng hearing the supreme court decided blakely v washington 47 holding that as part of state sentencing guideline system washington state judge could not find an aggravating fact authorizing higher sentence than the state statutes otherwise permitted the sentencing judge in fanfan considered the effect that blakely may have on the federal ntencing guidelines and recalculated the guidelines based only on the possession of 500 grams and imposed the 78 month maximum for that range the supreme court granted certiorari in booker and fanfan in an effort to give some guidance to lower courts that had begun variety of applications of the blakely decision to federal prisoners for example in booker the seventh circuit found that the federal sentencing guidelines violate the sixth amendment in some situations48 the fifth circuit on the other hand concluded that blakely did not apply to the guidelines because to do so would create separate offense for each possible sentence for particular crime49 the second circuit without resolving the issue certified questions to the supreme c ourt regarding the application of blakely to federal sentences pursuant to the guidelines50 the supreme court issued majority opinion in two parts the first part written by justice stevens for 54 majority justices scalia souter thomas and ginsburg decided that the guidelines violate the sixth am endment and are thus unconstitutional because they require j udge to increase sentence above the maximum guideline range if the judge finds facts to justify an increase they said defendants right to trial by jury is violated if judge must impose higher sentence than the sentence that the judg could have imposed based on the facts found by the jury51 pursuant to 18 usc 3553b the guidelines were mandatoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33318crs7 51 continued 63 to 78 months prior to booker the guidelines required judge to increase the sentence beyond that prescribed range if the judge f ound additional facts eg the presence of gun additional drug quantities or leadership role in the illegal activity each of these factual findings required new higher ntencing range the court said judge may not go over the sentence at the top of the guideline rang authorized by the jury in this case 78 months unless the jury finds the necessary facts for the higher range or the defendant admits to them 52 543 us at 221 apprendi held that other than the fact of prior conviction any fact that increases the penalty for crime bey ond the prescribed stat utory maximum must be submitted to jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt 530 us at 490 53 id at 244 54 id at 246247 55 id at 260 56 id at 234 57 the primary directive in section 3553a is for sentencing courts to impose sentence sufficient but not greater than necessary to co mply with the purposes set forth in paragraph continuedand thus create statutory maximum for the purpose of apprendi v new jersey 530 us 466 2000 which had c ondemned mandatory judicial factfinding for purposes of imposing sentence beyond the statutory maximum52 the court had applied apprendi s reasoning to state sentencing guideline system in blakely v washington and the rationale app lied with equal force to the federal guideline system in booker 53 under the then current administration of the guidelines judges rather than juries were required to find sentence determining facts and thus the practice was unconstitutional the second part written by justice breyer for different 54 majority justices rehnquist oconnor kennedy nd ginsburg remedies this defect by holding that the guidelines are advisory thereby making it necessary for the courts to consider the guidelines along with other traditional fact ors when deciding on sentence and also finding that the appellant courts may review sentences for reasonableness driven by the courts first holding it excises through severance and excision of two provisions 18 usc 3553b1 and 3742 from the sentencing reform act and declares the guidelines are now advisory54 pursuant to 3553a district judges need only to consider the guidelin range as one of many factors including the need for the sentence to provide just punishment for the offense 3553a2a to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct 3553a2b to protect the public from further crimes of the defe ndant 3553a2c and to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among similarly situated defendants 3553a 655 the sentencing reform act absent the mandate of 3553b1 authorizes the judge to apply his own perceptions of just punishment deterre nce and protection of the public even when these differ from the perceptions of the united states sentencing commission56 the sentencing reform act continues to provide for appeals from sentencing decisions regardless of whether the trial judge sentences are within or outside of the guideline rang based on an unreas onableness standard 18 usc 3553a57 and 3742e358httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33318crs8 57 continued 2 section 3553a2 states that such purpos are to reflect the seriousness

crack cocaine cases in view of the united states sentencing commissions conc lusions and recommendations the facts and circumstances of the case the history and characteristics of the defendant and the command of 18 usc 3553a26 to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparity typically the federa l courts follow threestep sentencing procedure in which they determine 1 the applicab advisory range under the sentencing guidelines 2 whether pursuant to the sentencing commissions policy statements any departures from the advisory guide line range clearly apply and 3 the appropriate sentence in light of the statutory factors to be considered in imposing sentence59 there is support for the view that the fe deral courts are not compelled to lower sentence recommended by the guidelines based on the

problem that has tormented enlightened observers ever si nce congress promulgated the 1001 ratio and shared the district courts concern about the fairness of maintaining the across theboard sentencing gap associated with the 1001 cracktopowder ratio63 but to recapitulate said the first circuit we hol d that the district court erred when it constructed new sentencing range based on the categorical substitution of 201 cracktopowder ratio for the 1001 embe dded in the sentencing guidelines64 panel in the fourth circuit agreed the principal question is whet her district court in the post booker
