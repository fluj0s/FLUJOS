international city lecture given on 24 march 1964 whats the date audience 24 march twentyfour march ad 14 well today im going to talk to you about something entirely different than ordinarily i talk to you about here at saint hill i want to talk to you about project having to do with world peace now you realize that communication is necessary to stop fights communication is also necessary to start fights what kind of communication is it well its generally communication thats little longer distance than can easily be understood and you take these massive terminals sitting around the world the worlds capitals various countries very distant from one another extremely distant very much protected about by their populations theyre quite distance apart and when they start talking to each other they dont talk very understandably and the distance between them has tendency to set up considerable amount of voltage theyre too far apart and they have to talk too loud and they have to shout too hard and after while they begin to figure that theyre mad at each other but it is technical fact that the distance they are apart brings about difficulty of communication which brings about an imperfect communication and theyre apparentlyin the leaders mindssufficiently far apart that they can destroy or strike at each other with impunity in other words one can shoot at moscow without wiping out washington one can shoot at washington without wiping out paris you see and they have the illusion then of security and that illusion of security actually longer exists because in any atomic conflict you have things called fallout and the drifting winds of space and you have other interesting things most of the atomic weapons designed for use today have killing elements put in them such as cobalt 60 and these tend to wipe out tremendous areas of countryside and the drifting fallout resulting from war even if its not terribly dangerous in test would be very very destructive to the nation who was declaring war well all of this brings about an interesting fact that these countries then are actually situated in such way that they have the illusion of being able to execute hostile actions against one another with impunity now none of these national governments are themselves able to operate broadly for the benefit of everyone but they are trying to go out beyond their own borders and influence other areas and these other areas are being influenced by yet another national government so they develop all sorts of brushfire wars and these little brushfire wars will probably keep on going theyll be more serious and less serious but man is killed just as dead in skirmish as he is in major battle and the activities going on now in southeast asia are an example of that here you have washington unable to strike directly at moscow moscow unable to strike directly at washington so they strike at each other in terms of smaller nationalism in southeast asia so you have small war going on there enturbulances going on there consistently and continually men getting killed just as dead as in any major conflict they have all sorts of odds and ends of battle and upset and diplomatic coups and influences of populations and you have bunch of people who really havent found out that you really cant be at war with one another with complete impunity and what theyre doing is bringing about dangerous environment that is actually the whole thing in ain sentence theyre still bringing about dangerous environment the citizen of the united states is being taxed to support fantastic armaments to point that it is utterly staggering hes workedthisthe washington government has worked itself into an economic solution by the manufacture of armaments i think some threequarters of the scientists and engineers in the united states now now work for the government and so forth pretty soon theres going to be nobody left to work for the people the stores are becoming more empty inflation is going up and the reason for inflation is shortage of goods whether or not you want to windowdress it in some other way inflation takes place in the presence of shortage of goods and deflation takes place in the presence of an overabundance of goods and thats about all you ever need to know about money if money wont buy things it inflates and if money will buy too much it deflates and although they tell you well theres plenty of products in the united states tremendous quantities of products in the united states nevertheless that currency is inflating so that currency has gone international in an effort to reach out and do things politically on political front and handle these situations with other capitals in other words theres too little goods in the world sitting under the united states dollar which is now the basic currency of the world the most frequent the most fluid currency of the world it isnt that theres too little goods in the united states get that theres too little goods everywhere now how does that come about well it comes about through lack of production theres too little production elsewhere people dont have the facilities to produce so if the people have facilities orto produce and if theyre being disturbed politically continuously you get an inflating state of affairs some fellow works very hard in his twenties and puts aside great deal of money and finds out that it will buy pair of shoelaces in his forties you see china is marvelous example the whole country was practically captured by inflation friend of mine in peking sent an airmail letter just before the iron curtain went down completely there were two letters about six months apart and the first letter had stamp on it an airmail stamp and its value had been overstamped on the stamp with rubber stamp so that the airmail stamp which should have cost thirtyfive cents or something of that sort cost about thirtyfive dollars and that was fine and few months later i received another airmail letter from him and it was quite interesting because that was the last one and the value of the stamp had been raised by the post office by overstamping so that the thirtyfive cent stamp was now worth something like seven million dollars now this brings about conditions of slavery more and less you eventually have to turn to communism and money because nobody can keep up with the inflation now russia today is busy starving its population its having wonderful time being the leading nation of the world in political freedom and it has never managed the problem of feeding its own people which is such bad advertisement that not long ago one of the quote new african states thats awful clich√©one of the new african states in conference duly assembled was sitting about giving their opinions on what political philosophy they should adopt and one of their leading lights stood up and said well whatever we adopt we must not adopt communism because it finds itself completely incapable of feeding its people well it took them few years but they finally found it out communism tries to tell us that this is political freedom but it isnt very much political freedom when nobody can receive reward for his labors and the communist worker of course is just on continuous strike if nobodys paying him and he cant have anything in return for his labors and so forth he just goes on strike i think most of their food comes from the oneacre peasant plots which they are permitted which the peasant is permitted to sell the produce of and i think thats all the food that russia has its quite interesting because theyve gone into tremendous reforms it isnt politicalit isnt lack of political cunning and it isnt lack of plans that has brought this about it really isnt too much in the field of political philosophy russia is having to support and maintain front line which is vastly extended into many other nations and has to support tremendous array of armaments which in fact with that many men under arms that many of her productive people held into the dedicated service of mars finds her rather incapable of doing anything mundane like making sure that the kids get enough milk to drink you see so we have the world at large in political turmoil of one kind or another and these national dedications to selfprotection to this to that the other thing theres tremendous emphasis today on politics and politics has entered very deeply into economics and it makes in effect rather unstable view in all directions its not very comfortable for the common citizen filling out forms forms forms it isnt very comfortable for the young man who just about the time he should learn to be mechanic or something useful and so forth has finger pointed at him we want you and he finds himself wearing blue or khaki or something of the sort and walking around place he doesnt want to be and for couple of years or so he has to go through this treadmill and he getsive talked to these kids and theyre just in complete apathy in their teens they dont plan their future in any way its quite interesting thethis thing but then again thats being in place you dont want to be that is not their decision and when you get condition where an individual is being forced to do things he doesnt want to do and being forced to be in place he doesnt want to be he degrades if theres any national degradation in progress in the united states it probablyit stems directly and exactly from the draft lawsconscription laws readiness for war readiness for war any one of these people would sit down and have chinchin with one another and settle their affairs and compare things its quite interesting that iowa farmers were quite capable of talking to russian farmers on their various trips and they were swapping notes as how you could best raise this and best raise that and getting all excited with each other because some of their practices were so barbaric and any time they met and talked to one another they found that they could be very friendly therefore it really isnt the individuals of the world that are having difficulty or are causing the dangerous environment which we find here on earth the individual would probably be able to work it out rather easily but impersonalized or depersonalized with gun in his hands or push button under his thumb he of course can go to war with other individuals hes never even been introduced to and we have nice system going here whereby the organizations of earth which cannot bleed which cannot suffer in actual fact which cannot feel are at war with one another all of which adds up to dangerous environment well this planet is going to blow itself into political unworkability or hot fission within the next decade or so unless somebody comes up with some workable idea which makes war difficult thing to wage and which sets aside these economic stresses which are such drain on the populations of earth its very interesting that such an objective would be possible this is pretty big plan this is pretty big think because there have been some big wits at work on this for some time in fact i think the first peace movements and so forth are probably discoverable in ancient egypt and lot of fellows have been thinking for long time on how you brought about peace but there has been longer think on this than mans think the left and right side of the bodylet show you some of the elementary actions on thisthe left and right side of the body might very easily be at war with one another you see theres two eyes and theres two ears and so on but what has happened there is the left side of the body is governed by the right side of the brain and the right side of the body is governed by the left side of the brain maybe you hadnt realized that but this wouldthis would make plan something like thisjust to show you theres feasibilities in these things you put washington in moscow and you put moscow in washington and let them govern their countries from that distance and of course their tendency to bomb each other out would be reduced to practically nothing now of course thats not practical solution but i have just given you little taste of the fact that even though its ludicrous solution it nevertheless can be stated that if that happened you see there then could be war you see how nice the muscovites would have to be to the people of the united states the people of that capital you can imagine the russian diplomat busy governing from the middle of the united states you know hed have to keep very good peace and personal relationships and understanding and so forth with the american people and vice versa you can see how the united states government would go about it thats very easy to see there would be three pressrelations men and publicrelations men you see for every political diplomat on the embassy and government staff see theyd handle that very very high pressure theyd make peace well you see right now theres vested interest whatsoever thats of course not the solution im forwarding but im just giving it to you you see it pays nobody now to advance the cause of peace nobody gets paid for it they only get paid for war general only gets promoted if he gets some more troops under him well how does he get some more troops under him well youd better rattle few more sabers you see and the congressman doesnt have influence unless hes appropriating fantastic sums of money and buying tanks and things like that then hes got lots of influence dont you see and everything is built up so as to go along that the more trouble there is the more importance the political figure has there was rule by woman queen down in romaniai think the name was marieand for long period of time she conducted very very peaceful government the country had more prosperity than itd had for hundreds of years and she got headlines only when she went over to the united states on visit actually that was one of the most productive governments that anybody had around for very long time they had prosperity during that particular period but she didnt have much publicity as great or very smart ruler apparently man deifies what causes trouble and itsamerican presidents who dont have war during their regime are hardly remembered in the textbooks at all you remember the war presidents those are the boys the war presidents but not the peace presidents see theyre something else you see and similarly things of that character are quite common so the amount of dissension is sort of an index of their win but the common citizen the boy whos got to keep things rolling and that sort of thing does not make his personal fortune or his life out of such chaos the popularity of such people as fdr great war president and so forth was borne out of the broken homes of practically everybody who fought world war ii see you get slaughter of the individual and his concerns the aggrandizement and few more stars on the shoulder of the political boss but you dont getyou dont get any forward progress for the individual therefore if man is to make any forward progress at all these conclusions and many others say that he will make his greatest progress in an atmosphere of peace the only thing that would make the government back up and knock off on income tax and so forth if it wasnt having any great demands on its treasury to build more tanks dont you see its quite interesting i have been in several countries which havent been at war for some time where other countries during the same period had been at war and it was just the length of time the country hadnt been at war that gave it an atmosphere of calm and things getting along all right you can notice this by going around and taking look at the world and youll find those countries which have most recently been at war or havent had time to go along are the most enturbulated and the citizen is the most upset and everybodys all nerved up about something or other now if you carried forward program then of international sanity the easiest program to carry forward on international sanity would be cessation of threats of the environment you would have to reduce the danger in the environment to make people saner if you wanted things to be better around then what you would do would be to reduce the amount of strife and dissonance in the communities and so on if you wanted the individuals of the world to draw saner breaths why you would give them less threat you would involve them less in the dangerous future because the individual who has future has tendency to act very oddly indeed now man is tied to the fact that he lives only once which is an interesting idea quite novel i dont know who invented it but it was invented by somebody but it gives him certain irresponsibility regarding any area he lives in and its very interesting to hear somebody in his fifties sixties saying well im after all out of my prime now and that sort of thing longer concerns and to see him again in his seventies with some dim inkling of the fact that hes got to come back and pick up body in this mess you seegetting very nervous about international affairs in his sixties you see he couldnt have cared less but in his seventies hes getting very nervous about all of this you know hes trying to solve the problem at subconscious level where do i go next where do i pick up body and so forth but in general man is practicing high level of irresponsibility with regard to his affairs because he thinks he only lives once and he thinks he will not inherit anything that he himself has started or abetted in chain fashion so you cant expect in actual fact broad public movement based on the idea that youre going to come back man wont buy this its asking him to take far too much responsibility broadly so you have to go into other fields now the problems that have to be solved in bringing about world peacean effective world peace program are then the importance of the politicianyouve got to salvage his importance or he wont buy ityouve got to furnish great deal of manufacturing and personal building and activity so as not to bring about aan immediate collapse of the economy which is all bolstered on war economy you see in other words theres got to be lot of construction theres got to be lot of things going on that require lots of money you see and that sort of thing andtheamongst the other problems that have to be solved is the shortening of the communication line between the capitals of the world and therefore bringing about greater understanding and then you have to curtail the individual initiative of various nations for the waging of war so that they longer have the right to knock the lid off just because theyre mad at somebody and you have to reduce the amount of danger in the environment while doing something dramatically constructive about it all these are just few of the problems that have to be solved and you have to offer them some attractive objective which is startling but which they wouldnt argue with too much you have to give them lots of things to build and lots of things to do and it has to be lot of trouble to bring all this about you see it has to be very complicated and with these various barriers you have to overcome the political objection and that sort of thing you have to have in such plan sufficient and adequate solution to the situation that war would cease and everybody would understand that it would cease in other words the solution to it has to be big enough to make the problem seem solvable well i put all this together originally as mental exercise and nothing more than that to see what would happen with ots this lecture is part of the class vi materials oddly enough because you answer this problem all the time some thetan says well now what could i do well let tell you what bunch of thetans shouldnt do they shouldnt go off in eighteen different directions each one banging the gong of his own dislikes thats production of chaos you see now one of the things one of the things that we have to remember is that we have base and that base is called earth and we dont want the base any more enturbulated than it has to be nor do we want the base to be so aware of what is happening to it or that it is being called base that itll be resentful of being one see these are very practical considerations also there are certain exercises which one should be able to do in order to improve his skill and so forth and they should not be of an hostile nature at least toward this planet now it takes lot of time to assemble body of technology it is resident in the individuals to whom it has been taught and who have experienced the long run with it and during its developmental period there isits communication lines its suitability to the area in which it is being generated all of these things are hardtowin assets and we have those assets so our interest our interest in peaceful earth is not only altruistic which it is because at one time in science of survival this was issued as target world without war without any slightest thought of first dynamic reward you see but each one of you now has first dynamic reward in view that is to say you have just the first dynamic reward in view not of money this has nothing to do with money it couldnt mean less its wonderful how we get picked on about money all the time i mean thats one of the least important commodities these fellows are missing the shot rather widely were not interested in money were only interested in the planet but we have vested interest completely aside from our altruistic motives which remember do exist we have vested interest in peaceful planet and the continuance of this planet because who knows this planet may go on being very peaceful for considerable period of time when other planets around about arent being so peaceful at all this is sort of forgotten backwash in the middle of nowhere see or at the far edge of nowhere not even in the middle of nowhere its rather minor sun minor planet out on the rim of galaxy rather lost horseshoe nail if you want to know the truth of it if you want to know what the exact situation of earth is you would not look at any such point as having great value but it does have the value of existing it does have the value of having had technology cultivated on it it does have the value of our understanding of it and it does have the value of course of not being immediately and instantly discernible as the center of anything now im not necessarily telling you they have vast widereaching plans that are going to wafwaf and then we are going toand so forth these are merely the practical considerations practical considerations of what happens once you recognize which direction you are going youre fool not to recognize the ramifications of what you are doing and realize that you have to take some responsibility for the effect its going to have around and about well its going to have an effect on this planet its going to have an effect on the surrounding areas here without even going space opera about it and all thats very vague purposely so andbut i think you understand we need then peaceful planet so i worked this out originally as what projectwas it possible for bunch of thetans to consistently hammer and pound along the way at certain objective or project that would bring about something constructive and its notit doesnt have much to do with international peace you see its just could they go ahead and so forth and was it possible to direct their own energies toward such goal and i worked it out worked it out that it was possible for this to happen without too much coordination and planning and the name of the activity in the exercise originally was not what it is now but became an internationalinternational city international city thats what became the name of the project international city project well i studied this for quite while was there anything one could do about destimulating the planet and consolidating the circumstances of war and so forth and finally came to the conclusion that if all the capitals of the world were located inside one city that they were not likely to bomb each other out that they in effect would be very careful of declaring war they would be close cheek by jowl enough to discuss most of their problems they would have great difficulties of interchange you wouldnt have vast whiplash of going to moscow and the ambassador there talking to somebody there you wouldnt also have the illusion of security involved with the distance itd be matter of driving couple of blocks you see to see the head of the other state youd be meeting him at dinner parties all the time and everybody knows that its nice to keep an atmosphere so that you have socially acceptable personality and that sort of thing and that might as well be introduced to international affairs you very seldom see blokes like this declaring war on each other across banquet table you see but they sure get awful loud and very discourteous you see few thousand miles apart so if these capitals ceased to be located on the native soil of the countries they governed and became located all of them within one perimeter the bombing of that capital would become rather remote possibility particularly if you never let people who seemed to be angry at each other leave the capital at the same time now this gives them new problem it gives them the problem of the long communication line to their country and gives communication line that might possibly wind up entirely and completely in new capital in their country well of course that mustnt happen so the communication line may only go to centers of states within the nation so that you have nation and then say that it is composed of states or counties so the communication line does not go from international city to another city inside the country and then go outyou see communication relay center that doesnt exist im afraid the message from international city would have to go directly to helena montana not via washington and there might very well be an assembly or legislature of that state another one would have to go to sacramento another one would have to go to houston or san antonio you see so youd get ayou get communication line from international city to each county or state head without any relay point in it now they would be the first ones to insist there was relay point once they got theeven though they arent processed and theyre pretty stupidthey would recognize they were setting themselves up for marvelous fall on their head if they put central communication center because it would simply become second capital and therefore control point by which the country could be wrested from their control in international city with the greatest of ease so their best prevention of revolution of course would never have second capital form inside their nation that their messages went immediately and directly to the governors who are the heads of states who were under their control this would bethey would insist on this which gives you the most fantastic communication network anybody ever heard of thats lot of building with that now look at the amount of building in international city just look at the amount of structure involved here and we find out that duplication of the mall in washington complete alongside of duplication of red square complete all of it fanned outeven drew this out in sketches exactly how this would work you see their suburbs stream out behind them you see in each one of these things you make these things stand in fan and you have fannedout city which is going out with tremendous transport and underground and so forth theres enough undergrounds in there to go around in circles and out to the furthest reaches of the suburbs so that you get any place in it but itd make rather large town now you take every capital of the world and treat it accordingly and then treat it in such way that transport within the capital is very fast and so that each and every section and center of the capital has some of its own atmosphere rather easily planned up by the way it isnt just sprawling mess whereyouby have bunch of capitals sitting side by side and they are very definitely worked in such way that everybodyd be quite happy with it all and theyre all built around central capital of its own which is very bombproof built under mountain artificial mountain which you could never destroy this would throw everybody into apathy and bunker of huge proportions and that of course would be an international parliament of earth which then had certain powers and so forth over various nations not unlike the united nations today but with different composition more britishamerican type of composition so that you dont get four or five favored nations who can overthrow everything else and you dont get unequal stuff so that theres some country that has twenty people in its population and it has member in the united nations who has as much say you see as somebody who has billion population i mean thats the way theyve got it rigged now but you get an equalization of population well you have to figure out how can you get very equalized population you have to invent new method in the united nations that you would put together you have to get brandnew method of representation you have to represent by the square mile and the person in formula in other words how much square mileage is this person representing and how much population and these two are put together in formula and that country has that many representatives in the united nations you see which is rather fair and then of course youd run some kind of twohouse system and so on well of course these fellows would love to be right up against every capital that they were dealing with these fellows that were elected to the united nations and that sort of thing if they were up against every capital they were dealing with they wouldnt have great difficulties and big misunderstandings and if all of these nations that had their capitals there work cheek by jowl with the assembly which was doing all this i dont think theyd get into too much trouble either thered be enough politicking going on it would be sufficiently involved to please almost anybody particularly if it was based on good sound system so wendell willkie came out with something he called one world and practically everybody shot him down in his tracks he was pioneer in this particular field but nevertheless this idea has become more and more popular and its actually sweeping in that direction and youll find out that togetherness is the watchword of all movements on earth its togetherness more togetherness so soundly technically speaking just scientological technical aspects of it proposal like this is far more acceptable than you would readily believe because it says immediately togetherness you see lets put them all together see well anybody can understand that see and they think thats good idea now what does thiswhat does this immediately entail in the way of propaganda or action or something of that sort well thats hardly even important as long as some of the elementary steps are taken why the rest might very well follow through rather easily and youd have to take program by these steps the first step would have to be youd have to persuade all governments to turn over all atomic weapons stocks control of atomic manufacturers to the united nations at once you see second step is persuade the united nations and all governments to select site for and construct an international city preferably in north africa on the mediterranean coast where land reclamation can expand its area and where its communication lines can be easily centered for earth third step persuade all governments to remove their capitals to international city complete with heads of government congresses and parliaments prohibit secondary capital or even communication relay center within the country itself fourth step is secure communication lines and command lines from each countrys head of government in international city to the government of each internal county or state in that country and regard each county or state within country as an autonomous unit under the control of the head of nation in international city the fifth step would be to bring about recomposition of the united nations basing its memberdelegates on formula comprised of land valueland area and value production and construction value and population figures more complicated formula i just gave you the most important one is what i gave you but you could even make more complicated formula for representation which had to do with its potential construction and production values as nation remove all special privilege categories for favored nations and the exercise of veto by few and form the united nations into judiciary division two houses an executive branch the key officials to be popularly elected or selected within the nations they represent and by voting by both upper and lower united nations houses for the head of the united nations and reform the united nations charter into an instrument specifically engaged in governing the heads of nations and international affairs and forbid in the charter all interference with individuals or smaller communities sixth step would be forbid treaties of mutual assistancewarlike assistance seventh bring about the creation of small effective armed force for the united nations dismantling or abolishment of all other war facilities well naturally if they were the only ones that got atomic bombs then their main police action would be devoted to whether or not anybody else was manufacturing atomic bombs and they just make sure that that wouldnt happen and they wouldnt makerequire tremendous force involved in it persuade stable and real international economic measures in other words do something to keep money in balance like the world international bank that tries to keep the lid on persuade the united nations and national governments that the activities of the united nations and national governments should be limited to and then we limit what national government should be up to and we go ahead with this plan and it has all been written up here in considerable detail which willwe go ahead with this plan on the basis on the basis that such general agreement amongst scientologists would push what efforts an individual was engaged in into coordinated activity so that it would count and here is big plan that is sufficiently sloppy with central executive you see sufficientand when i say sloppy i meani mean thatits aits plan which is centralized and it could be done very sloppily youd still get someplace you see theres great damage would result if it went far awry dont you see so if everybody was moving more or less in that direction youd have some possibility of the attainment of the final objective furthermore its sufficiently interesting plan i think you will agree that it would cause lot of conversation and i frankly dont think anybody else is doing anything for world peace at all so that gives it peculiar lonely individuality but its good conversation piece its good thing to talk about its good thing to speculate about good thing to figure on and it gives cohesive action to what might be great many individual actions if youre going to persuade some head of state in some particular line to do something or other theres many things which you could think of im sure but if you were in position to do that and any one of you were in position to do that in different areas or parts and you were all insisting on one objective itd be very likely to take place you see without any creation of chaos at all youd have situation here ofwell everybody sort of is insisting that this happen and if there was any persuasion being used why you wanted to know how to line up ones efforts with anybody elses efforts well if youve got plan of this particular character your own imagination can fill in an awful lot of blanks and details and you still wouldnt go awry and the plan still wouldnt be wrecked thats the basic virtue of this plan the possibility of its effectiveness the fact that something like this should be done are compared to another datum is thiswould there be any feasibility in it ever happening at all you would be surprised how many ideas that aof scientology have materialized in the world in the last few years its interesting they very often get warped and twisted around in numerous ways but its very peculiar how often this can occur how often these things have been actually adopted so heres plan an international objective is the name of the plan at large and the plan itself is the international city which merely says government of earth now what does scientologist get out of this well on its original release of course the plan doesnt pay too much attention to what scientologist would do or not do or how you would get out of it or what he would get out of it or something like that but let assure you if the scientologist was instrumental in bringing about what amounts to complete political revolution of this planet henobody would be sitting around wondering what he would get out of it its inevitable its inevitable if anybody starts getting into agreement with this plan all you have to do is just keep the word scientology parked someplace around the fringes of the plan and youll get all sorts of credit in this particular direction so theres good dissemination in this line and then of course having brought it about you eventually would find that they wouldnt want psychiatrists in international city they have political use and we could slip that one in you wouldnt want any psychiatrist there you see because you could seeyou could kidnap the head of another nation and brainwash him this has got to be calm weve got to have trustworthy people in charge of that branch of things and about all i would ask would simply be monopoly on all mental healing done inside the boundaries of international city i think that would be about the end product of it now now youve got these people together where maybe you could put some shoes on them see if youif you had the popularity of having pushed this plan across people would listen people would listen to you as scientologist and if you kept saying well you shouldnt have badbad healing facilities and so forth in international city you see and it shouldnt be all messed up that sort of thing and we ought to be taking care at least of that branch of things why im not now talking about doing any coercion or influence of any kind whatsoever political figures are always falling on their heads and their wives are always having snits and fits in very very short order if you merely were pushing on this particular point why theyd all swear by you theyd say oh well theyd start listening to you and the next thing you know why theyre all members of pe course and you got the planet but that point we wont go into in the original releases its nothing hidden it simply makes it somewhat incredible the point is the main virtue that it has the main virtue that it hasit is doing something and is proposing something where there is at the moment notably complete void i havent heard world peace plan for literally ages those that have existed have all folded up this is something nobodys thinking about this is long gone and that one emerged on the stage of the world which had any idea of workability or talkability that in itself has some value it gives coordinated direction and one of the targets and objectives im sure of every one of you is you wished to god that things would calm down and wouldnt be blowing its head off every fifteen seconds and the environments dangerousness would just subside just little bit so you could get on with your business well this is of course one method of bringing about on an international level now you notice im not particularly trying to sell you this plan im merely informing you of the plan informing you of what value it might have now there are otherundoubtedly there are liabilities to such plan undoubtedly there are liabilities to such plan but i dont think the liabilities are such that they outweigh the values of the plan you say well some bloke could come along and make himself dictator of earth in this particular fashion here is everybody all sitting there together ready to be gunned down and so forth well i dont know pretty hard to do today pretty hard to do communication lines and so forth we had bloke tried it fellow named hitler not too long ago and he didnt make it and nobodys made this target recently in fact nobodys ever really made it yes its true that it puts all the political control of earth in one particular area but it also puts into that area an awful lot of wily guys see these guys are of different nature than what you might expect of just legislators coming to capital dont you see they arethey have their own vested interest they want to walk their own way through all this they wantthey see that they cannot attain their objectives by war and man will always try to attain an objective so if they cant attain their political objectives by war they will try to attain them by diplomacy and they would welcome the proximity of other capitals and large legislature to lobby in and that sort of thing and theyre not about to give this up into dictatorship they would not even think in that particular direction theyd never cooperate with one thats what that amounts to now another liability is this might leave countries wideopen towideopen to revolt or revolution or something of this sort or they might revolt against their internationally located government which is quite absent and things might be very upset in that particular direction well i think thati think that that possibility would be equally apparent to the head of every state in international city and i think it would tend to govern in such way that it wouldnt happen absentee government has not recently been posing too much of problem britain for instance has real trouble and has had real trouble governing absently unless she was so distracted or longer cared and what people think about the british empire and its particular breakup seldom take into effect well maybe they got tired of the wogs you see and that i think is the real explanation for it i think they just got tired of it when you recognize that one small rock down in thethe caribbean and so forth drains directly out of the british treasury every year about million and half pounds just to pay for its government and it furnishes nothing back to anybody for anything after while fellow even tax collector whos sweating to get the money in says well why should we be spending million and half pounds so that island down there can have its own government and what use is it the truth of the matter is when you had sailing ships outflung and farflung bases were of great use but when you can get three hundred marines there in transport planes in matter of few hours there is need of that base so its an archaic method of control and its been dropped i dont think that thisi dont think this would bring about any vast upset you say well that government of course would maintain standing army of some kind or another yes yes itd maintain standing army of some kind or another they always do probably maintain bodyguard within international city well that puts quite few troops in international city of very dissonant lots and that sort of thing yeah that also puts quitethat also puts quite force of control under international city government well theres solution to the overthrow of the capital by force by putting the political control of the capital out from underneath the united nations so that the political control of international city should consistently be independent of any government it merely has to do with the safety and security of the individuals inside the boundaries of international city and that would be their end product that would be everything that they would be interested in and they would have sufficient force there to do that and that force would have to be sufficient to outnumber any even summedup bodyguards inside the city in other words the political control of international city ought to be itself well how do you keep it itself well you make it terribly profitable see you dont make it political you make it profitable so how do you finance international city well you finance it originally in such way that it itself becomes property which becomes very profitable to some people we dont care anything about who these people are we only care that they consider it profitable see to have international city and that they go on having international city and that they consider it governmental responsibility because its profitable now the russian would scream over that logic but theres where he falls on his head all the time the way to have calm international city is to make sure that the ownership of the land and property of the international city brings in money to small group who sit as council in international city and make sure that things remain nice and peaceful and profitable just cut the whole thing sideways from political control whatsoever you figure out then that theres member of the international city government member of that government had nothing to do with nation has nothing to do with the united nations he has only to do with the physical construction and property of the international city well you hold out this sort of bait to some construction company that after it built its buildings its going to draw rent on these buildings from here on out and that member of that construction company is going to sit on the governing board of that city with government over its head and all it has to do is sit there and keep the peace in international city you have then whipped the government of international city sideways from underneath the political ramifications of otherwise and you put very hard core of very hardheaded guys who want to make awful sure that they keep dragging down the rent you see from the white house and this is profitable and you make it profitable and you make it rather terrific to have seat you see on that council that governs international city and its not governed by the united nations now that splits up political control so much it puts another interest into the area which upsets of course any effort to upset international city now these boys would always be eager beaver theyve already got troops havent they theyve got lots of troops they got police of one kind or another who are used to dealing with the citizens of this city where they always would have their ear to the ground making sure nobody got assassinated making sure that parades got interrupted making sure that there were demonstrations messing up their buildings see making sure that there was sudden coup going to take place and overset their this and that and they would sit there and keep the thing on an even keel in other words it would only be to one persons interest if you want to see lousy capital take look at capital which is owned by the government governments take very bad care of the capitals do you know that the washington monument sat i dont know for how many years some disgraceful number of years as blocks of stone out in the middle of little meadow because of by private subscription was being put together one way or the other and the government wouldnt help them out and it just sat there it just sat there blocks of stone scattered around and somebody finally put it together after i dont know how many years twenty or thirty if you want to look at capital which is having hard time its capital that only depends totally on thea government for its maintenance and which is of great profit to anybody and the governments come and the governments go and nobody really takes care of the place so the way to get international city built of course is to hold out the persuasive fact that those who build international city govern international city as part of the international city council they do not govern earth but they govern international city and you all of sudden throw the main capital of earth in the western world which is construction capital immediately and directly behind the project with crash now somebody is going to have to operate and act as clearinghouse somebodys going to have to operate as clearinghouse as to who is member of that council and that is not particularly provided for and wed probably get forced into it sooner or later somebodyd take the bit in his teeth the way i figured and so forth wed be perfectly happy to operate or act as central which exchanged information concerning international city the books and pamphlets and wrote letters about it and that sort of thing but thats about the extent of our direct interest in it of our direct public interest in it thats the extent of it something to be interested in something to bring about world peace and that sort of thing now on the other side of the fence you consider this training ground for the budding ot and it becomes very fruitful its nice school exercise and its all very very constructive and he doesntisnt left standing around with his hands in his exengrams wondering what he should do with himself the upshot of the thing is then that there isthis was my conclusion on the originalthat it was possible to put together piece of planning which had some possibility of bringing about world peace that was the first thing that i was assembling on this that it was possible to do this my next conclusion was that it wasnt being done my next conclusion was that togetherness was the main forward dynamic thrust of most of these societies and that thenthat this then formed also way of exercising the talents of people in scientology and it seemed to that it became feasibility but more important perhaps even than this it holds forth bit of hope that there is something can be done about it i think people have gotten to point where they have recognition that anything could be done about it at all and it holds bit of hope forward in that particular direction now it gives the scientologist something else it gives him town it gives him an area of interest and town that could be put together and straightened up it gives piece of planet into their hands matter how mythical it is at the moment theres tremendous amount of desert down there i havent been down and taken look around there recently but somewhere between carthageill come up to present time excuse metunis andmodern name tripolialong this line of coast and so forth theres tremendous amount of back country old communication lines have also gone into there its time immemorial this place has been operative it was knocked around pretty badly in world war ii but theres possibilities open up of tremendous scope so that youre not building on top of aor around an already existing situation that looks to like fairly good view but of course itive merely picked the oldest natural communication lines of the planet and they went into that particular zone and area and looking overlooking over apossibilities feasibilities and that sort of thing i saw that therea lot of scientologists might be able to have some fun with it one way or the other they might be able to do something and i wasnt thinking now in terms of ots i was just thinking of somebody or other he knows somebody in the construction business you know and why he can get him all smoked up like mad you see so on withvery legitimately so you see because in actual fact it creates fantastic amount of new wealth see theres new wealth created when you start to take large area of the world thats completely arid and throw it into usable state and you get lot of fellows interested in putting construction together on the spot and harbor facilities and this that and the other and airfields and buildings and wawap and more and wow you know its creation of wealth and then you start figuring out your communication lines and that sort of thing and where they all go and the remodernization of various county and state capitals in england here they practically had to build another half dozen you know because its gotten very centralized heres stuff going up in all directions you see heres busyness you can get awfully involved you see in project like this you can go beat the drum on something or other now of course you say well it doesnt have too much to do with scientology yes it has great deal to do with scientology since its simply broad fourth dynamic method of dedangerizing the environment thats as process you justyoure just pushing in that direction now if youre merely saying something could be done about it because feasible plan does exist youve actually made the environment less dangerous so it is method of making the environment less dangerous it is fourth dynamic process technically it is method of achieving eventually dissemination to the heads of nations in one small area all at once and now ill give you another little secret with regard to this we have had some trouble with governments recently and i think theyve been insolent theyve been disrespectful and ive looked this over carefully and ive decided that we shouldnt stand for it now the waythe way you really upset government is to move its capital now if you are saying that you have in your power the ability to move all capitals of earth you have raised your comparable magnitude to the governments of earth from government of earth you see this is the little odd piece of magic back of it the fact that you are talking about moving all the capitals of earth at your discretion to new situation depowers all of those capitals with regard to scientology and i think they ought to be taught lesson and that is the innocent threat that is posed back of all that you see terminal has its force in power of being able to maintain and hold its position you destroy this in government by merely saying that it would be good thing to do this makes them very very weak and tottery as far as youre concerned and i think everybody would agree that itd be very good thing to do and i even think governments themselves would agree that it would be very good thing to do and therein lies very interesting little piece of magic because it upgrades at once the power and magnitude of scientology simply that they would say well all the governments ought to move down to international city see and that leaves those governments with odd feeling not knowing our technology they would not be able to explain it but they have been threatened with inability to hold their position theynow of course they dont even kind of want to hold their position because they dont even come up scale to point of realizing thats very important but it is very important it is very important and i frankly dont think youd have anywhere near as much trouble with them if you were espousing such plan i think youd have far less trouble with them theyd feel shaky talking to you because theyd feel they couldnt hold their position while confronting you theyd feel theyre kind of slipping off to north africa already this is not trickery this is just technology put to good use twoterminal situation all right theyre holding their terminal lines stretched out so as to hold the whole world in threat well lets just spoil the power to do so by shifting those terminals or proposing to shift those terminals now i will write lot of oh not lot of stuff but i will write some more on this well put this together into pamphlet of some kind or another its been written in actual fact for some time and i was just waiting until i had class vi pretty well settled and we will put this into bit of pamphlet that can be distributed around and maybe ill write up some more material on it if i get around to it this is quite interesting as itself but i should imagine there should be better agreement on this its very funny thing is although people will have lot of different opinions if we hold to central agreement line and so forth they will eventually accept the central agreement line this if it takes care of most objections would then come about as the materialized plan even though lot of people were trying to change it dont you see and it looks to it looks to like it is an interesting answer it is nothing where somebody would take off the week he was going to give an intensive in dont you see and spend that whole week pounding the desk about it or something like this but it would certainly be something that would be interesting to do over the weekend dont you see or something like this you know and its interesting to mention and hand out to pe courses and they might not be able to understand how theyre thinking but they might be able to understand that you could have an international government of one kind or another now somebodys going to ask scientologists well who is back of this who is back of this and the only thing you want to tell them well just we are you see or ron is i dont care what you say you see but therefrankly there is moneyed group or moneyed individual of any kind back of this you see there is nobody back of this but theres huge vacuum provided here that would pick up such people and put them into it only remember theyre not now in back of it theyre in it see so we in actual fact are in back of it but we are not being paid in any way shape or form to beat the drum one way or the other we merely figure itd be very good for the population of earth if they were just little less restimulated and it wasoriginally took place of is it possible to do anything about earth would it be possible for an ot to agree upon some project or another agree on some project that he might possibly care to push toward and would there be some constructive project which putmade life little easier for one and all and so forth these were the considerations which motivated this all very mild considerations i think something of this sort depends for its power upon interest i remember when i first wrote this up it was lying there very quietly minding its own business and i had really last seen it on my desk over to the side in huge pile of papers of one kind or another and itthats where id last seen it and here was dear joan standing there in the middle of the carpet in my office saying can i run this please in the next issue i thought isnt that interesting it has disappeared out of my desk and its mysteriously about to be printed as the british certainty because of course shes the editor of british certainty you see and it struck as though it must be considered somewhat interesting project because its been quite while since anybody stole an article out from underneath pile of paper but has moreit has more force or vastness to us than that its almost an incidental fourth dynamic project if you can have any fun with it why by all means do so and i will see that its distributed to you the mimeograph ofthe mimeograph writeup of the whole thing giving all sorts of odd points and so forth with regard to international city and its formation and what it should be about and ill see that those get handed out to you in the next day or so it all depends on whether or not they have stock of them in mimeo but anyway i wanted to talk to you about it because very often it occurs to you well were powering up individuals pretty heavily here this is getting more and more so and youll find that people around might also become uneasy what do these people mean to do we already have one scientologist up in theup in the north of england up here whos so horrified at the idea of making some ots he said the atom bomb would be far more preferable atom bomb would be far preferable to making some ots thatd be absolute chaos and disaster yeah very interesting point of view you see but they get these oddthey get these odd lines so what do these people intend all right if theyre bringing off anything of this sort or if something spectacular is happening what do these people intend what are their intentions toward this planet i think its nice thing to have some sort of plan sitting there that explains that your intentions are basically good roads and good weather and then if you have some time even give it little push and it seems to like thats sensible way of going about it well what do you think of the project all right thank you thank you very much
