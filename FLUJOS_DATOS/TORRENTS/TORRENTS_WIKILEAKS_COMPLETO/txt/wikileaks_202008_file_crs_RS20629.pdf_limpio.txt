sted in employer matching contributions to such plans in more than 5 years if the employer uses cliff vesting and in more than 7 years if the employer uses graded vesting egtrra accelerates these scheduleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20629crs4 so that employees will be fully vested in employer matching contributions in maximum of 3 years under cliff vesting and in mo re than 6 years under graded vesting the law directed the secret ary of the treasury to update the life expectancy tables on which required minimum distributions are based as directed treasury published the new tables in 2002 the law provides that distributions from section 457 plan made pursuant to qualified domestic relations order qdro ar to be made under the same tax rules that apply to distributions from taxqualified plans as the result of qdro in addition section 457 plan that makes payments to an alternate payee is not to be treated as violating the restrictions on distributions from such plans if such payments were made under qdro the law also repeals th special minimum distribution rules that previously applied to section 457 plans nd makes these plans subject to the minimum distribution rules applicable to 401k plans previously employees were prohibited from making employee contributions and elective contributions for 12 m onths after preretirement h ardship distributions made to satisfy immediate financial needs egtrra reduces this period to 6 months hardship distributions are not to be tr eated as eligible rollover distributions increasing portability for participants the law allows eligible distributions from taxqualified pension pl ans 401k plans 403b annuities iras and 457 deferred compensation plans to be rolled over into any other such plan or arrangement the rules for tax withholding applicable to rollovers from qualified plans have been extended to distributions from 457 plans employee aftertax cont ributions can now be rolled over into another qualified plan or traditional ira in the case of rollover from qualified plan to another qualified plan the rollover is permitted only through direct rollover surviving spouses may roll ove r distributions to qualified plan 403b annuity or 457 plan in which the spouse par ticipates the law allows the secretary of the treasury to waive the 60day rollover period if the failure to waive such requirement would be against equity or good conscience provided that certain requireme nts are satisfied defined contribution plan to which benefits are transferred will not be treated as reducing participants accr ued benefit if it does not provide all of the forms of distribution that previously were available to the participant in addition the secretary has been directed to sp ecify the circumstances under which early retirement benefits subsid ies or optional form s of benefit may be reduced or eliminated without the rights of participants being materially affected previously distributions from 401k plans 403b annuities and 457 plans generally could occur without penalty only upon separation from service under the particular plan paration from service occurs only with the participants death retirement resignation or discharge egt rra modifies the distri bution restrictions to provide that distribution may occur upon severance from employment with the plan sponsor including separation that occur as the result of merger or acquisition this effectively has repealed the socalled same desk rule which pr ohibited preretirement distributions to employees whose employer rges with or is acquired by another firm if the employee continues to work at the same job egtrra provides that participant in state or local governmental plan is not required to include in gross income direct trusteetotrustee transfer to governmentalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20629crs5 defined benefit plan from 4 03b annuity or 457 plan if the transferred amount is used to purchase permissive service cr edits under the plan or to repay certain contributions under current law lumpsum distribution of accrued retirement benefits can be paid to departing employee without the em ployees consent provided that the present value of the accrued benefit does not ex ceed 5000 the participants written consent is required for such distributions if the value of the distribu tion exceeds this amount egtrra allows plan sponsor to disregard benefits attributable to rollover contributions for purposes determining whether lumps um distribution will be greater than 5000 in the case of involuntary dist ributions of 1000 or more th law makes direct rollover to an ira the required method of distributi on unless the participant directs otherwise strengthening pension secu rity and enforcement under prior law the full funding limit for tax qualified plans was 150 of the plans accrued liability egtrra raised this limit to 165 of current liability for plan years beginning in 2002 and to 170 for plan years beginning in 2003 the currentliability fullfunding limit has been repealed for plan years beginning in 2004 and thereafter the special rule allowing deduction for unfunded current liability gene rally has been exte nded to all defined benefit pension plans covered by the pension benefit gu aranty corporation pbgc in determining the amount of pens ion contributions that are not deductible an employer is permitted to disregard contributions to defined benefit plan except to the extent that they exceed the accruedliability fullfunding limit if an employer so elects contributions in excess of the currentliability fullfunding limit are not subject to the excise tax on nondeductible contributions because pension benefits unde r multiemployer plans are generally based on factors other than compensation such as flat benefit per month of service the limits on benefits provided for under 415 of the tax code can resu lt in significant benefit reductions for workers who are covered by these plans and whose compensation varies from year to year egtrra eliminates the cap on benefits equal to 100 of compensation for multiemployer plans and provides that multiemployer plans are not to be aggregated with single employer plans for purposes of applying the 100of compensation cap to those plans the law also clarifies the method of determining the tax year to which an employer contribution to multiemployer plan is attributable section 1534b of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 prohibits the sponsor of 401k plans from requiring part of an employees elective deferrals to be invested in the employers securities or pr operty egtrra clar ifies that 1534b does not apply if these assets were acquired as the result of defe rrals made before 1999 the law also requires an excise tax to be levi ed on an employee stock ownership plan esop engaging in prohibited transactions with disqualified individuals deemed to be substantial shareholders of the corporation sponsoring the plan egtrra requires the sponsors of defined benefit plans to notify plan participants in advance of any amendment that would significantly reduce the rate of future benefit accruals such reductions in accrual rate s sometimes occur for example when traditional pension is converted to cash balance plan plan amendment that reduces or eliminates an early retirement benefit or retirementtype subsidy will be considered as reducing the rate of benefit accrual the notice must include sufficient information tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20629crs6 allow participants to understand the effect of the amendment an excise tax will be levied against the plan sponsor if the required tice is not provided the secretary of the treasury is authorized to allow simplified fo rms of notification or to exempt from the notification requirement plans with fewer than 100 participants and plans that allow participants to choose between the old and ne w plan benefit formul as the secretary is required to report to congress on the effect of cash balance convers ions on participants pension benefits with special reference to periods during which new benefits are accrued socalled wearaway periods reducing regulatory burdens defined benefit plan with assets equal to at least 125 of current liability is per mitted to use valuation date within the prior plan year an employer is entitled to deduct dividends that at the election of plan participants or their beneficiaries are paid to the plan and reinvested in employer securities the special definition of highl compensated employee under the tax reform act of 1986 has been repealed the law directs the treasury department to revise its regu lations under 410b to provide that if certain requi rements are satisfied employees of taxexempt charitable organization who are eligible to make salary reduction cont ributions under 403b annuity may be excluded for purposes of sting 401k plan for nondiscrimination in favor of highly compensated employees qua lified retirement planni ng services provided to an employee and his or her spouse by an employer maintaining qualified plan generally can be excluded from employee income under prior law elective deferrals under 401k plan were tested for discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees by means of the actual deferral percentage test adp test and the actual contribution percentage test acp test under certain circumstances the treasury department could subject plans elective deferrals employer matching contributions and aftertax employee contributions to an additional nondiscrimin ation test called the multiple use test egtrra repeals the multiple use test tax treatment of electing alaska native settlement trusts in order to encourage alaska native settlement
