international council for science and the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization over 120 mixed publicprivate national delegations will discuss controversial issues and will be asked to support framework for action that focuses on doing more ethical and relevant science rectifying gaps between developed and developing countries relating to the conduct of research technology transfer ownership of intellectual property rights including indigenous biological resources and compen sation for brain drain and implementing followup by unesco the national academy of sciences has proposed private interacademy center for international scientific advice the u s delegation is unlikely to support programs that require new funds or that conflict with us policies this report addresses issues relevant to formulating us science policy and programs for developing nations it will be updated after the conference background the world conference on science wcs science for the 21st centurya new commitment will be held from june 26july 1 1999 in budapest hungary cosponsored by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco and the international council for science icsu nongovernmental organization composed of 95 national science councils or academies formerly called the international council of scientific unions the official goal of wcs is to analyze where the natural sciences stand today and where they are heading what their social impact has been and what society expects from them finally it will establish what efforts should be invested to make science advance in response to these expectations and to the challenges posed by human and social development1 it will seek to establish new international guidelines for science policy and new social contract for science an unofficial and probably more realistic goal is to foster better networking and exchange 1 first announcement world conference on science science

scientists and policymakers as will be discussed below wcs discussions are likely to involve some controversial issues including calls for more public input into decisions about science priorities and applications proposals for international agencies to fund more indigenous traditional as opposed to modern research and development rd in some developing nations2 creation of regional partnerships for cooperation with southern or developing country scientists3 indigenous ownership of intellectual property rights ipr and of biological resources more equitable ethics for research and for technology transfer and compensation for brain drain the policy context relevant to the outcome of the wcs includes failure to implement many recommendations of the 1979 united nations conference on science and technology st us withdrawal from unesco us arrears on dues payments to the and us caution about multilateral st development assistance the wcs will include plenary and panel sessions and is expected to draw between 2000 to 3000 attendees including 120 official national delegations4 and others representing educational and research establishments scientists the industrial sector intergovernmental organizations nongovernmental organizations the media and the general public attendance is by invitation dr neal lane assistant to the president for science and technology will head the us delegation

international meeting on st the conference on science technology for development uncstd was held in 1979 in vienna with mixed results it recommended establishing large fund to support st projects in developing countries this never occurred and accorded with us policy not to contribute to fund but to use the and its agencies to play broker role bringing together potential projects in developing countries with sources of financing and technology in the developed world including the private sector8 also left unresolved was the issue of code of conduct for technology transfer between developed and developing countries among the more successful followup activities to uncstd was creation of intergovernmental committee on science and technology for development whose projects were administered by the development program undp through technical agencies such as the fao and through the world bank unesco and the private sector in 1992 the intergovernmental committee was replaced by commission on science and technology for development as part of the economic and social council planning and agenda the scientific community has played significant role in wcs planning in 1997 unesco set up 509member international scientific advisory board including the president of icsu to give working scientists greater say in planned reform of the way the agency supports science and to help prepare the agenda 7 for instance physicists have proposed creation of an impartial international bodyundereither the or unesco to adjudicate damaging disputes involving scientific issues ranging from cold fusion to informational issues david dickson physics workshop calls for new contract with society nature april 15 1999 there have been preparatory meetings by the leadership for environment and

for the year 1985 157 crs4 for world science conference9 in december 1997 to dispel uncertainty about the value of theconference meeting was convened at the initiative of the us national research council and involving senior representatives from dozen american science ngos and foreign embassiesin washington dc to hear the unesco assistantdirectorgeneral for science and the president of icsu10 also the american association for the advancement of science aaas was asked to participate in wcs planning11 unesco press papers say the wcs will discuss and be invited to approve two documentsthe draft world declaration on science and the use of scientific knowledge and the detailed draft framework for action that will embody the new commitment that the conference calls for as well as its implementation these documents incorporate the views of background report prepared by icsu12 these three documents are available on the internet they reflect the complex notions that st should be supported because of their benefits to society but that science is facing difficulties of confidence and investment as well as problems of an ethical nature and that scientists from the developing nations have less access to science than those from the developed nations13 some of the sponsors views may be inconsistent with prevailing views in most industrialized nations and with us national interests for example some would disagree with the categorical statements in unesco press release 9966 that says that while scientific progress has promoted development the general public is alarmed at both the rate and the direction of progress the aftereffects of the chernobyl accident and new developments in genetic engineeringwhether cloning sheep and cattle or breeding transgenic pigs to provide organs for transplantation to man or creating new strains of food cropraise fears of mad scientists fiddling dangerously with nature the press release also says that the wcs will challenge the industrialized countries to find solutions to complex issues such as climate change and adequate food energy and water resources and to do so without ignoring the twothirds of humanity that lack the financial technical and human resourcesand perhaps the political commitmentto contribute reportedly unesco is also interested in persuading the general assembly to declare the first decade of the millennium as decade for science14 the declaration addresses four main principles that underlie science in the 21st century in paraphrase 9 declan butler the s in unesco seeks out new role nature january 23 1997 286 10 not just another general conference look to the future americans for the universality of unesco 14 february 1998 10 unescos directorgeneral who reportedly originally conceived the idea for conference made it clear that the conference will not simply be an opportunity to review the great scientific advances of the century but rather an occasion to promote the commitment of decision makers in the public and private sectors to strengthening scientific research and to increasing public awareness to the accomplishments and dangers of scientific advancement ibid 11 philip w

decade for science nature may 6 1999 crs5 1 sustained public funding of science for knowledge and use of knowledge for progress 2 science for peace involving research accountability worldwide cooperation use of st to address the causes of conflict including disregard for human rights that lead to poverty insufficient protection of minorities interethnic tension inadequate education hunger and environmental degradation 3 using science for development while protecting the environment and protecting ipr 4 conducting and using science in society and science for society by establishing code of ethics for scientific professions and recognizing equality in access to science as an ethical requirement and necessary to realize the full potential of scientific communities15 the framework for action which emphasizes forming partnerships has three sections in paraphrase 1 the new context of science and society in the 21st centurywith an end to the cold war but reduction in st funding while inequalities of all kinds have increased public uneasiness with some scientific progress and the needs to share knowledge build new relationships among scientists and between scientists and users of science and involve the public in setting priorities and using science 2 the new commitment for 83 specific initiatives to produce scientific knowledge apply science and use science for peace and development 3 establishing unesco followup to review progress in implementing wcs initiatives16 likely to be discussed at the wcs is the us national academy of sciences proposal to create an interacademy center modeled on the us national research council that would assemble international expert panels to advise the and the world bank on st related issues this expands upon the collaboration in the interacademy panel on international issues an informal information exchange network of 80 national science academies that will meet in may 200017 attention may be given to the proposed request to unesco from the british science museumbritish association for the advancement of science to establish an international center for the communication of science for journalists broadcasters and exhibition organizers from developing countries18 some controversial issues there are obstacles to meeting the goals in the wcs documents and scientists and policymakers from both developed and developing countries have criticized wcs expectations19 for instance sir robert may britains chief scientist and delegate to the wcs said it was an extremely important event but he challenged it to produce more than pious platitudes and to agree on appropriately realistic and practical achievements20 there are diverse perceptions about topics to be discussed there is the conflict between allocating funds for longterm basic research and more applicationsoriented research related to the wcs emphasis on requiring science to respond more to social and environmental concerns there will be controversy about 15 unescoicsu the world declaration on science press release 16 unescoicsu science agendaframework for action press release 17 worldly scientists science april

some countries are giving new spin to this issue declaring their ownership and share in the profits of research that uses biological resources and genetic materials within their national boundariesin conflict with the interests of international agribusiness companies22 others seek ipr rewards for indigenous knowledge that predated but was used in the scientific revolution there is the issue raised in the unesco world commission on the ethics of scientific knowledge and technology report about the developing countries inability to purchase information technologywidening the gap between those who have and do not have scientific knowledge23 other issues include compensating developing countries for their loss of trained scientists and technicians to the more developed countries 24 deciding whether english or indigenous languages should be used to conduct science the merits of southsouth as opposed to northsouth cooperation25 the legality of us embargoes on technology transfer to terrorist states as discussed in the arab states preparatory meeting and the need for scientists to adopt pledgecommitting themselves to high ethical standards rigorous quality control communication with the public and sharing their knowledge26 the united states is still formulating its official position on the wcs declaration and framework for action27 the nature of us followup to the wcs is uncertain for several reasons the united states withdrew from unesco in 198428 but participates in selected unesco programs deemed in the us national interest there is debate over whether the united states should rejoin unesco29 in addition the united states currently owes the more than 1 billion for its assessed contributions to the regular budget and peacekeeping accounts congress has linked funding for these arrears to reforms it expects the to carry out also congress has limited the total us funds available for contributions to all international organizations making us return to unesco unlikely in the immediate future since us contribution to the unesco regular budget would have to come from the same limited state department appropriations account for international organizations tensions could intensify if the wcs generates expectations for action but funding principal donors are likely to insist that any followup mechanism be funded through existing resources 21 science by
