12958 decl 01222020 tags prel pgov mass marr af pk ir iz is am subject secretary gates turkey bilateral visit scenesetter classified by ambassador james f jeffrey reasons 14 abd 1 s pm erdogan welcomed president obamas reiteration of support to the fight against the pkk during the december 7 meeting in the oval office but the secretary should expect questions about how we will operationalize that commitment as plans to withdraw from iraq move forward key issue will be how to reduce the gap between the time when the us is longer able to provide isr support and when we will be able to help turkey acquire its own capability on missile defense we will look for the secretarys help in advancing our work with turkey to persuade the turks to allow key radar system to be based here the turks are struggling to define what they will need in terms of nato political cover to lessen the high cost both in terms of domestic politics and in relations with iran that erdogans government believes it will have to pay should they agree 2 s although our agenda with turkey is broad and complex the following issues are likely to come up during the secretarys trip need to raise our commitment to continue sharing realtime intelligence to support turkeys counterpkk fight but caution that the process for turkey to acquire an armed uav system from the us will be long and complex 35 14 the need for nato bmd system with turkeys participation and the iranian threat against nato interests 69 appreciation for turkeys efforts on afghanistanpakistan particularly for its new commitments to training security forces 1011 appreciation for support to oifoef through turkeys territory including the incirlik cargo hub easing transit of nonlethal mil cargo shipments from iraq to afghanistan 12 our advocacy support for raytheon and sikorsky on sales of air defense systems and utility helicopters 13 be ready to respond on pressure for direct us milops against the pkk paras 5 turkish requests for 247 predator coverage of the turkeyiraq border to counter pkk operations and activities 5 turkish requests for immediate delivery of ah1w helicopters 15 counter pkk operations still turkeys top priority 3 c turkeys counterterrorist efforts against the pkk have evolved in the past year and have expanded beyond military action alone although the governments renamed national unity project initially called the kurdish opening was not fully developed when launched and appears to be moving slowly the government has increased social and economic support to ethnic kurds in southeast turkey dramatically broadened the rights of kurds to use their own language and increased educational opportunities as well it is posts view that the military success against the pkk supported by our intelligencesharing operation has given the civilians the political space to explore this opening and to deal directly with masoud barzani and other iraqi kurds turkish military operations against the pkk continue however and on october 6 2009 parliament extended the governments mandate to conduct crossborder operations against the pkk in iraq for another year turkeys leaders have learned from us and from their own experience that only wholeofgovernment approach will succeed against the pkk insurgency 4 c our november 2007 decision to share operational intelligence was turning point for the bilateral relationship and president obamas declaration before the turkish parliament in april 2009 and during his oval office meeting with erdogan in december 2009 of our continuing commitment to support turkeys fight against the pkk were warmly welcomed our cooperation has helped to improve the bilateral relationship across the board particularly by making it difficult for pkk terrorists to use northern iraq as safe haven we can never reiterate enough our continuing committment as president obama did effectively with pm erdogan in december 5 c nevertheless turkish causalities are still occurring turkey still looks for more support and will press us for more concrete action before the us completes its withdrawal from iraq chod basbug will likely repeat the gots request for laserdesignation of targets andor direct us operations against the pkk in december pm erdogan also asked potus for 24hour predator coverage at present we provide approximately 12hour coverage with an occasional surge to 24 hours to support specific turkish operations such as against high value targets move to 24hour coverage is not easy due to resources requirements elsewhere however we may be able to provide few weeks of 24hour coverage during crucial spring months and are working with tgs to determine exactly where and when it would be most useful to do so and what assets the turkish military would employ if additional uav support is made available missile defense 6 s the turks asked us to postpone return visit from ellen tauscher undersecretary of state for arms control and international security as they are still considering how best to respond to our request to base an antpy2 and potentially other md assets in turkey while some of the turks technical questions remain unanswered the key questions are now political during his meeting with president obama pm erdogan said that such system must be implemented in nato context to diminish the political cost that his government will likely bear both in terms of domestic politics and in turkeys relations with iran the ball is now in the court of the civilian leaders here to determine just how much nato will be enough for them politically natos inability to fund an interim capability makes it harder for us to show parallel development of nato bmd system with paa erdogan is concerned that turkeys participation might later give israel protection from an iranian counterstrike 7 s we have made the point to the turks that decision to not base the antpy2 radar in turkey is essentially decision to opt out of missile defense coverage for turkey this would not be political consequence but just fact based on physics and geometry it is important to make this point again gently with pm erdogan but also underscore that we value turkeys participation and will try to natoize the system if turkey will tell us how much nato would be enough 8 s behind all this we fear is manifestation of both the turkish governments and to some degree the turkish publics growing distancing from the atlanticist world view now that most dangers for turkey are gone while turks are not naive about iran see below md places them in pickle forcing them to choose between the uswest and middle east vocation which while not necessarily includes coddling iran requires palpable space between turkey and the west iran 9 s turkey understands and partially shares us and international concerns about irans nuclear ambitions but is hesitant to use harsh language in public statements in part due to its dependence on iran as an energy supplier and as trade route to central asian markets it has worked quietly with us to prevent some proliferationsensitive shipments to and from iran turkeys top civilian and military officials may have come to the conclusion that military strike against iran would be more harmful for turkeys interests than iran gaining nuclear weapons capability they believe international pressure against iran only helps to strengthen ahmadinejad and the hardliners pm erdogan himself is particularly vocal skeptic of the us position however turkey did press iran albeit quietly to accept the p5 plus 1 tehran research reactor trr offer and fm davutoglu had been personally engaged in trying to rescue the trr deal which would have removed significant portion of irans lowlyenriched uranium stockpile as current member of the unsc the turks would be very hesitant to support sanctions against iran we need nevertheless to encourage pm erdogan to support actions if iran does not comply with irans international obligations while underscoring that we view irans program as serious threat to nato interests in europe and would like to see nonmilitary solution including turkish participation in nato bmd afghanistanpakistan 10 sbu turkey has been dedicated partner in afghanistan it has commanded isaf twice since its inception and again took command of rccapital in november turkey leads prt wardak and plans to open second prt in jawzjan also covering sarepol in mid2010 turkey has sponsored the ankara process dialogue one of several efforts to encourage constructive communications between kabul and islamabad and is leading participant in the friends of democratic pakistan it hosted trilateral summit on january 25 and afghanistan regional summit including all of afghanistans immediate neighbors as well as select other countries including the us on january 26 just prior to the january 28 london conference on afghanistan 11 c turkey pledged significant aid to both countries usd 200 million to afghanistan and usd 100 million to pakistan as well as usd 15 million to the ana there are 1750 turkish troops in afghanistan and turkey has four omlts currently in kabul and since december pledged two more omlts and one pomlt because of its culture history and religious orientation as well as foreign minister davutoglus strategic ambition turkey is well disposed to act as an agent of the international communitys goals in afghanistan and pakistan in 2010 turkey has pledged to offer 68 week trainings for up to brigades worth of afghan military and police personnel in turkey and will establish training center in kabul capable of training up to 600 ansa personnel at time retrograde through turkey 12 s turkeys agreement to allow us to use its territory facilities and airspace has been essential to our ability to support operations in iraq and afghanistan we now look to expand current capabilities to transit materiel from iraq to join up with the northern distribution network ndn to afghanistan centcom logisticians working with us and our eucom office of defense cooperation seek to take advantage of improved commercial ties between turkey and iraq to move nonlethal equipment across turkey to join the ndn we are working to expand our current retrograde agreements to minimize the time and bureaucracy involved and to expand permissions to allow nonlethal military equipment including armored transport vehicles advocacy for us defense industry 13 c we much appreciate secdefs help in advocating for us firms competing for key projects in turkey and hope he can raise both sikorskys and raytheons cases in person sikorskys international blackhawk proposal holds remarkable benefits this deal represents new level of industrial partnership sikorsky guarantees that it would build in turkey for sale outside of turkey one blackhawk for each one the got builds and buys for itself this is boon of hundreds of millions of dollars for the turkish economy on air defense raytheons pac3 is competing in tender for turkeys air defense raytheon also seeks to take advantage of turkish industrys ability to coproduce complex systems with us and would produce systems for sale in the uae and elsewhere the benefit to turkeys economy from such coproduction would likely exceed usd 1 billion technically and operationally there is system which can compete with the pac3 but turkeys defense ministry seeks to broaden competition to include lowercost options from russia and even from european producers raytheon often asks us to remind the turks that decision on requests for support on missile defense should not necessarily affect decision on pac3 uavs attack helicopters and intel surge 14 c turkey seeks to acquire on an urgent basis its own isr capability to replace the us assets currently being used in antipkk operations president obama told pm erdogan in december that we support turkeys request to acquire armed reaper uavs nevertheless approval for armed reapers is complicated due to hill concerns we have explained this to the turks however even if those could be overcome the delivery pipeline for these systems is long and turkeys leaders have sought reassurance that we will not pull our intelligence support until they can replace it while we are working to enhance turkeys isr capabilities we have not made this commitment to date 15 c bad got procurement decisions led turkey to severe shortage of dual engine high altitude attack helicopters which it desperately needs to fight the pkk pm erdogan raised this issue with the president in december 2009 secdef should expect this issue to be top priority in meetings with minister gonul and with gen basbug the turks took secdefs may 2009 letter to provide up to four ah1w helicopters each in 2011 2012 and 2013 as firm commitment and now have asked us to advance that date to 2010 they do not accept our explanation that these aircraft are simply not available from our inventory as they believe they have just like the us troops in contact and need the close tactical support while secdef should make commitment we should also explore whether we can persuade taiwan to sell or lease some of its own ah1w aircraft now that taiwan is taking delivery of apaches support for the usturkeyiraq tripartite security dialogue 16 s secdefs visit will take place just as usfis gen odierno will have left we expect that gen odiernos visit will give political boost to the usturkeyiraq tripartite security talks turkeys civilian leaders are taking heat from their domestic political opposition for pressing the kurdish opening while casualties from pkk attacks continue they hope to use gen odiernos visit to show that their wholeofgovernment approach against pkk insurgency is producing results and that it has the support of senior usg officials in iraq 17 s trilateral meetings continue regularly and new tripartite operational office in erbil established to share counterpkk intelligence was established over the summer the most recent trilat meeting took place in baghdad in december followed by joint turkeyiraq visit in erbil the turks remain frustrated that in their view the krg is not doing enough to combat the pkk the turks remain shy in sharing intelligence data they are not convinced that they can trust iraqikurdish individuals to keep information concerning operations secret turkish officials have become more strident in their calls for krg officials to take action against the pkk the cooperation that does exist is step in the right direction however it will need to improve significantly prior to the us pullout of iraq chod basbug and pm ergodan want the us to put more pressure on the iraqis and particularly masoud barzani to take actions to cut pkk supply and logistics lines in northern iraq we should stress the need for more trust and collaboration between turkey and iraq eventually on turkish cbos absent greater cooperation we could see significant bilateral problems post2011 to include iraqi claims of turkeys violation of its sovereign territory northern iraq 18 c turkey will not consider any alternative to the political unity and territorial integrity of iraq but has become more flexible on how it engages the local authorities of northern iraq how turkey refers officially to the kurdish regional government krg turkeys policy remains focused on the government in baghdad but its outreach to the krg is expanding this outreach is reinforced by the continued dominance of turkish products and investments in the krgs healthy economy armenia 19 s the signing of the protocols to reestablish turkisharmenian relations and open the common border in zurich on october 10 was landmark for the region however neither turkey nor armenia have taken steps toward ratification the got argues that progress toward withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijani provinces surrounding nagornokarabakh is precondition note this was notnot part of the agreement and not position the us supports end note future relations will nevertheless still be heavily linked to the 1915 armenian genocide issue any us determination of the events of 1915 as genocide would set off political firestorm in turkey and the effect on our bilateral relationship including political military and commercial aspects would be devastating israel 20 c while the foreign ministry and the turkish general staff agree with us that strong turkeyisrael relationship is essential for regional stability pm erdogan has sought to shore up his domestic right flank through continued populist rhetoric against israel and its december 2008 gaza operation his outburst at davos and the lastminute cancellation of israels participation in the fall 2009 anatolian eagle exercise multilateral air force exercise which had us turkey italy and israel as planned participants were the most noticeable examples of this rhetoric which we and his staff have sought to contain the latest incident snub in early january of the turkish ambassador by israeli deputy foreign minster danny ayalon almost caused the got to both recall its ambassador and cancel the visit of israeli defense minister ehud barak however the very public row was resolved with an israeli apology and baraks visit on january 17 helped to stem the downward spiral for now nevertheless we assess that erdogan is likely to continue antiisrael remarks and the issues will continue to cast shadow on the tuis bilateral relationship political environment 21 c pm erdogans islamistleaning justice and development ak party remains turkeys strongest political party but its poll numbers are slumping and it continues to fear an erosion of its political base from more conservativeislamist parties civilianmilitary relations remain complex chief of staff general basbug has worked out modus vivendi with pm erdogan but the longrunning struggle between turkeys secularists with the army as its champion and islamists represented by the government naturally puts them at odds erdogan has the clear upper hand fact with which basbug has seemingly learned to live alleged past military involvement in coup contingency planning or even deliberate generation of internal chaos remains political theme number one and preoccupies both erdogan and basbug and their respective underlings public trust in the military is starting to decline the result of several very public ongoing investigations into the alleged planning against the government jeffrey visit
