subject shsbc 40 date 22 mar 2000 165348 0000 from shsbcfzbaorg organization mail2newsnymaliasnet newsgroups altclearingtechnologyaltreligionscientology question and answer period goals search lecture given on 9 august 1961 thank you i was late because i thought mary sue probably had something to say to you good excuse isnt it this is well for while she was talking to you but then i guess i interrupted her too punctually you see and now that im late she isnt talking to you what what ball this is the 9th 9 aug 11 okay saint hill special briefing course and here we go you know all there is to know there isnt anything i can possibly tell you now what questions do you have female voice i have one good was ist female voice its about running havingness if the pcs needle is question about running havingness okay female voice yes the pcs needle is uhm uhm fairly loose so that it drops off the bottom of the pcs needle very loose dropping off the bottom of the needle meter okay go on female voice yes at the beginning of the session beginning of session female voice and it doesnt drop so much at the end of the session though its still more than thirdofadial drop mmhm female voice would you say his havingness had gone gotten worsened oh yes it is very loose at the beginning of session toward the end of session it is not so loose and the question is does this indicate that the pcs havingness has dropped yes it also indicates of course that the pc has run into some ridges or has gotten tangled up in the bank in some fashion or another and of course all ridges are canthaves all valences are canthaves all wild and confused postulates are canthaves and anything that is hanging fire with the pc is canthave so any time your pc gets stuck on the track the first phenomenon you encounter is loss of havingness and the phenomenon of havingness is registry well i guess its the primary registry and secondary apparent registry is that the pc is stuck in lot of ridges or hes stuck on the track or he is messed up in the middle of some problems or confusions or something of this sort and it appears to be of course that the track the ridge the difficulty he is in would be the cause for the tightening of the needle and basically the cause for the tightening of the needle is the fact that he is losing havingness or this is series of things of lost havingness you see pc grips things to his bosom in anxiety to have when his ideas about havingness drop you see that is the first manifestation probably if you didnt have the slightest notion concerning the remotest possibility that under some stretch of the imagination you could have nothing now you untangle that it just amounts to the fact that you would not take any steps to possess anything unless you had some inkling that there might be none of it or it might be difficult for you to get it you see now this difficulty of getting it does bring about this phenomenon of personal possession so what you really see happening is that the individual runs through bunch of bank and track all of which tells him he cant have when he thinks of canthave he pulls it in on himself and you get tightening of the needle female voice so any tightening even if it was so loose that it dropped out the bottom its still very loose its still very loose but slightly less so its drop of havingness you can tighten the pcs needle you could tighten it from total looseness to almost total stick with sensitivity 16 by phonying up piece of news for him concerning loss this isnt laboratory test basically you look at it humanitarianly and its cruel thing to do but if you suddenly convince him that he had just lost did you hear about the national provincial bank suddenly going broke you see or something of this sort and all of its depositors and the governments refusing to make any of the deposits good you know something like this and he had all his money in the national provincial bank just before and just afterwards youd see sudden wham youd get tightening of the needle so any news of loss would bring about tightening of the needle and therefore it could be stated that bank is substitute for the composite losses of the person not necessarily the reactive bank im talking about all of his the standard banks you see and any picture that he has and so forth for instance why do you still have picture of the battle of actium if you do have well you obviously havent got the battle of actium youve got picture of the battle of actium so the losses of things are substituted for by mental masses and these mental masses electronically bring about tightening of the needle im overstressing this point now its pretty obvious what happens but your question is very well put does that answer it female voice yes all right okay what other question do we have another female voice ive got one yup female voice supposing you have run one goals list and its all nulled out and you supposing youve run one goals list and its all nulled out okay female voice yes and youve had sensitivity say at 20 and youre not getting very good reads when you start new goals list and you start the assessment by elimination can you raise the sensitivity so as to get better reads oh and when you start new goals list female voice yes and you want to get better reads on your second goals list and your sensitivity was 2 and you want to do different job leave that sensitivity right where it is for thirdofadial drop or as near as you can get to thirdofadial drop you cant have pc you know who doesnt get thirdofadial drop at sensitivity 16 if youre going to do goals assessment by elimination you do not keep increasing the sensitivity matter what list you are working on and so on you just do it all on thirdofadial drop otherwise youre knocking out far far far more than you need to knock out in doing goals elimination and its going to take you fifteen times as long in order to do it in other words you dont increase your sensitivity doing goals elimination or terminals elimination at any time whether its one list or two lists or for goal or for list of goals or anything else never increase it always thirdofadial drop female voice like that yeah second female voice shes well all right second female voice she has case that you cant hardly couldnt hardly read the needle on them anyway you know and its normally at 1 sensitivity but on assessment well do you get thirdofadial drop female voice get twothirds get it off the bottom on 1 normally but when you start assessing theres practically reads youre getting reads all right youre not getting any goals female voice thats true thats easy im not trying to dismiss the question the question is quite well taken thats very intelligent question but you say that you have pc and you just get practically read at all even though he does get big drop you get read on the goals and you want to increase the sensitivity in order to get reads on the goals nah youre trying to make goals do that you havent got female voice yeah okay you havent got this persons goals thats all follow the same rationale okay female voice right thanks all right theres something else about goals there that i noticed going along you say first list and second list actually you know i never get first list and second list i work on list that i add to and its sort of revolving squirrel cage you know i just keep putting down every time i get to the end of the list of goals i shake them keep shaking them down for more goals at the end of this list and the list just accumulates and that doesnt even mean that ive gotten rid of all the goals on that first list see i actually got listing of 163 goals and i started going down this goals list and 60 of the goals are still alive and just by the fact that i reached the bottom of the list i start asking for new goals you see i dont wait until i got them all gone before i find some more i try to keep the list cumulative and its quite interesting itd work faster that way now i dont know whether youre doing it that way or not but im just telling you right now okay male voice ron question in theory here what makes the goal the final goal that you get persist what makes the goal persist the final goal that you get what makes it persist i was wondering when somebody would get bright enough to ask that question what makes that valence persist see why well the final goal persists because its got an answer and the answer is the terminal well the terminal is the answer to that goal and this betokens an enormous amount of success the appearance of goal when you finally get it is actually the longterm problem of the case and all problems have persistence and what youve done is reach in and pick the central problem of the person out this goal is hope that he can do something about this problem that is what goal really is its hope that he can do something about the problem and the problem of course is inherent in the goal and this problem has persisted for the duration of track practically thats very longterm proposition ordinarily when youre doing your regular goals assessment unless youve got present time problem comes out to be your goals assessment you see but it will just be on the chain and youve just picked it up late in some late form so the persistence of problem is due to the fact that nobody ever asises the confusion of the postulate counterpostulate and the motion countermotion and these things are all pinned in place anyhow so its its big byaaah all right now this has hope about it this big problem it has hope and the person hopes to do something about this problem and therefore he answers up as the hope he cant confront the problem but he can confront this hope about it you see the problem if it if the problem were totally confronted wouldnt be there so hes never been able to confront this problem and dont think youre going to get him to you go on via so you get him to confront the hope all right now the hope itself is pinned in place and theres the goal by the fact that valence solves that goal maybe you know its sort of stated that way in his mind you know the total solution to this goal and the beingness that will achieve this goal is absolutely concretely and without any variation whatsoever ninefoot cat and there is slightest doubt about this and thats the way it is except it of course might not so its total certainty with the invalidations of uncertainties hung on it so that of course hangs up the terminal so the terminal is hung up the hope is hung up because the problem is hung up and the three are all there in in bunch now when you get the hope the hope rather tends to lose its charge when you get the proper valence that goes with that hope see so then youve got now youre in the realm of terminal now all the time hes working on this and going up and down the line on this youre actually cutting away and orienting him on the subject of this valence this beingness and eventually it starts dawning on him what this beingness is there to do and what the beingness is supposed to do and what it cant do and the clarification of the beingness of course its sort of you let the pc now im just talking theoretically you let the pc look around at this great problem through the eyes of this beingness that solved it so of course hes right in the middle of this problem so hes busy confronting this problem all the time and he if he confronts it enough on the prehav scale runs he eventually winds up at the other end having confronted the problem the problem disappears the valence disappears the goal might or might not still be there if the goal were still there itd be quite surprising but it might be on proper assessment it wouldnt be there the valence wouldnt be there the goal wouldnt be there and the problem wouldnt be there see that would be on perfect assessment perfect run quite interesting all all three of these things would blow up and you wouldnt get this particular persistence theres sneaker on this and that is the state of beingnesses what are beingnesses now you already have thetan that is totally invalidated if he thinks he cant do it but has to have pat beingness in order to do it you get that little sneaker on the end in other words hes gone dog its like machinery you see now when fellows been overwhelmed by machine man he has had it when you see pc sitting there who is nothing but machine who thinks as machine who answers on machine who is machine that is about the most invalidation you could get in other words he isnt even alive he isnt even alive enough to be overwhelmed by beingness he is only you get how far this is that fellow will come up to beingness and machine overwhelmingness though is an example of this you see the individual has disappeared and it actually the machine is an overwhelmed valence and the machine has overwhelmed the valence he was in to such degree that well its its lost too and you get this minuszero thetan who hasnt clue who what when or where whos overwhelmed by machine but actually between that machine that overwhelmed and the thetan theres beingness that got overwhelmed and you quite ordinarily will be sorting out valence or terminal and youll find all of sudden you will sort machine the machine will be showing up there and then the machine goes off and you have beingness and now youve got terminal thats quite amazing and sometimes by the way you get the machine as the terminal and then you run that and then youll find out for the same goal you very probably will have to find new terminal after that machines gone because theres sandwich there you see all right now this next point the point im trying to make here is that in all acceptances of beingnesses you have betokened failure the person must have failed as himself to have beingness to carry on for him so this is of course your basic invalidation and that lies back of that now getting rid of the valence and squaring around the valence and orienting that particular problem which made the hope called goal and the valence take place and stick in orienting those things you make mest clear now let call something to your attention youve not done anything about uninvalidating the thetan see hes sort of looking out from underneath the covers you know all youve done is reorient this thetan on the subject of valences and hes got the clue on the subject of valences but hes still got problems and he really isnt himself yet and when he becomes himself hundred percent now of course all beingnesses he has necessity for beingnesses so the basic definition of theta clear is further necessity for beingnesses got that all right well thats just thats very exact definition further necessity for beingnesses equals theta clear but even though he has necessity for beingnesses he might not be able to do everything he would like to do and so you have theta clear who cant necessarily tear up ladies scarves in the thin air and you move from that point to ot do you get what this is you get how that gap would be closed it would be an able very able thetan well all you have to do is have him know hes thetan and be able to be thetan and be able to exist without any assist his beingnesses and you of course have theta clear so if fellow can exist without synthetic beingnesses which are solutions to problems he cant confront youve got mest clear see hes still in body you see thats why you call him mest clear hes got body beingness yet but hes gotten rid of these synthetic valences these synthetic valences arent bothering him now so thats out of the way but hes still pretty dependent on body he doesnt think he could walk down the street he doesnt think anybody would say hello to him if he walked down the street without body he knows pretty well they wouldnt he can get the horrified idea even if hes clear just of this so you can get the horrified idea of walking through the local town and being utterly ignored by one and all he doesnt like this he keeps lugging hundred and some pounds of meat around with him and he keeps putting up this meat and saying say hello to it you know and this is his level of conviction but all he needs then the only thing hes depending on actually is mest beingnesses longer any synthetic mental beingnesses he had dependence on those things at all well thats mest clear but remember hes still dependent on mest and hes still dependent on mest beingness well when you dont any longer have dependence on mest beingness and identity you have theta clear thats real honesttogoodness theta clear and every once in while somebody writes and says well weve cleared this fellow up he was cleared some time ago and now weve cleared him to mest clear you know theres always burning question that you can ask on the thing well is he still lugging around hundred and some pounds of meat you know does he have to and if he doesnt have to why of course hes theta clear and then if somebody wrote you and told you that hed made an ot however hed personally made ot you know why the only test question youd have to ask him is well how did you hold the pen if he writes you with my hand of course you say why you know and of course you dont send him the halo its halo you have to issue for ot you see weve had some in stock theyre theyre surplus weve had some surplus halos in stock for some little time they were originally made for christianity and then nobody could qualify okay what other questions do we have female voice what is actually wrong with case that takes such tremendous time in doing the goals assessment on them what are they doing are they playing game with the auditor are they in games condition nah female voice on auditing or are they just yeah well yeah theres something in that theyre not playing game with the auditor theyre in games condition with the auditor female voice uhhuh but maybe theres more to your question female voice i just wondered what is going on with the pc female voice yeah that it takes such tremendous who takes such tremendous long time in getting assessed and up to goals assessment what is this pc doing female voice right well of course if we could say specifically exactly what this pc was doing he of course would be assessed much faster so we probably at this moment dont have all of the answers for exactly what it takes so long and were work we work instead on the auditor trying to get him to make perfect approach to this situation that is our best answer to it at this time and the most enduring answer but what is wrong with this pc now youre asking mostly for conjecture i say its conjecture he could be doing an enormous list of things and amongst them of course you could include as common denominator to all of them hes in some kind of games condition with regard to life but he isnt kidding the auditor and i dont think people are playing coy and being mean and so forth they arent really theyre doing all right they just cant bring themselves to give up much the guy is actually being asked to give up his dreams theyre the most valuable commodity there is theres been poem written about them when the last of mans dreams is dead why the man is dead you know and if you badly do goals assessment he sort of gets the sensation like hes being killed dream by dream and that is why i say we got rid of some of that when we took this thirdofadial drop you know as goals assessment youre not trying to rub the pc out as he sits in the chair after all lets just find out if this goal is consistent and continual now giving up something valuable to the auditor is what being assessed for goal entails and the common denominator of games condition is thou must not have maybe neither but thou certainly and you run into an obsessive games condition of this character you could go over the hills and far away and probably do something about this you probably could approach it like this who used to ask you what you wanted to do in life and of course the needle will fall off the pin on anybody who was having hard time giving up goal because its certain that he has been plagued by his parents and associated personnel and maybe even by the military and other people some oblique wild program of you have to make up your mind what you are going to do in life or you are such disappointment to us or something like that ive noticed that girls very often ive had lot of girls ive seen lot of them from time to time who actually are just totally knocked in the head because they were their parents expected so much of them and they somehow or another didnt measure up to it and there was this terrific nostalgia about all this and this terrific well i tried you know and now they feel totally degraded and very upset and they were supposed to paint twice as good as leonardo da vinci you know and sit in the model chair and look three times as good as mona lisa and simultaneously with this they were supposed to marry millionaire and there have been few little mild goals laid out for them more or less of this character dont you see you know and they just werent ill tell you good example of this the day of the saxon is still with us but the saxon has in america and england has peculiarity and the peculiarity is is dont let him be thats sort of motto you know and other races find this as very peculiar you get down to spain and you run into waiters and its all right to be waiter nobody looks down on you if youre waiter you know and you get out to china spain kind of draws the line from that point on down because waiter is still able to dress and so forth they start drawing the line on the laborer and they dont kind of want people to be laborer you know and its just little bit beneath it all but out in china my god man can be laborer rickshaw coolie and next month be warlord and its just totally rolly coaster you see and everybody respects any beingness they run into which is quite amazing you know the fellows coolie so its all right theres nobody chivying at him saying now when are you going to be the construction boss do you see its perfectly all right hes coolie and hes supposed to carry basket and every time he passes the tallyman the tallyman pops another bamboo stick into the other box and this is the way life goes and he carries this basket and they fill it up and he carries it back and he empties it and thats all right and nobody finds any fault with it his wife isnt standing around saying well now wong and you dont have this vast notion of getting promoted or getting on in life in other words they leave these beingnesses at rest now this could be at two positions on the tone scale it could be harmonic you see of of decent attitude and it could be total apathy about beingness you know well the fellow was there and theres nothing you can do about it that doesnt happen to be present in china the other condition is more alive its quite amazing to watch this you youre around brick foundry or something like that and some bird all of sudden lays down his brick paddle and comes over and offers you cigarette and asks you for match and sits down and hes covered with dust and grime and he all hes supposed to do is stand there with paddle and pat the bricks as they go by or something you see and he is of importance of any kind whatsoever in this area hell have long drawn out very familiar conversation with you about the political issues of the day and about this and that totally relaxed he has apology for his own beingness hes doing very good job of patting bricks and you run into some of this in the west indies i had fellow one time whose name was horatio nelson and he let go of barrel he was rolling barrel of rum he was part of longshore crew and he just knocked off he saw standing there and he came over and had conversation with and he bought drink and i bought him drink and then he went back to rolling his barrel of rum and there was apology for it its quite amazing apology for beingness its very weird being in society of that after being in society where everybody is apologizing for their beingness you know and you get in america right now young boys or fellows in their late teens twenties something like that why theyre always explaining to you how theyre about to be promoted you know and in the services its enough to drive you mad i mean every reserve that you ran into was explaining how he was really supposed to be commissioned an admiral he left this job in chicago which was paying him 865 dollars week and hed given up all this to come into the service and he didnt amount to very much here now but in spite of all this youve heard that whats the guy doing he says forgive for being the beingness isnt here i mean im not really not in any beingness and i know it isnt adequate and i feel like i should apologize for it all you get the idea so you get this im little astray here on this other question but you get this condition in american englishtype societies at the present moment more dominantly so that must mean that in this particular society at this particular time theres tremendous amount of chivying at someone to make one amount to something else you see there must be lot of pressure on the subject which in itself serves as both an invalidation of the person as he is and demand that he be something else and that he have some quote ambition and that he have some goals and you get somebody who has been clawed at on the subject of youve got to have goals youve got to have goals youve got to have goals and he finally just sits back sullenly and sets his heels and then eventually gets overwhelmed so he starts giving you bunch of goals that have nothing to do with his goals but are which are bought goals you know theyre just foisted off on him now sorry to go astray on you about ethnology but it happens to be hobby of mine and you get condition here whereby the individual feels that if he voices any of his own goals or own opinions hes going to get slapped down now the various responses he could give you see was as he worsened in this condition he could get to point where he wouldnt give you any at all you see hed give you goals at all you ask him for goal and he doesnt tell you anything he doesnt even think of anything you understand hes just numb now this can go down and as i was talking yesterday on the business of pretended knowingness well theres pretended goalingness and hell sit there and pretend to have goals just to satisfy you you see its kind of delusory state you know and he doesnt really know if they are his goals or not his goals or anything else so this he could be giving off with you see well now theres another ramification that could exist in that and that is the individual isnt just giving you goals to satisfy you hes giving you somebody elses goals for him in perfect confidence that they are his own goals in other words you could apparently be dragging goals off of person who in all honesty thought he was giving you his goals and all he was doing was handing them out of little goals package over here that was laid in by mama few trillenia ago you see and he just keeps giving you these things and keeps giving you these things and they arent his goals you got the idea well there are various conditions could exist here lets review these conditions again just for succinctness there could be the condition where the individual is just knocked in the head on the subject of goals he feels he just better not give you any because its just going to be invalidated anyway now when you actually do then start to erase this fellows goals he feels this is true you start erasing the goal that he just gave you and he says you see see the auditors making nothing of my goals so this confirms it so then hes much slower in giving you his next goal all right lets theres that case now theres the case that will just dream up goals to please you its just delusory sort of of package and then there is the case different than that of the person who is giving you somebody elses goals in whose valence they are in which somehow or another fits on their own valence chain and naturally they would tend to marry or associate with people who were on their own valence chains and theyll sit there and give you somebody elses goals by the package so knowing these various conditions about goals you could speed up goals assessment enormously lets find out what this person is doing and then lets straighten it out now were getting awfully were getting awfully adroit here to do this sort of thing i wouldnt really frown at you if you werent able to untangle somebodys difficulties in this particular direction but you could hit at it and you could knife around on it and you could take these three classes which i just gave you and you could ask questions such as this you could say well if you did give goal would i just invalidate you and if you got very deep fall on this sort of thing of course youve got an arc break going on the subject of goals and you should do something to clear that up youre not trying to erase the goals youre just trying to find out which one will hang fire its quite little bit different you see so you could handle that now there would be the another condition here and this condition would be simple condition of individuals trying to please you and you could ask this guys very glib you know he says well what i want to be is carpenter i want to be bricklayer i want to be this i want to be that and i once wanted to be singer and i want to do this and i want to do that and so on and so on and so on and he just goes on and he gives you goals and it all seems to be automatic and he runs on and on and on and on and on well after while you suddenly wake up to the fact that he gives you these things and theres charge on them what is happening here well if theres charge hardly on the lists at all we can assume then probably that the individuals just dreaming them up just so on so you can ask him question something on this order and search this thing out real well and some condition of this character i think id ask the person what would happen if i asked you for goal and you didnt give one you know this would disturb the needle quite considerably if that were the condition the person was in you see well i dont know and so on and hed get into the idea of having to please you and so forth and you could straighten this out with the pc you see twoway comm sort of thing and then the next thing that you could do about this sort of thing is somebody elses goals well its right here in this lifetime and you have already seen well the class at large hasnt seen this particular one well we just had couple of students here that it was rather remarkable we didnt get anyplace on this girl at all until i asked for her husbands goals and boy they just came out brrrrr and she even misread it at first you know she read it goals for her husband i think it was being run at and we got that shifted back to where it should have been which was her husbands goals that was what we wanted to know and boy she just ran like canary bird on her husbands goals i mean marvelous didnt have any goals of her own apparently had her husbands goals had some goals for her husband but was giving her husbands goals as the response dont you see well id be awfully tempted if i ran into that particular one myself to get awfully clever about the whole thing and say all right this is girl who runs on mans goals obviously in her husbands valence in her husbands valence that solidly the terminal chain must be man that looks remarkably like the husband and id be likely to get falling terminal assessment right at that moment you know just shortcut the whole thing and then check it back for the goal well im not teaching you how to do this particularly im just saying how i would might go about shortening up some of these things very circuitous i would find out that this person ran off brrrrrrt on goals for husband and didnt run off brrrt on goals for self didnt have any then we must assume that the husband has stolen the wifes valence or the wife is you see in some kind of state of in the husbands valence or theres something going on here which is not routine nor ordinary that is not very usual everybody gets in little bit in somebody elses valences they get mixed up in valences you get southern girl in class here and suzie starts to drawl i mean its this kind of thing that hasnt anything to do with it im talking about this person actually doesnt have any goals of their own but just runs on another persons goals as though they were their own goals now id sort that out id immediately suspect that that other person was on the terminal chain of the pc and i would start finding out what this other person was in an effort to blow the person and i would do terminals assessment on that husband or on that wife or something like this see or on that father or mother id just do terminals assessment i dont care how long it took to do terminals assessment i would just go on and on and on and on and all of sudden you would find that terminal would blow free and then we would go back on goals assessment again wed probably find out it would match up with one of those terminals we very likely could get terminal hanging fire though before we got the goal dont you see just an entrance on such thing you have to find out what the pcs doing thats the golden rule of auditing whats the pcs mind doing now those are lot of particularities and lot of mechanical approaches and so forth and ill give you much better answer now of course the person is notknowing their goals like crazy the person is notknowing their goals you see you ask for goals list and you get bunch of notknows you say goal pc thinks notknow anybody who sat there and every time i asked them do you have another goal and they said well now let see i dont know i would certainly take it that they were running notknow on goals if they did this consistently and continually and so forth then i would suspect that the person ought to have lot of goals that shouldnt be known and the therere all kinds of variations once you understand this principle you could just have picnic with it and on goals assessment if you understand the exact principle how theyre notknowing the goals you know you ask them for various kinds of goals that would blow these things out youre already doing it secret goals withheld goals and all that sort of thing but there are lots of ways of doing this you shouldnt shorten your scope of action there are tremendous numbers of ways of doing this you could say now have you ever thought you would like to do anything which wouldnt be generally accepted socially you know not do you have withheld goal but now have you ever thought of doing anything that after you did it you would have to carefully cover up your tracks thats another way of asking for withheld goal now is do you have you ever had any goal that other people sure as the dickens better not find out about have you ever had goal to make people stupid have you ever had goal to not know you know have you ever had goal to make other people not know what varieties and versions of notknowingness or forgettingness would you have put down here on this goals list as your goals this can get pretty crude you see now lets see what goals do you have with regard to stupidity interesting question what goals do you have with regard to escaping knowledge of are there any subjects are there any subjects which exist as academic or scholastic subjects which you would rather not have any understanding or knowledge of of any kind whatsoever and you all of sudden may hit the jackpot dont you see the person says well hardly any theres just algebra geometry physics chemistry reading writing arithmetic geography uh then you might ask somebody did you ever know anybody who had the motto of know thyself who was that who didnt think youd succeed very well in life oh who didnt who was that now all right now what goal did that person have for you now what goals did you have before that person started talking about it and all of sudden youll get very fast much faster moving goals list when you were child did you in this lifetime did you attend specialized school of any kind which was fitting you or readying you for having fits in some profession oh well yes i went to military school from the time i was eight until the time i was nineteen well how have you never mentioned this before well as matter of fact ive just been trying to forget the whole thing well what is the goal of this particular school well i was supposed to become an officer ah an officer of what well i just never got along very well that has nothing to do with it i never had any goals in that particular sphere so well just skip that well yeah all right well just skip it now getting back to this military school what were they fitting you for to do particularly what subjects were you seeking to avoid in this particular institution of learning and the person says artillery i just always flunk artillery if i could i had goal in that school all right and that was to get out of those artillery classes hahaha yeah i did have goal yep thats right i had goal yeah yeah i had goal to get out of all the artillery classes thats right you say well thats fine the needle fell off the pin along about this time you see well it might be just cognition surge so explore it further and further and you say well artillery have you been resisting becoming an artillery officer or something of the sort like that oh well if you look at it that way yes i suppose could say so yes yes well did you ever have goal to become one never never never ive never had goal to become an artillery officer time have i ever had goal to be i wouldnt even think of it thats it theres reason to ask anymore because i just tell you thats it that is closed book now you can go on with your goals assessment if you like but uh what have you just hit there you have run into road barricade of magnitude on the subject of this person giving you any goals of any kind because somebody was trying to give them goal and now theyre reacting totally on the subject of having been given goal that they didnt want they are now resisting giving anybody any goals that they do want and you could get crisscross going here on the subject of goals but you have to loosen up your mind in doing goals assessment on the potentialities of person being beaten down on the subject of goals or the person beating other people down on the subject of goals you see and once youve loosened up your own mind on how many ways could pc be boobytrapped into giving slow numerous covert inarticulate or any other type of goals assessment once youve loosened yourself up on this thing you can outguess him oh he sits there and he says oh yes i have goals yes i had goal to be pitcher and i had goal to be uh once upon time i wanted to be cricket umpire for some particular reason or other and yes i wanted goal to drive trains i had goal to be politician wanted to be painter bricklayer cat i remember i wanted to be cat one time and yeah lots of goals oh yes i can give you lots of goals and boy they will too you know you invalidate the pc of course by being too direct in questioning but the temptation well now are any of these goals factual did you ever really want to be any of these things now if you hadnt if you hadnt come up against it so heavily on this and that and being all these various things well just confidentially what what would you have been before they wanted you to be something else what would you have been you see ah well thats different story and all of sudden this mad tirade of pleasing the auditor slows down to nothing you see and the goals that dont fall well the pc just isnt giving you goals in some fashion youre just not getting the pcs goals thats all or every time you say goal the pc goes into ridge he cant have it you cant have it he cant have it and so forth because the needle phenomenon which madge mentioned earlier would demonstrate the canthave of course at once needle tightens up and thats it you say goal and the person cant let you have goals they themselves cant have goals theres various approaches here i mean i could just go on by the hour giving you various approaches to shake all this stuff loose so forth theres another oblique approach is the horrors of ambition i imagine that would be very very useful today with modern youth because apparently one of the things you mustnt have is ambition theyve gone to negation you find this very broadly but factual person doesnt want to amount to anything nobeingness situation so you might have dissertation well what trouble would an ambitious person get into if you made anything in life and you made lot of things in life whod take it away from you just go the various round and round on all the conditions of games conditions and processes of this character who stopped this fellows goals who blunted them whose goals did this fellow stop and how did he blunt them and can we walk into the middle of this and with few quick flips of the wrist disentangle the whole ruddy knot and just to get the thing rolling theres where lack of the use of the principles ive just been talking with or lack of broad imaginative approach to the subject is what slows these things down for instance an auditor who does very fast goals assessment and an auditor who does very slow one theres difference between these two auditors it is not the difference of the pc and one the auditor who is getting slow goals assessment will get slow on some people fast on some people in other words hell get the goals assessment at the exact rate that the pc he has at the moment is willing to have goals assessment run dont you see hell always get it at that rate and then you have the other auditor who beats the game you see then he changes this rate by some adroit line of questioning he smells something is wrong here and he goes in with circuitous roundup and he decides hed better fix this up he asks the pc dozen questions and he says well what would you like to have been in life and do you have any ambitions or goals of any kind and the person says well well right there you know hed say well what have we got to clean up here before we get goals assessment you know you hardly even ask any questions at all you just see it written on the wall that this one is now going to run to some vast number of apathies its not going to be done by hours its going to be done by apathies and we say to this another person we say well to such person why then we might say well now who didnt measure up to your expectations in life oh well my my daughter my wife my mother my father my grandfather my teachers the postman uh and he could almost do goals assessment on this basis alone well what should your mother have been oh well thats different now i mean it gets real live you know well she should have this and that and the other thing and so on and so on and so on and so on whats your father been well he should have been this or that or the other thing and so on bom bom bom bom and what should your have been well i kept telling him just time after time i mean day after day after day for just well i just wore myself out i told him the only thing he could possibly amount to in life would be plumber and he just never seems to have realized it and so forth and he just goes on with this silly artist business all the time out in chelsea and so on but he would have made good plumber and i just kept telling him and telling him and telling him and hes got real interest see you watch it you just its all in the way you handle the cookie how fast it crumbles you get this individual saying well i was this and i was that and i was the other thing and i had goal to do this and that and the other thing and so on and so on and so on you want any more yes i all right and i i call that pretended goalingness yeah theres lot of lot of different attitudes but as long as you if youre trying to get pc to do something or give you something or get something over the bumps youve got to handle whats sitting in front of you system under the sun will handle it wholly for you you yourself have got to do some observation the first and foremost rule in any processing is if you can just parallel find out and parallel what the mind is doing it goes phlooft and you take it apart in any of its difficulties like psychosomatic illness you could probably set up shop weve had several things you could set up shop with you could probably put great big shingle hanging out flying in the wind on security checking psychosomatic ill parts of the body just that and you get adroit at this and you get practiced at this one way or the other and you just hang your shingle out and say spines adjusted skulls reformed your beauty restored in twelve easy treatments you could make it cook too if you worked at it straight away youd just do nothing but security checking what skull do you think should be hidden you know what zorch are you trying to hide what have you done to livers what have you done to liver that nobody should know about oh that because in any in any cluster of wrongness you have great deal of notknowingness and therefore ignorant societies which uniformly specialize in wrongnesses up in ignorance wind up specializing in wrongnesses i probably very often stand peoples hair on end talking about religion and im i cant really say with sincerity im sorry for it but i will say this i will say this that any zone which is zone of pretense its pretending to do one thing and its actually dedicated to doing something entirely different and so forth im afraid im liable to laugh at not necessarily attack it but ive certainly reserved the right to laugh hope i never lose it all right well one more question before we close this up one more question yes male voice is book one clear mest clear ron yes very definitely male voice thank you and also are the south african clears mest clears yes male voice thank you theres only one person around in angeles were talking about as theta clear at the present time whose status is in question with regard to this its quite goofy you know theta beingness is actually very very dominant and quite visible by the time youve made mest clear so people are apt to get quite confused about all this and they also think meter should sit there and never say anything after person is clear at all but it should sit there totally idly theres point of clarification on this if the person youve got on the meter is clear this condition will occur that if the person isnt doing anything actively and knowingly isnt doing anything youre not going to have any needle reaction its going to sit there just square at clear read and all is going to be well if the person isnt doing anything got the idea but they know theyre doing something or not doing something now you ask this person to do something youre going to get needle disturbance and youre apt to get tone arm disturbance too because they can change the mass of the body and they do it rather easily evidently on one report on south african case you got an inchwide theta bop or thereabouts every time the preclear moved in and out or the clear moved in and out of her body every time she moved out of her body or back into her body again you got big wide inchwide theta bop well naturally naturally because the electrical phenomena of the body was being considerably disturbed and you got the reading of the thetan moving out and the thetan moving in well that is quite different than notknowingness condition whereby theta bop you know where does that come from you know person says well im not quite sure where i am im back of my body or im in my body one or the other and youre getting theta bop well that is not the reaction im talking about the reaction im talking about is you ask the person well are you in your body and they say yes you want to move out and you get an inchwide theta bop see and then it stops and you say okay well move back in again you get an inchwide theta bop and then that stops got the idea in other words its the difference of course the key difference is predictable behavior of the meter now trying to clear up something on one of these people because of course theyre living in the mest universe you see and clear walks out into an oddity here hes perfectly cheerful hes perfectly able to do things and hes able to get show on the road and that sort of thing weve been so carefully sold on the idea of buddhist serenity as token of altitude and high state high state is still state and boy that has been very far from the case in every single one of these clears you see they just depart wildly from this particular lineup because they go into motion and they they go around doing things and tearing things and they get impatient with things and they go up and down the tone scale very volatilely and theyre quite alive and everybody gets the idea clear buddha well you see hes supposed to be sitting there and legs crossed naked loin cloth regarding his navel you see thats what hes supposed to be doing if hes really clear hes sitting up there doing that you know bright shade of yellow and instead of that you find this person tearing around straightening up this and straightening up that and doing this and getting very impatient running into barrier you see and saying whoooooa barriers shouldnt be and thaaaaaaah and so on and then getting that done and fixed up you see it doesnt present the same picture it presents picture of action it presents picture of effectiveness well similarly the emeter presents this same thing but now the emeter is problem when used anywhere in the vicinity of clear because as long as the clears sitting there doing nothing youre going to get perfectly idle swinging arm just you know textbook and the person will be sitting on there sets clear read and everything will be just dandy see this now they do something and you dont have that condition because they can very definitely disturb the masses of the body with the greatest of ease dont you see and it goes flying off but of course they know what theyre doing and you know what theyre doing too theres mystery on your part as to what theyre doing theyre not sitting there influencing the needle with thought you know theyre moving around theyre kicking the body in the back of the head you know and thinking big thoughts and mocking up ridge and throwing it away and doing things like this and this all influences the meter of course so when one of these people has present time problem and they can have present problems and you decide to audit this person on present time problem you are now going to have picnic because one you cant get the registry of the problem unless youre quicker than greased lightning you say do you have present time problem and as the needle coasts across the dial you see you have to notice this momentary little flick you see as it went by and you say well now what problem is that and actually youre trying to audit below the level of knowingness into the reactive area you see and theyre responding simultaneously on the analytical level they say yes i have present time problem yes i know about the present time problem and you say well well try to isolate it little better and theyll say well thats good id like to inspect it and id like to confront it little better and trying to isolate though what theyre doing on the needle and get the needle to coordinate with the questions youre asking and the responses and what theyre doing of course is all haywire because the needle is the emeter is totally rigged to respond on the reactive mind and doesnt register on the reactive mind it just registers on electronic ridges and things of this character now which comprise actually what the body is built out of all right whats the next thing then that weve got to have well weve got to have clear meter you see weve got to have meter thatll register this sort of thing and weve already had some despairing wails on this subject of people trying to audit clears sounds funny auditing clear you see but hes still got theta clear and still ot to go you know and were trying to get clue what theyre doing you know and trying to read registry and it just doesnt read anymore the sensitivity is all gone the needle is floating clear across back and forth across the dial and you ask for withhold do you have withhold do you think offhand if the person were clear the girl were clear sitting here at 20 and you said do you have withhold that the person would move the tone arm maybe tiny little bit but then move the needle little bit now thats what youre accustomed to and that isnt what clear does at all the technical facts im giving you now are of observed material you say do you have withhold the clear says yes five you say what is it and they say well i had an unkind thought about you last night and it was soandso and there it goes bang which is quite goofy man it clears up instantly on the whole read it goes right back to where it was it wasnt there to begin with dont you see and its only there as long as they didnt tell you and then the second they tell you it drops right straight back to the clear read quite interesting theyre very easy to security check but the meter can still be used on security checking clear but it of course blows up for any practical purpose on auditing and therefore we have got this other project of research well underway as matter of fact more or less got it licked i think its quite amusing myself of course you get these ideas about what clear should be and theyre actually based on what you have been told clear should be and that basing is back at five four three bc gautama siddhartha rewritten and naturally the way you would pin down whole race would be to take them out of motion so that they made the ideal person who was in motion of any kind whatsoever that was the ideal and now if somebody was going to feel good and be able and so on you naturally would have to take him out of the category that absolutely mauled complete race see psychologist today is cooperating in this dont think that this is stray datum that only person in the field of theosophy or something would know it isnt psychology dramatizes this hundred percent today they even wrote in civil defense their additions for civil defense the only condition under which theyre going to incarcerate somebody during civil defense disaster is if the person is in motion if they find person going around trying to organize things they are supposed to put him at once in an institution i read this carefully i got their definitions for it i couldnt believe it in other words if anybodys going to do anything about the disaster that just occurred at all why hes by definition not by any stretch of the imagination you know i mean not making too much out of definition well yeah yeah well whos supposed to do something then you say well the civil defense workers you see and the government workers are supposed to do something and you say well what if they were all in the wrong building oh well thats chance youd have to take well man you can take that chance but after this ruddy countrys blown off the face of the earth by atomic bombs i can tell you the first thing that will be apparent is that it has government now what are you going to do well you depend on the civil defense workers ah of course im not now talking about field i dont know anything about im talking about field i know great deal about and the only people the only time some order comes out of chaos is with some guys get together and decide to put it right and theyll be the guys on the ground not the guys with the badges you see theyve had nothing to do with that and this is any time anything works or works out and so forth its because the people are there who are trying to do something and you get all of these areas where just the guys with the badges can operate and only the guy with the badge can operate and under circumstances can anybody else operate and you have the present arab situation you know these arabs who were driven out of palestine and you know theyre there yet you know theyre just mob and they just wont do anything and they wont lift their finger and theyre just in complete apathy and theres never been any recovery of that particular group of people and theyve evidently followed out some kind of basis that if any one of them got up and said all right the rest of you guys now lets go out here and carve up few acres and lets raise some khatinkas or whatever they raise and cabbages they apparently said well that man is being too active you know hes trying to do something so doingness has been divorced from being clear i want to make that very very very clear there its booby trap see thats the basic and primary booby trap of buddhism thats the basic that if youre in good shape youll be sitting still mmmrnrnrn if youre in good shape you can sit still i used to upset people end by going out and sitting under tree and theyd say wheres the book what are you going to do and id say nothing itd drive them nuts you know just sit there and do nothing for an hour or two theyd go bezeeeh how could you possibly do that well person wouldnt be able to do that at the same time id get the same objections from person you know i think youre working too hard you know dont you think you ought to take rest you know you really ought to take rest i think youre working much too hard although you couldnt confront somebody being totally motionless they at the same time couldnt confront somebody in motion so they just couldnt confront but thats the basic tenet and one that we must be very careful of in scientology that we dont give this thing much credence because apparently every clear we have made to date has all of sudden gotten busy and that is without exception theyve gotten busy and they dont believe in being mest theyre very alive and they get in peoples hair people get upset about them you know and they sometimes have opinions that are not true but they have them just because they believe them and they argue and theyre not necessarily totally hundred percent right every five minutes you know they make mistakes you know but boy they sure make them on grand scale one has to give them 100 for trying but theyre in motion and they do get things done and homo sap alongside of clear looks like snail crawling along the road you know thats the way he looks to clear too apparently from their viewpoint you know they say why dont you people get moving you know whats the matter with you people and moving well were just hurrying as fast as we can you see they dont believe it speed ratio has changed on them idea of what fast motion is has changed on them idea of what work is changed on them idea of what is worth doing has changed you see all these things have shifted and id make this very thorough solid recommendation that we take look at the people who have been cleared and then we watch what theyre doing to find out what clear does thats thats snidely put i mean its very sound thing because its out of the area of theory you see its long been out of that area but its out of this area of theory its fact all right now there is something to be observed about it and there are people who are clear and if you put them on meter as an auditor you would see at once there was something drastically wrong with this person they werent reading on meter the arm was coasting around and you were trying to run processes on them and you werent getting anyplace processing them and you couldnt get any meter reactions and they blew things by inspection and all kinds of things like this and thats the way they behave as pc which is about be the most reliable test of clear now watch what those people are doing watch how they react and take that as your index rather than book one just take that as your index this is what clear does well this is what clear is doing what is clear doing and of course there are an awful lot of people totally sold on buddhism that will suddenly decide having observed that that this is not desirable state because the person now doesnt go and sit on the temple steps you know theres this fellow down in the marts and businesses of life you see and saying come on get this show on the road get that done lets do this and lets go here and i think it ought to look very nice and ive got some long term goals for this country and so on and i think we ought to be getting at it in this particular line and then instead of sitting back at it like the usual fellow with the ideas is concerned the person gets in and works three times as hard you see as anybody else involved in the project clear in johannesburg wore out the whole staff everybody was utterly panting and their tongues out this person was teaching about nine hours day and auditing pc or two and answering all of the organizations backlog of letters in her spare time and things work out right for these people you see because theyve got more velocity on the thing and their postulates stick harder and they have very clear idea of where theyre going they have held down fives telling them they ought to be doing something else but there is our best zone of information and at the present instant we really arent using it i try to publish little scraps and stuff that come along but i ought to get it more thoroughly done of course i also have the idea i shouldnt invade their privacy or invalidate their states okay well thats enough thats enough for now thats enough youve had it okay good night
