american law division the process data and costs of mortgage foreclosure summary the passage of legislation such as pl 110289 the housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act of 2008 representative barney frank et and the introduction of numerous bills such as hr 5818 the neighborhood stabilization act of 2008 representative maxine waters et serve as evidence of the concern in the 110th congress over recent foreclosure activity this report provides description of as well as some brief analysis of foreclosure and related issues generated by the behavior of us housing and mortgage markets specifically this report explains the foreclosure process both from the point of view of traditional financial lending institution and from the viewpoint of securitization when loans are sold in

foreclosures frm versus arm 10 the process data and costs of mortgage foreclosure introduction this report provides an analysis of the process activity and policy issues related to mortgage foreclosures description of the foreclosure process is presented first in traditional banking context and then under securitization when the loan originator longer owns the distressed mortgage brief discussion is also included concerning what guides the decisions to foreclose next the various foreclosure data sources are summarized lastly some estimates of foreclosure costs are presented the general foreclosure process the foreclosure process is governed by state law and varies widely by state the description of the foreclosure process provided in this report is in general terms first assuming traditional lending framework followed by brief explanation of how the process works when the mortgage has been securitized foreclosure under traditional lending framework foreclosure can begin after borrower defaults on the mortgage loan1 default is generally defined as being 90 days or more delinquent although some lenders may use other definitions once in default the lender must decide whether loss mitigation or workout option would suffice or whether to proceed with foreclosure the process of recovering losses by repossessing and selling the property2 financially motivated lender will try to select the option that minimizes losses 1 for primer on delinquency default foreclosure and loan workouts see charles capone research into mortgage default and affordable housing primer prepared for the local initiatives support corporation for home ownership summit 2001 november 8 2001 available at httpwwwliscorgfiles906_file_asset_upload_file755_793pdf 2 loss mitigation or workouts refer to menu of possible options to avoid foreclosure lenders may choose from various options such as forebearance rescheduling payments or restructuring the loan which may help distressed borrowers become current and continue to stay current in the payments after forebearance or loan modification borrower can become delinquent again if borrower circumstances will not allow for loan to reperform agreement to preforeclosure sale or deedinlieu of foreclosure may also be viable options to mitigate losses crs2 depending upon the state foreclosure process may take from several months to almost two years to complete to ensure valid transfer of title the lender must prove that the borrower is in default and follow various legal procedures prior to the authorization of foreclosure auction in states that follow judicial foreclosure process foreclosure petition must be heard and ruled upon by judge who examines all of the evidence in the case in powerofsale states the lender holds deed of trust with clause that allows foreclosure without court action because of the additional legal work foreclosure generally takes longer and is more costly to complete in judicial foreclosure states after proper notification requirements and other legal procedures have been completed foreclosure auction process begins states typically require that the property owner be given advance notice regarding when the foreclosure auction will take place in addition legal advertisement must appear in local news media announcing the time and place of the auction legal description of the property and the sale terms and conditions at the auction the auctioneer may begin with reading of the legal advertisement and then set minimum bid the highest bidder at the conclusion of the bidding period assumes title of and responsibility for the property if one purchases the property above the minimum bid the lender receives title the property becomes real estate owned reo term used for foreclosed houses that lenders carry until they can be resold by conventional means like any seller the lender may need to incur expenses for deferred maintenance or outright damage before putting the property on the market lenders may hire the services of realty brokers who are paid commissions to sell reo properties meanwhile the lender still incurs costs such as forgone interest property taxes and any other delinquent liabilities assumed from the previous borrower consequently even if the property were sold at market value the lender may incur losses the stigma of being reo property however may have the effect of reducing the list price below current market value furthermore the lender may pay some or all of the closing costs to entice new buyers just as any seller might do in any ordinary real estate transaction once title has been transferred to new owner the tabulation of the lenders total foreclosure costs from borrower default to final property disposition may begin the foreclosure process does not necessarily end after title of the property is transferred some states provide borrowers with statutory right of redemption which allows the borrower period of time perhaps longer than full year to repurchase the property after the foreclosure auction hence the foreclosure sale is not final in these states until the end of the redemption period3 the length of time from initiation to completion of the foreclosure process therefore depends on whether the foreclosure must go to court and whether right of redemption exists 3 if property sells for less than the current mortgage there will be remaining unpaid balance the tax consequences on the unpaid mortgage debt vary according to state law for more information see crs report rl34212 analysis of the tax exclusion for canceled mortgage debt income by mark p keightley and erika lunder crs3 the discussion so far has focused upon single lender foreclosing on single mortgage if the borrower used two loans to acquire the property however then two lenders would be affected suppose borrower whose property has been foreclosed obtained primary loan for 80 of the total needed amount and piggyback or secondary loan for the remaining 20 after subtraction of legal and administrative costs the proceeds of the foreclosure or reo sale go to pay off the primary lender first and the lender of the secondary loan gets whatever is left over given that foreclosure costs can be substantial the second lender risks not recouping anything on the unpaid secondary loan balance foreclosure under structured financing framework the term lender has so far been used in the traditional context in which bank that originates mortgage also holds it in portfolio in modern financial markets however originators do not necessarily keep loans in their own portfolios loans originated in the primary market where the home purchaser and the loan originator conduct business are often sold in secondary market where the loan originator and an investor conduct business the process of structured financing in the mortgage market involves the following steps first home buyer goes to an originator which can be financial institution or mortgage broker who approves and issues mortgage loan second the originator sells the loan to securitizer securitizer can be governmentsponsored enterprise gse such as fannie mae or freddie mac or private securitization trust third the securitizer bundles the individual mortgages together and creates new financial product the mortgagebacked securities mbs finally the securitizer may sell mbs payment streams to investors who become the ultimate lenders investors may be hedge funds pension funds sovereign wealth funds or other financial institutions if the securitizer decides not to sell the securities to third party investors and instead holds them in its own portfolio then the securitizer becomes the investor mbs payment streams which are called tranches have specific risk or return requirements that meet various investor needs for example securitizer may create seniorjunior tranching structure in which the senior tranche investors receive payment first but their yield is lower than for the junior tranche investors the senior tranche would appeal to investors who prefer lower risk investments and the junior tranche would appeal to investors who prefer to take higher risks for the possibility of earning higher yield the seniorjunior tranching structure is only one of the numerous disbursement structures securitizers can use to attract investors this particular tranching structure however is used throughout this report for the sake of illustration4 the key difference between the foreclosure process under traditional banking versus structured financing frameworks has to do with the amount of flexibility that the mortgage holder has to make important financial decisions if default occurs suppose the securitizer either acts as or appoints servicer who collects mortgage 4 for more information on the securitization process see crs report rs22722 securitization and federal regulation of mortgages for safety and soundness by edward vincent murphy crs4 payments from borrowers and disburses these to the tranches the investor and servicer negotiate rules that the servicer will follow while acting on the investors behalf if default occurs servicer contract provisions along with state law determine 1 whether the servicer can offer loss mitigation solutions and if so of what types and with what limitations 2 when the servicer can initiate foreclosure 3 if the servicer may act as an agent at the foreclosure auction and 4 any bidding rules the servicer must follow for example if servicer can initiate foreclosure the rules are likely to state how much can be bid eg up to certain percentage or the full amount of borrowers unpaid balance at foreclosure auction given that the costs associated with foreclosure will be borne by the ultimate investors the rules are designed to minimize those expenses5 any foreclosure costs generated from defaulted mortgages in pool of mbs must be subtracted from the proceeds paid to the securitization trust suppose the securitizer is currently using the seniorjunior tranching structure described above if the senior tranche gets paid first then the junior tranche will initially suffer the revenue loss the investors in the senior tranche would be adversely affected should the number of foreclosures be greater than expected and associated costs exceed the stream of revenues that would have been paid out to the junior tranche of course fewer foreclosures can translate into the junior tranche holders being rewarded with higher yield than senior holders which compensates them for assuming more default risk6 more on foreclosure incentives lenders may try loss mitigation solution with defaulted borrowers while workout may result in reduction of revenues compared with the original mortgage agreement the revenue loss may still be less costly alternative to foreclosure of course if loan falls into default second time after loss mitigation option has been applied the additional forgone interest expenses are also added to the overall foreclosure costs hence loss mitigation may be less costly alternative to foreclosure if it is successful in getting the mortgage loan to perform again for this reason lenders may be cautious and adopt different policies regarding the frequency of loss mitigation usage based upon their individual experiences another consideration regarding the decision to foreclose is whether the mortgage loan carries mortgage insurance foreclosure costs can be reduced if some or all of the delinquent mortgage loss is covered by private or government mortgage insurance private mortgage insurance pmi is typically required by lenders when the borrower puts down less than 20 of the appraised value of the home pmi pays the lender based on the outstanding balance of the loan foreclosure costs property maintenance costs taxes and hazard insurance federally insured mortgages which 5 see crs report rl33775 could securitization obstruct voluntary loan modifications and payment freezes by edward vincent murphy 6 the liquidity problem of august 2007 was triggered by senior tranche holders reassessing the riskiness of their exposure to financial problems see crs report rl34182 financial crisis the liquidity crunch of august 2007 by darryl getter mark jickling marc labonte and edward vincent murphy crs5 are typically guaranteed up to 100 of the statutory maximums for eligible borrowers are provided by the federal housing administration fha and the veterans administration va when lenders file insurance claims mortgage providers may either pay just fraction of the loss allowing lenders to retain title or pay the full amount of the mortgage balance and take title to the property and then decide whether to proceed with foreclosure consequently lender incurring loss from defaulted mortgage in particular one with private insurance may decide to initiate foreclosure and pass on some of the loss to the mortgage insurance provider7 as stated earlier in this report however the foreclosure decision is usually guided by the contracts negotiated by the lender or investor and the servicer for example the contracts typically specify how servicers will get paid and reimbursed for expenses suppose servicer collects fees in the form of commission which may be calculated as percentage of the interest or mortgage coupon paid by the borrower under this arrangement payment occurs as long as the mortgage loan is performing so foreclosure would translate into lost income stream there may even be additional financial penalties associated with the inability to get delinquent loans to reperform some servicing firms have incentive compensation plans that deduct money from employees unable to avoid completing foreclosure8 servicers who acquire reputation for not being able to get sufficient number of loans to re perform may risk being unable to obtain future servicing rights for other types of loans eg for automobiles credit cards etc hence some payment structures provide servicers the incentive to avoid foreclosure some servicing agreements may not allow servicers to have much discretion for example for mortgages that fannie mae holds in its portfolio servicers must follow guidance on how to proceed with loss mitigation solutions9 the servicer must first get written permission from fannie mae before implementing loss mitigation solution as well as follow guidances on how to implement the solution given that it is subject to various capital requirements accounting and tax rules fannie mae must purchase delinquent mortgage from its mbs pool before loss mitigation solution can be applied as result fannie mae monitors and approves all decisions concerning troubled loans in its portfolio similarly fha servicers must follow fha guidelines for troubled loans fha servicers however have more discretion over how to get troubled loans to reperform fha federal mortgage insurance company does not face the capital requirements and tax consequences of private mortgage securitizer hence fha requires its servicers to participate in the fha loss mitigation program and avoid foreclosure if at all possible10 servicers cannot simply file claim on troubled mortgage and convey title of the property to fha without permission from the department of housing and urban development 7 fha typically assumes all of the borrowers default risk by insuring 100 of the mortgage loan after default the agency pays an insurance claim filed by the lender fha can then decide whether to initiate foreclosure and dispose of the property 8 see httpwwwocwenbusinesscomdocumentspdfcongressional_testimonypdf 9 see httpswwwefanniemaecomsfguidesssgannltrspdf20060627pdf 10 see httpwwwhudgovofficesadmhudclipslettersmortgageefiles0005doc crs6 hud fha servicers will not be reimbursed unless they show evidence of adherence to fha policies and procedures regarding troubled loans because of the various contractual arrangements that loan servicers are obligated to follow borrowers cannot necessarily avoid foreclosure by contacting their servicers in some cases present and future compensation for servicers depends on the number of loans they can get to perform which encourages servicers to try solutions to avoid completing foreclosure in other cases servicers may have limited authority and options11 consequently understanding why servicers may or may not complete the foreclosure process requires an understanding of the servicing contractual agreements or guidelines attached to the various mortgage loans measuring us foreclosures the federal government does not collect mortgage foreclosure data various private data sources are therefore used to measure foreclosure developments different sources employ different approaches to measuring foreclosures one approach is to look at the number of foreclosures as percentage of mortgages outstanding another approach is to count the number of foreclosure filings or starts the selected measurement approach may affect whether changes in foreclosure activity are viewed as being more or less severe this section examines some key differences in the various data sources as well as interpretation caveats foreclosure data sources the national delinquency survey the mortgage bankers association mba reports on the percentage of delinquencies and foreclosure filings in its quarterly national delinquency survey nds12 the nds sample consists of more than 40 million loans serviced by mortgage companies commercial banks thrifts credit unions and other servicing institutions13 this measurement approach counts foreclosures as percentage of outstanding mortgage loans the nds data include

continued crs8 measurement issues given that not all properties that begin foreclosure process will complete it foreclosure starts represents an upperlimit of completed foreclosures foreclosure starts or filings refer to the filing of legal documents during various stages of the foreclosure process as previously described many states require lenders to file notice of foreclosure to begin the process borrower and servicer can nonetheless resolve repayment problem and avoid completing foreclosure some states require lender or servicer to file an initial notice of foreclosure intent followed by another filing when the foreclosure sale takes place consequently if every filing is counted as new foreclosure then multiple counting will inflate or severely overstate foreclosure activity20 this report uses the nds data which provide an upperlimit measure of completed foreclosures to track foreclosure activity tracking foreclosure activity the data on foreclosure rates used in figure 1 and figure 2 come from the nds the figures include data on foreclosure filing rates for prime loans fha insured loans subprime loans and composite rate for all foreclosed loans the foreclosure rate for each loan category is computed as the total number of foreclosures filed at the end of the quarter divided by the total number of loans in that particular category the loan categories are defined as follows prime loans typically made to creditworthy borrowers who meet the standards set by the gses21 alternative or alta loans which typically meet the gse credit score requirements they do not meet the standard requirements for documentation property type debt or qualifying ratios or loanto value ltv ratios fha targets alta borrowers although it does insure loans for borrowers with lower credit scores fha also allows more flexibility with respect to debt and ltv ratios than prime lenders and fha borrowers must comply with standard documentation requirements subprime loans are primarily made to borrowers with impaired or limited credit subprime loans do not have to meet the gse credit 19 continued community af f ai r s report 20061 revised j une 2007 at

interest rates were falling between 2002 and 2005 the overall foreclosure rate for prime loans was steady while subprime foreclosure rates declined markedly22 foreclosures began to rise in early 2006

foreclosure rate for all subprime loans during this period was 642 while the average foreclosure rate for all fha loans was 224 the foreclosure rate for all prime loans averaged 073 given low prime foreclosure rate relative to the other loan type categories and the fact that prime loans make up larger share of the mortgage market the overall foreclosure rate for all loans in the survey averaged 158 the maximum foreclosure rate over the entire period for all 22 fha foreclosures saw an increase arguably because some of its more creditworthy borrowers were refinancing out of fha these borrowers were either obtaining prime loans and longer paying fha mortgage insurance premiums or they wanted to obtain cashout refinances that exceeded the fha loan limits since house prices were rapidly appreciating hence the rise in the fha foreclosure rate might reflect decrease in the denominator of total mortgage loans rather than an increase in the numerator of total foreclosures crs10 loans in the survey was 275 which occurred during the second quarter of 2008 the rise in the overall foreclosure rate since 2006 therefore reflects the large increase in subprime foreclosure rates in figure 2 the composite categories have been further separated into fixed rate mortgage frm foreclosures and adjustable rate mortgage arm foreclosures from 2006 to the first quarter of 2008 subprime foreclosure rates were again the highest followed by fha and then prime loans23 foreclosure rates averaged 332 for subprime frm loans 814 for subprime arm loans 199 for fha frm loans 293 for fha arm loans 044 for prime frm loans and 146 for prime arm loans the nds does not report composite foreclosure rates for all frm loans or all arm loans based upon the information provided here however the overall frm and arm composite foreclosure rates are likely to be much lower than the equivalent rates computed for the subprime and fha categories furthermore the composite series of frm loan foreclosure rates is likely to be lower than composite series of foreclosure rates for arm loans24 the descriptive data in figure 2 indicate that many foreclosures were associated with arms and particularly subprime arms

was updated 24 see crs report rl33775 alternative mortgages causes and policy implications of troubled mortgage resets in the subprime and alta markets by edward vincent murphy crs11 microeconomic factors that help explain foreclosures include unanticipated changes in economic or personal circumstances examples of unanticipated changes in personal circumstances include divorce sudden changes in health and job loss given abnormal rise in national divorce rates or debilitating medical injuries those reasons do not fully explain the recent rise in foreclosures foreclosures could potentially be attributed to local labor market conditions for example foreclosures in ohio rose when its unemployment rate rose to approximately one percentage point higher than the annual us national unemployment rate 55 compared with 46 in 2006 rising job losses however still cannot entirely account for aggregate developments florida for instance had unemployment rates at or below the us national average during 2006 yet the state still experienced marked rise in foreclosures hence unanticipated changes in personal circumstances do not entirely explain the recent rise in foreclosures regional and more widespread macroeconomic factors that can translate into rise in foreclosures include slowdown in sales activity and the rate of house price appreciation declining sales activity increases the difficulty of borrowers with cash flow problems to avoid foreclosure because they cannot quickly sell their homes and reduce expensive mortgage payments falling house prices affects the ability to refinance mortgage and may even encourage some borrowers to stop making mortgage payments altogether25 homeowners with substantial equity in their homes arguably have greater incentive to cooperate with the lender and renegotiate an arrangement to avoid foreclosure foreclosures are however more likely to occur when homeowners have little 10 or less equity in their homes if the market value of house falls sufficiently below the value of the mortgage or if very little or downpayment was used to purchase the home the borrower may have financial incentive to walk away and not attempt steps to avoid foreclosure26 according to national us census bureau data new home prices fell by 411 between june 2006 and june 2007 and new home sales were down by 2218 during the same period according to the national association of realtors median existing home prices fell by 004 during the same period and existing home sales declined by 112527 hence selling home or refinancing mortgage perhaps prior to an interest rate adjustment on an arm loan that would result in substantial increase in the monthly payment appear to be less feasible options in the current market consequently rise in foreclosures would not be considered unusual given the recent 25 in some cases rising mortgage rates may have the same financial impact as falling house prices 26 see httpnewsbbccouk1hibusiness7529277stm although borrower with little home equity may not suffer major financial loss after foreclosure the subsequent ability to obtain loans may be severely affected for several years 27 the january 2006 to june 2007 time frame would have best coincided with the period that foreclosures began to rise as reported by the nds some of the housing price and sales data however are not seasonally adjusted making it necessary to use the june 2006 to june 2007 period for computing annual rates crs12 decline in housing market activity housing market activity and foreclosure rates are cyclical and typically move in opposite directions28 in addition to unanticipated housing market changes the mortgage market also experienced structural changes including the expansion of the subprime market prior to this expansion people with impaired credit were unable to obtain home equity or cashout refinance loans from prime market lenders furthermore when home prices began to exceed the maximum fha loan limits in various regions credit impaired borrowers looked for alternative credit sources hence the growth in subprime lending during the late 1990s and early to mid2000s enabled people evaluated as having lesser credit quality to gain access to mortgage credit by 2005 subprime loans accounted for an estimated 20 of all mortgage originations29 the recent housing market slowdown has revealed that subprime borrowers appear to be more susceptible than prime borrowers to changing housing market conditions and perhaps also more susceptible than those who satisfy current fha requirements for mortgage insurance estimates of foreclosure costs foreclosures are rarely profitable for lenders30 the legal fees lost interest property taxes other delinquent obligations incurred by the former homeowners eg association fees and selling expenses make foreclosures costly to lenders31 although many studies provide dollar value estimates of foreclosure costs it is difficult to know how cost estimates were

inflated prices using fraudulent appraisals or making shoddy repairs that pass inspections should home buyers suspect they may be victims of fraud and perhaps have loans higher than the actual property values they may simply choose to walk away and allow the property to be foreclosed upon under these circumstances the lender who is likely to be saddled with an overvalued property that must be repaired and resold may also be considered victim of fraud 31 although the generic lender term is being used this discussion is still applicable to investors who have servicers acting on their behalf 32 see desiree hatcher foreclosure alternatives case for preserving homeownership continued crs13 foreclosure for sample of loans at approximately 58759 per loan33 those costs include the interest lost during the delinquency period foreclosure costs and disposition of the property costs that the lender would be likely to incur the working paper does not state explicitly if these costs were paid by the lender nor whether the 58759 was an average or median amount per foreclosure but it did say the foreclosure process took an average of 18 months to resolve hence this reported dollar amount may be fairly representative of the actual costs incurred only by single lender presumably in 200234 foreclosure costs are farreaching in addition to losing their homes borrowers are likely to find it difficult to obtain credit in the future even at high interest rates lenders suffer the losses associated with acquiring the property from the borrower settling outstanding claims repairing any damages and selling the property local governments may face the problem of vacant units in neighborhoods and loss of tax revenues foreclosure may reduce the value of neighboring homes as result foreclosure is something that parties directly and indirectly involved with the property would want to avoid35 32 continued profitwise news and views published by the federal reserve bank of chicago

costs in order to obtain the net cost of foreclosures to lenders if this figure is net costs then estimated foreclosure costs reflect current market conditions at the time the estimates were computed foreclosure costs are likely to be higher during 2006 and 2007 when housing market activity has slowed lenders would be unable to turn over foreclosed properties as quickly and market prices have
