620zc12 shspec110 prepclearing sec checking is out prepclearing is newly born it sounds better for one thing and it is preparatory to clearing hence the prep auditors havent learned sec checking very well despite lots of efforts to teach them to do it so it is probably hard to do there must have been some element missing so lrh has been working on the subject of withholds realizing that if nothing was missing he should have been able to articulate it well enough so that auditors could get it and do it easily he has done remarkable things with pulling withholds now and then but maybe there is more to the mechanism he had been aware since the first of the year that if he couldnt relay it so that auditors could get resurgence after every time it was done then there must be some kind of variable in it missed withholds was the first discovery that resulted from this research they have proved out as the source of all the arc breaks and natter you get the proof is that when you pull the missed withhold the arc breaks and natter disappear and the pc gets case gain that had been missed before this is not variable it is not true that every time you miss withhold you will get an arc break but it is true that every arc break comes from missed withhold the only effective thing to do about it is to pull the missed withhold punishment has been tried in the past and it hasnt worked explaining and protesting also dont work so you have business trying to handle the pcs arc break with you except by pulling the missed withhold which is most likely to have been in the session you are running since to the pc present time things are more important than the past what the missed withhold is composed of monitors what rud goes out ptp is missed withhold in life an arc break is missed withhold in session etc shouldhaveknown is an unknown which puts us back to sec checking with unknown auditors doing that were putting people into engrams and trying to run the engrams with them it wasnt running well although it was successful at shaking up the bank the whole subject of withholds is notknow and unknowns missed withhold is halfknown halfunknown there seems to be enough charge to cause polarity that sets off godawful agitation in the bank it can be halfknown to the pc being halfknown analytically and half reactive hence half unknown unknow plays heavy part in 3dxx the notknow that is most important is the shouldhaveknown this is regret it bunches up the bank something half known is very disturbing it seems dangerous and makes one freeze up the regret mechanism is what turns 3dxx valence into ball and loops the time track the mechanism of looped time track is due to just one thing shouldhaveknown this smashes everything into the one time zone of valence it adds up to feeling that one shouldnt have done shouldnt have confronted shouldnt have experienced so the prior pictures of having experienced are invalidated at once so he tries to say this never happened and we get the occlusion of the whole track shouldhaveknown is apparently the most important button in the bank this is the sequence leading to occlusion 1 he should have known something 2 he didnt know it 3 one gets regret this smashes everything into the one timezone of valence 4 this adds up to feeling that one shouldnt have done confronted experienced 5 he invalidates prior pictures of having experienced 6 he tries to say they never happened 7 we get whole track occlusion the only thing that reduces pcs profile after auditing is arc breaks but what produces an arc break is should have known via missed withhold so you can remedy arc breaks with should have knowns this universe has quantitative button it isnt the number or size or gruesomeness of the withholds you get that gives you case gain it is just the thoroughness with which you get withhold the quality of your auditing which gives the degree of case gain freud was always trying to get the one button that would produce big resurgence in the case he must have done it at least once to have such faith in it he never taught it to anyone but he must have had some success with it he was looking for withhold he was looking in one area sex and one time childhood which circumscribed it too narrowly his occasional successes were what gave psychoanalysis its success and repute even though they didnt know what they were doing you have two choices when dealing with missed withhold 1 do full dress job of knocking out all the shouldhaveknowns on the subject in this lifetime or 2 just get and knock out the latest keyin which way you do it depends on how successful you are with the light shouldhaveknown touch on the latest keyin if the pc stays arc broken or quickly rearc breaks you will need the full works per hcob 12feb62 how to clear withholds and missed withholds starting from the difficulty being handled finding what the withhold is when all and who should have known repetitively per the rules in that bulletin if you work this system you will find all of the basic buttons on the case will just roll out if you can do it by the numbers exactly per the above bulletin even chronic somatics will straighten out they will come back during 3dxx but this withhold system does give the resurgences that freudian practitioners are looking for prepchecking is the system of getting each rudiment in so it stays in fairly permanently during 3dxx it uses the same elements as the withhold system given above you could also do joburg form three with one of these things form three is the sec check form for new students see hcopl 22may61 the only valid sec check the zero question from form three would be any question from the form that you are trying to clear on the pc if you get read you move on to question number one what was that and more specifically what about subject of the sec check question write this down because you will have to clear that question it should duplicate as nearly as possible the pcs reply to the zero question and its read pc never refuses to tell the auditor but he sometimes doesnt tell because he doesnt know it is the auditors job to get the pc to look and to help him find the answer it may be so charged that he doesnt want to look but it is up to you to get him to look it is ok to be positive in getting him to look but if you ever imply he knows and wont say you have admitted that he is out of session and you have got games condition going so that point never comes into the session you must clear questions 0 and 1 if they clear without 2 3 and 4 fine when you first get into question 2 you dont have to be precise but if you have to cycle through it again get it more precise so as to spot it exactly if it doesnt clear question 2 is when the withhold occurred to clear question number one run 2 3 4 until 1 is cleared when it is clean check 0 again etc questions 2 3 and 4 are the way to blow the withhold to halifax so it never comes up again if in compartmenting the question you get read on subquestion that now becomes the zero question it is more important to handle one withhold question well than thousands indifferently it is not the quality of the withhold that counts it is how much of it is submerged out of sight if he has done something horrendous and knows about it it isnt going to aberrate him matter how tempting it may be to blame his condition on it you will find that it is out of some stupid little incident run back on stack of things the pc did that you recover recollections on bring them back to view and the pc confronts them and his case will tend to resurge it is good idea to take up any sec check question the pc has gotten reads on recurrently take it as the zero question get the what clean it thoroughly with 2 3 and 4 because it must be halfknown or it wouldnt be reading recurrently any difficulty could be handled that way it is fundamental question you may not get much in the way of cognitions for awhile as your zero question keeps reading but eventually things will begin to blow and it will all fall apart nothing will read on an emeter that is not significantly charged and nothing will fall on an emeter that is not unknown in part to the pc if the emeter registers there must be something unknown at least in part the only thing you will get into and difficulties with is converting the zero question to the what question dont vary the zero or what questions 2 3 and 4 neednt be rote though you shouldnt get yappy on them just be natural with it you only use the meter to test one and zero do not take past life answers when using this system pcs will duck into the unreality of yesterday to avoid the withhold in this lifetime or they are trying to run the whole bank on this process and this process wont run the whole bank 3dxx is for handling past lifetimes you wont get any gains running past lives on this withhold system
