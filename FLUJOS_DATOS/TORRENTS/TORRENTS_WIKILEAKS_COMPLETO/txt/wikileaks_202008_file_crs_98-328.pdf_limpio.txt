attorney american law division summary on march 12 1998 the senate committee on commerce science an d transportation favorably reported two bills that would restrict material on the internet deemed harmful to minors s 1482 srept 105225 would require anyone i n interstate or foreign commerce or through the world wide web who is engaged in the business of the commercial distribution of material that is harmful to minors t restrict access to such material by persons under 17 years of age s 1619 srept 105226 would require elementary schoo ls secondary schools and libraries that accept universal services under 47 usc 254h1b to install on their computers with internet access system to filter or block matter deemed to be inappropriate for minors this report summarizes and discusses interpretational issues in these two bills an d addresses first amendment issues that they raise s 1482 summary and interpretation s 1482 105 congress would require anyone in interstate or foreign commerc eth or through the world wide web who is engaged in the business of the commercia l distribution of material that is harmful to minors to restrict access to such material by persons under 17 years of age it would impose criminal penalties of fines an d imprisonment for violations it would define material that is harmful to minors as any type of communication in words pictures or sound that i taken as whole and with respect to minors appeals to prurient interest in nudity sex or excretion ii depicts descr ibes or represents in patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts or lewd exhibition of the genitals andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98328crs2 iii lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value this definition parallels the supreme courts definition of obscenity which i s pornography that is not protected by the first amendment even for adults in miller v california 413 us 15 24 1973 the court held that to determine whether work is obscene it asks whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work taken as whole appeals to the prurient interest b whether the work depicts or describes in patently offensive way sexual conduct specifically defined by th applicabl state law and c whether the work taken as whole lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value in pope v illinois 481 us 497 500 1987 the supreme court clarified that the first and second prongs of the miller test appeal to prurient interest and paten t offensiveness are issues of fact for the jury to determine applying contemporar community standards however as for the third prong the proper inquiry is t whether an ordinary member of any given community would find serious literary artistic political or scientific value in allegedl obscene material but whether reasonable person would find such value in the material taken as whole s 1482 does not specify what standards are to be used in applying its threeprong definition of material that is harmful to minors because it does not mentio n community standards but refers in its first two prongs respectively to with respect to minors and with respect to what is suitable for minors court might construe it t intend national standard to apply to these two prongs court would also seem likely to apply uniform standard to the third prong as the supreme court in pope v illinois cited constitutional basis for prescribing reasonable person standard for the thir d prong of the miller test it wrote the first amendment protects works which taken as whole have serious literary artistic political or scienti fic value regardless of whether the gover nment or majority of the people approve of the ideas these works represent 481 us at 500 the court has not addressed whether the first amendment protect s such works even with respect to minors but it seems likely that court would construe the third prong of the definition in s 1482 as governed by reasonable person standard as for how provider would have to restrict access s 1482 provides it is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this subsection that the defendant restricted access to material that is harmful to minors by persons under 17 yea rs of age by requiring use of verified credit card debit account adult access code or ad ult personal identification number or i n accordance with such other procedures as the federal communications commission may prescribe s 1482 does not provide that these are the only methods provider may use t restrict access it provides merely that these are acceptable methods retailer f magazines who engaged in interstate commerc could presumably comply with the law by checking potential purchasers driv ers licenses or other ids s 1482 does not define the terms it uses in setting f orth the above affirmative defenses it is unclear therefore whathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98328crs3 it means by verified credit card and thus whether it would be illegal for example to provide material to minor whom the provider may or may not know to be minor who uses his parents c redit card with or without parental permission which the provider of materials verifies to be an active credit card s 1482 appears to contain other uncertainties as well it does not state whether it would apply to internet service providers such as america online as well as to persons who post material as both may be viewed as engaged in the business of the commercial distribution of material in this regard s 1482 might be construed as limited by 4 7 usc 230c1 which provides provider or user of an interactive compute r service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider s 1482 also does not define commercial distribution and thus leaves uncert ain whether magazine whether paper or electronic that includes paid advertising but is made available for free is commerc ial as noted below this could make difference as to the constitutionality of the bill s 1619 summary and interpretation s 1619 105 congress would require elementary schools secondary schools andth libraries that accept universal services under 47 usc 254h1b to install on their compu ters with internet access system to filter or block matter deemed to b inappropriate for minors sc hools would be required to install such system on all their computers with internet access but libraries would be required to do so only on one or more of their computers with internet access this would ensure that in libraries adults would not be restricted in their access to material deemed inappropriate for minors unless the library has only one computer wit h internet access and the filtering or blocking software cannot be turned off when adults use the computer s 1619 would require schools and libraries that accept universal services to certify to the federal communications commission that they are in compliance with th requirements of the bill under s 1619 the determination of what matter i s inappropriate for minors shall be made by the school school board library or othe r authority res ponsible for making the required certification s 1619 does not however provide any standards for determining what matter is inappropriate to minors and does not limit such matter to matter dealing with sex or any other subject s 1619 als prohibits any federal agency or inst rumentality from reviewing the determination made by the certifying school school board library or other auth ority instrumentality is not defined so might be construed to include federal courts but this would apparently t preclude state court review it is not clear whether even if instrumentality is construed to include federal courts s 1619 would preclude federal court review of determination of what matter is inappropriate for minors if such determi nation is made not only pursuant to s 1619s certification requirement but is made simultaneously pursuant to state r local law s 1482 and the first amendment the first amendment provides that congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press the supreme court has held that the firs t amendm ent applies to pornography with two exceptions obscenity and chil dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98328crs4 pornogr aphy obscenity as noted above is the subset of pornography defined by th miller test child pornography is material that visual ly depicts sexual conduct by children and is unprotected by the first amendment even when it is not obscene ie child pornography need not meet the miller test to be banned pornography that constitute s neither obscenity nor ch ild pornography because it is protected by the first amendment may not be banned with respect to adults but it may be regulated to some extent as to the time place and manner of its distribution or exhibition in addition the supreme court has upheld statutes that prohibit access by minors to material deemed harmful t minors eg ginsberg v ne w york 390 us 629 1968 fcc v pacifica foundation 438 us 726 1978 sable communications of california inc v fcc 492 us 115 1989 in its most recent decision on the constitutionality of statute intended to protec t minors from harmful material the supreme court in reno v american civil libertie s union 117 s ct 2329 1997 struck down two sections of the communication s decency act cda these sections would h ave prohibited indecent communications by telephone fax or email to minors and would have prohibited use of an interactiv computer service to display indecent material in manner available to person under 18 years of age this latter prohibition would have in effect banned indecency fro m public ie nonsubscription web sites the courts concern in reno focused on the cdas potential restriction on the free speech rights of adults and its potential interference with re lationships between parents and older teenagers as for adults the court wrote in order to deny minors access to potentially harmful speech th cda effectively suppresses large amount of speech that adults have constitutio nal right to receive and to address to one another that burden on adult speech is unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives would be at least as effe ctive in achieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted to serve as we have explained th government may not reduce the adult population to only what is fit for children id at 2346 as for its concern with relationships betw een parents and older teenagers the court in reno wrote under the cda parent allowing her 17yearold to use the family comput er to obtain information on the internet that she in he r parental judgment deems appropriate could face lengthy priso n term similarly parent who sent his 17yearold colleg freshman information on birth control via email co uld be incarcerated even though neither he his child nor anyone in their hom communi ty found the material indecent or patently offensive if the college towns community thought otherwise id at 2348 the court in reno referred to possible alternatives to the cda such s requirin g that indecent material be tagged in way that facilitates parental control f material coming into their homes making exceptions for messages with artistic r educational value providing some tolerance for parental choice and regulating som ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98328crs5 portions of the internet such as commerc ial web sites differently from others such as chat rooms id as noted the lack of definition in s 1482 of commercial distribution leave s uncertain whether s 1482 would pply to web site that is freely accessible but includes paid advertising if not if s 1482 is construed to apply only to web sites that require users to subscribe or register or to we b sites that offer for sale material that is harmful to minors then it would appear to avoid the first amendment impediments the cour t identified in reno this is because if s 1482 is construed to ap ply only to such web sites then providers would have the capacity to require users to certify their age or to use verified credit card or other means specified in the affirmative defense provision of the bill providers could thus comply with the bill without restrict ing adults access to material deemed harmful to minors in addition s 1482s exclusion fro m its definition of material that is harmful to minor s of material with serious literary artistic political or scientific value would seem to allay the courts concern with censorship of birth contro l information and the like if however all web sites with advertisements were construed to be engaged i n commercial distribution so that s 1482 would apply to them then s 1482 woul d appear to be unconstitutional b ecause as the supreme court said in reno with respect to the cda it would effectively suppress large amount of speech that adults have constitutional right to receive and to address to one another s 1619 and the first amendment s 1619 unlike s 1482 would not impose criminal penalties on the exercise f speech it would limit access to speech only as condition to the acceptance of federal benefit the constitution grants congress the power to provide for the genera l welfare of the united states and incident to this power congress may attac h conditions on the receipt of federal funds and has repeatedly employed the power t further broad policy objectives by conditioning rec eipt of federal moneys upon compliance by the recipient with federal statutory and administrative directives south dakota v dole 483 us 203 206 1987 in rust v sullivan 500 us 173 193 1991 th supreme court held that the government may choose to fund one activ ity to the exclusion of another legislatures decisi on not to subsidize the exercise of fundamental right freedom of speech doe s not infringe the right see also national endowment for the arts v finley 66 uslw 4586 us june 25 1998 nevertheless as even rust and finley indicated there are limits to the speec h restrictions that congress may impose in connection with its spending power s 1619 by not providing any standards for determining what matter is inap propriate for minors and by not limiting such matter in any way could be construed to authorize schools an d libraries to deem material inappropriate for minors and to filter or block it for an reason they could filter or block material even if it had serious literary educational artistic political or scientific value for minors and they could do so solely because they deemed the ideas it expressed inappropriate for minors f or example school or library official could find that w eb sites that discussed socialism or darwinism were harmful to minors because the official disagreed with socialism on political grounds or wit h darwinism on religious grounds there might of course be web sites that discus s socialism or darwinism that for rea sons other than their subject matter are inappropriatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98328crs6 for minors and school or library official could filter or block access to such web sites for such reasons under the first amendment however he apparently may not even for legitimate reasons deny students access only to material with which he disagrees n political religious or similar grounds for example although school or library official may deny stud ents access to semiliterate material generally he apparently may not deny students access to semiliterate discussions of darwinism but allow students access t semiliterate discussions of creationism two supreme court decisions in particular support these c onclusions first in board of educati on island trees school district v pico 457 us 853 1982 plurality f justices held that lthough school boards must be permitted to establish and apply their curriculum in such way as t transmit community values they may not remove books from school library shelves simply because they dislike those books and seek by thei r removal to prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics nationalism religion or othe r matters of opinion second in rav v city of st paul 505 us 377 1992 th court struck down an ordinance that prohibited the placing on public or private property of symbol such as burning cross or nazi swastika which one knows or s reasonable grounds to know ar ouses anger alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race color creed religion r gender the minnesota supreme court had construed the ordinanc to apply only to conduct that amounted to fighting words which are t protected by the first amendment the us supreme court h eld however that although fighting words may be proscribed because of their constitutional ly proscribable content they may not be made the vehicles for content discrimination unrelated to thei r distinctively pr oscribable content thus the government may proscribe fighting words but it may not make the further content discrimination of proscribing particular fightin g words on the basis of hostility towards t he underlying message expressed by analogy it appear s that even though school or library official might deny minors access t material for legitimate reasons or may in fact deny minors all access to the internet he may apparently not proscribe to minors only materia l with which he disagrees for political religious or similar reasons neverthel ess s 1619 would not appear to grant school or library officials any new power to engage in these possible unconstitutional acts they can engage in them now apart from s 1619 and are subject to being judicially overturned s 1619 would at most seem to preclude federal but not state jud icial review of such acts this would not appear to render s 1619 unconstitutional s 1619 may how ever have an unrelated constitutional problem if it were applied to library that had only one computer then s 1619 would apparently in contravention of reno v ac lu effectively suppress large amount of speech that adults have constitutiona l right to receive and to address to one another of course this would not be the case if the filtering or blocking software could be turned on or off for eac h individual user depending on his age we note that co nstitutional law in this area is in flux as challenge to the loudoun county virginia public librarys intern et restrictions which apply to adults and children makes its way through the federal courts on april 7 1998 federal judge refused t dismiss the case mainstream loudoun v board of trustees 972049a ed va
