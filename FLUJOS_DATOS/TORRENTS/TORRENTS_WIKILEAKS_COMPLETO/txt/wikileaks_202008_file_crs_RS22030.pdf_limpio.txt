strengthening police and judicial cooperation by kristin archick background on eu efforts against terrorism the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states and the subsequent revelation of qaeda cells in europe gave new momentum to eu initiatives to combat terrorism and other crossborde r crimes for many years eu efforts to address such challenges were hampered by national sovereignty concerns insufficient resources and lack of trust among law enforcement agen cies immediate european efforts following september 11 to track down terrorist suspects and freeze financial ssets often in close cooperation with us authorities produced numerous arrests especially in belgium france germany italy spain and the united kingdom germany and spain were identified as key logistical nd planning bases for the attacks on the united states as result european leaders recognized that the largely open borders within the then15 member eu and europes di fferent legal systems

november 11 2007since the 2001 attacks the eu has sought to speed up its efforts to harmonize national laws and bring down barriers among member states law enforcement authorities so that information can be meaningfully sh ared and suspects apprehended expeditiously among other steps the eu has established common definition of terrorism and list of terrorist groups an eu arrest warrant enhanced tools to i nvestigate terrorist financing and new measures to strengthen external eu border controls the eu has been working to bolster europol its fledgling joint criminal intelligence body and eurojust unit charged with improving prosecutorial coordination in crossborder crimes the march 2004 terrorist bombings in madrid injected greater sense of urgency into eu counterterrorism efforts and gave added impetus to eu initiatives aimed at improving travel document security and impeding terrorist travel in the wake of the madrid attacks the eu also created new position of counterterrorist coordinator key among the coordinators responsibilities ar enhancing intelligencesharing among eu members and promoting the implementation of already agreed eu antiterrorism policies some of which have bogged down in the gislative processes of individual members the july 2005 terrorist attacks on l ondons mass transport system prompted additional eu efforts to improve police judicial and intelligence cooperation in december 2005 the eu adopted new eu count erterrorism strategy outlining eu goals to prevent protect pursue and respond to the international terrorist threat the eu also set out plan to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment following the plot foiled in august 2006 to bomb airliners flying from the uk to the united states the eu reached political agreement on package of new measures to improve and harmonize air security among its member states in november 2007 the european commission the eus executive proposed new counterterro rism package among other measures it targets terrorist activities over the internet that incite violence and promote terrorist recruitment or training calls for improving the security of explosives and proposes an euwide system for the exchange of airline passenger data see below these proposals must now be considered and pproved by the member states2 useu counterterrorism cooperation progress to date as part of the eus efforts to combat terrorism since september 11 the eu has made improving law enforcement cooperation with th united states top priority the bush administration and many members of congress have largely welcomed this eu initiative in the hopes that it will help root out terrorist cells in europe and beyond that could be planning other attacks against the united states or its interests this is in line with the 911 commissions recommendations that the united states should develop comprehensive coalition strategy against islamist terrorism exchange terrorist information with trusted allies and improve border security through better international cooperation some measures in the re sulting intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 and in the implementing recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 pl 11053 mirro r these sentiments and are consistent with useu counterterrorism efforts pecially those aimed at improving border controls and transport securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22030crs3 3 on the us side the state department has the lead in managing the interagency policymaking process toward enhancing useu police judi cial and border control cooperation while the justice and homeland security departments provid the bulk of the legal and technical expertise the treasury department has the lead on efforts to suppress terrorist financingdeveloping useu links contacts between us and eu officials from the cabinet level to the working level on poli ce judicial and borde r control policy matters have increased substantially since 2001 and ve played crucial role in developing closer useu ties the us departments of state justice homeland security and the treasury have been actively engaged in this process the secretary of state us attorney general and secretary of homeland security meet at the ministerial level with their respective eu counterpa rts at least once year and useu working group of senior officials meet s once every six months to discu ss police and judicial cooperation against terrorism europol has posted two liaison officers in washington dc and the united states has stationed an fbi liaison officer in the hague netherlands to work with europol on counterterrorism in november 2006 us liaison position was established at eurojust headquarters in the hague as part of wider useurojust agreement to facilitate cooperati on between european and us prosecutors on terrorism and other crossborder criminal cases us and eu officials have also bridged many gaps in their respective terrorist lists and ve developed regular dialogue on terrorist financing us secret service liaison posted in the hague works with europol on counterfeiting issues in addition the united states and th eu have established highlevel policy dialogue on border and transport security to di scuss issues such as passenger datasharing cargo security biometrics vi sa policy and sky marshals3 new law enforcement and inte lligence cooperation agreements us eu efforts against terrorism have produced number of new accords that seek to improve police and judicial coopera tion in 2001 and 2002 two useuropol agreements were concluded to allow us law enforcement aut horities and europol to share both strategic information threat tips crime patterns and risk assessments as well as personal information such as names addresses and criminal records useu negotiations on the personal information accord proved espe cially arduous as us officials had to overcome worries that the united states did not meet eu data protection standards the eu considers the privacy of personal data basic right and eu regulations are written to keep such data out of the hands of law enforcement authorities as much as possible eu data protection concerns also reportedly slowed negotiati ons over the 2006 useurojust cooperation agreement noted above in september 2006 president bush trans mitted to the senate for its advice and consent two new treaties signed with the eu on extradition and mutual legal assistance mla these treaties agreed in 2003 s eek to simplify the extradition process and promote better prosecutorial cooperation th us death penalty and the extradition of eu nationals posed particular challenges in these negotiations washington effectively agreed to eu demands that suspects ex tradited from the eu will not face the death penalty which eu law bans us official s also relented on demands that the treaty guarantee the extradition of any eu national they stress however that the extradition accord modernizes existing bilateral agreements with individual eu members the mla treaty will provide us au thorities access to european bank account information speed mla request processing and permit joint investigations the treaties must now behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22030crs4 4 the white house also transmitted for senate advi ce and consent separate bilateral instruments signed by the united

ratification before they can enter into force4 in april 2007 the united states and the eu also signed an agreement that sets common standards for the security of classified information to facilitate the exchange of such information border control and transport security the united states and the eu have been placing increasing emphasis on coopera tion in the areas of border control and transport security as seen by the creation of the highlevel policy dialogue on these issues several agreements have also been concl uded in april 2004 the united states and eu signed customs cooperation accord among ot her measures it calls for extending the us container security initiative csi throug hout the union csi stations us customs officers in foreign ports to help prescreen usbound cargo containers to ensure that they do not contain dangerous substances ch as weapons of mass destruction in may 2004 the united states and eu reached an agreement permitting airlines operating flights to or from the united states to provide us authorities with passenger name record pnr data in their reserva tion and departure control systems within 15 minutes of flights departure this accord was controversial because of fears that it compromised eu citizens data privacy righ ts as result the european parliament lodged case against the pnr agreement in the eu court of justice in may 2006 the court annulled the pnr accord on grounds that it had not been negotiated on the proper legal basis eu officials stressed however that the court did not rule that the agreement infringed on eu citizens privacy rights in july 2007 the united states and the eu concluded negotiations on new sevenyear agreement to ensure the continued transfer of pnr data us officials appear pleased with this new deal which will allow us customs and border protection to share pnr data with other us agencies engaged in the fight against terrorism will extend the length of time that the united states can store such data and will per mit the united states to access sensitive information about passengers race ethnicity re ligion and health in exceptional circumstances the new accord beginning in january 2008 will also re quire airlines to send data from their reservation systems to us authorities at l east 72 hours before flight departs us officials are also reportedly open to the new proposal from the european commission noted above for similar passeng er data regime in the eu in which the personal data of us citizens flying into or out of the eu would be transmitted to european border and custom authorities for c ounterterrorism purposes5 the united states and the eu have also pl edged to enhance international information exchanges on lost and stolen passports to pr omote travel document security through the use of interoperable biomet ric identifiers and to exchange information on aviation security technologies in addition the unite d states and the eu reportedly continue to discuss the use of armed air marshals on so transatlantic flights some european countries objected to us requirements i ssued in december 2003 for armed marshals on certain flights to and from the united states viewing guns on board planes as increasinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22030crs5 6 frattini claims major advance in data privacy dispute european report june 29 2007 travelers to us face personal data trawl the observer july 22 2007the security risks in april 2004 us offici als pledged to consider alternative measures for european countries opposed to armed air marshals ongoing challenges despite useu strides si nce 2001 to foster closer counterterrorism and law enforcement cooperation and shared commitme nt to do so some challenges remain some us officials doubt the u tility of collaborating with euwide bodies given good existing bilateral relations between the fbi and cia among other agencies and national police and intelligence services in eu memb er states many note that europol and eurojust lack enforcement capabilities and that national services are often reluctant to share information with each other let alone with us authorities meanwhile european officials complain that the united states expects intelligence from others but does not readily share its own others point out that european opposition to the us death penalty or resistance to handing over their own nationals may still slow or prevent the extradition of terrorist suspects and some differences persist in the us and eu terrorist lists for example some eu members continue to resist us entreaties to add suspected hamas related charities or the leba nonbased hezbollah to the eus common terrorist list data privacy also remains sticking poi nt washington would like to establish an umbrella agreement in which the eu would largely accept us data privacy standards as adequate and permit the routine transfer of personal data between eu and us law enforcement the eu resists this idea claiming that only tailored agreements will guarantee an added level of protection for eu citizens against possible us infringements of their privacy rights they point out that it would be burdensome for eu citizens to gain redress for any wrongs committed through the us judicial system observers suggest that any useu umbrella agreement is unlikely in the near term given ongoing european concerns to sharing personal data with us authorities european data privacy concerns have also been heightened by the controversy over us government program as part of efforts since 2001 to tr ack terrorist financing to secretly obtain banking records from belgian based consortium of interna tional banks swift or the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications in june 2007 the us and eu reached deal to allow continued us access to swift data for counterterrorism purposes but it remains contr oversial for some european politicians and privacy groups6 another challenge confronting us and eu officials is finding balance between improving border security and facilitating gitimate transatlantic travel and commerce the united states and the eu remain at odds over the us visa waiver program vwp and the eus desire to have it applied equally to all eu members the vwp allows for shortterm visafree travel to the united st ates from 27 countries most of which are in europe new eu members are eager to join the vwp but most are excluded due to problems meeting the program s requirements amid grow ing eu frustration president bush announced in november 2006 that he would ask congress to modify the vwp to allow new eu members and other interested states to qualify more quickly while also strengthening the programs security compone nts although some members of congress have expressed skepticis m about the vwp in general because of security concerns notinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22030crs6 7 europeans fear new us requi rements could hurt travelers new york times june 18 2007 eu hits at us plan to scan containers financial times august 2 2007that terrorists with european citizenship have entered the united states on the vwp other members are more supportive of exte nding the vwp to new eu members given their roles as us allies in nato and in the fight against terrorism in july 2007 congress passed the impl ementing recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 pl 11053 which in cludes changes to the vwp however eu officials remain disappointed with the legislation noting that some vwp requirements are still set too high to allow most new eu members to qualify in the near term furthermore eu offi cials are concerned about the acts mandate to create new us electronic travel authorization system which will require that visitors submit biographical information to us authorities prior to traveling to the united states they contend that this system will essentially comprise new type of visa requirement could be hardship for business travelers in par ticular and could infringe on eu privacy and data protection rights in addition eu offi cials are concerned with separate provision in pl 11053 that sets fiveyear goal of scanning all container ships bound for the united states for nuclear devices arguing that it could disrupt trade and would place heavy financial burden on eu ports and businesses7 some analysts also suggest that transatlantic tensions could negatively affect future useu cooperation against terrorism most eu members continue to view terrorism primarily as an issue for law enforcement and political action rather than problem to be solved by military means many europeans fear that the united states is losing the battle for muslim hearts and minds because of the war in iraq past prisoner abuse at abu ghraib and the detentions of terrorist susp ects at guantánamo bay some europeans have also expressed serious concerns about us renditi on policy and cia program to detain and question suspected terrorists outsi of the united states despite these frictions others assert that europe remains vulnerable to terrorist attacks and law enforcement cooperation will continue because it serves both eu and us interests us perspectives and issues for congress the bush administration and many memb ers of congress have supported efforts to enhance useu cooperation against terro rism although some skeptics worry that such useu collaboration could weaken str ong bilateral law enforcement relationships with eu members the bush administration ppears to have determined that the political benefits of engaging the eu as an entity on police and judicial matters outweigh the potential risks us officials say that the unions renewed initiatives in the police and judicial field may be the first steps on long road toward common eu judicial identity thus they assert it is in us interests to engage with the eu given europes role as key us law enforcement partner they also hope that improved useu cooperation on border controls and transport security w ill help authorities on both sides keep better track of suspected terrorists and prevent them from entering the united states or finding sanctuary in europe congre ssional decisions related to improving us travel security and border controls may also affect how u seu cooperation evolves in these fields the us visa waiver program cargo security and data privacy issues will continue to be salient issues for congress in this respect
