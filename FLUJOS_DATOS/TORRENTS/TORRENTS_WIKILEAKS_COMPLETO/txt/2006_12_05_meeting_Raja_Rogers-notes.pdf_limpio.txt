raja rogers meeting notes december 5 2006 carol at nataki school in detroit we taught on the premises although this is not advised in the public schools it is charter school important to have helpers the principal demanded teaching to be done during the school day the most we could do in 1 day was 8 that is moving quickly with governor who helped us couple of rooms set up we got all the flowers and put in buckets we bought bags of apples it took 4550 min to initiate the 10 12 yr olds we started the initiation and then we started another and governor took them out we read the questions on the form out loud because they took too long to read then there is the lunch break the 3 days of checking we did in 1 period 45 min for long time but its just not enough we didnt play maharishis tapes we got period and half approved eventually 1 hour and that was good length for the 3 days of checking you cant hold them for 2 periods 15 hours because it is too long for them too abstract material jeff murphy 18 in that week then carol at nataki school recently they taught 112 people in 3 weeks they brought teachers in from all over ohio indiana if you are not going to teach at the school you have to do it on the weekend because they would lose Â½ school day because they have to travel to the teaching location or we can see how it is school by school parents have meeting before the kids sign up and they sign permission form we used to do an intro one period the prep and the pi form in one period raja rogers we should be able to do 200300day candace and lindsay and i when teaching in estonia taught 308 people in one day using different technique that allowed us to teach many people carol down here in sarasota there is hotel with proper vastu and they have given many rcs here ray has the idea to rent the whole hotel to use for teaching the teachers can stay overnight there too jane concern has been raised that if many teachers come in and share in the initiations there wouldnt be enough income to sustain the organizers of the program over the year chris busch and the david lynch founda tion feel that those invited teachers should give most of income to those who set it up raja rogers that works for those who are selfsufficient but others need some money for travel etc we will work something out if you need to get hold of susie dillbeck she raja michael and raja konha us and sara are at mapi in colorado maharishi sent them there few days ago they are contemplating reopening the door to sell mapi produc ts wholesale to large chains plus health food stores and maybe having reps like recerts visit health food stores there would be commission on that maharishi wants to reenliven mapi because it helps us and also helps india there will probably be vicepresident for mapi for our domain to oversee it would be paying situation let know if you are interested new recertification course is announc ed for dec 23 2 week course and 4 week course they are asking that people register as soon as possible so they can work out the hous ing jeff murphy we just received some produc ts from mapi without the clear plastic shrink wrap around the cap but they do have safety seal unde r the cap customer service said they werent doing that anymore because they are being packaged in india i wanted to express concern because we have premium produc ts and charge premium price yet we dont have the safety seal that is standard for most produc ts raja rogers email about this and i will pass it on we just had rajas meeting about mapi jane one produc t idea healthful hair coloring raja rogers yes email any idea the clothing line is good but rather expensive india is now the largest grower of organic clothing raw materials stuart is the fulltime requirement waived for this course can parttime people be certified charlie the course office contacted bevan and he verified that it is not necessary to be fulltime ruth fees raja rogers 2000 for 2 weeks 4000 for 4 weeks this does not include food or hous ing if you need financial suppor t you are eligible for the 600 mo grant ray thursday is alcines birthday jeff moses if there are lot of govs in one area will there be consideration as to newly recertifying govs raja rogers we had this situation in asheville large number of teachers and smaller popul ation the situation was that they couldnt suppor t themselves so we want to avoid that but now with mapi reaching out to retail stores there are other areas of revenue opening up but the bottom line is that we dont want to have concentration of govs in one area unless it is large popul ation ruth new meditators have hard time settling down in the first month it would be good if we could teach them asanas and pranyama raja rogers nice if they could go on rc if person is in need of asanas or pranyama they should come in for regular checking and then it would be okay to teach them the first set of asanas and gentle pranyama safety first is the highest principle for example the shoulder stand there is very gentle way to not pull their lower back we dont want to strain people at all main thing is that we are not in competition with the yoga schools ruth someone i initiated used to do hot yoga raja rogers thats bikram yoga bikram used to call candace weekly to see if he could get his yoga at the raj etc tell people to take the asanas stepbystep sequential unfoldment encourage them to go to rc and perfect the first set or get the second set several days ago in the domes flying went to 15 hours experiences here continue to unfold to deeper layers its quite beautiful and quite spectacular jeff murphy yoga 16hour course raja rogers there are 4 courses that are being prepared more info will be released charts brochures etc are being
