research service the library of congress border and transportation security budget for fy2003 and fy2004 summary wellmanaged border is central to maintaining and improving the security of the homeland against terrorist threats although the department of defense dod will continue to provide an umbrella of protection against potential foreign threats to national security from other nations the new department of homeland security dhs has been given primary responsibility for securing the nations borders and for increasing the security of transportation among other responsibilities on september 24 2003 both the house and senate passed hr 2555 the first ever appropriation for dhs pl 10890 was signed into law october 1 2003 and provides 178 billion for border and transportation security functions for fy2004 the administration requested 173 billion for these functions while the house provided 176 billion and the senate 181 billion the omnibus appropriations resolution for fy2003 pl 1087 funded activities transferred to dhs to secure the borders and increase transportation security but the administrations request for fy2004 was the first attempt to submit an explicit integrated estimate of the funds needed by dhs for those activities the total amount provided for dhs for fy2003 was 297 billion of which 64 was for the operations of border and transportation security as identified in this report of the amounts appropriated for fy2003 and requested for fy2004 for these activities administration documents suggest that 27 of the funding for the accounts would be used for functions other than security for instance the us coast guard has responsibilities for boat safety programs including expenses for rescuing passengers of distressed watercraft customs administers trade laws many of which are concerned with import and export operations unrelated to security issues major issues in border and transportation security include determination of the optimum number of air marshals and airport screeners port security measures cargo security initiatives implementation of the visitor immigrant status indicator project us visit alien tracking system border security

introduction increasing border and transportation security are essential strategies for improving and maintaining homeland security border security entails regulating the flow of goods and people across the borders so that dangerous and unwanted goods or people are denied entry transportation security entails inspecting people and goods as they move among different locations within the country to reduce the possibility of terrorist attacks or the incursion of unwanted people or goods determining which goods and people are permitted and which are denied entry into the us involves system of good border management so that the distinctions are recognized without interfering with essential commerce and the legitimate free flow of citizens and authorized visitors across the borders the system must be capable of examining minute details of goods and people seeking entry but still fit within budget constraints and be administratively feasible improving transportation security has meant an expanded federal role in screening passengers and baggage traveling through airports and increasing the presence of federal officers aboard domestic and international flights with plans to extend that presence to other modes of transportation more intensively in the future finally these management systems must accomplish their functions with minimum of disruption of legitimate activities and without unnecessary intrusion into the civil liberties of persons affected by them major issues in border and transportation security include determination of the optimum number of air marshals and airport screeners port security implementation airline cargo security measures implementation of the visitor immigrant status indicator project us visit alien tracking system border security efforts at the northern border with canada extension of transportation security administration tsa border security efforts beyond airline security to other forms of transportation trains buses trucks and pipelines and funding for the coast guards deepwater effort to replace its aging ships and planes background the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 transferred the functions relevant funding and most of the personnel of 22 agencies and offices to the new department of homeland security dhs created by the act the dhs was organized in four major directorates border and transportation security emergency crs2 preparedness and response science and technology and information analysis and infrastructure protection the first directorate border and transportation security along with its close functional sibling the us coast guard are responsible for the first line of defense against terrorism as well as remaining responsible for securing and managing the nations borders included in this responsibility are the inspection investigative and enforcement operations of the former immigration and naturalization service ins which had been responsible for managing and coordinating entry into the us and enforcing immigration laws dhs border and transportation security objectives also include fulfilling the newly expanded federal role of the tsa in protecting the nations transportation systems initially involving airline passengers baggage and freight the customs function previously the responsibility of the department of the treasurys us customs service1 is now under the directorate the customs function administered by dhs together with the us coast guard are expected to effectively secure commercial traffic entering the nations ports the directorate includes planning office and training activity to assist state and local entities with homeland security objectives the directorate also assumes responsibility for inspecting and monitoring plants and animals entering the us to minimize the risk that noxious pests and diseases will be introduced into the country on january 24 2003 the department of homeland security began operations as separate federal department web sites were launched some employees given different locations to report for duty dhs managers began to issue directives to employees and preparations were made to begin the transfer of most functions including personnel and funds on march 1 2003 at the same time federal officials responsible for administering the new department also had responsibility for homeland security issues that could not await the full operations of an established bureaucracy not only was there suspected evidence of terrorist plans against the us being developed around the world but the us was also preparing to use military force to remove the existing rogue regime in the nation of iraq an effort that some believed could lead to increased terrorist threats to the us homeland operation liberty shield as the country anticipated the impending conflict with iraq considerable attention inside and out of the administration focused on the possible increased terrorist threat that could be present as result of the military campaign in response to the perceived increased threat on march 17 2003 the administration announced operation liberty shield2 as comprehensive national 1 the us customs service among the first of federal functions at the origins of the republic apparently remains in existence but in name only official dhs documents sometimes refer to operations pertaining to the customs function and link them to the bureaus of the directorate some documents refer to the us customs service but without reference to its location or operations some documents refer to dhs inspectors without distinguishing among their ins customs or animal and plant health responsibilities 2 for more detail on operation liberty shield see crs report rs21475 operation liberty continued crs3 plan to increase protections for americas citizens and infrastructure while maintaining the free flow of goods and people across our border with minimal disruption to our economy and way of life although some of its enhanced security steps will continue indefinitely operation liberty shield terminated on april 17 as the threat appeared to diminish as hostilities in iraq wound down in spite of its short duration as plan of heightened security operation liberty shield served as an example of the activities that could accompany any such alert furthermore the program served as an explanation of funds requested for dhs in bill requesting supplemental appropriations for operation iraqi freedom some of the requested funds could be expected to accomplish purposes that would remain in place after operation liberty shield was ended including those directed to border and transportation security border security land border security was increased by adding agents to the northern and southern border regions including additional numbers between major ports of entry maritime security was increased by adding patrols of major ports and waterways more escorts of passenger ships and more sea marshals on board high interest vessels with cargoes crewmembers or other characteristics that warrant closer scrutiny in addition the coast guard enforced published security zones in close proximity to critical infrastructure sites in key ports transportation security operation liberty shield implemented additional airport security measures increasing the presence of law enforcement officers on patrol in and around airports new flight restrictions were established for the airspace over washington dc and new york city dhs requested states to provide additional police or national guard forces at specified bridges railroads including amtrak were asked to increase security at facilities and rail hubs and to improve the monitoring of hazardous materials hazmat and the trains carrying such materials shipping companies as well as trucking companies were encouraged to improve employee identification checks communications systems improved operator awareness and coordination between the us and canada on crossborder shipments of hazmat budget for homeland security the effective date for shifting most of the responsibilities from former departments and agencies to the new dhs was march 1 2003 while the transfer of functional lines of authority and the personnel to carry out those functions was relatively straightforward problems arose with initial attempts to ascertain the amount of the appropriated funds actually transferred because functions now performed by dhs were previously performed by predecessor agencies with somewhat different purposes than homeland security comparisons of responsibilities and analyses of requests for increased budget authority were difficult to develop the funding lines between fy2003 and fy2004 2 continued shield border transportation and domestic security updated by jennifer lake crs4 were not identical to lines of functional responsibility before and after transfer problem made more difficult because the basic documentation of appropriations in the presidents fy2004 budget was prepared after the formation of dhs but before final enactment of appropriations for the remainder of fy2003 furthermore the fy2003 appropriations bill was developed using the predhs configuration of appropriations accounts and functions while the presidents request for fy2004 used dhs and its administrative layout as the basis for the requests in the similar functional lines the administrations request for additional supplemental funds for operation liberty shield also used the new configuration given the different accounting purposes for appropriations lines before and after the formation of dhs amounts for the various functions of the new agency are not always directly aligned with previous accounts from which those functions were funded in their former agencies with the completion of appropriations for fy2004 baseline will be established making future appropriations decisions more easily compared to the previous years levels but at the moment we have comparable numbers for fy2002 which would be the base for showing the large increase in funding which has occurred in nearly all these programs for both 2003 and 2004 table 1 shows appropriations for various aspects of border and transportation security for fy2003 requested amounts for fy2004 amounts approved by each chamber and the conference committee as they completed work on hr 2555 appropriations for the department of homeland security for fy2004 the distinction between border and transportation security functions and other functions funded through the same account lines is somewhat arbitrary in this sense our analysis uses something akin to functional classification for border and transportation security consequently it does not include activities in the directorate for border and transportation security that have direct bearing on that function such as the office for domestic preparedness odp federal building protection and the secret service on the other hand this functional grouping does include the activities of the coast guard separate agency in dhs not part of the directorate for border and transportation security but which has an essential role in providing border and transportation security as those words are commonly understood as noted earlier definitions are arbitrary and some functions contained in other accounts that are related to border and transportation security such as those aspects of the science and technology account which improve that security are excluded from this table this table shows an approximation of costs for border and transportation security based on identifying the accounts for which such security functions are the primary function involved and do not reflect dhs breakdowns as to estimated amounts specifically associated with the directorate for border and transportation security crs5 table 1 summary of appropriations border and

observers indicate the need for additional funding in the area of border and transportation security the issue for congress is to determine the appropriate levels of such funding in the context of the current budget situation and competing claims for resources the following sections of the report provide detail concerning the operational components of border and transportation security these details include selected appropriation detail issues of potential interest to the conferees and discussion of some of the challenges facing the different components of border and transportation security securing the nations borders and transportation systems includes the regulation of imports and exports enforcement of laws pertaining to immigration and visitation borderrelated inspection of agriculture and livestock oversight of the security of ports federal inspection of airline passengers and baggage and comprehensive approaches to improving overall transportation security in addition to these explicit activities associated with securing the borders are set of disparate activities in support of broader goals which have been collected under the title border security these ancillary activities include protection of federal buildings training for law enforcement personnel and development of strategic plans and support assistance for state and local first responders this report excludes these ancillary activities from both the numbers and discussion of border and transportation security that follows3 some observers might question the exclusion of the bureau of citizenship and immigration services bcis from the discussion of border and transportation security there is question that homeland security is enhanced by the well managed administration of routine immigration services however such services would remain even in absence of any threats to the homeland immigration activities would continue in any event and including the cost of these activities would distort the true summary costs of border and transportation security4 3 for additional information on the office for domestic preparedness odp secret service and the federal building protection service see

that is they entail more investigation and evaluation in advance of enforcement activities bureau of customs and border protection bcbp although border security could be thought of as beginning with the procedures by which visas are issued at consular posts around the world border security functional responsibilities are at their most vivid at the point at which goods or people are expected to cross borders the bcbp has responsibility for security at and between portsofentry along the border these responsibilities include inspecting people and goods to determine that they are authorized entry and maintaining border crossing stations to process persons seeking entry to the us the inspection and borderrelated functions of the customs service the border security functions of the former ins including the border patrol and the inspection functions of the agricultural quarantine inspection aqi program are consolidated under the bcbp the customs function in the past the us customs service processed goods being imported into the us and collected duties and tariffs upon passage of the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 the functions of the customs service were transferred to border and transportation security at dhs the customs function is the first line of defense against illegal drugs contraband and other illicit goods entering the country and administers export laws including laws pertaining to illegal currency transfers exportation of sensitive and controlled commodities and other transborder crimes including those committed through use of the internet even before the events of september 11 2001 the customs service was aware of the difficulties inherent in performing its dual missions of enforcing laws to protect us borders against the illegal entry of goods and of regulating legitimate commercial traffic in fy2001 customs officers processed 142 million conveyances 472 million land sea and air passengers and over 23 million import entries with value

strategy had proceeded logically and its initiatives do improve compliance the overall impact on compliance rates remains small gao stressed that part of the challenge facing the agency responsible

the us immigration benefit fraud while ins officials noted the pervasive and serious nature of immigration benefit fraud according to gao evaluations ins was not positioned to adequately deal with it according to gao immigration benefit fraud had comparatively low priority within ins and thus it suffered from lack of resources for example in 2000 ins had 40 positions dedicated to fraud and detection while the four service centers received millions of applications for immigration benefits18 previous gao reports had concluded that ins also lacked comprehensive plan to coordinate benefit fraud investigations guidance to ensure the prioritization of cases an agencywide case tracking and management capability to maintain data on investigations and that adjudicating staff did not have access to appropriate data19 in response to these gao concerns ins developed strategic plan for combating immigration fraud mandated that all investigative components use the agencywide criminal investigative reporting system to track and manage all criminal investigations and required that all applications be checked against federal law enforcement database20 reducing employment of illegal aliens gao has reported that under the former ins resources allocated to work site enforcement were limited and that as result employers who hired unauthorized workers were unlikely to be investigated

that staffing levels for the irp actually decreased due to vacancies in the immigration agent position24 efforts to combat the smuggling of aliens alien smuggling is significant and growing enforcement problem and gao found that ins ability to implement and evaluate its antismuggling program has been impeded by lack of coordination lack of an automated agencywide case tracking system and

discretionary accounts as called for in the conference version of hr 2763 passed by the house on december 8 2003 at the time of atsas passage considerable attention was directed to the question of whether screening of passengers and checked baggage could best be conducted with federal workers or private sector employees under contracts supervised by the federal government the atsa required tsa to conduct pilot programs at five airports in which contract employees would conduct the screening tasks under the management authority of federal security director whether part time employees under

accommodate and install inline eds machines in addition to the logistical challenges to implementing inline eds systems funding for these projects remains key issue though atsa authorized the use of airport improvement program aip funds for airport security related projects using these funds can have an impact on other airport improvement projects the senate bill s 824 to reauthorize the federal aviation administration and related aviation programs contains provision to establish separate aviation security capital fund that would use money derived from passenger and air carrier security fees for these projects atsa contains general provisions for the screening of cargo on passenger aircraft but does not specify how this objective is to be achieved at present security of cargo carried aboard passenger aircraft primarily relies on socalled known shipper programs to detect and prevent the shipment of cargo from unknown sources aboard passenger aircraft to date security of allcargo operations has not received much attention30 gao reported that although the tsa uses the known shipper program to meet these atsa requirements tsa lacked comprehensive plan with longterm goals and performance targets for cargo security time frames for implementing security improvements and riskedbased criteria for achieving these goals gao recommended that tsa develop such plan and the tsa agreed31 gao also noted that tsa lacked reliable statistical data to estimate the nature frequency and risk of shipments of undeclared dangerous goods gao recommended that tsa determine whether it needed additional inspection authority to develop such data gao also estimated that revenues from the new passenger security fee would fund only approximately onethird of tsas budget with the

coast guard32 the coast guard is the lead federal agency for the maritime component of homeland security as such it is lead agency responsible for border and transportation security as it applies to us ports coastal and inland waterways and territorial waters the coast guard also performs other missions including some such as fisheries enforcement that are not related to homeland security the coast guard was transferred from the department of transportation dot to the new department of homeland security dhs on march 1 2003 the law that established dhs pl 107296 directed that the coast guard be maintained as distinct entity within dhs and that the commandant of the coast guard report directly to the secretary of dhs accordingly the coast guard exists as its own agency with dhs and is not part of dhss border and transportation security directorate the coast guard does however work closely that directorate33 mission vs resources in general34 key issue for congress regarding the coast guards role in border and transportation security concerns the adequacy of the coast guards resources for carrying out its various homeland and nonhomeland security missions even before september 11 2001 the coast guard appeared hard pressed to perform all its missions at desired levels with available assets and resources in the 2 years prior to september 11 2001 coast guard leaders and supporters attempted repeatedly to draw attention to this missions vs resources situation prior to september 11 2001 both the gilmore and the hartrudman commissions made specific recommendations regarding the coast guard the hart rudman commission noted that the coast guards ships and aircraft were aging and technologically obsolete and that the coast guard cutter fleet was older than 39 of the worlds other 41 coastguardlike naval fleets35 the commission noted that the coast guard faced serious readiness issues because of increased operating and maintenance costs and lack of essential capabilities in speed sensors and 32 this section was prepared with the assistance of ronald orourke 33 for more on the coast guards role in homeland security see crs report rs21125 homeland security

and missions coast guard for the twentyfirst century washington dc dec 1999 crs25 interoperability of it equipment and databases the commission recommended modernizing and rebuilding the coast guard the gilmore commission noted that the coast guard has taken on number of additional homeland security missions and that coast guard resources to perform its ordinary missions have been reduced in recent budget cycles with concomitant reduction in mission as an example the commission noted that the coast guard lacked sufficient resources to conduct port vulnerability assessments at the more than 350 us ports the commission recommended increasing resources for the coast guards homeland security missions but did not suggest level of appropriate funding36 the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 increased coast guard requirements for homelandsecurity missions including border and transportation security without obviously reducing requirements for other missions as result numerous observers have expressed increased concern for the coast guards ability to perform all its missions as desired levels gao testimony noted that levels of effort on homeland security related functions remain at much higher levels than prior to september 11 2001 while levels of efforts on missions including fisheries enforcement and drug interdiction have dropped substantially gao also stated that the fy2004 budget request for the coast guard contains little that would substantially change levels of effort for most missions and noted that if the fy2004 coast guard budget request is approved about half of the agencys operating expenses will be directed to fulfilling homeland security responsibilities37 few observers appear to oppose the general notion that the coast guards resources will need to be increased to bring them into better alignment with the services postseptember 11 2001 mission requirements the issue appears to center more on the question of the size of the increase that will be needed funding for deepwater program more specific coast guard budget issue concerns funding for the deepwater program the coast guards 20year acquisition program to replace and modernize its current aging fleet of deepwater capable cutters patrol boats and aircraft among other things these assets perform the outermost portion of the coast guards border and transportation responsibilities

guard awarded 17billion 20year contract for the deepwater program to an industry team led by lockheed martin and northrop grummans ship systems prior to the contractaward announcement the coast guard estimated that equipment acquisition for the deepwater program was estimated to require over 20year period an annual average of 530 million in constant ie inflationadjusted fy1998 dollars 500 million for the contractor and 30 million for coast guard administration of the program for total equipment acquisition cost of about 106 billion in fy1998 dollars the program has received total of 9142 million to date including 423 million in fy2001 3202 million in fy2002 and 478 million in fy2003 some observers have long been concerned about the coast guards ability to secure adequate funding for the deepwater program deepwater supporters are concerned that the annual funding requirement of 500 million in constant fy1998 dollars for the contractor is being reinterpreted in budget requests to mean flat figure 500 million per year in nominal dollars which will result in less and less actual purchasing power for the program each year due to inflation they are also concerned that the 500 million figure is being interpreted as including the annual 30million cost for coast guard administration of the program deepwater supporters argue that unless the program is funded at the equivalent of about 530 million per year in constant fy1998 dollars the deepwater program will become increasingly underfunded each year the coast guard estimates that funding the program at 500 million per year
