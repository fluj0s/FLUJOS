government and finance division the advisory panels tax reform proposals summary in november 2005 the presidents advisory panel on tax reform presented two potential reform proposals simplified income tax sit and direct consumption tax proposal the growth and investment tax or git both proposals would eliminate itemized deductions while allowing for all taxpayers credit for mortgage interest deductions and deductions for charitable contributions and health insurance both proposals substitute credits for personal exemptions and standard deductions both would allow greatly expanded taxpreferred savings plans sit would eliminate taxes on dividends and most capital gains from corporate stock simplify depreciation and allow expensing deducting costs immediately for small business and alter the international tax regime git as consumption tax would allow expensing of all investment git also includes tax on passive capital income dividends interest and capital gains both proposals are stated to be both revenue and distributionally neutral because the panel uses baseline assuming the 2001 tax cuts are permanent both would lose revenue compared to the congressional budget office cbo official baseline which has the tax cuts expire as provided by current law an additional revenue loss is expected in the long run because of the proposals for taxdeferred savings plans these measures also cause the income tax proposal to be slightly less progressive than current law the consumption tax proposal is likely to be significantly less progressive than current law the plans would simplify tax filing for higherincome individuals and the self employed lowerincome taxpayers could in some cases have more complicated tax returns much simplification rests on the assumption that many minor provisions not actually discussed will be eliminated an unlikely event in the case of certain provisions such as casualty losses and catastrophic medical expenses both plans would likely increase efficiency in the allocation of capital but these effects would be quite small for sit and lessened for git due to the tax on financial income the sit may magnify distortions in the allocation of capital around the world the effects on overall economic growth would be negligible for sit because of the limited change in marginal tax rates although there would be substantial reduction in effective tax rates on new investment under git the growth effects for this plan are uncertain and may be quite modest in any case they are not large enough to materially affect the budget outlook the effects on economic efficiency other than in the allocation of capital are mixed floor under charitable deductions along with expansion to nonitemizers would contribute to efficiency but the effects on health markets are unclear transition problems present difficulties the main issue with the sit would probably be in the loss of deductions for homeowners with large houses and mortgages these transition problems in the sit are minor however in comparison with the significant problems in the git arising from the loss of depreciation deductions interest deductions

income treasury study 20 the advisory panels tax reform proposals in early 2005 the president appointed tax reform advisory panel to formulate tax reform proposals the report of the presidents advisory panel on tax reform issued in november 2005 recommended two reform plans to consider 1 revised income tax referred to as the simplified income tax sit and 2 consumption tax coupled with tax on financial income referred to as the growth and investment tax git1 the income tax proposal or sit is an income tax reform proposal that broadens the base and lowers the rates the consumption tax or git is imposed as direct tax which includes cash flow tax on businesses and progressive tax on individual wage income consumption tax of this type is often referred to by the generic term flat tax when rates are flat and as an xtax when the tax on wages is progressive the git is not pure consumption tax plan because it also includes 15 tax on financial income interest dividends and capital gains rather it is consumption tax with wage credit and an addon tax on passive capital income at the individual level few individuals are likely however to pay much of that capital income tax because of the generous opportunities for taxfavored savings accounts the advisory panels report discussed and found some merit in considering partial replacement of the income tax with value added tax vat but did not propose such tax finally the report discussed but rejected retail sales tax as replacement for the income tax and also rejected full replacement of the income tax with vat note however that there are several congressional proposals that include value added taxes and retail sales taxes as well as income tax and flat tax proposals2 currently the reform proposals are being considered further by the treasury department which has recently released dynamic analysis that discussed the two tax reform proposals as well as third proposal progressive consumption tax pct that modifies the git by eliminating the 15 financial income tax and raising the top rate to 353 1 simple fair and progrowth proposals to fix americas tax system november 2005 which can be found at httpwwwtaxreformpanelgov 2 see crs report rl33443 flat tax proposals and fundamental tax reform by james m bickley 3 robert carroll john diamond craig johnson and james makie iii summary of the dynamic analysis of the tax reform options prepared for the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform us department of the treasury office of tax analysis may 25 2006 prepared for the american enterprise institute conference on tax reform and dynamic analysis may 2006 crs2 this report describes the two formal proposals and analyzes them based on revenue neutrality simplicity and administrative feasibility equity distributional effects and variety of economic effects the section on economic effects considers the effects on the allocation of capital overall effects on growth potential consequences of the international tax rules and effects of other tax incentives including health care charitable contributions and spending by state and local governments some of these sections also include brief mention of the pct the vat and the retail sales tax the report concludes with discussion of transition issues description of the proposals the tax reform plans have not been presented in legislative language and therefore details of the plans are not always clear many tax issues such as the treatment of casualty losses or alimony or capital gains on owneroccupied housing are not directly addressed but would presumably be addressed once specific legislative changes are contemplated4 however the major important features are clear changes in basic individual tax provisions both proposals the proposals generally have similar provisions that relate largely to the current individual income tax convert personal exemptions and standard deductions to credits replace the current rate structure 10 15 25 28 33 and 35 with four rates 15 25 30 and 33 in the sit and three rates 15 25 and 30 in the git repeal the alternative minimum tax amt increase the maximum earned income credit eic eliminate itemized deductions allow 15 mortgage interest credit for all taxpayers with the mortgage amount capped at the average price of housing in the region allow deduction for charitable contributions in excess of 1 of income for all taxpayers note deductions for state and local taxes would be eliminated allow deduction for the purchase of health insurance to taxpayers not covered by an employer plan and cap employers deductions for health insurance simplify the exclusion for social security benefits and index it eliminate the tuition tax credit and other education preferences significantly expand existing preferred savings accounts such as individual retirement accounts by allowing two savings accounts 4 technically the proposal appears to disallow casualty loss deductions even though these deductions were recently expanded for victims in the aftermath of hurricane katrina current law also allows alimony to be deductible by the payor and taxable by the recipient and presumably many divorce settlements take into account this tax treatment many other small tax provisions are not explicitly addressed in the proposal crs3 each with limit of 10000 income restrictions would apply the save for retirement account would replace existing individual retirement accounts with current limit of 5000 the save for family account would replace education and health savings accounts funds could be used for education health and first time home purchase simplify employer savings plans all individual savings plans would be converted to roth type plans not deductible up front and in the case of the git 401k and similar plans would be converted to rothtype plans as well simplify employer savings accounts and encourage and remove barriers to automatic enrollment and growth of contributions several provisions listed above would also have consequences for the taxation of investments in assets for owneroccupied housing the changes in mortgage interest and property taxes would affect the return on that investment tax burdens on capital income would also be affected by the preferred savings accounts business and capital income tax treatment under the income tax proposal sit the simplified income tax plan would make major revisions in the current treatment of capital income in addition to those affecting savings in preferred accounts and investment in owneroccupied housing as in the case of the individual structural provisions the treatment of some items is not entirely clear for example although the research and experimentation credit would presumably be repealed the expensing of intangible investment in rd would presumably continue the major changes are as follows eliminate taxes on dividends and reduce taxes on capital gains on corporate stock to more or less negligible level allow significant amount of expensing of investment in equipment as well as cash accounting for small businesses and cash accounting for medium sized businesses small businesses would be required to have separate business bank account repeal the corporate alterative minimum tax amt provide new simplified depreciation system eliminate most existing preferences eliminate the taxation of income from active business abroad but tax earnings from intangibles currently additional modifications of business and capital income tax treatment under the progrowth proposal git the git provides cash flow tax at the business level so that the treatment of investments that are currently expensed such as intangible expenditures on research and development would continue all investments and purchases are expensed deducted when paid old depreciation deductions phased out crs4 interest would not be deductible by business and interest income would not be taxable deductions and payment of taxes on interest on existing debt would be phased out taxes paid would be rebated at the border similar to the treatment of value added tax financial capital income dividends capital gains and interest would be taxed at 15 the progressive consumption tax pct plan studied by treasury would eliminate the tax on financial capital and obviate the need for savings accounts and would raise the top rate to 35 the vat would be similar to the pct but would not allow deduction at the firm level for wages and would not tax wages to individuals and therefore would eliminate all of the features of the individual tax including the mortgage credit and the deduction for charitable contributions for that part of the tax the vat was discussed however as partial replacement for the income tax revenue neutrality one of the objectives of the proposal was revenue neutrality how revenue neutrality is measured depends on the baseline used and the panel chose to use the administration baseline which included the permanent extension of the 20012003 tax cuts this baseline differs from the baseline used by the congressional budget office cbo which simply relies on the current tax law and thus assumes that temporary provisions including the 20012003 tax cuts will expire thus revenues raised under the administration baseline are smaller than those raised under the cbo baseline as result the revenues raised by the tax reform proposal are associated with substantial deficit and one even more substantial given that there is currently surplus in the social security account that will eventually disappear and become deficit over the period 20072016 in addition to the projected deficit of 08 trillion the cost of making temporary tax provisions except the amt permanent including debt service is about 23 trillion5 and these projections do not include the possibility that discretionary spending will rise to keep pace with national income which would increase the deficit by 16 trillion because the panel used the administration baseline any comparisons made in the analysis are with current law incorporating the 20012003 tax reductions nevertheless some additional source of revenue must eventually be identified which means that tax rates might need to be increased or tax preferences reduced and how that revenue is made up would affect the analysis note also that there are some smaller provisions that would be difficult to dispense with as discussed below and if they were restored an additional revenue shortfall would occur 5 based on data in crs report rs22045 baseline budget projections under alternative assumptions by gregg esenwein and marc labonte crs5 there is an additional reason that the proposals may not be truly revenue neutral even within the context of the baseline used the adoption of rothtype savings accounts reduces current losses from deductions in traditional accounts but loses revenue in the future such loss could be significant for example some rough estimates suggest that similar proposal by the administration that gained small amount of revenue in the budget horizon could eventually cost around 50 billion at current income levels an amount equal to about 4 of current income tax revenues6 simplification both proposals contain many elements that would simplify tax compliance the elimination of itemized deductions would simplify tax filing the proposal would however add complexity to current nonitemizing returns which account for 70 of all returns by allowing the charitable deduction health insurance deduction and mortgage credit some nonitemizers do not give in amounts that exceed the threshold for charitable deductions 1 of income and either rent their homes about third of the population rents or have paid off their mortgages but for those who have either mortgage payment or significant charitable deductions or who purchase health insurance tax filing will be more complicated charitable deductions in particular require record keeping although floors may eliminate the need of those with small contributions relative to income to do so the proposal on its surface also eliminates some itemized deductions that are difficult to dispense with such as the casualty loss deduction the deduction for extraordinary medical costs and the deduction for miscellaneous items such as employee and investment costs because the panel remained silent on these other itemized deductions there is way to know how they would be treated these exemptions all over floor except for casualty losses for hurricane victims in 2005 are designed to allow offsets for unusually large costs relative to income it is difficult to imagine not allowing some deduction for these extraordinary costs but allowing the deductions for all taxpayers would significantly add to the complexity of the tax form under current law two factors limit the claiming of these deductions to truly large costs the floor and the fact the deduction is itemized so that low income individuals must have significant dollar loss since itemized deductions are longer feasible since there is longer standard deduction restoring these deductions would be complicated and undo much of the apparent simplification with respect to itemized deductions there are also above the line deductions such as those for alimony and for moving expenses as well as some credits that might be thought desirable the child care credit whose retention might prove important given the extension of tax benefits to nonitemizers and the possibility of reintroducing some additional deductions it is not clear whether simplification for individual tax filers on the whole is increased or decreased considerably simpler approach to reform would have been to eliminate the state and local income tax deduction while leaving other 6 see crs report rl32228 proposed savings accounts economic and budgetary effects by jane g gravelle and maxim shvedov crs6 itemized deductions in place calculations based on the public use file suggest that change would have reduced the number of itemizers from 30 to about 207 all taxpayers should experience simplification from the collapsing of deductions exemptions and credits into single family credit and for higher income taxpayers from eliminating phaseouts and the amt higherincome taxpayers who save will also benefit from the simplified savings accounts allowing cash accounting and expensing for small businesses under the income tax would also significantly simplify their tax compliance although much of this benefit would be lost if state income taxes do not make similar adjustments the provision requiring small business bank accounts to be handled separately from personal accounts could complicate the affairs of those with occasional small amounts of selfemployment income unless deminimus rule were adopted an example would be professional who receives small consulting fee but whose major source of income is employment or skilled workman who occasionally moonlights complications would also occur for those who use assets for both business and personal use eg homes and cars although there is some simplification of the depreciation system for larger businesses most of the current complexities would remain as would most of the challenges in allocating international income for multinationals which cannot be eliminated the elimination of the production activities deduction is an important simplification however on the whole the income tax proposal appears to simplify the tax system for higherincome taxpayers and the selfemployed while possibly complicating it for lower and middleincome wage earners the consumption tax proposal should achieve more simplification for business because all acquisitions would be expensed in this system there is need to keep depreciation accounts or inventories fairness and equity issues of tax equity may concern vertical equity how effective tax rates rise as incomes rise and horizontal equity how different taxpayers with similar circumstances are treated the discussion below suggests that the income tax replacement has relatively small effects on either vertical or horizontal equity and indeed may increase inequities across family types it is more difficult to characterize the growth plan which is essentially consumption tax but there is case to be made that such tax would be much less progressive than the current income tax system in any case the distributional method used in the panels study for their progressive consumption tax is inconsistent with the one they suggest is appropriate for another economically equivalent consumption tax the vat 7 this information was provided by maxim shvedov of crs based on simulations from the statistics of income public use file crs7 vertical equity second objective of the panel was to maintain the current progressivity of the tax system the panels report shows both the sit and the git to be distributionally neutral at least across broad income classes there is detail about the extremely highincome individuals at the top who constitute only tiny fraction of taxpayers but large fraction of income note that this distributional comparison is with respect to the assumption that the 20012003 tax cuts which favored higherincome individuals are in place even so there are questions about the distributional neutrality of the plans proposals to reduce taxes on capital income through reducing or eliminating taxes on dividends capital gains and interest income would likely shift the burden other things equal away from highincome individuals to the middle class the commissions distributionally neutral system is likely in part temporary artifact of the shift into backloaded savings accounts which can raise revenue from owners of assets in the short run but lower it dramatically in the long run8 the magnitude of this effect is difficult to determine but analysis of the presidents budget proposals of this nature which had less generous contribution limits and negligible revenue effects in the budget window suggested the longrun revenue loss could easily be 50 billion or more at current income levels an amount equal to 4 of fy2005 corporate and individual income taxes this saving would accrue to individuals in the higher income levels as savings of any sort tends to be concentrated there distributional issues are far more problematic in the case of the consumption tax proposal although distributional tables are presented that also show distributional neutrality that conclusion is not clear as in the case with the income tax proposal some of the overall effect reflects the effects of savings accounts and these effects are even more important in the git because all defined contribution plans such as 401ks will be converted into backloaded plans moreover because dividends and capital gains are taxed under this proposal the longrun sheltering of income by highincome individuals may be even more important the effects will likely be larger than the effects in the sit which are already significant second and more important problem with evaluating vertical equity under the git is how to distribute the tax that is collected one might propose to allocate the tax according to consumption along with credit for wage tax reductions due to graduated rates indeed in discussing the vat which is also consumption tax the study indicates that tax would be allocated according to consumption and would be regressive not progressive requiring additional fixedrate credits and even in that case resulting in lower shares of tax paid by the highestincome individuals however for the git which is simply vat imposed in different form with wage credit different distributional methodology was used the business cash flow tax is allocated according to income and thus the tax is modeled as if it were an income tax 8 see crs report rl32228 proposed savings accounts economic and budgetary effects by jane g gravelle and maxim shvedov for an explanation of this budget effect crs8 consumption tax is tax on wage income and lump sum tax on old capital that is effectively collected over time as the assets are consumed for veryhigh income individuals who indefinitely pass on assets in estates that consumption may never occur if one distributed the tax on the basis of consumption the tax would decline as income rises despite the rate structure the tax was however distributed as if it were an income tax and thus the cash flow tax at the firm level which is really lump sum tax on old capital that may or may not be translated into an effective tax on consumption is treated as if it is tax on income and falls on highincome individuals to illustrate the importance of these approaches consider recent study that compared the distributional effects of an x tax with 15 and 30 rate and demogrant rebate to lowerincome individuals to offset the tax under both approaches9 this plan is similar in many respects to the panels proposal if distributed according to consumption the middle quintile has an effective tax rate of 233 the top quintile tax rate of 121 and the top 1 tax rate of 61 if distributed according to income the tax rate is 114 for the middle quintile 225 for the top quintile and 220 for the top 1 distributing consumptionbased tax in the short run is tricky and there is perfect answer because the cash flow tax is tax that causes asset values or their purchasing power to fall but does not burden new investment which can be purchased at discount however in the long run the consumption tax base tends to be similar to wage tax base except that it also favors higherincome people even in the long run because they are less likely to consume all of their lifetime wage income thus it is highly unlikely that the git is distributionally neutral it makes the tax system less progressive by largely exempting capital income from tax horizontal equity horizontal equity refers to the equal treatment of those with similar circumstances there are three basic issues of horizontal equity that could be considered equal treatment of different family sizes equity in the treatment of different age cohorts and equity in the treatment of taxpayers who vary in their preferences for taxfavored activities recent study used an equivalency index similar to the poverty levels that vary across family size to compare tax burdens on families of different sizes10 this analysis suggested that in the lowerincome levels families with children tend to be heavily favored compared to singles and childless couples with similar abilities to pay whereas the reverse is the case at the higher income levels the tax reform plans appear largely to preserve these features of the tax system the benefits for families with children at lower income levels arise from the earned income tax credit and 9 see leonard burman jane gravelle and jeff rohaly towards more consistent distributional analysis forthcoming in the proceedings of the national tax association 2005 conference 10 see jane gravelle and jennifer gravelle horizontal equity and family tax treatment the orphan child of tax policy forthcoming national tax journal september 2006 crs9 child credits which are maintained at higher income levels families with children are penalized because the adjustments for family size are not large enough this problem may be magnified by the converting of personal exemptions into credits but reduced by the repeal of the alternative minimum tax and phaseouts of deductions on the whole there appears to be major change in this aspect of the tax system consumption taxes such as the git inevitably shift the burden of the tax towards the current older generation and away from young and future generations essentially those with assets who expect to consume out of these assets are subject to substantially higher tax this shifting across the generations is relieved to some extent by the transition rules that allow some recovery of depreciation but this offset is quite limited that shift means that older people pay higher lifetime tax than younger or unborn generations the elimination of preferences for investment types the most frequent type of tax preference in the income tax is generally not viewed as important to horizontal equity in the long run since capital and pretax returns shift to equate returns after tax the tax revisions continue to favor homeownership although as seen below to lesser degree the proposals eliminate the preferences for taxpayers in states with higher taxes and appear to reduce the benefits for those covered by employer provided health care while allowing benefits for those not covered by employer plans charitable contributions effects are mixed as the benefit is provided to nonitemizers but also subject to floor on the whole the proposals appear to improve horizontal equity as measured on this basis efficient allocation of capital and the taxation of capital income in the broadest terms tax reform can alter economic behavior by changing the tax rates on labor and capital income one of the most important ways in which the tax reform proposals would affect the nature of the tax system is through changes in the taxes on capital income indeed the indications from recent dynamic analysis of the tax reform proposals suggest there is little or change in either average or marginal tax rates on labor income from the proposals it is largely in the treatment of capital income that the proposals have potential effect change in the treatment of capital income can improve economic efficiency if they lead to better allocation of capital to different uses in general more even taxation of different types of assets is more efficient if investors tend to equate returns after tax on different investments then more neutral taxation will more clearly equate the pretax or social return leading to higher level of output and wellbeing lower aggregate tax rate on capital income can also reduce distortions and lead to more optimal savings behavior the method for examining this issue begins with measuring the effective tax rate on the returns to capital invested in different types of assets in the absence of external effects or other market failures capital is allocated most efficiently when all returns are taxed in at the same rate and when financial choices are not influenced crs10 by the tax code11 effective tax rates can vary across physical assets such as equipment and structures across organizational forms corporate versus non corporate businesses and financial form corporate debt versus equity effective tax rates presented in this section are estimated effective rates on income from prospective investments they take into account the timing of deductions and the fact that tax benefit received today is more valuable than tax benefit received in the future because of the time value of money ie money received today can be invested and yield more money in the future see appendix for more detailed explanation these effective tax rates can differ substantially from average tax rates in the economy because the timing of deductions has different and in the long run more powerful effect on tax burdens on new investment than is reflected in average tax rate measures indeed it is possible for effective tax rates on new investments to be negative while average tax rates are positive however it is the effective tax rates on new investment that affect the allocation and size of the capital stock aside from the statutory tax rate the main provision affecting the tax burden on new investment is how quickly the cost of the asset is recovered via depreciation deductions when tax depreciation matches economic depreciation the effect is to tax the return to capital investment income in each period and the effective tax rate is the statutory rate when considering firms tax burden the same effect occurs as long as the present discounted value of depreciation deductions is equal to the present discounted value of economic depreciation deductions12 two opposing forces can affect depreciation and therefore effective tax rates because depreciation is based on historical acquisition cost the real value of depreciation deductions is undermined by inflation thus higher inflation means higher effective tax rates13 this inflation effect other things equal raises the effective tax rate more for shorterlived investments than for longerlived ones however depreciation deductions are generally allowed more quickly than the rate that would be justified by economic decline and that tendency is particularly pronounced in the case of equipment which increases the deductions value and leads to lower effective tax rate under current law most equipment assets for example have their costs deducted in five to seven years although they last much longer period of time the internal revenue code specifies that buildings are deducted over 39 years although residential structures are deducted over 275 years 11 market failure is technical term which indicates not that markets do not function but that they do not function perfectly so that prices represent true resource costs in practice market failures are numerous but in most cases are small or cannot be easily determined and quantified and thus make effective government intervention difficult or capable of worsening rather than improving the market failures 12 the present discounted value is the value of future dollar discounted by dividing it by 1rt where r is the interest rate and t is the time period for depreciation all of the values are summed up 13 higher inflation can however benefit debtfinanced investment if the tax rate of the firm is higher than the tax rate of the creditor because nominal rather than real interest is deducted crs11 the maximum acceleration of depreciation allows investments to be deducted when incurred and is feature of the consumption tax git at the firm level the effective tax rate on new investment is zero tax rates can be measured in different ways the tax rate at the corporate level on equity financed investment which is calculated first shows the effects of depreciation rules across asset type eg computing equipment buildings effective corporate tax rates can also be measured as the total tax at both the corporate and personal level which also reflects the deductibility of interest by corporations and the imposition of individual income taxes on interest dividends and capital gains this measure indicates the change in the total burden on corporate investment tax rates can also be separated into total rates on debt financed and equity financed investment to examine the degree of distortion that favors debt finance the total tax rate can also be compared with tax rates on noncorporate investment to measure the differential between the total tax on investment in the corporate and noncorporate sectors as well as federal income taxes on owneroccupied housing which tend to be around zero tax rates also affect the dividend payout choice arising from differential treatment of retained earnings which give rise to capital gains and dividends and the realization of capital gains finally the overall tax rate in the economy which requires weighting by asset type can affect savings decisions differential taxes across asset types table 1 shows the effective tax rates across different types of assets for the corporate sector with corporate level tax and shows how even the tax rates are two different types of tax rates for current law are reported one without and one with the 9 production activities deduction enacted in 2004 the statutory rate without the production activities deduction is 35 and the effective statutory rate with the production activities deduction is 3185 similar to the statutory rate of 315 in the panels income tax revision the last column reports the effective tax rates using the depreciation system in the panels income tax plan although the corporate tax rate under the panels consumption tax plan is 30 it is not really relevant to the effective tax rate since all investments are effectively subject to zero tax rate table 2 reports these tax rates aggregated across basic composite asset types and assumes third of assets is eligible under current law for the production activities deduction14 this table indicates that the panels income tax reform evens out tax rates slightly and very slightly increases the effective tax rate by percentage point essentially that plan does not differ much from current law the consumption tax reform however results in zero effective corporate tax rate on all assets 14 see jane g gravelle crs report rl32099 capital income taxes and effective tax rates for data on the share of assets eligible this report also contains data on the effective tax rates before the 20012004 revisions and presents more extensive discussion of effective

computation and assumptions these comparisons across asset types indicate that the depreciation system in the income tax reform plan is quite similar in its features to the current provision equipment assets are slightly favored relative to structures and inventory and tax rates are reasonably close to their statutory rates the income tax reform slightly narrows these differentials but in general is quite similar to current law the consumption tax reform plan is completely neutral across assets because all investment is expensed leading to zero effective tax rate at the firm level taxes may still be paid at the individual level however15 the debt equity distortion another issue is the differential tax treatment within the corporate sector of debtfinanced versus equityfinanced capital debt is favored at the corporate level under current income tax rules and under the income tax reform because corporations deduct interest payments if taxes applied only to real economic profits the tax rate on debt financed earnings would be zero and the tax rate on equity would be the statutory rate currently 35 for most corporate income however under current law debt is subject to subsidy at the firm level for two reasons first interest is deducted at the statutory rate adjusted for the production activity deduction which on average lowers the rate to 34 whereas the income is taxed as suggested above at lower effective rate of 29 due to accelerated depreciation second nominal 15 the beneficial treatment of mineral investment largely in oil and gas arises from provisions that allow much of the cost including unproductive tracts and wells as well as all intangible drilling costs supplies labor etc to be deducted immediately the deduction of losses while consistent with accounting rules is subsidy because the cost of unproductive tracts and wells is part of the cost of finding productive ones and should be in theory deducted over the useful life of productive properties the calculations assume that unproductive wells and tracts will continue to be deducted as losses under the income tax reform option but intangible drilling costs will be recovered as will other costs under cost depletion crs14 rather than real interest is deducted together these effects mean that debt at the firm level enjoys 32 subsidy whereas equity has 29 tax16 these tax rates are increased and the differences are moderated however because equity is favored at the individual level capital gains and dividend tax rates are lower and capital gains can be deferred until the stock is sold and are never paid if shares are passed on at death note that this calculation uses the lower rates on capital gains and dividends adopted in 2003 and technically scheduled to expire in 2010 tax rates would be higher if these provisions expire individual taxes on the return to capital are also reduced because they are imposed on profits after the corporate tax and thus the corporate tax is effectively deductible from the individual tax base for an individual in the 30 tax bracket for example the tax on interest income is 30 for dollar of earnings but the additional individual tax on equity is only 20 03 x 1035 the recent temporary revisions lowered the tax rate on capital gains for most recipients from 20 to 15 and extended these lower tax rates to dividends change favoring equity investment there was also temporary benefit to debt finance from the individual tax rate reductions these effects are shown in the first three rows of table 3 which shows that the tax reform plans narrow the differentials between the two types of finance in fact the consumption tax reform results in slightly higher tax burdens for debt finance under this plan the only tax is at the individual level and because of the preferential treatment of capital gains about half is effectively not taxed through deferral and step up in basis at death the effective burden on equityfinanced investment is lower than that on debtfinanced investment the effective tax rate on debt vs equity is however complicated by the existence of taxfavored forms of individual investment through pensions and iras where individual tax rates are effectively zero if these effects are taken into account current tax rates are lower and the effect of changes in individual tax rates less important since these pension funds and ira account managers whether or not self directed can also choose between debt and equity the case with these effects incorporated is probably more realistic determining exactly what weight to assign to tax exempt assets is not entirely clear although roughly half of interest and dividends are in funds where they are eligible for exemption under current law it is not clear whether half of the marginal investments were exempt because some assets were in accounts where investment was made up to the limit the account limits reduce the share of investments that were nontaxable at the margin in addition because of the restraints on these investments such as penalties for early withdrawal or lack of access to funds assets in tax exempt accounts at the margin also pay an implicit cost that offsets to some extent the tax benefit 16 with 0075 nominal interest rate and 002 inflation rate and with the production deduction reducing the tax rate by 3 the aftertax discount rate to the firm is 00751 035097002 dividing that discount rate by 1029 produces pre tax return of 00416 the real interest rate is 0055 0075002 so the difference of 00146 is 32 of the pretax return crs15

increase the exemption levels to 10000 and allow both retirement account and savings account where withdrawals may be made for health education or purchase of primary residence to replace existing iras that are limited to 5000 as well as existing health and eduction savings plans that also tend to have smaller limits income limits would also be abolished17 in addition for the income tax plan the exemption of dividends and most of capital gains should allow more interestbearing assets to be placed into exempt accounts once tax exempt forms are considered and the exempt share is assumed to be larger for the reform plans it is longer obvious that the income tax reform narrows the debtequity distortion compared to current law in comparing tax rates with large discrepancies and particularly those with negative rates more meaningful comparison is the tax wedge or the excess by which the pretax return must exceed fixed aftertax return which is measured by t1t where t is the tax rate thus under current law without considering tax exempt forms effects debtfinanced 17 note that recent tax legislation allowing one time rollover of assets in 2010 including nondeductible traditional iras without income limits effectively eliminates the income limit for few years all individuals are eligible for nondeductible traditional accounts which allow deferral of income and by opening those accounts in the next five years and rolling them over into roth iras highincome individuals can effectively open tax exempt accounts crs16 return must exceed the aftertax return by 10 0091009 whereas an equity financed return must exceed the aftertax return by 59 0371037 the difference between those is 49 of aftertax return the difference between the wedges for the income tax reform proposal is 30 however the difference between the wedges for current law with 50 tax exempt finance is 59 whereas the difference for the tax reform proposal is 48 for 50 tax finance and 62 for 100 tax finance the differences are negligible for the consumption tax plus tax on financial income reform these measures suggest that the income tax reform is likely to narrow the differences between debt and equity finance but perhaps not by very much whereas the consumption tax reform would eliminate virtually all of the differences distortions of payout and realization decisions under current law the tax system favors the retention of earnings in corporations and the delay in the realization of capital gains because capital gains that arise from retained earnings are not taxed until the asset is sold and are never taxed if held until death as result the effective tax rate on capital gains for taxable investors is about half the rate of dividends and the distortion is small about an eight percentage point differential because most dividends and capital gains are taxed at flat 15 rate there are distortions for tax exempt investments this basic treatment is retained in the consumption tax reform provision although the share of tax exempt investment is likely larger the income tax revision actually reverses the relationship because the tax rate on dividends is zero but only 75 of capital gains are excluded that treatment creates an incentive to pay out earnings the magnitude of the distortion is probably less however the maximum capital gains effective rate will be only about 8 corporate versus noncorporate business distortions aside from the distortion between debt and equity the corporate tax also discourages investment in the corporate sector table 4 examines

calculations are also done taking into account the lower individual tax rates for pensions and iras since these entities would not invest directly in unincorporated businesses such as sole proprietorships and partnerships the noncorporate numbers consider only the case when the providers of loans are not fully subject to tax however since noncorporate investment is not viable alternative for passive investment entities such as pension plans the more relevant measure may be the tax rates without incorporating these effects since it is among taxable accounts that choices might be made about investing directly in businesses rather than financial instruments this table also considers the differential treatment of small businesses which are largely noncorporate the smallest businesses which account for most non corporate investment are assumed to operate on cash basis and expense equipment investments whereas the medium sized businesses would also be on cash basis but would depreciate equipment and buildings cash accounting produces zero effective tax rate on inventory investment for current law the calculations assume that small noncorporate businesses would be able to expense investments in equipment under current provisions of the tax law that allow expensing with ceiling crs18 as in the case of the debt equity choice the income tax reform proposal appears to narrow the differentials between corporate and noncorporate investment although the reduction is generally small the consumption reform significantly narrows the differentials business versus owneroccupied housing and total burden table 5 provides estimates of the total tax burden on business investment for owneroccupied housing and for aggregate investment in the economy the income tax reform in general narrows the differences in tax rates between business investment and owneroccupied housing from difference in tax wedges of about 40 under current law to difference of about 27 the consumption tax reform narrows the wedge to less than 15 thus both reforms would reduce the distortions between business investment and housing final rate shown in table 5 is the overall marginal tax rate in the economy the income tax reform proposal keeps about the same effective tax rates if the same assumptions are made about tax exempt finance but it would be likely to slightly lower the overall tax rate because of the increased amount of tax exempt finance the consumption tax proposal with the tax on financial income would lower overall tax rates and is likely to produce negative overall tax rate negative tax rate could occur when most investment comes from tax exempt forms and thus there is little or tax on financial investment and combines virtually zero tax on

labor supply growth and output if tax rates on capital and labor income affect labor and savings and if they are altered output and growth rates in the near and intermediate term can change18 despite the presumption that lower tax rates will increase supply such an outcome is neither theoretically nor empirically certain for both of these effects there are offsetting income and substitution effects rise in aftertax wage income can cause work effort to decrease because the individual wishes to consume more of everything including leisure offsetting the incentive to shift consumption from leisure to other goods with the outcome uncertain similarly rise in the aftertax rate of return can allow individuals to achieve target amount with smaller savings offsetting the effects of the incentive to save more to achieve higher target simple empirical evidence suggests that effects are small because labor supply and savings responses are relatively small19 economists at the treasury department recently prepared dynamic analysis of the tax reform plans and that analysis will be used to discuss the potential growth effects20 the treasury study in addition to examining the two reform plans also examined personal consumption tax pct that was similar to the panels consumption tax git but excluded the 15 tax on financial income interest dividends and capital gains and had slightly higher top individual tax rate 35 rather than 30 the treasury used three different models to analyze the effects one model is standard neoclassical growth model with fixed labor supply and an elasticity of savings with respect to the rate of return equal to 04 the other two models used in the treasury study were the standard intertemporal models the ramsey model which depicts the economy as single infinitely lived person and the overlapping generations model olg which traces cohorts of individuals over time these intertemporal models were developed to bring the microeconomic foundations of decisions regarding savings and labor supply into macroeconomic models although more satisfying theoretically to many economists these models have not been tested empirically and are highly stylized in many ways table 6 summarizes the effects on output of the various reform plans using the three models in the first 10 years in year 20 and in the longrun steady state as the 18 in most growth models changes in savings rates and labor supply cannot affect the long run growth rate which is determined by population growth and exogenous technological change there are models of endogenous growth but the factors that drive those growth rates are unlikely to be affected by the tax changes in the reform plan 19 for review of the empirical evidence see crs report rl31949 issues

none of the proposals had significant effect on marginal and averagewage tax rates and only the consumption tax proposals had an effect on tax rates on investment21 second for those proposals that had noticeable effect on the capital income tax rate the results vary significantly depending on the model used in the first 10 years on average output increases by 19 for the ramsey model 15 for the olg model and 01 for the solow model in the long run output is larger respectively by 48 22 and 14 table 6 percentage change in national income treasury study plan solow model olg model ramsey model

24 and 13 respectively under the income tax plan these rates are estimated at 24 and 128 whereas in the consumption tax plan they are 235 and 133 respectively the marginal and average rates go up slightly in their personal consumption tax plan pct to 264 and 147 for capital income the treasury study estimates current marginal tax rate of 139 for the income tax reform the rate falls slightly to 128 but for the consumption plan git the reduction is much larger to 11 their personal consumption tax rate is 37 the tax rates used in their analysis are similar to the ones calculated in this study in table 5 crs21 explaining the causes of these different results and evaluating the reasonableness of the models is quite complicated and the technical discussion is contained in an appendix to this paper however the major conclusions suggested in that appendix are as follows straightforward empirical evidence indicates that savings could rise or fall and even in the model with the most modest results the solow model it is not clear that the effects would indeed be positive as some timeseries elasticities are negative the use of rothtype iras and in some cases 401ks from traditional iras would according to the theory embedded in intertemporal models be less likely to induce savings as individuals would longer need to save the upfront tax reduction to pay future taxes this effect could be particularly pronounced in the git where defined contribution pension plans will be converted to roth style plans as substituting roth for deductible plan should reduce savings these effects are not accounted for intertemporal models while theoretically appealing in many ways involve some fairly heroic assumptions about the abilities of individuals to make complex decisions and have not been empirically tested much of the savings response reflects intertemporal substitution of labor in response to interest rate changes where virtually evidence of response is available alternative rules of thumb savings behavior may be more consistent with individual savings behavior and tend to imply zero or negative elasticity this view of behavior suggests that automatic enrollment in employer retirement plans facilitated by the proposals might increase savings for which there is some direct evidence the ramsey model also suffers from some serious limitations as it requires some strict assumptions to achieve an internal solution ie where there is general ownership of capital across many people as observed in the economy including homogeneous preferences asexual reproduction and common tax rate thereby making it impossible to apply the model to progressive tax rate structure an open economy or to incorporate differential state tax rates even within the context of the intertemporal models many of the implicit elasticities are inconsistent with the empirical evidence including the labor supply elasticities and particularly the intertemporal labor substitution elasticity which empirical work suggests is less than 02 but which is set at around 075 in the ramsey model and around 05 in the olg model standard labor supply elasticities also tend to be higher than most empirical estimates especially in the ramsey model part of the reason for these high elasticities is the somewhat arbitrary choice of hours available for additional work crs22 even where the higher growth effects are expected these effects are quite modest compared to the normal growth of the economy for example the largest growth is projected for the git by the ramsey model in that simulation over the 20year period output rises by 37 for an average annual growth rate of less than 210 of percent normal growth is usually 2 to 3 and growth per worker typically 1 or more growth induced by even significant tax change of this nature is not likely to materially affect the fiscal outlook that is we cannot grow our way out of the deficit by changing the shape of the tax system international tax treatment the panel proposes significant change in the tax treatment of foreign source income in its income tax proposal and proposes to treat taxes in its consumption tax proposal git in the same manner as vat under current income tax law income of foreign subsidiaries of us parents is not taxed until repatriated as dividends treatment referred to as deferral income of foreign branches of us companies is taxed currently as is certain passive income subpart f income of subsidiaries that is easily subject to abuse when income is taxed firms can take credit against foreign taxes paid up to the amount of the us tax due and these credits are aggregated across countries so that unused credits for taxes in hightax countries can be used to offset us tax due in lowtax countries this offsetting of credits across countries is referred to as crosscrediting certain passive income is segregated into separate foreign tax credit basket the international tax regime has several problems relating to economic efficiency and tax compliance first because of deferral and crosscrediting too much of us investment flows to lowtax countries where its pretax return is too low and too little to the united states and hightax countries deferral does not produce as large disincentive as outright exemption but once income is earned abroad there is an incentive to reinvest abroad to avoid the repatriation tax second the potential to reallocate profits from high to lowtax jurisdictions complicates tax administration and compliance profits may be reallocated by setting prices for intercompany transactions and by assigning patent rights to operations in lowtax countries in addition since companies control their tax liability through repatriation decisions they engage in complex planning to minimize their taxes and indeed very little tax is paid on foreign source income one reform approach would be to tax all income currently which would eliminate the repatriation issue also if it were administratively feasible although there are claims that it is not foreign tax credits could be separated into country baskets treatment that would eliminate incentives for investment in lowtax countries although it would increase the disincentive to invest in hightax countries but even with crosscrediting case can be made that this change would lead to greater economic efficiency through eliminating much of the incentive to invest in lowtax countries moreover there would be less incentive to transfer income across different countries us individual investors could avoid some of this current tax by crs23 investing in foreign parents and there would also be incentives for us parents to transform into foreign parent corporations corporate inversion the evidence suggests that these effects would probably be small and corporate inversions could be discouraged with legislation revenue raised from this approach could be used to reduce the corporate income tax rate and top income tax rates if the distributional effects are to be held constant an argument is sometimes made that this type of change would lead to an unfair disadvantage to companies that must compete in lowtax countries with firms from other countries who do not tax their subsidiaries income it could lead to smaller presence abroad of us firms but nevertheless the investment that takes place in the united states would earn higher return and benefit the us economy that is from the point of view of us society as whole this is not so much an unfair competition but rather system that diverts resources to their best uses the panel did not choose current taxation of foreign source income but rather complete exemption of active income and current taxation of passive income including royalties this latter provision would eliminate the ability of companies to shift income abroad through the use of royalties this option suggests the panel wanted to focus more on the international abuses and reduction of planning costs as this treatment eliminates the repatriation decision and reduces the opportunity to shift income through royalties the panel argues their plan on the basis of conforming to what most other countries do and also invokes the levelplayingfield argument discussed above they also suggest that the tax shelter problem is more severe than the real allocation of capital but the plan can be criticized as not only increasing real asset allocation distortions but also giving up the opportunity to reduce transfer pricing and expense allocation methods of shifting profits to lowtax jurisdictions22 for the consumption tax plan since the tax is longer corporate income tax all of these mechanics would be abandoned two approaches that are generally equivalent for uniform tax and this tax is relatively uniform are an origin basis tax where output is taxed where produced and destination basis tax where output is taxed where consumed in the destination approach as used in the vat taxes would be rebated on exports and imposed on imports the panel recommends destination basis because it eliminates the incentive to shift taxable sales into lowtax countries other tax incentives the tax reform proposal eliminates series of tax preferences some of which are discussed in the document and some of which are simply presumed to be eliminated based on general statements an analysis of this myriad of tax incentives 22 for recent study which compares these systems with discussion of these profitshifting issues see harry grubert and rosanne altshuler corporate taxes in the world economy reforming the taxation of cross border income presented at the james baker iii institute for public policy conference is it time for fundamental tax reform the known unknown and unknowable houston tx april 2728 2006 crs24 is beyond the scope of this report although it is possible to argue that many of them tend to distort the allocation of resources and many are simply accidents of history23 some provisions however are substitutes for what might be desirable spending programs that are channeled through the tax system and repealing them without providing an alternative spending program may be questioned an example is the lowincomehousing credit for which case may be made that use of the tax system is inefficient but where the goal helping lowincome people obtain decent housing may be laudable another example is the education tax credit and deduction which was aimed at making higher education more affordable for the middle class and was phased out at higher incomes the tuition credits and deductions were criticized because direct system for delivering aid was already in place and using the tax system simply made the system more complicated one can also debate the desirability of expanding aid to middle class given the extensive subsidies that already exist but that is debate about education not tax policy it is the case however that the proposal retained the subsidies for saving for higher education through the save for family accounts subsidies that are likely to be more concentrated to higherincome families who can afford to save for long period of time as noted above many of the provisions in current law affect the allocation of capital investment and the major ones are incorporated in the analysis of capital income taxes there are certain consumption items that are favored in significant way by the current tax law and these will be discussed briefly in this section perhaps the most significant in terms of lost dollars of revenue is the current benefits for health care and specifically for health insurance also discussed is the subsidy for charitable giving and the effect on state and local governments due to the deductibility of state and local taxes and the exclusion of interest on tax exempt bonds the panels proposal would make changes in all of these areas although full analysis of these issues is beyond the scope of this report some brief discussion is provided health care some of the largest subsidies in the tax code accrue to health care with forgone revenues of 904 billion in fy2006 for the exclusion of health insurance benefits from employees income there is also 38 billion loss for exclusion of health insurance for the selfemployed some part of spending for cafeteria plans where employees choose benefits is associated with health care these plans result in revenue loss of 279 billion in addition to these benefits for private health insurance 75 billion is lost in itemized deductions for major health costs those over 75 of income there are also some losses due to exclusion of employee benefits and medicare benefits the latter being relatively costly 23 for brief discussion of each of the more than 100 tax expenditures see us congress senate committee on the budget tax expenditures compilation of background materials on individual provisions prepared by the congressional research service s prt 10854 december 2004 crs25 there are reasons for government intervention into the health care market which is subject to adverse selection differential premiums for people with poor health histories and moral hazard encouraging too much spending on health care due to insurance in addition our society does not wish to deny critical medical care to people due to lack of ability to pay the revisions in the panels plan may reduce some of the problems but possibly aggravate others the exclusion of insurance for employer plans and the self employed can be criticized on the grounds that it adds to moral hazard by encouraging coverage of ordinary medical expenses and is unfair because it does not benefit employees of firms without plans at the same time employer plans by pooling individuals in the workplace can address adverse selection the proposal to limit employer contribution deductions it is not practical to tax this implicit income to employees might reduce moral hazard without interfering with the benefits of offsetting adverse selection and thus may be considered an efficient reform allowing deduction for health insurance premiums to those not covered by employer plans has both desirable effects it would be more equitable and would improve coverage and undesirable effects it would increase moral hazard and could undermine the employer system with its improvement of adverse selection in addition to including healthrelated fringe benefits the plan would eliminate the extraordinary medical expense deduction provision that allowed relief for families with significant medical costs and one which might be difficult to dispense with charitable contributions the panels proposals would restrict the current deduction for charitable contributions to amounts over floor equal to 1 of income and would also extend the benefits to all taxpayers not just itemizers the proposal would also permit individuals to sell assets and donate the cash to charity without paying capital gains tax if the cash is donated within short time frame provision that would eliminate the tax benefits of donating property directly charitable contributions are subject to market failure in that assuming individuals benefit from the goods financed by charitable contributions individuals can freeride on others contribution because of this freeride people count on others to fund charities and do not give enough in the aggregate thus there is justification for subsidy the tax benefit is potentially subject to abuse as people attempt to gain private benefits overstate their deductions and exaggerate values of property donated even for taxpayers who are intending to be honest valuation of property is often difficult this problem would be reduced to some extent by the provision allowing the property to be sold and then donated the 1 floor would contribute to target efficiency which focuses on how much charitable contributions are increased for each dollar of revenue loss target efficiency is often referred to as bang for the buck the floor would also achieve administrative simplicity by disallowing small deductions among itemizers it would reduce the overall incentives for giving for those with contributions under the threshold according to calculations using the public use statistics of income file crs26 about 63 of itemizing contributors gave over 1 of income24 these contributors accounted for 95 of giving with 18 under the floor and 77 above the floor these numbers suggest for itemizers that the floor will create more target efficient system without doing much to reduce giving since 78 of the revenue gain from the floor is associated with the loss deductions by those already over the threshold who will retain an incentive to give at the margin the extension of the deduction to nonitemizers may offset the reduction in coverage and also will be more efficient than deduction without floor thus overall this change is likely to lead to more effective incentive for charitable giving state and local tax deductions tax exempt bonds the proposal eliminates the existing deductions for state and local taxes which include income property and as temporary alternative to income tax deductions sales tax deductions the property tax deduction can be considered as part of the general beneficial treatment to owneroccupied housing as well but in general the argument against deducting state and local taxes is that these taxes pay for state and local goods and services that are not taxed to the recipients hence the deduction encourages more expenditure on these goods of course there is close relationship between taxes and services as there is for private spending or even fees such as those for national parks so this argument is not entirely straightforward the deduction also encourages the use of deductible taxes income and property and temporarily general sales taxes some consider this effect to be an inappropriate interference in choice but others may support the encouragement to use more progressive taxes especially the income tax another argument for allowing deduction is that these taxes are not voluntary and reduce ability to pay although the deduction can also be criticized as favoring taxpayers in hightax states whether the deduction for state and local taxes is desirable or undesirable therefore is difficult to determine another major subsidy in the tax system is the exemption of interest on state and local bonds on theoretical grounds this benefit is questionable because there seems particular reason to favor spending on investment goods which generally are the purposes of these bonds in addition some of the subsidies go to investments which are not really public goods through localities financing for example sports stadiums and convention centers or through the use of private activity bonds which are permitted to benefit private investors with restrictions on the purposes and amounts although there is explicit elimination of the subsidy the expansion of taxfavored savings accounts in both plans will however diminish the tax benefit transition issues in any major tax revision transition issues become difficult in the case of the income tax plan sit these transition issues are likely to be most problematic for 24 these estimates were provided by maxim shvedov of crs based on the statistics of income public use file crs27 moderately high and higherincome homeowners who have purchased homes with values high relative to income and will lose part of the value of their mortgage deductions and their deduction for property taxes the transition problems are much more severe for the consumption tax proposal and indeed may be severe enough to make adoption of such proposal impossible in shifting from an income to consumption base businesses would normally lose all of their recovery of costs of existing assets including depreciation deductions basis in the sales of assets and costs of goods sold when selling items in or produced from inventory or intermediate purchases consumption tax is as noted above equivalent to wage tax and lump sum tax on capital income under consumption tax without transition rules the value of assets falls because the full value of the asset will be taxed upon sale also because the consumption tax does not include financial assets in its base but does not require price accommodation as might be the case for vat or retail sales tax that lump sum tax on old assets falls on the equity share of capital it should also be reflected in stock market share values where absent adjustment costs the imposition of 30 consumption tax should be expected given that about one third of assets is debt financed resulting in theoretically predicted fall in asset value of 45 202325 taxpayers with heavily debtfinanced assets not only would be unable to deduct interest costs as well as depreciation or costs of goods sold but also could suffer significant burden if they wish to sell their business or major asset with the tax due on sale exceeding their cash proceeds26 examples of taxpayers who might be adversely affected are individuals with substantial inventory going out of business and unable to deduct the cost of their goods sold or individuals who own and wish to sell single piece of property such as building these effects are adjustment costs and can be reduced by transition rules but transition rules for recovery of depreciation or inventory costs would be extremely expensive this lump sum effect would be offset in part if depreciation deductions and recovery of old inventory costs were still allowed however without adjustment costs assets would still lose about half of their value because the present value of depreciation deductions is less than the current value of the property27 the panels transition rules are quite limited there would be fouryear phaseout of depreciation deductions and interest deductions 80 in the first year 60 in the second 40 in the third and 20 in the fourth interest would be taxed in the same proportions other transitions are allowed and sale of an asset would terminate depreciation transitional rules and new financial contracts would terminate interest deduction allowances 25 these effects are smaller in the short run if there are adjustment costs 26 see crs report rl32603 the flat tax valueadded tax and national retail sales tax overview of the issues by gregg esenwein and jane g gravelle for further discussion 27 see leonard burman jane gravelle and jeff rohaly towards more consistent distributional analysis forthcoming in the proceedings of the national tax association 2005 conference crs28 based on this transition rule taxpayer with new nonresidential building purchased before the tax was imposed would lose approximately 95 of scheduled deductions on buildings about 65 of deductions for equipment for typical seven year asset and all of the deductions for existing inventory either goods for sale or goods in process the loss would be smaller in present value for the buildings and to some extent for equipment and smaller for older assets but inventories would bear virtually the full loss and the loss is substantial current inventories for the fourth quarter of 2004 were 17 trillion thus providing any sort of partial relief would be extremely costly as most inventories are turned over very quickly taxpayers with outstanding debt would also lose significant fraction of interest deductions unless they can refinance not all bonds can be called according to bondmarketcom out of 2077 billion of corporate bonds with maturities of over year over half or 1217 billion are not callable28 the average maturity of bonds is approximately seven years29 for sevenyear bond paying coupon taxpayers would lose 71 of interest deductions the loss would be greater for longer maturities 80 for 10year bond 90 for 20year bond and 93 for 30year bond presumably all depreciation would be lost when an asset is sold and presumably the basis of the asset would not be recovered all proceeds taxed thus all depreciation would be lost for these assets these transition problems impose very significant barrier to the possibility of adopting consumption tax conclusion of the two proposals presented by the panel the income tax revision may be more likely to have any chance of ultimate adoption the consumption tax has gains in efficiency through the allocation of capital possibly some gains in growth although the analysis in this report suggests these effects may be modest and some significant gains in simplicity especially for business that exceed those of the income tax proposal however the analysis presented in the last section suggests that the progressive consumption tax proposed by the panel would be very difficult to implement moreover the consumption tax is likely when appropriate distributional analysis is considered to significantly reduce the progressivity of the federal tax system these observations suggest focus on the income tax proposal sit there are some important simplifications in the sit especially for businesses and highincome individuals although lowerincome taxpayers may find their affairs more complicated in translating the income tax plan to more detailed proposal that deals with small but important deductions however some of these simplification gains 28 see httpwwwbondmarketscomstoryaspid2234 29 see httpwwwbondmarketscomstoryaspid2235 crs29 may be lost the sit faces revenue sufficiency problems that will require some taxes to be increased in the future and is probably not entirely distributionally neutral but shifts some of the burden away from highincome taxpayers there are efficiency gains in number of areas although probably little effect on growth and the change to international tax may increase inefficiency and even exacerbate tax sheltering there are also some transition problems but they are small compared to the consumption proposal whether the gains from the changes under the sit are worth the costs is unclear historically it has been difficult to make major changes to the tax code because of the disruption in taxpayers affairs nevertheless there are some limited aspects of the proposals that do seem to have many advantages and few drawbacks the proposal for floor on charitable deductions has salutary effect on both target efficiency and tax administration and simplification removing barriers to automatic enrollment in employer retirement plans is as well proposal that is likely to facilitate savings ceiling on deductions by employers in health insurance plans appears to preserve the benefits of reduced adverse selection in health insurance markets while reducing both moral hazard effects and differential treatment of taxpayers it may be that the greatest contribution of the panel study is to identify some possibilities for more limited reforms appendix calculating effective capital income tax rates the tax rates in this paper are calculated by first determining given required aftertax return and an expected rate of decline in productivity of the asset due to depreciation how much the investment must initially produce in order for the sum of profits after tax over time discounted by the aftertax return to equal the individual investment outlay ie to break even then all of the tax payments and deduction are eliminated and the before profit flows are used to determine what pre tax discount rate would sum the flows to original cost the effective tax rate is the pretax rate of return minus the aftertax rate of return

tax reform plans by the treasury department the model that yields the smallest results in the dynamic analysis is the solow model where labor supply is fixed but savings is responsive to changes in the rate of return the savings response is based on direct estimate of the savings elasticity from time series evidence most evidence of labor supply is consistent with relatively unresponsive supply this evidence reflects the historical stability of participation and hours by primeage men cross section studies of labor supply and studies using contrived or natural experiments similarly times series estimates of saving tend to suggest small response that is not surprising given the relative constancy of the savings rate over time as well as the constancy of the capital output ratio despite significant changes in tax rates these estimates may be positive or negative but are close to zero and the 04 elasticity estimate used in that model is crs31 about at the upper range of estimates of savings supply response from time series studies30 although it is possible to construct an intertemporal model with fixed labor supply standard labor supply response is included in the two intertemporal models however that standard response is only part of the effect that labor has in the model in addition to potential permanent decrease or increase in the labor supply due to withinperiod choices of leisure and consumption there can be an intertemporal shift indeed this intertemporal shift in labor can play major role in the shortrun response to tax cut in capital income as occurs in shift to consumption taxes this effect comes about because of the desire to shift leisure from the present to the future so that the agent works more today saves that income and works less in the future in addition to these labor supply effects there is the normal savings response that would occur even in models with fixed labor supply savings response that depends on the rate of return this savings response tends to have very small effect on output in the short run but can be significant in the long run there are several issues surrounding the use of these intertemporal models to project the effects of tax changes these issues are also discussed in considerable detail in crs report on dynamic revenue estimating31 however three questions may be raised about these intertemporal models the first question is how realistic such models are as way of depicting how people actually behave these models are attractive to economists because they rest on the basic microfoundations of consumer behavior nevertheless the ramsey model originated as planning model rather than description of how people actually behave and can only be considered as representation of economywide behavior if strict assumptions are met since the model treats society as an infinitely lived person it requires asexual reproduction if dynasties are to be represented as an infinitely lived person and in order to avoid reaching corner solution where all capital is owned by one group it requires completely homogeneous tastes ie all individuals have the same preferences for present and future consumption and common marginal tax rates thus the model cannot be used if there are differential marginal tax rates either through progressivity in tax rates or differential tax rates across states of the united states or differential rates across countries the overlapping generations olg lifecycle model does not suffer from these problems and planning horizon of 50 years or more provides significant savings effects in addition because income is shifted from the old to the young savings may increase for that reason as well some economists doubt the appropriateness of such model because of the extreme complexity of the decision the individual is making the model presumes individuals to make optimal decisions choosing work 30 for survey of evidence on labor supply see crs report rl31949 issues in dynamic revenue estimating by jane g gravelle cited above for brief survey on the savings evidence see jane g gravelle the economics of taxing capital income cambridge mit press 1994 further discussion of the historical evidence and savings response can be found in crs report rl32517 distributional effects of taxes on corporate profits investment income and estates by jane g gravelle 31 crs report rl31949 issues in dynamic revenue estimating by jane g gravelle crs32 decisions savings and consumption for typically around 55year adult life individuals may not be able to make these decisions because they do not have the knowledge and skills to do so or even the self control and freedom from procrastination an alternative model sometimes referred to as bounded rationality model suggests that people may make choices based on rules of thumb and the most common rules of thumb fixed fraction of income saved or target retirement fund imply zero or negative savings elasticities there is some empirical evidence to support this type of model and indeed evidence on the importance of defaults on savings in retirement plans is justification for the automatic savings provisions for employer plans included in the panels report32 in addition the life cycle model is sensitive to many types of assumptions that may be made in an arbitrary fashion including how retirement occurs how bequests are left whether there are precautionary as well as retirement savings and many other characteristics the olg model can also have outcomes that depend on specific model features however the olg model used by treasury does avoid one troublesome problem in some other olg models it has fixed retirement age that feature means that an effect common in an olg model with endogenous retirement older people returning to work in significant numbers due to the lump sum tax on older peoples assets under consumption tax phenomenon that seems unlikely given the adjustment costs and health issues does not occur33 the second question is whether the models have been empirically tested and the basic answer to that question is although relationships are based on certain empirical estimates of substitutions across time there are estimates of substitution elasticities across long periods of time basically the models presume that the substitutability across farapart periods is the same as for closetogether periods in addition the models often predict very dramatic shortrun changes in savings and labor supply that are difficult to reconcile with the stability of these relationships over time the third question is how closely the models given that structure track those empirical relationships that we can observe and how those empirical relationships in turn drive the model there are actually four types of empirical relationships to draw on the substitution effect for the static labor supply response the income effect for the static response the intertemporal substitution elasticity for consumption bundles over time and the intertemporal labor supply elasticity and these in turn govern the short run labor supply response the initial savings response and 32 see crs report rl33482 saving incentives what may work what may not by thomas hungerford for discussion 33 that phenomenon causes an olg with endogenous retirement such as that presented in alan auerbach and laurence kotlikoff dynamic fiscal policy cambridge cambridge university press 1987 to have larger effects in the short run than ramsey model for discussion see eric engen jane gravelle and kent smetters dynamic tax models why they do the things they do national tax journal vol 50 september 1997 pp 657682 in these simulations of shift from flat income tax to flat consumption tax the olg model increased labor supply by 38 compared to the 24 in the ramsey infinite horizon model even though the time horizon for the ramsey model is greater crs33 ultimately the long run effect on the capital stock both labor supply and consumption can be shifted over time due to changes in expected wages over time or changes in the rate of return it is possible to sort out some of these effects in rough fashion to compare them with empirical estimates those empirical estimates include the static income and substitution compensated elasticities of labor supply with respect to wage changes the intertemporal substitution elasticity how consumption shifts across time with respect to the interest rate and the intertemporal labor supply elasticity how labor supply shifts with respect to the wage rate the formula for percentage change in labor from static model is34 l dtm dta 1 1 h 1 tm 1 ta where l is hours of leisure h is the time endowment l is hours of labor is the substitution elasticity between leisure and consumption is the ratio of nonlabor income to labor income tm is the marginal tax rate and ta is the average tax rate in the model the share of the time endowment in leisure was 06 in the ramsey model and 05 in the olg model and the elasticities were 08 and 06 respectively given the tax rate changes in the text this effect suggests reduction in labor for the sit of about 01 because of the slight fall in the average tax on labor income whose income effect causes less work for the git where the marginal tax rate fell and the average tax rate rose both income and substitution effects led to 05 increase in the ramsey model and 04 increase in the olg in the full simulations by the treasury in the ramsey model the labor supply fell in the first 10 years on average by 01 in the sit but rose by 03 in the olg model these small differences could have arisen because of some small amount of intertemporal shifting and variations in income effects for the git however labor supply rose in the first 10 years by 13 and 12 respectively moreover while labor supply changes over time stayed relatively constant for the sit 02 and 04 in year 20 for the ramsey and olg 03 and 04 in the long run they show significant decline in the git for the ramsey model the labor supply increase was 13 in the first 10 years 1 in year 20 and 01 in the long run for the olg model the labor supply increase was 12 in the first 10 years 07 in year 20 and 06 in the long run the intertemporal labor supply response also affects saving because the increase in labor is for the purpose of saving to permit more leisure in the future there was additional savings as well in the git simulation since even as labor increased consumption fell these calculations suggest that at least in simulating the git and the pct that the intertemporal labor supply response is important several empirical measures govern these responses for labor the static responses imply compensated elasticity which captures the positive effect on 34 this formula is derived in crs report rl31949 issues in dynamic revenue estimating by jane g gravelle as are the remaining formulas in this appendix crs34 wages on labor supply and multiplies the marginal tax rate term in equation 1 with the value of ranging from zero to 02 of 048 to 053 and an income elasticity of 056 to 06 for the olg model the substitution elasticity is 03 to 033 and the income elasticity is 045 to 05 the smaller elasticities in the olg model reflect the lower leisure share 06 in the ramsey model versus 05 in the olg model and with respect to the compensated elasticity because of the smaller intratemporal substitution elasticity 08 in the ramsey model and 06 in the olg model these elasticities are likely to be high based on surveys of the evidence the congressional budget office chose an uncompensated elasticity of 014 and an income elasticity of 007 whereas the joint tax committee chose an uncompensated elasticity of 018 and an income elasticity of 01335 the cbo has recently increased their elasticities36 yet there is more of justification for reducing them because it is likely that the response for women has decreased because of greater participation for participation as for hours the greater the labor supply the smaller the elasticity is likely to be recent study suggested that elasticities of womens labor supply had decreased by about 5037 the second type of elasticity that can be compared with empirical evidence is the intertemporal substitution of labor with respect to the wage rate this elasticity is l 2 1 l where is the share of total consumption spent on leisure is the intertemporal substitution elasticity and is the intratemporal substitution elasticity between leisure and consumption although the elasticities vary most of the evidence suggests intertemporal labor supply elasticities that are quite small in the neighborhood of 0238 the treasury elasticities are higher than that value for the 35 congressional budget office how cbo analyzed the macroeconomic effects of the presidents budget july 2003 p 12 john w diamond and pamela moomau issues in

and monica singhal the effect of anticipated tax changes on intertemporal labor supply and the realization of taxable income finance and economics discussion series 200544 this study that used the loss of dependent to identify an expected change in the marginal tax rate and continued crs35 ramsey model the elasticity is estimated at 075 whereas for the olg model it is estimated at 04939 these relatively high labor supply responses particularly in the ramsey model drive lot of the shortrun response in the git one simple way of reducing these elasticities to conform more closely with the empirical evidence without disturbing other parts of the model is to reduce the time endowment available for labor there are some direct reasons to do so as well for example in the ramsey model assuming 40 hours of work for full time worker and eight hours to sleep would result in leisure of 64 not much above the allowance in the ramsey model but this ratio leaves time to carry on the essential functions of modern life which are really not leisure but simply necessary tasks such as commuting personal grooming eating and preparing food shopping and maintenance of home and possessions40 the intertemporal substitution elasticities of 025 in the ramsey model and 0 35 in the olg model are consistent with the empirical evidence suggesting the intertemporal elasticity is below 05 and that the average is around 0341 note that there are really studies that capture some of the other relationships directly such as the labor supply response to change in the rate of return or responses across long periods of time it is these farapart periods that drive much of the models results because the savings elasticity with respect to the interest rate is multiplied by the time period so that the savings response in the long run is very large in fact in the ramsey model the long run steady state does not depend on the intertemporal substitution elasticity as the savings elasticity is effectively infinite it merely determines the adjustment path in the long run in both models it is the increase in the capital stock that largely causes the increase in output another important elasticity in both models for both the short run and the long run is the factor substitution elasticity which is set at one setting this value at one is common in many models nevertheless there are some economists who have 38 continued found change in labor income but not in labor supply either in participation or in hours worked by existing participants the study did find curious increase in labor income of men which is not easily explained although it is possible that there was shifting of income over time periods or shift to fringe benefits or perhaps an increase in work intensity 39 in the ramsey model since leisure is 60 of total hours the ratio of leisure to labor is 15 in the olg model it is 50 of total hours and the ratio is 1 the intertemporal substitution elasticity is 025 in the ramsey model and 035 in the olg model while the intratemporal elasticities are 080 and 060 respectively crs was unable to obtain the estimate of the share of leisure in expenditure on leisure and consumption but estimated the leisure share assuming that consumption is 95 of output and labor is 75 at 54 for the ramsey model 1575951575 and 44 for the olg model 40 see the review in crs report rl31949 issues in dynamic revenue estimating 41 ibid crs36 studied this issue and argue that the elasticity is much lower around 0442 these elasticities can make great deal of difference in simulation study lowering the elasticity from 10 to 05 caused the output change to fall by 4543 based on this survey of models and elasticities it is unlikely that the git would have as pronounced an effect on output especially in the short run as depicted in the models there is one final issue that makes the effects also likely to be overstated in these models private saving is influenced by the timing of taxes thus in shift to consumption tax that fact that taxes are higher in the retirement years as assets are drawn down results in an increase in savings in the short run the changes in iras and 401ks however are moving in the opposite direction traditional iras with deductions up front should cause greater private savings because individuals should save their tax cut today to pay taxes on withdrawals in the future for the roth style ira there is upfront deduction and substituting roth iras for traditional iras should cause savings to fall 42 ibid 43 eric engen
