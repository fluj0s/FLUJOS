commitment to the military dominated government of pakistan despite serious concerns about that countrys nuclear proliferation activities the 911 commission cast into sharp relief two long standing dilemmas concerning us policy towards pakistan and south asia first in an often strained security relationship spanning more than five decades us and pakistani national security objectives have seldom been congruent pakistan has viewed the alliance primarily in the context of its rivalry with india whereas american policymakers have viewed it from the perspective of us global security interests second us nuclear nonproliferation objectives towards pakistan and india repeatedly have been subordinated to other important us goals during the 1980s pakistan exploited its key role as conduit for aid to the antisoviet afghan mujahidin to avoid us nuclear nonproliferation sanctions and receive some 600 million annually in us military and economic aid underscoring pakistans different agenda some of the radical islamists favored by its military intelligence service later formed the core of qaeda and the taliban crucial us policy challenge is to gain pakistani cooperation in shutting down the extensive illicit nuclear supplier network established in the 1990s by the self designated father of pakistans nuclear bomb abdul qadir khan which provided nuclear enrichment technology to iran libya and north korea while at the same time supporting stability in pakistan and gaining its maximum cooperation against terrorism to date the administration appears largely to have acquiesced in pakistans refusal to allow access to khan by us intelligence officials the administration has been equally reluctant to publicly criticize the musharraf governments apparent use of international arms dealers to obtain controlled us dualuse technology for its own nuclear weapons program in violation of us law the 109th congress has been asked by the administration to provide some 698 million in military and economic assistance to pakistan for fy2006 part of five year 3 billion aid package some members of congress have expressed concern that as during the 1980s the urgent need for pakistans cooperation will prevent the administration from dealing forcefully with its nuclear proliferation activities and have introduced legislation that seeks to make us assistance contingent on pakistans cooperation

towards pakistan and south asia1 in calling for clear strong and longterm commitment to the military dominated government of pakistan despite serious concerns about that countrys nuclear proliferation activities the final report of the 911 commission cast into sharp relief two longstanding dilemmas concerning us policy towards pakistan and south asia first in an often strained security relationship spanning more than five decades us and pakistani national security objectives have seldom been congruent pakistan has viewed the alliance primarily in the context of its rivalry with india whereas us policymakers have tended to view it from the perspective of regional stability and us global security interests mutual security agreements concluded with pakistan in 1954 and 1959 which remain in force were part of the us containment policy towards the soviet union2 second us nuclear nonproliferation objectives towards pakistan and india repeatedly have been subordinated to other important us goals during the 1980s pakistan exploited its key role as conduit for aid to the antisoviet afghan mujahidin to avoid us nuclear nonproliferation sanctions and receive annually some 600 million annually in us military and economic aid underscoring pakistans different agenda some of the radical islamists favored by its military intelligence service later formed the core of qaeda and the taliban during the 1980s pakistan successfully exploited its importance as conduit for aid to the antisoviet afghan mujahidin both to forestall the imposition of economic and military sanctions otherwise required by us nuclear nonproliferation laws and to gain some 600 million annually in us military and economic aid ironically not only did pakistan develop its nuclear weapons capability

foreign policy objectives the united states unwittingly facilitated the rise of radical antius islamic terrorist movement3 the ranks of qaeda and the taliban include some of the very same radical islamists nurtured by pakistans interservices intelligence isi organization and supported and armed by the cia in the successful effort to drive the soviet army out of afghanistan some observers view this unwanted legacy as cause for not losing sight of us nuclear nonproliferation and other interests when seeking to forge closer antiterrorism ties to country that has been major and recent source of the proliferation of nuclear technology and materials and which also faces some degree of risk of itself falling under the control of radical islamists this report seeks in part to explore whether there may be ways for gaining more leverage with pakistan on the proliferation issue without jeopardizing islamabads cooperation on terrorism figure 1 country map of pakistan dushanbe turkmenistan

neither the 911 commission report nor legislation enacted to implement its recommendations directly address the issue of balancing us assistance to promote counterterrorism cooperation and stabilize pakistan against islamist extremism with curbing nuclear proliferation activities emanating from pakistan congress endorsed and funded for fy2005 only request from the bush administration for new five year 3 billion package of us economic and military assistance to pakistan congress also signaled its concern that pakistan was not sufficiently cooperating with us efforts to eliminate aq khans illicit nuclear supply network by revising an existing reporting requirement under the foreign assistance act 1961 amended but did not condition us assistance to pakistan on the imposing of any specific performancerelated nonproliferation requirements4 see legislation section at the end of this report in theory achieving the two most critical us policy objectives relating to pakistan defeating radical islamic terrorism and deterring nuclear proliferation should be complementary since the acquisition of nuclear weapons by terrorists is in the words of the vicechairman of the 911 commission former representative lee hamilton the ultimate nightmare in practice however the historical record shows that the dual american objectives often have been operationally incompatible especially the goals of promoting democracy and preventing nuclear proliferation from that perspective vicechairman hamilton observed at an august 24 2004 hearing of the house international relations committee i think pakistan represents as tough problem as there is in american foreign policy today5 press reports in late december 2004 and early 2005 concerning the covert supply network established by aq khan underscored the challenge of addressing simultaneously the terrorist and nuclear proliferation threats in us policy towards pakistan the new york times reported on december 26 2004 that both the bush administration and the united nations international atomic energy agency iaea had gathered evidence in the middle east and asia indicating that khans network may be much more extensive than previously assumed the extent and degree of threat posed by khans network has become apparent through the discovery in libya of plans for an atomic bomb and other elements of nuclear starter kit evidence that pakistan has been the source of most of irans uranium enrichment knowhow and technology strong indications that pakistan has been the main source of centrifuges or components for north koreas secret uranium enrichment program us and officials and experts of the iaea strongly suspect that khans network also 4 by law appropriated funds and any legislative content to appropriations bills apply only to the relevant fiscal year thus funds for the 3 billion program can only be provided on yearbyyear basis 5 remarks of 911 commission lee hamilton at hearing 911commission recommendations for us diplomacy hearing house international relations committee aug 24 2004 crs4 was involved in transporting north korean uranium hexafluoride gas uf6 the feedstock for uranium enrichment centrifuges to libya6 in addition to aq khans network us officials revealed the existence of another illicit trafficking ring in january 2004 this one involved in illegally exporting sensitive us technology for pakistans own nuclear weapons and missile programs in september 2004 an israeli arms dealer resident in south africa asher karni pleaded guilty to five federal felony charges related to his key role in number of unlicensed exports of sensitive dualuse us technology to pakistan via south africa and dubai including high speed switches called triggered spark gaps which can be used in nuclear weapons karnis customer in pakistan was an islamabadbased company pakland owned by humayun khan relation to aq khan with long standing ties to pakistans military and nuclear establishment us officials say that karnis cape town company also supplied missilerelated and possibly nuclear related technology to india7 see details below8 congressional concerns and perspectives in the face of continuing evidence that pakistan remains involved in nuclear proliferation activities some members of congress and some policy analysts and observers are concerned that the united states may be ignoring the lessons of the 1980s in again subordinating its nuclear nonproliferation interests to other policy objectives during the 108th congress these concerns were raised by some members of congress in committee hearings and in proposed legislation that did not receive action pending legislation in the 109th congress likewise appears to reflect in part the desire of some members of congress to recalibrate the balance between us counterterrorism and nonproliferation objectives these initiatives would condition us assistance on more cooperation from pakistan concerning aq khans network and the curtailment of other actions by pakistan to oppose or undermine us efforts to curb nuclear proliferation see details in section entitled legislation at the end of

by us intelligence agencies 3 considers issues regarding the nature objectives and viability of the militarydominated government headed by president pervez musharraf and 4 outlines series of unilateral and multilateral us options with discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each for gaining further nuclear nonproliferation cooperation from pakistan and forestalling future exports from pakistan of nuclear and dualuse components materials and technology this report will not be further updated recommendations of the 911 commission hard choices or the same choices the 911 commission report emphasizes the need for hard choicesand difficult longterm commitments to pakistan9 the report explicitly notes that the need for pragmatic approach inevitably involves compromises with other important us interests such as democracy and nuclear nonproliferation the report does not address the issue of where the balance should be struck between supporting the musharraf government as necessary means of fighting terrorism perhaps because of its relatively narrow mandate the 911 commission focused more on the urgency of maintaining stable and cooperative government in islamabad that would remain partner in the war against terrorism and less on pakistans role as source of nuclear proliferation in the view of the 911 commission maintaining close cooperation with pakistan in the fight against qaeda and keeping pakistans nuclear capabilities out of the hands of terrorists depends critically on supporting president pervez musharrafs vision of moderate modernizing islamic state the 911 commission addressed only in an oblique manner the issue of pakistans past nuclear proliferation activities and the risk of further proliferation emanating from pakistan the reports section on pakistan acknowledges but does not dwell on pakistans continuing potential to be source of technology and know how for other states or terrorist groups intent on acquiring nuclear weapons it noted president musharrafs repeated assurances that pakistan does not barter with its nuclear technology but also observed that proliferation concerns have been long standing section of the 911 commission report dealing more generally with the threat of nuclear proliferation takes note of khans role in establishing illegal covert networks for global transfer of nuclear technology and materials but its recommendations are not pakistanspecific rather the report emphasizes multilateral solutions based on an international legal regime with universal 9 this section was prepared by richard cronin crs6 jurisdiction to enable the capture interdiction and prosecution of smugglers by any state that finds them operating covertly in its territory the report specifically calls for expanding the 2003 proliferation security initiative psi and the 1991 nunn lugar cooperative threat reduction ctr program the psi emphasizes international cooperation to interdict wmd and ballistic missile shipments while the ctr concentrates on securing nuclear weapons and other dangerous materials scattered throughout the territories of the former soviet union which could fall into the hands of terrorists10 instead of hard choices some observers judge that the bush administration and congress have little choice but to provide substantial assistance to pakistan to bolster musharraf and to gain the closest possible antiterrorist cooperation from islamabad without regard to issues such as democracy and nuclear proliferation from this perspective the issue may be less one of choices than following the logic of unpleasant realities the hardest choices may in fact be those faced by president musharraf given the broad public antipathy in pakistan towards us policy in the middle east including the war in iraq and support of israel and the widely held misperception that the us war on terrorism is in fact war against islam past as prologue pakistan and the recurrent dilemma of conflicting us policy goals11 the effort to reconcile us nuclear proliferation objectives towards pakistan with more immediate american regional and global security concerns has long and less than encouraging history references by the 911 report to pakistans perception of the united states as an unreliable ally relate directly to fundamental differences in us and pakistani expectations of the alliance and the consequent unwillingness of several us administrations to support pakistan in its wars with india in 1965 and 197112 10 eleven industrialized democracies nine nato countries plus australia and japan endorsed statement of interdiction principles in paris in september 2003 since then many additional countries have also endorsed the principles and several exercises have been

additional information 11 this section was prepared by richard cronin 12 when india and pakistan went to war in 1965 and 1971 the united states not only refused to assist pakistan but cut off military assistance to both countries an act which hurt pakistan far more than india pakistani resentment of us policy in the 19711972 war was particularly deep because of pakistans role in facilitating secret trip to beijing by national security advisor henry kissinger in july 1971 just few months before the war with india which led to the us opening to china the nixon administration disapproved of the military government of pakistans brutal efforts to suppress rebellion in east pakistan and believed that india which it viewed as prosoviet was exploiting the situation but declined pakistans request for military support when its forces became surrounded by the indian army dennis kux the united states and pakistan disenchanted continued crs7 indias 1974 nuclear test and the beginning of the us policy dilemma pakistan emerged as major source of nuclear proliferation concern following indias underground test of 1974 itself delayed response to chinas 1965 nuclear test because its technological base was far smaller than indias pakistan concentrated on obtaining nuclear materials and technology from abroad and by whatever means successful us diplomatic efforts in the late 1970s to prevent france from delivering uranium reprocessing plant to pakistan which could turn spent reactor fuel into plutonium marked the beginning of long struggle to prevent pakistan from acquiring what some including the thenprime minister of pakistan zulfikar ali bhutto were already calling the islamic bomb13 unfortunately the us effort to close off pakistans ability to employ the reprocessing route to nuclear bomb was already being undercut by aq khans initiation of secret program to produce highenriched uranium the alternative kind of nuclear weapons material while working at european nuclear facility in the netherlands urenco khan had stolen the plans for an uranium enrichment facility in 1983 dutch court convicted khan of nuclear espionage in absentia an action that was later overturned on technicality14 because of khans success in acquiring the necessary materials and technology from abroad including items obtained illegally from the united states american efforts to prevent pakistan from acquiring nuclear weapons became much more difficult eventually us efforts were overtaken by cold war developments that caused successive us administrations and congress to flinch repeatedly as islamabad transgressed each new us red line 12 continued allies washington woodrow wilson center press and baltimore johns hopkins university press 2001 p 194 13 bhutto was an urbane pakistani aristocrat and muslim from the shia minority but by means radical islamist in his autobiography written in jail cell following his overthrow by general zia alhuq in 1977 bhutto partly justified his role in seeking nuclear weapons capability for pakistan by observing that there was christian bomb jewish bomb and hindu bomb and vowing that pakistan would build an islamic bomb in this particular context bhuttos use of the phrase appears related to his resentment of the perceived discrimination against pakistan on the part of the united states and other western countries and his belief that israel and india enjoyed western favor because of bias against islam he also appeared to believe that pakistans acquisition of nuclear weapons capability would garner more economic and political support from middle east and persian gulf countries zulfikar ali bhutto if i am assassinated new delhi india etc vikas publishing house 1979 1 4 timeline pakistans nuclear programcnncom

nuclear test in 1974 congress has played the leading role in formulating the legislative parameters governing us nonproliferation policy pakistans efforts to acquire technology from abroad as well as concern that the ford administration had not responded adequately to indias abuse of us and canadian peaceful nuclear assistance led congress in the late 1970s to enact two landmark nuclear nonproliferation provisions to the foreign assistance act faa of 1961 amended section 669 of the faa first enacted in 1976 and expanded in 1977 symingtonglenn amendment15 banned us economic and military assistance and export credits to countries that have not placed all of their nuclear facilities and materials under the inspection regime of the united nations international atomic energy agency iaea or that deliver receive acquire or transfer nuclear enrichment technology section 670 glenn amendment first adopted in 197716 provided the same sanctions in the case of countries that acquire or transfer nuclear reprocessing technology or explode or transfer nuclear device these provisions amended are now contained in sections 101 and 102 of the arms export control act aeca17 congress had india as well as pakistan in mind when it enacted the nuclear nonproliferation act nnpa of 1978 which also generally enjoyed the support of the carter administration the nnpa among other things bans the sale of us uranium fuel to countries that do not accept the imposition of fullscope iaea inspections and safeguards because of indias unwillingness to accept these terms the united states abrogated 30year bilateral agreement under which it had committed to sell lowenriched uranium fuel for indias ussupplied tarapur atomic power station18 alternating us policy priorities towards pakistan the united states chose its nuclear proliferation interests over its regional security interests in april 1979 when president carter cut off us assistance to pakistan under section 669 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 amended following the discovery that pakistan had secret uranium enrichment program later in november of the same year uspakistan relations reached nadir after 15 pl

facilities in response to false reports possibly spread by the iranian revolutionary leader the ayatollah khomeini that the united states was somehow involved in takeover of the grand mosque in mecca by islamic extremists19 the policy of giving priority to nonproliferation in relations with pakistan proved shortlived as in the case of the 911 attacks some three decades later the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan created quick reversal of us nuclear proliferation and other security policy priorities president carters national security advisor zbigniew brzezinski set the tone in memo of december 26 1979 when he reportedly told the president that the united states had choice but to repair its thentattered relations with pakistan reportedly brzezinski told the president that gaining pakistans support against the soviet occupation will require more guarantees to it pakistan more arms aid and alas decision that our security policy cannot be dictated by our nonproliferation policy20 pakistans key role in the antisoviet war in afghanistan continued to trump us nuclear nonproliferation concerns until the withdrawal of soviet troops in 1989 congress supported this reordering of us policy priorities in 1981 by adding new section 620e of the faa which gave the president qualified authority to waive for period of sixyears the provisions of section 669 congress annually appropriated funds for sixyear 32 billion program of economic and military assistance to pakistan much like the fiveyear 3 billion program requested by the bush administration for the period fy20052009 despite washingtons periodic warnings pakistan not only continued to develop nuclear weapons capability but companies connected with its nuclear program were caught trying to export dualuse materials such as krytrons used to trigger nuclear explosions and specially hardened steel in violation of us export control laws in 1986 pakistans military ruler president zia ulhaq reportedly told an interviewer it is our right to obtain the technology and when we acquire this technology the islamic world will possess it with us21 19 two americans marine defending the embassy and an airman in

reconcile us cold war and nuclear proliferation objectives the 1985 pressler amendment and the 1990 aid cutoff in 1985 in the face of incontrovertible evidence that pakistan was continuing to develop nuclear weapons capability despite repeated denials by president zia ul haq the reagan administration agreed to accept new provision to us foreign assistance law the socalled pressler amendment sec 620ee of the faa requiring the president to certify annually that pakistan did not possess nuclear explosive device as condition of us assistance president reagan and president george h w made such findings for three years after passage of the amendment but each was successively more circumscribed in 1990 president bush informed congress that he could longer make such certification and that most economic and all military assistance to pakistan would be suspended22 the 911 commissions references to pakistans belief that past us support has been selfserving relate in large part to this development even though islamabad had ample warning that its nuclear activities were putting its assistance in jeopardy although the us government denied the charge pakistani commentators asserted that the imposition of sanctions was directly related to 1989 withdrawal of the soviet army from afghanistan which made pakistan longer critical to us regional security policy23 india and pakistans may 1998 nuclear tests and the decline of sanctions as us nonproliferation policy approach when india and pakistan tested nuclear weapons in may 1998 congress and the clinton administration moved with haste surprising to many observers to waive most of the proliferationrelated economic and military sanctions required by us foreign assistance law on both countries pakistan subsequently became ineligible for most forms of us aid for other reasons see below the reaction of the president and congress appeared to reflect several factors including decline in the belief of the efficacy of sanctions once the tests were fait accompli efforts by us agricultural interests to prevent loss of markets and the rising influence of the india caucus in congress legislation passed in july 1998 made pakistan eligible for agricultural export credits to buy us winter wheat while legislation signed into law in october that year the india and pakistan relief act gave the president the authority to waive various economic sanctions for one year later in october 1998 congress made this 22 peter blood ed the united states and the west in pakistan country study federal research division library

to include military assistance foreign military sales credits and exports to high technology entities in the fy2000 department of defense appropriation india was able to take advantage of many of these relaxations of sanctions but pakistan remained ineligible for most us assistance on two other grounds general musharrafs october 1999 military coup and the fact that pakistan had fallen into arrears in its debt repayments to the united states24 us policy reversal after 911 the 911 terrorist attacks as in the case of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan immediately changed pakistans status from that of problem country with which the united states had strained relations to critical regional ally but they put the us government once again at disadvantage in dealing with pakistans nuclear activities number of nonproliferation experts agree with the critical importance of keeping pakistans nuclear weapons and materials out of the reach of terrorists but they disagree with the commissions assumption that president musharraf is sufficiently reliable partner absent more forthcoming attitude from the pakistani government on the activities of aq khan and his network others question the whether pakistan is fully committed to fighting the war against terrorism let alone exercising nuclear restraint among the most serious sources of concern is the welldocumented past involvement of some members of the armys interservices intelligence isi organization with qaeda and the taliban and the possibility that some officers retain sympathies with both groups in the words of one analyst pakistans official alliance with the united states in the war on terror has only increased the danger posed by alqaeda sympathizers within its nuclear establishment25 these considerations are seen as significant factor in musharrafs refusal to provide adequate information about aq khans network some observers argue that without additional nonproliferation policy initiatives beyond those already adopted by the bush administration embracing and supporting musharraf is an inadequate response to danger posed by pakistans nuclear establishment and its past role as possibly the most important single source of nuclear proliferation to radical states even if president musharrafs assurances are taken at face value pakistan remains significant source of proliferation risk still outside the nuclear nonproliferation treaty pakistan is not bound by that treatys prohibitions on nuclear weapon states transferring nuclearweapons related technology or materials to any other state or encouraging or assisting any state it also is not member of the nuclear suppliers group informal organization of countries producing nuclear materials and technology that has established guidelines for nuclear exports while pakistani leaders have proclaimed that their nuclear weapons are secure and that pakistan has not been involved in selling or transferring nuclear weapons technology 24 crs report rs20995 india and pakistan us economic sanctions by dianne rennack 25 graham allison tick tick tick the atlantic monthly oct 2004 5860 crs12 this claim is cast into doubt by the activities of dr aq khan over more than decade details on pakistans proliferation activities26 pakistan has been involved in the covert acquisition of nuclearrelated technologies since at least the mid1970s khan germaneducated metallurgist worked in the early 1970s for contractor to european nuclear consortium urenco located in the netherlands reportedly after indias 1974 underground nuclear test pakistans thenprime minister zulfikar ali bhutto asked khan to head up pakistani uranium enrichment project khan returned to pakistan in 1976 with secret plans for dutchdesigned uranium enrichment centrifuge assembly27 the aq khan network because pakistan lacked an adequate industrial base or sufficient scientific expertise to build an enrichment facility from domestically available resources khan began almost immediately to put together network to obtain necessary materials and technology from abroad evidence concerning any official pakistani involvement in the network remains largely circumstantial khans efforts were foiled number of times by the us and european governments but it became clear by the mid1980s that pakistan was making significant progress towards the ability to produce weaponsgrade uranium what was not understood however that khan also started using his network personally to reap millions of us dollars by providing nuclear knowhow technology and materials to other countries seeking nuclear weapons capability it is now clear that aq khan and several other scientists from the khan research laboratories sold nuclear technology from the 1980s through 2002 to several countries including iran libya and north korea28 president bush in speech that focused on proliferation at the national defense university on february

of that confession has not been made public moreover it appears that the confession was written under pressure which could further distort the truth about khans activities khans confession came at the end of twomonth investigation by the pakistani government into his activities which was sparked by two related proliferation investigations iran was pressured by the iaea in the fall of 2003 to reveal its foreign sources of centrifuge equipment if only to support its argument that the presence of highly enriched uranium came from foreign contamination and not its own production of heu and libya renounced its wmd programs in december 2003 revealing all its foreign sources of procurement only in february 2004 did pakistan admit that nuclear technology was sold to those two countries the pakistani government and the north korean government continue to deny any transfers of nuclear technology between pakistan and north korea yet us officials have testified before congress that khan provided such technology to north korea29 president bush stated in his february 11th speech that khan and his associates provided iran and libya and north korea with designs for pakistans older centrifuges as well as designs for more advanced and efficient models30 one popular theory is that pakistan bartered uranium enrichment technology for missile technology from north korea but president musharraf has stated that whatever we bought from north korea is with money31 khan reportedly sold full range of technology from blueprints and components to full centrifuge assemblies uranium hexafluoride feedstock and reportedly nuclear weapon design assistance to iran began in the late 1980s and continued at least until the mid1990s32 assistance to libya began in the early1990s 29 see

and lowenriched uranium libya also received startlingly nuclear weapons design35 in the case of iran and libya khan provided technology for an advanced centrifuge design the p236 there is confirmation that the nuclear weapon design libya received in 2001 or 2002 is from pakistan but some sources have reported that the design contained chinese text and stepbystep instructions for assembling 1960s heu implosion device which could indicate that khan passed on design pakistan is longrumored to have received from china37 most nuclear proliferation experts contend that aq khan must have had significant logistical support from elements in the pakistani military and the civilian nuclear establishment whether acting in support of pakistani security policy or his own desire for private gain or both in what appeared to be carefully worded response at december 21 2004 press interview secretary of state colin powell indicated that the administration accepted president musharrafs statement

international flight at denver international airport on his way to skiing holiday karni was charged with violating us export control laws by using front company and bogus south african recipient to ship to pakistan 66 triggered spark gaps high speed electrical switches that can be used as detonators for nuclear weapons as well as for igniting rocket motors and separating missile stages at the time karni was not aware that his movements were being monitored by us agencies and that at the request of us commerce department officials the triggered spark gaps had been rendered useless by the

of the triggered spark gaps as well as sophisticated electronic equipment to government agencies in india some of whom are involved in nuclear weapons and missile research40 in mid2003 after failed attempts to buy the triggered spark gaps directly were rebuffed by french company and perkinelmer both of which asked for proof that karni had an necessary export license from the commerce department karni engaged new jerseybased front company giza industries to purchase the items under false pretenses according to us officials karni and khan had shipped these and other dual use items on the us export control list using chain of companies in new jersey south africa the uae and pakistan karni engaged new jersey company giza technologies inc of secaucus new jersey as front purchaser and took advantage of the fact dual use items can be exported to south africa without an export license because south africa is member of the nuclear supplier group because the triggered spark gaps are also

pakistans response if any47 reportedly according to other unnamed us officials the reluctance of senior policymakers to pursue the case against humayun khan reflects larger tugofwar between federal agencies that enforce us nonproliferation laws and policymakers who consider pakistan too important to embarrass48 as in the aq khan case the reported handling of this case by us policymakers appears to suggest that american dependance on pakistan for cooperation against terrorism has significantly influenced us nuclear nonproliferation policy two apparent aspects of us policy concern or are likely to concern critics of the administrations priorities first the reported struggle between the state department on the one hand and the commerce department and us customs service on the other over how aggressively the united states should pressure pakistan for cooperation creates perception that nonproliferation policy has lower priority than antiterrorism cooperation with islamabad reportedly the state department successfully blocked request by the commerce department and the department of homeland security to send investigators to pakistan49 by reportedly not making forceful efforts to gain access to humayun khan in pakistan the united states may be reducing its ability to determine if any of the technology procured by asher karnis pakistani partner was transferred to other countries us investigators are said to be involved in major effort to follow leads in south africa the uae india and elsewhere and the administration has made highlevel requests for cooperation directly to musharraf but some senior officials reportedly have complained in press interviews that these requests have not been made forcefully or publicly50 in april 2005 washington dc federal grand

gave him several years ago was not specific enough for him to take action reports of extensive official cooperation between pakistan and the three countries might also have informed the intelligence communitys assessment pakistan reportedly signed nuclear cooperation agreement with iran in 1986 although the terms of that agreement are unknown and iranian scientists received training in pakistan in 1988 libyan funding of the pakistani nuclear weapons program in the early years long has been alleged most notably in 1981 book by steve weissman and herbert krosney called the islamic bomb58 finally pakistans welldocumented missile cooperation with north korea beginning in the early 1990s as well as aq khans dozen or so trips to north korea were certainly known to the intelligence community pakistans absence in us intelligence reports on proliferation despite the existence of intelligence information and rumors in the open literature concerning significant pakistani contacts with radical states known to be seeking nuclear weapons congress has received little information on this issue in unclassified reports from intelligence agencies the cias semiannual reports to congress on the acquisition of technology related to weapons of mass destruction section 721 of fy1997 intelligence authorization act do not highlight pakistani involvement in supplying wmd technology pakistan is addressed as country acquiring technology from 1997 to the first half of 2002 and then longer appears in the reports as country of proliferation concern59 china russia and north korea are regularly included as key suppliers but pakistan has never been included in this list the first time pakistan is mentioned as potential new supplier of technology is for the report ending june 200060

traditional recipients of wmd and missile technology could emerge as new suppliers of technology and expertise many of these countries such as india iran and pakistan do not adhere to the export restraints embodied in such supplier continued crs20 june 2002 addresses emerging state and nonstate suppliers but neither pakistan nor aq khan is mentioned by name the text states that traditional recipients of wmd technology might follow north koreas lead in supplying such technology to other countries or nonstate actors additionally even in cases where states take action to stem such transfers there are growing numbers of knowledgeable individuals or nonstate purveyors of wmdrelated materials and technology who are able to act outside the constraints of governments such nonstate actors are increasingly capable of providing technology and equipment that previously could only be supplied directly by countries with established capabilities south asia is first mentioned as region of key suppliers in the report covering january to june 2003 however even in that report there is mention of connection between south asia iran libya or north korea in the sections on iran and north korea there is information on foreign suppliers and the section on libya refers just to libya seeking technical exchanges for dualuse equipment aq khan is finally mentioned in the section 721 report ending december 2004 publication mid2004 the exposure of the aq khan network and its role in supplying nuclear technology to libya iran and north korea illustrate one form of this threat but commercial purveyors of dualuse technologies who routinely seek to circumvent international export control regimes to deliver wmdrelated equipment and material to wmdaspirant countries are of grave concern as well61 transfers to iran by and large the us intelligence community appears not to have identified pakistan as significant source of nuclear technology for iran concerns about potential iranian nuclear weapons program date back to the 1970s with hiatus during the years of the iraniraq war 19801989 with the end of that war the attention of the iranian government turned back to recreating its nuclear program including the reactors at bushehr when many governments were persuaded not to participate in the project russia stepped in to fill the gap and us attention focused on the nuclear technology iran might glean from russian scientists and engineers although centrifuge enrichment techniques were concern the intelligence community had not focused on pakistan as particular supplier in the section 721 reports russia and china are repeatedly mentioned as suppliers to irans nuclear program from 1999 to 2001 the report admits that iran has sought technology from variety of sources but especially russia only in the report for the first half of 2002 is there mention that the us intelligence community suspects iran is interested in acquiring foreign fissile material and technology for weapons development 60 continued groups as the nuclear suppliers group and the missile technology control regime p 11 61 central intelligence agency unclassified report to congress on the acquisition of technology relating to weapons of mass destruction and advanced conventional munitions 1 july through 31 december 2003 crs21 transfers to libya although the us intelligence community long had suspected libyan interest in developing nuclear weapons most analysts attributed the limited libyan success to sanctions and lack of an indigenous scientific and engineering base the iaea reported in february 2004 that libya began receiving centrifuge components from aq khan in 1997 yet the section 721 reports did not contain any text about libyan nuclear program until 2000 then the report noted that the suspension of sanctions has accelerated the pace of procurement efforts in libyas drive to rejuvenate its ostensibly civilian nuclear program that report hinted that nuclear cooperation agreement with moscow would play key role not until the report for january to june 2002 did the text note that libya used its secret services to try to obtain technical information on the development of wmd including nuclear weapons if this was referring to libyas procurement of nuclear weapons design from aq khan it seems to imply less willingness by khan to provide the plans than apparently was the case the reports for the last half of 2002 and first half of 2003 only mention technical exchanges related to dualuse equipment transfers to north korea at the time the october 1994 agreed framework with north korea was negotiated there was concern about but scant evidence of north korean interest in uranium enrichment62 reports of north koreas procurement of enrichmentrelated equipment particularly from pakistan date back to the mid1980s see above but apparently us intelligence agencies had evidence of an actual enrichment program although senior north korean official reportedly admitted that it has an enrichment program to us assistant secretary of state james kelly during confrontational meeting in pyongyang in october 2002 pyongyang has continued to publicly deny possessing such program63 it is clear that the us intelligence community knew of multiple trips by aq khan to north korea beginning in the mid1990s whether the intelligence community attributed this to missile or nuclear cooperation is unclear but the role of krl in both nuclear and missile technology could point to collaboration in one or both areas 62 north korea joined the npt in 1985 but did not implement its nuclear safeguards agreement until the early 1990s when north korea refused request for special inspection by the iaea it threatened to withdraw from the npt in march 1993 the us dprk agreed framework negotiated by the clinton administration was response to this crisis in return for north koreas agreement to freeze its nuclear program

korea had begun constructing centrifuge facility64 the cia concluded that north korea began centrifugebased uranium enrichment program in 2000 further the paper noted that in 2001 north korea began seeking centrifugerelated materials in large quantities it also obtained equipment suitable for use in uranium feed and withdrawal systems the cia the report said had learned that the north is constructing plant that could produce enough weapons grade uranium for two or more nuclear weapons per year when fully operational which could be as soon as middecade65 one media report in 2002 cited western officials as stating that pakistans aid included complete design package for centrifuge rotor assembly another stated that pakistan had exported actual centrifuge rotors 2000300066 in october 2002 the washington post reported that north korean efforts to procure high strength aluminum and significant construction activity tipped off the united states67 apparently north korea attempted to obtain materials from china japan pakistan russia and europe but pakistan provided most of the assistance related to the rotors in the section 721 reports to congress however there has been little mention of north koreapakistan connection in the nuclear area in the first report in 1997 the text states that north korea does not require significant outside assistance to produce wmd in the 1998 report there is mention of any procurement related to the nuclear program and the report for the first half of 1999 states that pyongyang sought to procure technology worldwide that could have applications in its nuclear program but we do not know of any procurement directly linked to the nuclear weapons program this statement was included in both reports for 2000 but dropped in reports for 2001 the report for the first half of 2002 notes that north korea began seeking centrifugerelated materials in large quantities in 2001 but makes mention of where it procured those items the report covering the last half of 2002 states that we did not obtain clear evidence indicating that north korea had begun acquiring material and equipment for centrifuge facility until mid2002 although the intelligence community might place emphasis on clear evidence and the threshold of centrifuge facility this admission comes after media accounts in october and november 2002 of north koreas centrifuge procurement from pakistan and perhaps seven years after that procurement apparently began only on february 24 2004 weeks after khan confessed to his activity did cia 64 untitled working paper on north

weapons role of aq khan the pakistani government and military68 whether the musharraf government can be trusted to go forward with the united states as security partner let alone major nonnato ally while not putting the united states further at risk from nuclear proliferation depends in part on the degree of culpability of the pakistani government and military in aq khans activities even if as has been alleged by the pakistani government khans aggressive marketing of nuclear materials and technology to north korea iran and libya was designed to further khans outsized ego and financial interests he could not have functioned without some level of cooperation by pakistani military personnel who maintained tight security around the key nuclear facilities and possibly civilian officials as well this section discusses the available information on khans role and assesses the credibility of pakistans denial that his activities were authorized or supported at the policy level in islamabad khans motives aq khans celebrity status and the degree to which he enriched himself by his activities have been cited by some as evidence that his activities were not government policy in return for assistance provided by khan and laboratory director mohammed farooq close associate of khan iran allegedly funneled millions of dollars into foreign bank accounts held by the two men reportedly khan then used the money to purchase valuable real estate in both pakistan and dubai69 khan reportedly made numerous trips to tehran to share his expertise on uranium enrichment procedures compensation also may have included the gift of villa on the caspian sea khan denies ever having traveled to iran70 one unnamed aide to musharraf reportedly said that khan had completely blank check while in charge of the khan research laboratory krl he could do anything he could go anywhere he could buy anything at any price71 khans reputation as pakistani national hero appears manufactured

to that of national hero72 although khan apparently did make pakistans nuclear weapons program possible by illegally acquiring the plans for an uranium enrichment facility this is only one albeit critical one of many steps required in the production of nuclear weapons according to one source much of the nuclear weapons production process was overseen by lead scientist at the pakistan atomic energy commission paec which did not enjoy krls high public profile that scientist samar mubarikmand may have known of khans activities and may even have used khan and krl as decoy to divert attention from paec where the most critical work on nuclear weapons was being carried out73 whether president musharrafs delicate treatment of khan following the revelations of his activities reflects some level of official culpability is arguable it has been pointed out that despite evidence that he had committed serious breaches of pakistani law khan was allowed by musharraf himself to keep the many millions of illgotten dollars while two former elected prime ministers had been exiled and barred from political office for corruption charges involving far less money74 likewise it appears that the pakistani government was at very minimum incredibly lax in responding to rumors of his activities even before pakistans may 1998 nuclear test several scientists working with khan at krl reportedly warned government officials that khan was involved in suspicious activities75 there have been reports that khans daughter smuggled out of pakistan documents and tape recorded statement indicating that senior pakistani military officers including musharraf were aware of her fathers proliferation activities76 on the other hand khans selfpromoted reputation as the father of pakistans nuclear weapons program created motive not only for overlooking his transgressions but also for seeking to share in his reflected glory at formal dinner marking khans march 2001 retirement from krl president musharraf lavished praise on the famed metallurgist dr khan and his team toiled and sweated day and night against all odds and obstacles against international sanctions and sting operations to create literally out of nothing with their bare hands the pride of pakistans nuclear capability77 given musharrafs relative unpopularity some observers suggest that his lavishing praise on khan does not necessarily imply approval or complicity in his proliferation activities 72 see oped by stephen cohen out of the nuclear loop new york times february 16 2004 73 fission smokescreen outlook india new

political groups were nearunanimous in their dismissal of proliferation charges claiming they were part of usled effort to denuclearize pakistan they typically portrayed musharrafs cooperation with the united states on this and other issues as capitulation to foreign power81 on january 20 pakistan barred all scientists working on its nuclear weapons program from leaving the country the officiallystated reason was to ensure that these individuals would be available for questioning but many believed that the true purpose was to prevent them from talking to foreign investigators or

north korea and libya with uranium enrichment technologies and materials83 after conceding that some pakistani scientists had been involved in proliferation musharraf suggested that personal gain was the central motivation but other motives have been mentioned when asked about motive one unnamed senior pakistani official did not mention greed at all but rather indicated that khan had transferred technologies to divert attention from the pakistans nuclear program as well as to bolster islamic solidarity84 key pakistani investigators reportedly have opined that khan was motivated to defy the west make himself hero to the islamic world and gain wealth85 khans proliferation ring is reported to have earned 100 million in deals with libya alone86 pakistani military role from the time of the revelations of aq khans shipments of nuclear enrichment technology to north korea observers and commentators speculated that this very visible and celebrated figure must have had the cooperation of pakistani army and air force personnel at some level in february 2004 as the khan story was breaking in the international media the washington post reported that khan had told friend and senior pakistani investigator that top pakistani military officers including gen musharraf had known about khans assistance to north koreas uranium enrichment efforts khan also reportedly told investigators that general mirza aslam beg the former army chief 19881991 was aware of similar assistance being provided to iran and that two other army chiefs in addition to musharraf knew and approved of his efforts on behalf of north korea87 one of these former army chiefs jehangir karamat became pakistans ambassador to the united states in september 2004 close friend of khan person who may well have an interest in shifting blame away from the famed metallurgist reportedly described karamat along with both musharraf and beg as having been aware of everything khan had done karamats responsibility for pakistans ballistic missile programs in the late 1990s may have included his taking covert trips to north korea and possibly having direct knowledge about pakistans alleged barter deal with pyongyang involving nuclear technology and missiles88 publicly khan accepted all of the blame in his televised confession to the pakistani people khan sought to atone for some of the anguish and pain he had caused by offering his deepest regrets and unqualified apologies to traumatized nation he took full responsibility for the proliferation activities and 83 key pakistani is said to admit atom transfers

from his cabinet that khan not be subjected to any proliferationrelated criminal prosecution yet within week the pakistani government announced that the pardon was conditional and specific to charges made so far90 subsequent actions by the pakistani government underscored doubts that khan could have operated without some level of support by military officers and officials whether acting on their own or carrying out government policy following khans public confession the musharraf government announced that it had arrested at least five scientists and administrative officials from krl including mohammed farooq and islamul haq91 on february 11 pakistans foreign minister said that nobody would be spared in the ongoing criminal investigation including khan on the same day four civilian scientists and three retired military officers including krl department heads and brigadiers in charge of security there were formally charged with proliferationrelated crimes92 president musharraf himself raised more questions when on february 9 he acknowledged that he had long suspected that khan was involved in proliferation activities but argued that the united states had failed to provide convincing evidence until the fall of 200393 why musharraf had not followed up on his own alleged suspicions has not been explained but angeles times report of may 16 suggests that after musharrafs coup in 1999 both he and pakistans secretive inter services intelligence organization isi became suspicious of khans activities in dubai reportedly musharraf had decided in the words of senior exmilitary officer that it was time to put an end to this dirty business musharrafs main concern the article argues was to avoid jeopardizing his desire to get rid of remaining us economic and military sanctions94 because of khans popularity and musharrafs still shaky hold on power so this explanation goes the president had to move cautiously but by march 2001 he was fed up with khans

for continued insubordination95 politically the khan affair put president musharraf in difficult position when the pakistani parliament met on february 16 opposition parties accused the government of coveringup the militarys role in proliferating humiliating khan appeasing the united states and bypassing the countrys elected representatives96 some pakistani commentators argued that the pakistani state should in way be held accountable for the actions of khan himself they pointed to khans allegedly total control of krl reports that the facilities were offlimits to both civilian politicians and the isi and an absence of evidence that khans actions were ever transformed into krl policy97 general beg in particular has long been suspected of having antius and pro iranian tendencies henry rowan at the time us assistant secretary of defense has related january 1990 meeting with gen beg who he says said something like if we dont get adequate support from the us then we may be forced to share nuclear technology with iran98 another source attributes similar statement by general beg to late 1990 following the decision by president george h w bush that he could not make the required certification to congress that pakistan did not have nuclear weapons thus invoking the pressler amendment sec 620ee of the foreign assistance act 1961 as amended requiring cutoff of military and economic assistance to pakistan99 beg reportedly has strongly denied having ever having had control over aq khan role he assigned to former prime minister benazir bhutto 19881990 19931996 and former

claimed that nothing moves in the pakistani nuclear spectrum without the knowledge of the chief of army staff103 beg himself has claimed that the pakistani army has never been in control of the countrys nuclear weapons program except during periods of military rule he insisted that the ultimate authority was always the chief executive in this case benazir bhutto bhutto herself claimed that khan could not have been acting alone and that senior government or military officials were seeking to coverup their own complicity she even asserted that as prime minister she had turned down several requests by military officials and scientists to export pakistans nuclear technology104 an aide to thenpm nawaz sharif claimed that beg approached him in 1991 with proposal to sell nuclear technology to iran reportedly former us ambassador to pakistan robert oakley said that beg told him that same year of an understanding with the head of irans revolutionary guard corps that pakistan would help

the usled military successes in kuwait and iraq in early 1991 beg denies all claims that he sought to provide nuclear assistance to iran105 the public reaction to the accusations against khan was predictably nationalistic and antiamerican many pakistani observers accused the foreign media of bias in singling out pakistan while ignoring the roles played by the citizens of other countries including those in the west they also criticized the iaea and the united states for turning blind eye to the nuclear weapons programs of israel and india106 representative media commentary in pakistan

israel107 number of civilian politicians and analysts from across pakistans political spectrum were quick to suggest that khan was falling on his sword to protect others in the pakistani government and military who also were involved in proliferation activities perhaps even including musharraf himself108 others suggested that the series of events leading up to khans confession and pardon appeared to have been tightly scripted and may have been privately endorsed by us government keen to protect key counterterrorism ally109 bush administration statements the bush administration has maintained that there was evidence that the top officials of the pakistani government were complicit in or approved of khans proliferation activities the bush administration has found insufficient evidence to trigger us nonproliferation laws even though us officials claim neither to have asked for access to khan nor believed that such access was necessary110 some senior us officials have insisted that the united states is receiving the cooperation it needs from pakistan but in testimony to congress on april 29 2004 thendeputy secretary of state richard armitage said that the administration was impatient for even greater efforts from president musharraf111 in feature article on december 26 2004 the new york times reported that the administration had received little new information from pakistan to its questions about where khan obtained the plans for nuclear weapon the article also maintained based on unnamed sources that the administration had not gained access to his chief assistant buhari sayed abu tahir who has been jailed in malaysia as consequence of the discovery of khans network112 in view of the domestic political sensitivity of the issue for president musharraf other statements by us officials also appear designed to minimize publicly american concern about the light treatment given aq khan by musharraf despite the gravity of his actions responding

reportedly stated further and if you dont think national humiliation is justice for what he did i think it is hes nationally humiliated113 rather than publicly demanding that the musharraf government make full revelation of aq khans activities thensecretary of state colin powell and other state department officials insisted that the united states should play role in judging musharrafs handling of the matter state department briefer on february 5 2004 said he was impressed by the seriousness of the investigation being conducted in pakistan and expected that pakistan would share with the international community the information that is gleaned though the investigation powell explicitly described the investigation as pakistani internal matter at press conference in islamabad on march 18 2004 though he also said that he was confident that the pakistani authorities would provide full disclosure so that the united states and pakistan could work together to completely eliminate khans network114 many pakistani analysts voiced their approval of the conclusion that khans activities breached international laws thus justifying musharrafs prerogative to pardon115 other observers have not expressed the same level of confidence that the investigation would achieve the stated objectives the directorgeneral of the iaea called khan the tip of an iceberg and claimed that his case raises more questions than it answers dr khan was not working alone116 new york times editorial asserted that pakistans military and that means general musharraf was without question aware of and part of this illicit and perilous commerce yet the bush administrations reaction the editorial continued has been one of grateful acceptance117 indian reactions were predictably dismissive of the khan pardon as grand charade designed to protect the pakistani military many were equally discomfited by the bush administrations quickness to call khans activities an internal matter118 113 father of pakistans

has been the bush administrations main justification for largely setting aside us nonproliferation concerns in the case of pakistan not only does the united states need pakistani cooperation but musharrafs survival has been seen by both the administration and the 911 commission as an essential requirement for maintaining and increasing pakistani cooperation given the troubled history of uspakistan security cooperation the 911 commission report emphasizes in particular the necessity of avoiding repetition of the past cycle of engagement disengagement and reengagement with pakistan the following section addresses the stability of the musharraf government and the prospects for continuation of current pakistani policy should president musharraf leave the scene for whatever reason nearterm us security needs versus longer term human rights and democracy goals us interest in pakistani democratization exists in tandem with the perceived need to have stable and effectivelyadministered ally in the international anti terrorism coalition however while many observers believe that us interests in combating terrorism and weapons proliferation in south asia entail tradeoff with regard to other concerns some contend that the human rights situation in pakistan may itself be crucial aspect of the incidence of terrorism and religious extremism120 congressional oversight of uspakistan relations in march 2003 hearing included member expressions of concern about problems with pakistani democratization and the danger of the united states giving full recognition to military takeover through continuous waivers of couprelated aid restrictions121 the military continues to dominate pakistans centralized decision making process and while in office prime minister jamali referred to president musharraf as being his boss122 while it is possible to argue that pakistan is somewhat more democratic since the october 2002 elections many analysts note that the countrys democratic institutions and processes are inflexible and unaccommodating of dissent these observers see pakistans political parties seriously weakened in recent years with the 119 this

jamali musharraf elected president for five years pakistan press international april 18 2003 crs33 militarys influence correspondingly more profound123 moreover numerous commentators reject the 911 commissions best hope label for musharraf himself as myopic and repetitive of past us reliance on pakistani military regimes especially in light of their view that pakistans uncertain political stability is rooted in musharrafs policies and in the personal support he receives from the united states124 president musharraf remains generally popular figure in pakistan but he has been an object of hatred for islamic radicals including those affiliated with domestic and international terrorist organizations march 2004 survey found that 86 of pakistanis view musharraf favorably with 60 viewing him very favorably but 65 also said that they support osama bin laden musharrafs government depends on an alliance of six islamist parties which use the acronyms mma united action front in english to maintain majority in the national parliament the same alliance controls the assemblies in two provinces bordering afghanistan baluchistan and the northwest frontier province nwfp125 the support of the islamist parties has been brought into question by musharrafs decision to break his commitment to step down as army commander at the end of the year promise he made in 2003 to secure the support of six islamic parties in parliament the bargain struck with the islamic parties served both to maintain governing majority in the national assembly and to secure passage of an amendment the 17th to the pakistani constitution which among other things legitimatized musharrafs 1999 military coup126 the response to musharrafs indication that he would remain army chief until the end of his presidential term in 2007 suggests that his popularity may have declined musharraf has justified keeping his uniform as necessary to maintain stability127 overall the events of september 11 2001 and after appear to have assisted musharraf in strengthening his grip on power one former pakistani political advisor and diplomat notes that each of pakistans patriarchs have based their claim to power on grounds of us support and their own ability to provide good governance128 the perceived us need for stable and reliable regional ally in its ongoing counterterrorism efforts in south asia have some analysts

bombay july 10 2002 crs34 many analysts believe the advance of democracy and civil society in pakistan is key to the longterm success of stated us policy in the region although the 911 commission report implies that in the short run anyway supporting musharraf is an absolute necessity at july 2004 hearing of the senate foreign relations committee all three private witnesses who were veteran pakistan watchers agreed about the potential problems inherent in perceived us preference for bolstering musharrafs authoritarian leadership at the expense of pakistans democratic institutions and civil society one witness offered that musharraf is best seen as marginal satisfier who will do only the minimum expected of him he recommended that the united states must alter the impression our support for pakistan is essentially support for musharraf129 doubts about musharrafs popularity have been echoed by leading pakistani analyst who contends that all of the pakistani presidents major policy shifts after september 2001 have come through compulsion by external pressure or events and that while the direction of pakistans policy change has been appropriate the momentum of change is too slow and awkward and unsure to constitute critical and irreversible mass130 many leading pakistani commentators insist that only by allowing the countrys secular political parties fully into the system can the country realize stable and enduring democracy131 american policy makers however generally agree with the 911 commission that us interests are for the time being best served by the presence of strong and secure islamabad leadership thus while early optimism about musharrafs potential as reformer has waned considerably there are those who still conclude that the existence of an unstable and possibly islamicized or failed state between afghanistan and india state in possession of nuclear weapons is far less desirable circumstance than the present one in which powerful and secular military institution maintains reasonable degree of order in pakistan for some this argument has become less persuasive as the countrys lawandorder situation has deteriorated in 2004 pakistans fragile democratic institutions are under continuous threat from the authoritarian influences of the countrys powerful military and quasifeudal economic structures given stated us position that

leaguequaideazam pmlq party and musharraf loyalist muhammadmian soomro an international banker from wellknown sindhi family it is the presidents prerogative to appoint army chiefs the consensus view among analysts has the pakistani military maintaining its substantive administration of the country in the event of president musharrafs premature removal the nature of such potential removal likely would influence the scope and intensity of military governance for example if musharraf were removed through violent means it is quite possible that the army would declare martial law and rule directly for period in any case it is widely assumed that the hierarchical solidarity and historic professionalism of pakistans military would result in its continued effectiveness as stabilizing force at least in the short and perhaps middleterm despite the apparent sturdiness of the militarys command structure there remains widespread pessimism about the ability of political institutions built by musharraf to survive his sudden removal and doubts remain about the viability of political succession mechanisms134 after his september 2001 policy shift musharraf moved to purge protaliban islamists from the higher ranks of the military in october 2001 musharraf promoted trusted associate lieutenant general muhammad yusuf chief of the general staff of the pakistan army to the rank of general and appointed him as vice chief of the army staff vcos the seniormost position after musharraf reportedly musharraf earlier had entrusted yusuf said to be ideological moderate with responsibility for sensitive negotiations with us officials concerning american military operations in afghanistan135 also in the immediate wake of 911 musharraf named lt gen ehsanul haq corps

hayat narrowly escaped assassination in bloody june 2004 attack on his motorcade an event which appeared to confirm his status as an enemy of islamic extremists the newlypromoted fourstar general is

taliban officers from pakistans intelligence service after september 2001with relatively unknown officer lt gen ashfaq kiani musharraf shifted haq to the post of chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee less powerful position some speculate that the new vcoas lt gen hayat will exercise close supervision over the isi and operations against qaeda138 policy discussion more constraints than options139 despite pakistani denials considerable evidence suggests that pakistan continues to be involved in the illegal acquisition of nuclear materials and technology to modernize its existing nuclear forces and at minimum allows the activities of nuclear supply networks on its territory such networks may still be involved in supplying nuclear materials technology and knowhow to wouldbe nuclear states or even terrorist networks in addition pakistans nuclear arsenal and fissile material may be vulnerable to seizure in the event of coup by dissident military officers or the seizure of power by radical islamists with sympathy for terrorist groups moreover if not carefully handled us policies aimed at strengthening pakistan militarily could unintentionally upset current positive trends in pakistans relations with india that involve considerable political risk for both governments resolving or deferring final settlement of the thus far intractable kashmir dispute would greatly benefit both us security counterterrorism and nonproliferation interests because this festering territorial dispute has led the countries to the brink of war on two occasions since both deployed

release nov 16 2004 transmittal numbers 0505 0506 and 0507 crs38 possibility of obtaining approval to acquire israels arrow battlefield missile defense system which includes uslicensed components and technology india reportedly expressed strong objections to the sale of the p3c surveillance aircraft and the tow antitank missiles144 within the constraints imposed by dependence on antiterrorist cooperation from pakistan us policymakers still may have several options for pursuing stronger antiproliferation policy while maintaining pakistans status as front line state in the war against terrorism possible approaches include option 1 facto acceptance of pakistans nuclear activities and noncooperation on the aq khan issue on condition of maximum counterterrorism support although the united states may appear to have little choice but to support musharraf the degree of us support matters greatly one option which appears to approximate current policy is to provide largescale economic and military support to pakistan conditioned only on satisfactory pakistani cooperation against terrorism the 911 commission report argues that president musharraf is the best hope for stability in pakistan and afghanistan and an advocate of enlightened moderation the commission recommends that as the united states makes fresh commitments now it should make promises that it is prepared to keep for years provided pakistans leaders are prepared to make difficult choices of their own145 the advantages of this course are that it reduces pakistani suspicion that in the words of the 911 commission report the united states views pakistan as an ally of convenience the underlying rationale for this option is that the more confidence that president musharraf has in the us commitment to pakistan the more ready he will be to confront terrorism for several reasons the nonproliferation benefits of this option appear few while the risks may be high this option does not fully address the limits of musharrafs authority in regard to antiterrorist cooperation with the united states and it limits pakistans hard choices to the fight against extremists not its nuclear behavior despite its strong support for the musharraf government the bush administration has not yet obtained full pakistani cooperation against qaeda and the taliban if musharraf should adopt zerotolerance policy of shutting down all terrorist networks he risks possibly fatal backlash from extreme nationalist and islamist elements of the military and militants carrying out an insurgency in indian occupied kashmir as well as the loss of support from his current political allies among the islamist parties 144 another pak missile test the statesman india briefs dec 9 2004 us could sell

military successor continues to maintain political dominance for the next few years there is absolute guarantee that pakistan will continue its front line status against the taliban and qaeda much could depend on pakistans volatile political situation already islamist political forces are impatient with musharrafs vision of moderate modernizing islamic state and measures however incomplete to suppress domestic jihadists in baluchistan and the northwest frontier province and terrorist groups operating in kashmir even now some in the pakistani hierarchy are not prepared to support us policy to the point of compromising in their view pakistans long term fundamental interests some analysts judge it unlikely that the isi would ever completely alienate the taliban evidence that more than one assassination attempt against musharraf involved collusion between radical islamists possibly qaeda operatives and lower level pakistani air force personnel underscores that the military continues to be susceptible to ideological fissures radical political change may be unlikely under present circumstances but violent islamist campaign against the government or an internal coup cannot be completely ruled out questions about musharrafs ability to control events appear to be underscored by rumors in late 2004 and early 2005 that he has been engaged in secret negotiations on power sharing agreement with the leaders of the two previous governing parties the pakistan peoples party ppp led by benazir bhutto and the pakistan muslim league pml led by nawaz sharif under one rumored deal musharraf would remain president at least until 2007 but he would give up his position as chief of the army staff move also demanded by his current mma allies and hold fresh parliamentary elections in 2005 both bhutto and sharif had alternated as civilian prime ministers during the 1990s but both had been overthrown by military coups and both are now in exile146 while such development would likely be viewed as positive step towards democratization decision by musharraf to end his alliance with the mma could provoke new political crisis moreover the very fact that the arrangement has been rumored raises questions about pakistans stability at the same time questions remain about pakistans nuclear policies the us government cannot verify the musharraf governments assurances that aq khans nuclear sales were not state policy and would not be repeated moreover although pakistan firmly ruled out any limits on its vertical proliferation activities ie building more nuclear weapons and deploying more capable ballistic missiles humayun khans acquisition of us technology in collaboration with the south african arms dealer asher karni appears to belie this claim some of these illegal exports of us technology took place as recently as august 2003147 matter what the united states does at this point it will have to live with consequences of 146 isi on musharraf benazir sharif

southafricaasherkarnihtml crs40 pakistans successful acquisition of nuclear weapons and the potential fragility of the stability and moderation offered by musharraf in terms of unilateral options that do not directly undercut uspakistani cooperation against terrorism one us official has said that ultimately the first and best line of defense as regards ussource technology is the vigilance and cooperation of us companies that sell sensitive technology reportedly french company refused to sell triggered spark gaps to karni because he did not have us export license148 it appears that the discovery of karnis activities occurred only by luck and the vigilance of one company whereas earlier purchases of sensitive technology had been delivered for instance the united states could further increase its assistance to and intelligence and law enforcement cooperation with south africa currently country with weak enforcement of its stringent laws against the export of dualuse technology to nonnsg countries should south africa continue to demonstrate weak enforcement of its laws against the unlicensed exports of nuclearrelated technology the us government could unilaterally suspend south africas privileges as member of the nuclear suppliers group to import sensitive us technology without an export license it is likely however that such move would be opposed by some nsg countries if for other reason than that their own enforcement of export controls may have weaknesses option 2 emphasize multilateral nonproliferation strategies this approach recommended in the 911 report involves concentrating on the recipient or enduser side of the equation as the most effective way to deny nuclear weapons and materials to terrorists that is it emphasized measures to seek to close off global supply networks rather than penalizing pakistan or even demanding full account of aq khans activities and networks proliferation security initative as noted above the bush administration appears to be focusing on improving the global communitys ability to interdict dangerous shipments through the proliferation security initiative psi and in shrinking access worldwide to capabilities needed to produce fissile material crucial for nuclear weapons in speech on february 11 2004 president bush proposed mix of measures to respond to the threat of the nuclear black market149 the president has proposed expanding interdiction efforts under the psi which aims to shut down labs to seize their materials and to freeze their assets the multinational agreement was announced by president bush in may 2003 and inaugurated in paris in september 2003 by the united states eight european nato allies australia and japan additional countries have joined since undersecretary of state john bolton has described the initiative which now enjoys the support of some 60 or more 148 ibid 149 available at httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200402200402114html crs41 countries as foremost among president bushs efforts to stop wmd proliferation150 the 911 commission recommended expanding the psi including persuading russia and china to join and providing participating member countries with nato alliance intelligence and planning resources151 it is probably crucial to include russia and china to make the psi effective but it will also be important to include where possible supplier states while it is doubtful that iran or north korea would agree to restrictions making sure that pakistan longer engages in proliferation activities would appear critical to the effectiveness of the psi from this perspective critics charge that it is past time that pakistan reinforced its promises with concrete measures proliferation specialists have welcomed the psi but say that its potential is limited by several factors including its ad hoc nature which depends on the political will of participating countries some critics view the psi as supplement to more robust nonproliferation regime and one which needs to be bolstered by changes in international law this includes adopting amendments to the convention for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of maritime navigation 1988 and the adoption of resolution that would provide for interdiction activities under section vii of the charter which allows the security council to authorize sanctions or the use of force to compel states to comply with its resolutions152 strengthened international regimes security council resolution 1540 of april 28 2004 which is based on us draft requires all states to adopt laws against the transfers of chemical biological or nuclear weapons and as well as delivery systems and related technology and to report by october 28 2004 on efforts to review their domestic laws and regulations and to demonstrate that action was being taken to comply with the resolution the resolution explicitly bans states from providing any proliferation help to nonstate actors153 the resolution was adopted under section vii of the charter and is thus binding on all member states the resolution requires states to report on the measures they have taken to tighten their export controls although the resolution makes mention of the right 150 see crs report rs21881 proliferation security initiative psi by sharon squassoni 151 911 report op cit p 398 152 joseph cirincione the bush administration and

sanctions if other means have failed154 it may be possible to ban the further spread of enrichment and reprocessing capabilities without new treaty such as fissile material production cutoff treaty fmct but new voluntary agreements remain difficult to enforce the international community is already working on making the additional protocol to fullscope nuclear safeguards agreements prerequisite for nuclear imports through the nuclear suppliers group but pakistan is not member of the nsg finally for political reasons it is unlikely that the iaea will create special committee for compliance although director general elbaradei has set up study group to evaluate several recommendations that have emerged as result of the exposure of the khan network in testimony before congress one nonofficial witness deemed that efforts to combat nuclear proliferation remained the stunted pillar of the presidents national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction the witness joseph cirincione of the carnegie endowment for international peace compared fy2004 funding for nonproliferation programs at less than 2 billion with 41 billion for homeland security and 81 billion for military counterproliferation efforts including ballistic missile defense and the war in iraq155 effectively shutting down the black market trade in nuclear technology materials and components may be possible with adequate cooperation from host governments but this objective would be easier to accomplish if pakistan would provide access to aq khan or otherwise provide more information on the extent of his network irans current defiance of the iaea and the security council also underscores the limitations of multilateral approaches to countries with sufficient financial and technological resources and significant reverse leverage expanded cooperative threat reduction ctr program even if pakistan agreed which is most unlikely under current circumstances expanding to pakistan the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction program currently focused on russia and countries of the former soviet union could be difficult for several reasons significant barriers to assistance include us domestic and international legal and political restrictions on cooperation with states outside the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt the low level of transparency exhibited by pakistan lack of incentives for pakistan to pursue threat reduction measures and potentially competing objectives of threat reduction and nuclear deterrence visavis india in fact pakistan has made it clear that although it is willing to cooperate on denying nuclearrelated technology to terrorist groups it has every intention to modernize and 154 alistair miller and morten bremer maerli nuclear

expand its own nuclear forces apparently as the asher karnihumayun khan ring shows pakistan is committed to improving the capabilities of its nuclear weapons even to the point of violating us export laws to obtain controlled technology156 option 3 condition high value assistance on access to aq khan some argue that the united states should not provide pakistan with high value military hardware without dramatically improved cooperation on the aq khan case and other activities linking pakistan to nuclear proliferation the united states might insist on the following actions by pakistan as price for obtaining valued military equipment especially weapons systems that are not directly related to counterterrorism cooperation such as f16 aircraft antitank weapons and other weapons systems that pakistan is seeking to upgrade its military forces and offset or qualitatively exceed the capabilities of indian weapons this option could also include longerterm waiver authority on us nuclear and missile proliferation sanctions beyond the current yeartoyear extensions in appropriations bills this option could require pakistans agreement to full cooperation on aq khans network full cooperation also regarding the asher karnihumayun khan network strict observance of us export control laws by the government of pakistan the pakistani military and any third party intermediaries absolute commitment on future transfers of nuclear or missile technology and new nuclear tests and restraint on nuclear and missile competition with india key rationale key rationale for this option is that providing pakistan with such high value weapons systems is only warranted if the benefits exceed the cost in this case the cost to the united states is not just the dollar value of the weapons systems but also the inevitable complications for relations with india country with which the united states also has developed facto strategic relationship even if new delhi is also allowed access to coveted us defense technology as now seems likely the record of the past half century shows that india will seek to match every increase in pakistans military capability and viceversa one of the most problematical aspects of selling f16s to pakistan is that in the words of one study the f16 could be pakistans primary nuclearcapable aircraft capable of delivering 1000kilogram bomb to distance of 1400 kilometers157 key question that 156 for more details see crs report rl31589 nuclear threat reduction measures for india and pakistan by sharon squassoni 157 federation of american scientists wmd

with jon b wolfsthal and miriam rajkumar deadly arsenals tracking weapons of mass destruction carnegie endowment for international continued crs44 congress may wish to consider is whether the united states is paying too high price including cost to its foreign policy interest in stable and peaceful india pakistan relationship for what it is getting from pakistan158 potentially risky test of wills potentially significant problem with this option is that so long as islamabad perceives that the bush administration needs it more than pakistan needs the united states musharraf or successor is in position to turn the tables on us policymakers that is instead of treating the f16s or other weapons systems as carrot to be earned by additional cooperation pakistan could reduce or limit its cooperation on terrorism as lever to get the united states to agree to allow the purchase of the aircraft and other desired hardware in fact some of president musharrafs remarks at press conference during visit to washington in early december 2004 several months before the administration announced its willingness to approve the sale of the f16s could be interpreted as effort to put counterpressure on the united states musharraf told reporters that he had discussed the f16 issue with president bush and senior us officials but that the administration had not yet agreed to the requested purchase at the same time musharraf also implied declining enthusiasm for using pakistani forces to hunt for qaeda in tribal zone between pakistan and afghanistan where many believe bin laden and other senior terrorist leaders may be hiding he reportedly criticized the us invasion of iraq and said that the trail of osama bin laden had gone cold in large part because of decline in operations by us forces in afghanistan and delays in the training of afghan forces159 although using the offer to sell f16s to pakistan as leverage to gain more cooperation regarding aq khans network or other objectives could backfire musharrafs domestic political vulnerabilities noted above might give the united states the upper hand in any test of wills moreover conditioning the sale of f16s on better responsiveness by pakistan to us nuclear nonproliferation concerns may be the least risky of the options that involve putting pressure on pakistan but the viability of this option depends on many factors that are outside us control and even that of musharraf because of his somewhat precarious domestic political system any attempt to achieve quidproquo would appear to have the best prospects of success if done in secrecy f16 fighter aircraft sale and the indiapakistan confrontation on march 25 2005 at state department press briefing unnamed senior officials announced that pakistan would be allowed to buy an unspecified number of f16s the officials also announced that the prime contractors on both the f16 and the f18 fighters general dynamics and mcdonnel douglas respectively would be allowed to bid on an expected indian contract for new multirole combat aircraft the 157 continued peace 2002 chapter 12 pakistan 158 see crs report rs22148 combat aircraft sales

announcement followed march 2005 trip to six asian countries starting with india and pakistan by secretary of state condoleezza rice and according to an unnamed state department briefer months of thinking through american strategy towards south asia the briefer designated by the ground rules as senior official one placed the possible sale of combat aircraft to india in the context of new framework of cooperation which might also include the sale of ballistic missile defense technology and even cooperation on nuclear energy in response to questions from the press the briefer denied that the sale of f16s to pakistan would be destabilizing arguing that while the numbers of aircraft provided to pakistan would be relatively small perhaps in the neighborhood of 25 the indian government was contemplating very large scale purchase160 whether the administrations decision to approve the request might be the result of successful strategy to gain more cooperation on aq khans network and qaeda cannot be determined from open sources should there be link to pakistans new cooperation with the iaea some critics of the administrations handling of pakistans nuclear activities may question the value of the tradeoff when questioner at the march 25 2005 press briefing commented that the announcement came shortly after pakistan announced that it would allow iaea inspectors to look at some nuclear parts161 to aid its investigation of irans nuclear program the state department briefer responded that we dont want to get into the details of our diplomatic discussions with pakistan on this very sensitive issue the briefer added however that what we can say is that the aq khan issue has obviously been an issue the secretary has been working on very hard and she did discuss it during her trip with the pakistani government and we feel like the pakistani government is offering good cooperation on this front to address the understandable concerns we have162 congressional role and powers congress itself has the power under the arms export control act to block an arms sale by passing joint resolution or other legislation with sufficient margin ie twothirds or more to overcome presidential veto the fact that the administration has announced its intent to resume sales of f16s to pakistan does not affect congress powers as of midmay 2005 the administration had not submitted required formal notification of the intent to sell the aircraft customarily the defense department notifies congress informally of its intent to carry out an arms sale but because pakistan was designated 160 us department of state office of the spokesman background briefing by administration officials on ussouth asian relations march 25 2005 161 the reference was to the iaeas request for centrifuge parts that could be used to determine if radiation contamination on iranian centrifuge parts held by the iaea could be matched with the pakistani parts on march 30 2005 the english language pakistani newspaper dawn reported that pakistans foreign minister had stated the previous day that pakistan would send some outofdate pieces of centrifuges to geneva for testing but that the parts would remain in pakistani custody and eventually returned to pakistan 162 us department of state office of the spokesman background briefing by administration officials on ussouth asian relations march 25 2005 crs46 nonnato ally in june 2004 congress would have only 15 calendar days following the formal submission of notification to block sale163 refusal by congress to allow the f16 sale to go forward would have significant but unpredictable and almost certainly negative impact on uspakistan relations consequently should members of congress wish to block the sale or attach conditions with the least negative consequences for uspakistan cooperation against terrorism they may wish to seek behindthescenes dialogue with the administration or otherwise make their views known prior to the receipt by congress of formal notification of intent to sell the aircraft whether the administration would be willing to engage with congress on this issue would likely depend significantly on the nature and strength of opposition to current policy option 4 reimposition of nuclear nonproliferation sanctions for reasons noted above neither congress as whole nor the administration have shown any interest in reimposing economic and military assistance and arms transfer sanctions in response to pakistans nuclear proliferation activities apart from expanding the scope of existing law to include terrorist acts or threats involving weapons of mass destruction wmd sections 6801 6802 and 6803 of pl 108 458 s 2845 the intelligence reform and terrorism protection

assistance arms sales transfers and licenses on unrestricted access to aq khan and full compliance by pakistan with us and iaea requests for information about his network this proposed legislation has

foreign assistance act which gives the president broad powers to waive subject to consultation with congress nonproliferation sections of the foreign assistance act that would otherwise apply to pakistan he could also decline to use waiver authority provided annually in successive foreign operations appropriation acts since 2001 to waive provisions of appropriations acts that forbid assistance to countries in default of their debt repayments or whose democratic government has been overthrown in military coup congress also has the power to block the presidents use of waiver authority under section 614 of the faa and other legislation additionally congress could decline to renew the annual foreign operations appropriations authority to waive the 163 for detailed
