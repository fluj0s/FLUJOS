confront congress each time the president introduces armed forces into situation abroad that c onceivably could lead to their involvement in hostilities one issue concerns the division of war powers between the president and congress whether the use of armed forces falls within the purview of the congressional power to declare war and the war powers resolution wpr the other issue is whether or not congress concurs in the wisdom of the action this report does not deal with the substantive merits of using armed forces in specific cases but rather with congressional authorization for military action and the application and effectiveness of the wpr the purpose of the wpr pl 93148 passed over president nixons veto on november 7 1973 is to ensure that congress and the president share in making decisions that may get the united stat involved in hostilities compliance becomes an issue whenever the president introduces us forces abroad in situations that might be construed as hostilities or imminent hostilities criteria for compliance include prior consultation with congress fulfillment of the reporting requi rements and congressional authorization if the president has not complied fully the issue becomes what action congress should take to bring about compliance or to influence us policy related issue has been congressional authorization of peacekeeping or other unsponsored actions for over three decades war powers and the war powers resolution have been an issue in us military actions in asia the middle east africa central america and europe presidents have submitted 123 reports to congress as result of the war powers resolution although only one the mayaguez situation cited section 4a1 or specifically stated that forces had been introduced into hostilities or imminent hostilities congress invoked the wpr in the multinational force in lebanon resolution pl 98119 which authorized the marines to remain in lebanon for 18 months in addition pl 1021 enacted in january 1991 authorizing the use of us armed forces in response to iraqi aggression against kuwait stated that it constituted specific statutory authorization within the meaning of the wpr on november 9 1993 the house used section of the wpr to state that us forces should be withdrawn from somalia by march 31 1994 congress had already taken this action in appropriations legislation war powers have been at issue in former yugoslaviabosniakosovo iraq and haiti authorizing military actions in response to the terrorist attacks against the united states of september 11 2001 through pl 10740 directly involved war powers the continued use of force to obtain iraqi compliance with resolutions remained war powers issue from the end of the gulf war on february 28 1991 until the enactment of pl 107243 in october 2002 which explicitly authorized the president to use force against iraq an authority he exercised in march 2003 and continues to exercise for military operations in

the armed forces article i section 8 while the president is commander in chief article ii section 2 it is generally agreed th at the commander in chief role gives the president power to repel attacks against the united states and makes him responsible for leading the armed forces during the korean and vietnam wars the united states found itself involved for many years in undeclared wars many members of cong ress became concerned with the erosion of congressional authority to decide when the united states should become involved in war or the use of armed forces that might lead to war on november 7 1973 congress passed the war powers resolution pl 93148 over the veto of president nixon the war powers resolution wpr states that the presidents powers as commander in chief to introduce us forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities are exercised only pursuant to 1 declaration of war 2 specific statutory authorization or 3 national emergency created by an attack on the united states or its forces it requires the president in every possible instance to consult with congress before introducing american armed forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities unless there has been declaration of war or other specific congressional authorization it also requires the president to report to congress any introduction of forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities section 4a1 into foreign territory while equipped for combat section 4a2 or in numbers which substantially enlarge us forces equipped for combat already in foreign nation section 4a3 once report is submitted

by jennifer k elsea and richard f grimmett it is important to note that since the war powers resolutions enactment over president nixons veto in 1973 every president has taken the position that it is an unconstitutional infringement by the congress on the presidents authority as commander in chief the courts have not directly addressed this question

congressional authorization is required under domestic law depends on the types of action and is governed by the constitution the participation act pl 79264 as amended as well as by the war powers resolution section 8b of the war powers resolution exempts only participation in headquarters operations of joint military commands established prior to 1973 for armed actions under articles 42 and 43 of the charter section 6 of the participation act authorizes the president to ne gotiate special agreements with the security council subject to the approval of congress providing for the numbers and types of armed forces and facilities to be made available to the security council once the agreements have been concluded further congressional authorization is not necessary but such agreements have been concluded some members have sought to encourage negotiation of military agreements under article 43 of the charter questions include whether congressional approval is required only for an initial agreement on providing peacekeeping forces in general or for each agreement to provide forces in specific situatio ns and how such approvals would relate to the war powers resolution section 7 of the participation act authorizes the detail of up to 1000 personnel to serve in any noncombatant capacity for certain peaceful settlement activities the united states has provided personnel to several peacekeeping missions such as observers to the truce supervision organization in palestine in these instances controversy over the need for congressional authorization has not occurred because the action appeared to fall within the authorization in section 7 of the participation act controversy has arisen when forces have been deployed in larger numbers or as possible combatants in the 103 rd congress members used several vehicles in seeking some control over future peacekeeping actions wherever they might occur both the defense appropriations act for fy1994 pl 103139 section 8153 and for fy1995 pl 103 335 section 8103 stated the sense of congress that funds should not be used for peacekeeping or peace enforcement operations unless the president consulted with congress at least 15 days in advance whenever possible section 1502 of the defense authorization for fy1994 pl 10360 required the president to submit by april 1 1994 report on multinational peacekeeping including the requirement of congressional approval for participation and the applicability of the war powers resolution and the participation act along similar lines the conference report accompanying the department of state appropriations act for fy1994 hr 2519 pl 103121 signed october 27 1993 called for the secretary of state to notify both appropriations committees 15 days in advance where practicable of vote by the security council to establish any new or expanded peacekeeping mission the foreign relations authorization act pl 103236 signed april 30 1994 established new requirements for consultation with congress on us participation in peacekeeping operations section 407 required monthly consultations on the status of peacekeeping operations and advance reports on resolutions

authorization is necessary for us participation in action was also raised by efforts to halt fighting in the former territory of yugoslavia particularly in bosnia the united states participated without congressional authorization in airlifts into sarajevo naval monitoring of sanctions aerial enforcement of fly zone and aerial enforcement of safe havens because some of the us action has been taken within nato framework action in bosnia has raised the broader issue of whether action under na to is exempt from the requirements of the war powers resolution or its standard for the exercise of war powers under the constitution article 11 of the north atlantic treaty states that its provisions are to be carried out by the parties in accordance with their respective constitutional processes implying some role for congress in the event of war section 8a of the war powers resolution states that authority to introduce us forces into hostilities is not to be inferred from any treaty ratified before or after 1973 unless implementing legislation specifically authorizes such introduction and says it is intended to constitute an authorization within the meaning of the war powers resolution section 8b states that nothing in the resolution should be construed to require further authorization for us participation in the headquarters operations of military commands established before 1973 such as nato headquarters operations on august 13 1992 the security council adopted resolution 770 calling on all nations to take all measures necessary to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to sarajevo on august 11 1992 the senate passed sres 330 urging the president to work for such resolution and pledging funds for participation but saying that us military personnel should be introduced into hostilities without clearly defined objectives on the same day the house passed hres 554 urging the security council to author ize measures including the use of force to ensure humanitarian relief thus both chambers of congress supported action but not by legislation authorizing the use of us forces for details of congressional actions relating to bosnia from 1993 through 1995 see crs report rl32267 the war powers resolution after thirtyfour years by richard f grimmett in late 1995 the issue of war powers and bosnia was raised again as president clinton sent more than 20000 american combat troops to bosnia as part of na toled peacekeeping force in december 1995 congress considered and voted on number of bills and resolutions but the house and senate could not come

congressional authorization under the war powers resolution or otherwise became an issue of significant controversy in late march 1999 when president clinton ordered us military forces to participate in natoled military operation in kosovo this action has become the focus of an ongoing policy debate over the purpose and scope of us military involvem ent in kosovo the presidents action to commit forces to the nato kosovo operation also led to suit in federal district court for the district of columbia by some members of congress seeking judicial finding that the president was violating the war powers resolution and the constitution by using military forces in yugoslavia in the absence of authorization from the congress the kosovo controversy began in earnest when on march 26 1999 president clinton notified the congress consistent with the war powers resolution that on march 24 1999 us military forces at his direction and in coalition with nato allies had commenced air strikes against yugoslavia in response to the yugoslav governments campaign of violence and repression against the ethnic albanian population in kosovo prior to the presidents action the senate on march 23

population and appealed for contributions to humanitarian relief efforts the second situation stemmed from the cease fire resolution of april 3 1991 security council resolution 687 which called for iraq to accept the destruction or removal of chemical and biological weapons and international control of its nuclear materials the third situation was related to both of the earlier ones on august 26 1992 the united states britain and france began nofly zone banning iraqi fixed wing and helicopter flights south of the 32nd parallel and creating limited security zone in the south where shiite groups are concentrated after violations of the nofly zones and various other actions by iraq on january 13 1993 the outgoing bush administration announced that aircraft from the united states and

on january 6 1993 the united states gave iraq an ultimatum to remove newly deployed missiles in the nofly zone on january 19 1993 president george hw bush reported to congress that us aircraft on

until iraq fully complied with all relevant security council resolutions he reported the united states would maintain sanctions and other measures designed to achieve compliance war powers issue for years was whether the use of us force in iraq in the period after the early 1991 desert storm conflict had been authorized by congress pl 1021 authorized the president to use us armed forces pursuant to security council resolution 678 to achieve implementation of previous security council re solutions security council resolution 687 was adopted after this on august 2 1991 the senate adopted an amendment to the defense authorization bill for fy1992 supporting the use of all necessary means to achieve the goals of resolution 687 senator dole said the amendment was not intended to authorize the use of force by the president and that in his view in the current circumstances the president required specific authorization from congress as enacted section 1095 of pl 102190 states the sense of congress that it supports the use of all necessary means to achieve the goals of security council resolution 687 as being consistent with the authorization for use of military force against iraq resolution the bill section 1096 also included an amendment by senator pell supporting the use of all necessary means to protect iraqs kurdish minority consistent with relevant resolutions and

compliance by iraq with the s ecurity council resolution adopted in response to the iraq aggression starting in 1998 and through the end of the clinton administration iraqs refusal to permit weapons

aircraft to attack iraqi radar installations in southern iraq believed to threaten allied forces enforcing the nofly zone additional bombings of iraqi sites were authorized and took place from the

consult with congress before introducing us armed forces into situations of hostilities and imminent hostilities and to continue consultations as long as the armed forces remain review of instances involving the use of armed forces since passage of the resolution noted in this report indicates there has been very little c onsultation with congress under the resolution when consultation is defined to mean seeking advice prior to decision to introduce troops presidents have met with congressional leaders after the decision to deploy was made but before commencement of operations one problem is the interpretation of when consultation is required the war powers resolution established different criteria for consultation than for reporting consultation is required only before introducing armed forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances the circumstances triggering the time limit second problem is the meaning of the term consultation the executive branch has often taken the view that the consultation requirement has been fulfilled when from the viewpoint of some members of congress it has not the house report on the war powers resolution said consultation in this provision means that decision is pending on problem and that members of congress are being asked by the president for their advice and opinions and in appropriate circumstances their approval of action contemplated third problem is who represents congress for consultation purposes the house version specifically called for consultation between the president and the leadership and appropriate committees this was changed to less specific wording in final housesenate conference committee version to provide some flexibility some critics of the existing statute have introduced proposals to specify consultation group but congress has yet to act on such proposal

is whether to invoke section 4a1 of the war powers resolution and trigger durational limit for the action unless congress authorizes the forces to remain if congress concurs in presidents action application of the resolution may be desirable either to legitimize the action and strengthen it by making clear congressional support for the measure or to establish the precedent that the resolution does apply in such situation on the other hand some may believe it is preferable to leave the president more flexibility of action than is possible under the resolution or some may not wish to have formal vote on either the issue of applying the resolution or the merits of utilizing armed forces in that case if congress does not concur in an action taken by president the resolution offers way to terminate it longerterm issue is whether the war powers resolution is working or should be amended some contend that it has been effective in moderating the presidents response to crisis situations because of his awareness that certain actions would trigger its reporting and legislative veto provisions or they suggest that it could be effective if the president would comply fully or congress would invoke its provisions others believe it is not accomplishing its objectives and suggest various changes some have proposed that the resolution return to the original senate passed version which would enumerate circumstances in which the president needed congressional authorization for use of armed forces namely to respond to or forestall an armed attack against the united states or its forces or to protect us citizens while evacuating them but prohibit any other use or any permissible use for more than 30 days unless authorized by congress others would replace the automatic requ irement for withdrawal of troops after 60 days with expedited procedures for joint resolution authorizing the action or requiring disengagement still others would repeal the resolution on grounds that it restricts the presidents effectiveness in foreign policy or is unconstitutional several members have suggested establishing consultative group to meet with the president when military action is being considered senators byrd nunn warner and mitchell introduced sjres 323 in 1988 and s 2 in 1989 to establish permanent consultation group of 18 members consisting of the leadership and the ranking and minority members of the committees on foreign relations armed services and intelligence the bill would permit an initial consultative process to be limited to core group of six membersthe majority and minority leaders of both chambers plus the speaker of the house and pres ident pro tempore of the senate on october 28 1993 house foreign affairs chairman lee hamilton introduced hr 3405 to establish congressional consultative group equivalent to the national security council action was taken on this proposal thus far however executive branch officials and congressional leaders who themselves have varying opinions have been unable to find mutually acceptable changes in the war powers resolution president clinton in presidential decision directive 25 signed may 3 1994 supported legislation to amend the resolution along the lines of the mitchell nunn byrd and warner proposal of 1989 to establish consultative mechanism and also eliminate the 60day withdrawal provisions although many agreed on the consultation group supporters of the legislation contended the time limit had been the main flaw in the war powers resolution whereas opponents contended the time limit provided the teeth of the resolution the difficulty of reaching consensus in congress on what action to take is reflected in the fact that in the 104 th congress only one measure s 5 introduced

bosnia and herzegovina hrept 105442 it was the hope of representative tom campbell its sponsor that passage of the resolution could lead to court case that would address the constitutionality of the war powers resolution on march 31 1998 the house passed supplemental appropriations bi ll hr 3579 that would ban use of funds for conduct of offensive operations against iraq unless such operations were specifically authorized by law this provision was dropped in the conference with the senate on june 24 1998 the house passed hr 4103 the defense department appropriations bill for fy1999 with provision by representative skaggs that banned the use of funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this act to initiate or conduct offensive military operations by united states armed forces

passed hjres 114 the authorization for the use of force against ir aq resolution of 2002 pl 107243 on october 16 2002 president bush signed this legislation into law this statute authorizes the president to use the armed forces of the united states as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to 1 defend the national security of the united states against the continuing thr eat posed by iraq and 2 enforce all relevant united nations security council resolutions regarding iraq prior to using force under this statute the president is required to communicate to congress his determination that the use of diplomatic and other peaceful means will not adequately protect the united states or lead to enforcement of all relevant united nations security council resolutions and that the use of force is consistent with the battle against terrorism the statute also stipulates that it is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5b of the war powers resolution it further requires the president to make periodic reports to congress on matters relevant to this joint resolution finally the statute expresses congresss support for the efforts of the president to obtain prompt and decisive action by the security council to enforce iraqs compliance with all relevant security council resolutions pl 107243 clearly confers broad authority on the president to use force the authority granted is not limited to the implementation of previously adopted security council resolutions concerning iraq but includes all relevant resolutions thus it appears to incorporate resolutions concerning iraq that may be adopted by the security council in the future as well as those already adopted the authority also appears to extend beyond compelling iraqs disarmament to implementing the full range of concerns expressed in those resolutions the presidents exercise of the authority granted is not dependent upon finding that iraq was complicit in the attacks of september 11 2001 moreover the authority conferred can be used for the purpose of defending the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq on march 19 2003 president bush used the authority granted in pl 107243 by launching military attack against iraq the president continues to use that authority for ongoing military operations in iraq g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 richard f grimmett specialist in international security rgrimmettcrslocgov
