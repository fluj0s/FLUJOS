bureau of reclamation has been contentious many members of congress particularly from waterscarce western states support both the program and specific projects but are frustrated by growing backlogs of projects seeking author ization or awaiting appropriations the bush administration has generally opposed authorizing add itional projects citing the backlogs and noting that the pr ojects proposed for authorization generally do not meet reclamations requirements for feasibility study at the same time the administrations requests for appropriations for title xvi have been relatively consistent for several years with the fy2007 request at 101 million albeit nearly half of what congress has appropriated in recent years the resulting inertia in implementation has raised congressional interest in possible changes to the program options discussed range from clarifying the programs criteria eg focus on areas of most need to changing the way projects are evaluated eg replacing the requirement for reclamation feasibility study with an evaluation of technical and financial viability to expanding and prioritizing title xvi appropriations views on how to proceed vary based on pe rspectives of the proper role of the federal government in water supply the appropriate prior ity for the program in the current fiscal environment the history and mission of th program and the urgency and need for investment and promotion of water reuse technologies title xvis genesis includes helping s outhern california reduce its reliance on colorado river water as authorizations for projects in other areas and with other purposes were added the justification for federal involvement in th projects which expand municipal water supply and the longterm goals and planning for the program came under increasing scrutiny partic ularly by the administrati on at the same time the program was increasingly pursued by pr oject sponsors as route for federal assistance which was then leveraged for additional support and fi nancing several project sponsors have directly pursued c ongressional authorization outside the title xvi feasibility study process it is not clear if this is due to the administrations resistance to pursue title xvi projects or due to combination of other factors in the face of decreasing support from the administration and mounting dissatisfaction of project sponsors the 109th congress has engaged in oversight of the program and authorized only limited set of additional title xvi projects the issue for congress is whether and how to change the program the challenge for congress is that stakeholders perspectives on how to improve the prog ram are fundamentally different project sponsors generally prefer more streamlined project development process and expanded progra m appropriations while the administration supports smaller more focused program with longterm objectives tied to federal interests this report will be update d as events

supplies and river systems resulting in water use and management conflicts throughout the country these demands are particularly evident in the west where population is rapidly increasing and wher climate variability and water scarcity make managing water supplies especially challenging1 in many western states agricultural and urban needs conflict and these demands also compete with water demand for threatened and endangered sp ecies recreation and scenic enjoyment debate over western water resources re volves around the issue of how best to plan for and manage the use of this renewable yet limited resource some observers advocate enhancing water supplies throug h such steps as building new storage or diversion projects expanding old ones and funding water reclamation and reuse facilities others emphasize conservation and policies that provi opportunities for more efficient use of existing supplies such as using market mechanisms or providing better price signals which theoretically would result in more efficient water use in practice all of these tools are used by western water managers to varying degrees and all have been addressed by congress again to varying degrees to address growing challenges in we stern water manageme nt congress in 1992 directed the secretary of the interior to establish federal water reclamation recycling and reuse pr ogram title xvi of pl 102575 the reclamation wastewater and groundwater studies nd facilities act 43 usc 390h the act directed the secretary to investigat and identify opportunities for water reclamation and reuse in the west for desi gn and construction of demonstration and permanent facilities to reclaim and reus wastewater and to conduct research including desalting for the reclamation of wastewater and naturally impaired ground and surface waters 43 usc 390ha the title xvi program appears to be at crossroad as reuse2 and desalination have become more viable options for ddressing variety of water managementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33707crs2 issues legislative proposals for authorizing title xvi projects have increased at the same time administration support for the program has changed from full support prior to enactment in 1992 to the administr ations current position of generally not supportin g projects proposed for authorization by project sponsors primarily municipal water agencies that have not gone through reclamations feasibility process for example the administrati on when asked has testified against every title xvi bill in the 108th congress and most of the pending bills in the 109th congress citing mostly budgetary and proj ect feasibility concerns further the administration continues to request funding only for pr ojects that have received funding in prior years also during th is time congressional au thorization of new projects has been significantly less than demand since 1996 six projects have been authorized of appr oximately 13 project authoriza tion bills introduced during the 108th congress two were enacted as of august 2006 the 109th congress has enacted one bill and has 16 individual project au thorizations in pe nding legislation this situation has created frustration and confusion over the existing program its future and to some degree the future role of the department of the interiors bureau of reclamation reclamation in the rapidly growing west frustration is especially apparent among project s ponsors whose authorized projects remain without title xvi funding or with limited funding and sponsors of pending project proposals resu lting in increased pressure on congress and the administration to address program issues in sum the resulting backlog of sparsely funded and unfunded projects and pent up demand for federal assist ance have

that it will focus on title xvi projects supported in prior fiscal year budget requests ie it will not undertake new starts congress authorizes each title xvi project individually the genesis for reclamations wastewater reclamation and reuse program was sixyear western drought in the late 1980s and early 1990s in particular the drought strongly affected california and the southwest it led to an intense debate in congress over federal wate r supply policies includin g how to addr ess conflicts between the need and desire for continue d operation of the fe deral central valley project and the application of state and federal environmenta l laws that could potentially limit water deliveries in order to protect certain aquatic species or comply with water quality standards the result of several years effort in addressing this conflict was the reclamation projects au thorization and adjustment act of 1992 pl 102575 while much ttention has been given to title xxxiv of that act the central valley project improvement act t itle xvi authorized construction of five specific reclamation water reuse and recycling projects in arizona and california and established the reuse program title xvi of the act also authorized comprehensive reuse study for southern california incl uding colorado river hydrologic regions the latter language provides specific statutory authority for

enactment of title xvi reclamation had held its first preplanning committee meeting for the southern california water reclama tion and reuse study the effort was later broadened to include 70 southern califor nia water supply and wastewater treatment agencies the study was largely completed by april 2001 and was published as final report in july 2002 2 002 report however the report was not officially submitted to congress as required under the act section 1606c requires submission of the study within six years of the first appropriations for the title by fy2000 according to an october 2003 letter to relevant project managers the department of the interior found the original report contained more detail than desired for submittal sic to congress the thenassistant secretary for water and scienc asked reclamation to prepare concise tothepoint version of that report the southern california comprehensive water reclamation and reuse study reclamation compendium was submitted to congress february 20 2004 however the word feasibility was removed from the compendium raising the question of whether the submissi on complies with the directives of 1606 for feasibility studiesin addition to increasing the water s upplies available to the area southern california this program would also decrease the areas dependency on water imports from the colorado river california and angeles aqueducts help restore and protect the quality of existing groundwater reserves and help meet environmental water needs lujan said reclaimed water one of the most dependable abundant and underutilized water supplies available could provide as much as 2 million acrefeet of water each year for the area4 the southern california study and othe r reuse studies initiated under the title xvi

fy2004 budget included an evaluation of the title xvis effectiveness by the office of management and budget omb part review process discussed below the policy shift resulted in an uncertain future for

in providing clear link between federal funding and progress toward specific outcome s and in longterm planning ombs supporting documents for the fy2004 part review describe the program as an earmarkdriven grant program for local pr ojects for which there is competitive grant process18 these supporting documents st ate that the program helps reclamation meet its mission to manage and develop water nd related resources in an economically and nvironmentally sound manner and specifically notes the programs role in assisting southern ca lifornia reduce its reliance on colorado river water however the summary of the part review declares that the water reclamation and reuse activity is not one of reclamations core functions the title xvi part review concludes that the pr ogram should be scaled back because it serves largely local function that should be local responsibility consistent with this conclusion the administration s budget request for fy2004 was 126 million 65 less than the enacted level for fy 2002 and 59 less than the enacted level for fy2003 congress subsequently appropriated 284 million for fy2004 the administration requested 115 million for fy2005 and

administration requests between fy2001 and fy2003 ranged from 171 million to 22 million title xvi issues for congress ombs part review raises several specific policy issues not unique to title xvi first it highlights the tension between congressional and administration priorities for example while the part review concludes congressional earmarks drive the title xvi program congressiona l supporters express frustration with the administrations lack of par ticipation in the program and hence seek to fund the program in line with congressional priorities sec ond the part review raises questions regarding the appr opriate federal role in wa ter supply development for municipal and industrial uses fo r example is congress redefining thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33707crs9 19 it is hereby declared to be the policy of the congress to recognize the primary responsibilities of the states and local interest s in developing water supplies for domestic municipal industrial and other purposes and th at the federal government should participate and cooperate with states and local intere sts in developing such water supplies in connection with the construction maintenanc and operation of federal navigation flood control irrigation or multiple purpose proj ects water supply act of 1958 72 stat 320 43 usc 390b notefederal governments role in water supply and trea tment as it authorizes new sitespecific projects to what degr ee should the federal government provide incentives for water supply development vi new technologies and what geographic regional or social factors should be considered third is coordination or realignment of certain federal water activities needed to ensure efficient use of scarce federal resources in general title xvi policy issues fall into two categories 1 broad policy issues and 2 issues specific to the programs implementa tion and structure broad policy issues broad policy issue central to discussions of the future of title xvi is the debate over the appropriate fe deral role in water supply velopment particularly for purposes because title xvi projects are municipal water development project and the most recent articulated congressional policy on these types of projects is nearly half century old there remains c onfusion over how to manage the differences of opinion over the appropriate federal role in water reuse projects that are raised between congress and the administration and within congress at issue for congress is the basic question of whethe r supporting title xvis municipal water development projects is an appropriate fe deral role historically federal water resource agen cies involvement in water supply was limited to developing irrigation projects and multiple use projects unlike other areas of water resources management in which the federal role is more prominent eg irrigation water supply flood damage reduction and navigation or supporting wastewater and drinking water treatme nt investments through revolving loan programs the federal role in water supply development for uses largely has been secondary to the primary role of st ate and local governments water supply development for purposes generally has been incidental to the primary project purposes of large multipurpose irri gation flood reduction hydro power and navigation projects pursuant to congressiona l policy established in the water supply act of 195819 while as general matter local regional or state agencies have been responsible for water supply development and wary of fede ral involvement in allocating water congress occasionally has deviated from this policy for example over the last two decades congress has increasingly and incrementally authorized the doi to participate in construction of approximately 13 wate r supply projects for small and rural communities as well as water reclamation and reuse projects under title xvi although congress has increasingl passed bills for site specific projectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33707crs10 20 43 usc 390h1ac nd 43 usc 390h2ac and established the title xvi program it has not rearticulated longstanding congressional policy regardin g the federal role in water supply development since the 1958 water supply act implementation issues on the implementation front what is at issue for congress is whether the title xvi programs current imple mentation inhibits the ach ievement of congressional interest in water reuse projects recent questions and concerns bout the implementation of the title xvi program appear to have increased in part because of the nature of project evaluation and aut horization processes and the lack of clear program funding process that is typical of federal water quality programs this is demonstrated by ombs part review nd the administrations current positions on authorizing new projects and its budget requests criticism of title xvi implementation has spawned discussions of the future of the program and comparisons to othe r federal programs other federal water assistance programs such as state revolving loan funds for wastewater and drinking water administered by epa and rural wa ter and wastewater disposal programs administered by the us department of agriculture usda have criteria regulations and competitiv processes for projects and funding congress appropriates money annually for these pr ograms however project funding is not appropriated by line item as is the case fo r reclamation projects instead depending on the program states or federal agencies allocate program fundi ng based on program and project eligibility criteria for more information on other federal water programs see crs report rl30478 federally supported water supply and wastewater treatment programs coordinated by claudia copeland other overarching issues include the scope of the program and the degree to which project assistance should be targeted to certain type s of projects or broadened to include more projects in more areas different stakeholder views on these overarching issues will ultimately affect specific decisions to address broad policy issues as well as program criteria project evaluation and funding issues discussed below program criteria in contrast to several othe r federal water programs there are legislatively manda ted or promulgated deve lopment criteria and competitive grant processes for title xvi projects sections 1603 and 1604 of title xvi establish project evaluation process which directs the s ecretary to undertake appraisal investigations before preparation of feasibility studies on potential reuse measures and lists several consider ations that must be addressed20 however the act does not include clear evaluation or decisionmaking criteria such as listing criteria that feasible projects must meet for project to be recommended for construction authorization nor does the cu rrent authority include project ranking or eligibility criteriahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33707crs11 21 us department of the inte rior bureau of reclamation guidelines for preparing reviewing and processing water reclamati on and reuse project proposals

httpwwwwhitehousegovombbudgetfy2004pmahtml p 6to implement the program reclamation developed guidelines for the development of title xvi projects21 these guidelines provide more explicit evaluation and feasibility criteria than is provided in the statute however again they are phrased as things that must be considered and as such do not function as eligibility or decisionmaking criteria while omb in the past has noted reclamations title xvi guidelines provide solid criteria to evaluate potential projects prior to funding and also to monitor and evaluate projects under construction22 the guidelines provide little guidance on project ranking further these guidelines have never been offici ally promulgated as official rules or regulations nor do they appear to be binding project evaluation and authorization under the evaluation process established in title xvi of pl 102575 s amended reclama tion requires projects first to pass an appraisal pha second to pass feasibility phase and third to receive feasibility recommendation by the secretary positive recommendations are forwarded to congress for c onstruction approval via proj ectspecific authorization authorized projects are then funded r not via the annual energy and water development appropriations bill however in practice many project authorizations and pending legislative proposals are for pr ojects that have not gone through the project evaluation process outlined in title xvi the reasons for this are varied first it appears that reclamation itself has initiated few title xvi appraisal or feasibility studies in recent years sec ond some sponsors have engaged reclamation in feasibility study but have found agency support lacking in recent years third some contend feasibility studies are better suited to traditional large multipurpose projects that reclamation used to construct and that the process is illsuited for smaller primarily locally financed water reclamation and reuse projects in other words some view the feasibility process as too cumbersome and costly for the amount of federal assistance being sought it is not clear whether it is the feasib ility evaluation pr ocess itself funding levels change in administration policy toward implementing the title xvi program or other reasons that have contributed to lag in feasibility study recommendations regardless of the cause it appears that in recent years relatively few entities have successfu lly completed feasibility process that met with reclamations approval ye t reclamation will not support legislative proposals for projects it has not reviewed or studied for feasibility this situation has contributed to confusion and frustration over implementation of the title xvi program project funding issues funding for title xvi projects has been controversial in recent years because of differences in congressional and administration priorities for example reclamation has limited its budget request to projects that have received prior fe deral funding while congress has provided funding for more proj ects than have been requested by the administration thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33707crs12 budget request for the last three years has been 4067 less than the enacted appropriation for each of the last three ears the administrations request of 101 million for title xvi for fy2007 is 40 ss than the fy2006 enacted appropriation of 256 million while between 1 million and 3 million is devoted to program management annually there is overall program funding per instead each project receives appropriations via separate line item in reclamations water and related resources budget account this process is consistent with most water resource project funding eg corps of engineers project funding however it is markedly different from other federa lly supported water treatment programs which receive program funding that is then disperse d by formula or other means by the administering agency eg by epa and usda or via state agencies further lack of funding for already authorized pr ojects has led some to oppose new project authorizations the above issues rais several questions is new or revised program guidance needed via formal rulemaking process congre ssional action or both would new or revised guidance fore stall the issue of projects being authorized by congress prior to undergoing the title xvi project evaluation process could the title xvi program be signed to help alleviate funding issues and controversy over differing administrative and congressional budget prio rities eg by establishing ranking or prioritization criteria where to go from here growing pressure on water supplies in the west make it likely that the demand for title xvi projects and requests for federal assistance and hence pressure on congress to approve more projects will increase at the same time the potential for future requests to escalate nd create an entirely new cla ss of water supply assistance appears to have increased congressional administration and trad itional reclamation stakeholder concerns over the implementation and authorization of new title xvi projects under the current process the potential result is an evergrowing list of pending title xvi legislative proposals and for those gaining congressional approval growing list of projects competing for limited appropriations and administration support curren tly almost third of the 33 authorized projects are unfunded backlog the administration has repeatedly cited as reason to oppose new authorizations and an add itional 16 project authorizations are in legislation pending before the 109th congress some of these proposals have been pending for multiple congresses thus the 109th congress is faced with the question what should be the future of the title xvi program fundamental to deciding the future of the program are underlying questions related to the federal role in muni cipal water reclamation andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33707crs13 reuse specifically and perhaps municipa l water supply more generally how urgent is the problem of water scarcity in west what are other options to address the problem how important is the problem while the problem may be acute in some areas it may be less so in others should an adjustment to the program acknowledge such differences and focus fede ral resources in certain areas should it be federal responsibility to promote reuse in the west if so why or why not nationwide how does reuse c ontribute to national wellbeing if congress decides to affirm federa l role for water reuse in the west different set of questions arises how does promoting or facilitating reuse in the west facilitate other federal goals objectives and lega l obligations eg protection of threatened and endangered species how does or could the title xvi program mesh with other federalactivities eg interiors wate r 2025 challenge grant initiative or calfed water reuse and storage activities should the program be tied to alleviating dema nd or reducing existing diversions where endanger ed species or other fish and wildlife or water quality concerns are at issue should it be used to help comm unities droughtproof their supplies or to slow pressure on agricultu ral water supplies by possibly slowing conversion of agriculture tourban water transfers will promotion of water reclamation and reuse simply encourage more growth in already water scarce areas will growth or development come at the expense of federalinvestment in other economically depressed areas with plentiful water resources these questions are just few that arise when discussing the future of title xvi legislative considerations oversight hearings have been held on the title xvi program in both the 108th and 109th congresses however only recently have comprehensive bills been introduced which would amend title xvi stakeholders include local and regional proponents of new but unauthoriz ed title xvi projects proponents of authorized yet unfunded title xvi projects the admin istration congressional sponsors and committees of ju risdiction as well as traditional r eclamation stakeholders concerned about the programs potential to siphon funds away from nontitle xvi projects overview of legislative options wide range of options is available for addressing the title xvi issues addressed above one opti on currently being pursued focuses on evaluation issues two recently introduced bills hr 5768 and s 3639 would replace the existing appraisal and feasibility evaluation process with more limited technical and financial viability and review process the bills also address implementation issueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33707crs14 23 statement of larry todd deputy commissioner bureau of reclamation before senate energy and natural resources water and power subcommittee july 27 2006 pp 12 24 water 2025 is relatively new department of the interior small grants program for innovative water resource projectssuch as the purpose of the program to au thorize both permanent and demonstration projects in western states nd hawaii and clarify that salination and recycling are permitted title xvi activities the ad ministration testified that the proposed legislation would improve the program and make it easier for reclamation to administer however the administration s upported adjustments to the legislation to ensure that project assessment and authorization is prioritized to focus on areas of greatest need and to ensure project s are worthy of federal investment23 t h administration stated it could not support s 3639 in its current form another option would be to focus on program and project eligibility and ranking criteria this direction is supported in the administrations testimony on s 3639 the administration specifically called for veloping ranking criteria that would help reclamation congress and the administra tion prioritize projects according to reclamation such ranking criteria woul d address whether the project actually alleviates significant water conflict or shortage and whethe r it would add water supply in one of the likely crisis areas th at we have focused on in efforts like the water 2025 program24 under this option other stake holder priorities might also be addressed these priorities range from assisting communities with drought resilience to focusing on projects with innovative and new technologies while s 3639 includes several factors that must be considered during review of project proposals including how the project might serve an id entified federal interest these factors are not presented as decisionma king or ranking criteria another approach would be to evalua programs using funding focus funding issues could be addr essed via economic or financ ial prioritiza tion during the evaluation process through new program eligibility and ranking criteria or both for example in order to justify federal investment in local projects many federal capital investment programs includ requirements for some type of economic analysis of project alternatives federa l water resource projects are generally evaluated using economic and environmental principles and guidelines for water resource projects pgs the focus of the p gs is on national ec onomic development ned benefits although analysis of re gional economic development red is also included although using the pgs is typically necessary component of reclamations feasibility study process reclamation guidelines explicitly state that the pgs are not used for title xvi proj ects because of the projects local not national scope instead the guidelines require an assessment of projects economic feasibility relative to other alternatives the local sponsor could pursue many other federal agencies also requi re economic analyses of projects via alternatives analysis for example the federal transit administrations new starts program requires evaluation of co steffectiveness via an alternatives analysis as part of its overall financial and project justifica tion evaluation process 3011a of safetealu 49 usc 5309 d also although projectlevel decisions under the epas clean water ac t state revolving fund program are madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33707crs15 25 while the administration developed guidelin for the title xvi program in the mid 1990s the guidelines have not been revised and were never formally promulgated as rules nor have other administrative options been actively pursuedby the states the clean water act directs the epa administrator to publish guidelines for evaluation methods includi ng costeffectiveness 2122c of pl 92500 33 usc 12922c such as the identification and selection of cost effective alternatives to comply with the objective and goals of the act 217 further projects receiving fe deral financial assistance unde r the act must be the most economical and costeffective 218a and b relevant clean water act state revolving fund guidelines are publishe d at 40 cfr 35 subpart appendix these are just few of the options to address identified title xvi implementation issues other legislative options include dismantling or phasing out the title xvi program strengthening the program or other less drastic adjustments such as providing reclamation with clearer direction on the purpose for it to carry out these activities options that could be pursued administratively include strengthening agency guidelines and deve loping formal rules or regulations with specific program and project eligib ility funding and ranking criteria25 while option is likely to garner the support of ll stakeholders an examination of options may clarify perspectives on the appropriate federal role in reus and define goals of federal participation in reuse conclusion the title xvi program is at crossroad growing demands on water resources in the west and elsewhere make it likely that demand for assistance with water reclamation and reuse projects will continue to increase depending on ones perception of problems with the title xvi program different solutions to resolving program issues will be sought different stakeholders will have different opinions on the magnitude importance and scope of the broad policy program criteria project evaluation and funding issues iden tified in this report congress and the administration have several options to address title xvi implementation issues resolution of these issues will depend on many factors including whether or to what degree congressional and administration priorities for the program can be articulated and balanced for example it appears fro m recent testimony that projects sponsors are generally interested in more str eamlined project development process and expanded program appr opriations while the administr ation supports more limited program with longterm objectives focused on federal interests the challenge for congress will be how to proceed in the face of divergent positionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33707crs16 26 pl 104266 1996 amendments authorized sp ecific construction pr ojects in california utah
