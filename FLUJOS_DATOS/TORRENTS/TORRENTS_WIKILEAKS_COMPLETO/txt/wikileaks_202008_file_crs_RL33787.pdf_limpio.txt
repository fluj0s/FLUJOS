maritime security activities among virtually unlimited number of potential attack scenarios while individual scenarios have distinct features they may be characterized along five common dimensions perpetrators objectiv locations targets and tactics in many cases such scenarios have been iden tified as part of s ecurity preparedness exercises security assessments security grant administration and policy debate there are far more potential attack scenarios than likely ones and far more than could be meaningfully addressed w ith limited counterterrorism resources there are number of logical approach to prioritizin g maritime security activities one approach is to emphasi ze diversity devotin g available counter terrorism resources to broadl representative sample of credible scenarios another approach is to focus counterterrorism resources on only the scenarios of greatest concern based on overall ris k potential consequence lik elihood or rela ted metrics us maritime security agencies appear to have followed policies consistent with one or the other of these approaches in fe derallysupported port secu rity exercises and grant programs legislators often appear to focus attention on small number of potentially catastrophic scenarios clear perspectives on the nature and likelihood of specific types of maritime terrorist attacks are essential for prioritizing the nations maritime antiterrorism activities in practice however there has been considerable pub lic debate about the likelihood of scenarios frequently given high priority by federa l policy makers such as nuclear or dirty bombs smuggled in shipping containers liquefied natural gas lng tanker attacks and attacks on passenger ferries differing priorities set by port officials grant officials and legislators lead to differing allocations of port security resources and levels of protection agains t specific types of attacks how they ultimately relate to one another under nati onal maritime security strategy remains to be seen maritime terrorist threats to the united states are varied and so are the nations efforts to combat them as oversight of the federal role in maritime security continues congress may ra ise questions concerning the relationship among the nations various maritime security activities and the implications of differing protection priorities among them impr oved gathering and sharing of maritime terrorism intelligence may enhance consistency of policy and increase efficient deployment of mar itime security resources in addition congress may assess how the

security potential terrorist attacks and protection priorities introduction maritime security is principal protective element of united states global war on terrorism the bush administrations national strategy for maritime security states that the infrastructure and systems that span the maritime domain have increasingly become both targets of and potential conveyances for dangerous and illicit activities1 widely reported maritime attacks against the united states and its allies such as the bombings of the uss cole in 2000 and the french oil tanker limburg in 2002 have focused congressiona l attention on ma ritime threats2 in 2006 debate over the failed attempt by dubai ports world to operate marine terminals at some us ports raised dditional congressional concerns about us maritime security activities3 questions have emerged regarding both the nations overall strategy for maritime security and its level of commitment to specific components of that strategy as debate about us mar itime security continues po licy makers seek better understanding of the nature and likelihood of potential terrorist attacks against the united states and how federal programs prioritize their efforts to prevent such attacks this report outlines the key dimensions of maritime terrorism and how these dimensions may characterize specific attacks in the global maritime domain the report illustrates credible maritime attack scenarios based on actual past attacks or potential attacks developed fo r maritime security exercises or other us counter terrorism activities it discusses the challenge to maritime security planners of facing virtually unlimited number of potential attack scenarios and how certain federal programs address this challenge it also reviews various perspectives

terrorist attacks maritime terrorism encompasses wide range of potential attack scenarios while individual scenarios have distinct feat ures for purposes of this report they may be characterized along five common dimens ions perpetrators objectives locations targets and tactics these dimensions are useful for discu ssing both historical instances of maritime terrorism and potential scenarios for future maritime attacks perpetrators identifying potential perpetrators is important in evaluating maritime attacks because perpetrator capabilities vary widely and therefore bear on the types of attacks they might attempt disgruntled shipping workers for example may exploit privileged port access to circumvent secur ity safeguards and mount an insider attack on maritime infrastructure an qaeda cell on the other hand may mount an entirely different type of attack on the same type of infrastructure exploiting sophisticated training in terrorist t actics and privileged access to weapons and explosives especially overseas although many terrorist groups may pose credible threat to the united states not all may pose maritime threat qaeda and its affiliates have been primary focus of us maritime security policy given the terror networks hostility to us interests and its record of past attacks qaeda or its operatives for exam ple appear to have been responsible for both the cole and limburg bombings5 likewise the abu sayyaf group islamist separatists based in the philippines and tied to qaeda appears to have been behind the bombing of the philippine vessel superferry 14 in 20046 groups or individuals not necessarily affiliated with qaeda may also attack the united states however it is noteworthy that the only sustained international terrorist campaign in us waters over the last 40 years was carried out by anticastro cuban groups between 1968 and 19767 independent islamist terrorist cells may also emerge as qaeda is disrupted or disaggregated by the us war on terror according to state department review of qaeda activity in 2005 what was once relatively structured network appeared to be more diffuse worldwid movement of likeminded individuals and small groups sharing grievances and obj ectives but not necessarily organized formally8 given this evolution among terrorist groups maritime terrorism scenarios increasingly require consideration of broad spectrum

human casualties economic losses environmental damage or other negative impacts alone or in combination of minor or major consequence9 i f h u m n casualties are the principal objective passenger vessels such as cruise ships and ferries which together account for less than 4 of us commerc ial vessel inventory may be more attractive terrorist targets than cargo and other vessels10 consistent with this reasoning federal agencies reportedly concluded in 2004 that the washington state ferry system had been under surve illance as possible terrorism target11 weapon of mass destruction wmd attack on heavily populated us port could inflict the greatest number of human casualties the defense departments joint task fo rcecivil support developed such scenario in 2005 exercise involving the smuggling and detona tion of 10kiloton nuclear device in the port of charleston sc12 if economic loss is the primary objective terrorists may seek to carry out different types of attacks with potentially few human casualties but significant impacts to critical infrastructure or commerce the limburg bombing may have been an attack of this type threatening to disrupt the global oil trade and causing considerable consternati on among tanker operators13 although the bombing killed only one member of the limburgs crew it caused insurance rates among yemeni shippers to rise 300 and reduced yemeni port shipping volumes by 50 in the month after the attack14 the bombing also caused significant environmental damage spilling 90 000 barrels of il into the gulf of aden15 other types of

the potential consequences of terror att ack are also an important consideration in evaluating terrorist objectives terro rists groups such as qaeda appear to choose the scale and timing of their attack s in order to max imize media coverage and hence public awareness and psychological impact as one academic study concluded to make it into the news terrorists operating in western countries can commit some minor terror incident with few fa talities whereas terrorists in developing countries need to produce lot of bl ood to attract the attention of western media17 accordingly attack scenarios must consider consequences and how such consequences would align w ith the objectives of potential perpetrators the study cited above suggests that terrorists attack ing the united states may achieve their media objectives even with relatively minor attacks locations where potential maritime attack could occur is also essential to defining terrorism scenario examples above have already illustrated that maritime attacks targeting us interests may occur in us ports of which there are over 36018 or among the ports of the nation s 165 maritime trading partners19 specific types of attacks such as the smuggling of wmds in shipborne cargo containers may involve both foreign port of departure and us port of entry maritime terror attacks may also occur at sea in areas of concentrated shipping like the straits of gibraltar where in 2002 alqaeda operatives reportedly plotte d to attack us and british warships and possibly commercial vessels20 the straits of malacca in southeast asia is another location frequently identified by security analysts as potential locus of maritime terrorism activity in 2001 jem aah islamiyah terrorists reportedly had plans to attack us navy vessels visiting the

terrorist attacks in us waters may have the greatest potential to injure us citizens if they occur in populated areas they may also have the greatest potential for economic impact in the event of the clos ure of major us port nonetheless future attacks on us interests in foreign ports or on vessels at sea in transit to the united states may be easier for terrorists to execute than attacks in us waters targets another key aspect of maritime terrori sm scenarios is identifying potential targets there are numerous possibilities especially in and around ports as us government accountability office gao an alyst testified befo re congress in 2006 ports contain number of specific facilities that could be targeted by terrorists including military vessels and bases cruise ships passenger ferries terminals dams and locks factories office bui ldings power plants refineries sports complexes and other critical infrastructure23 in addition to vessels and infrastructure terrorists may seek to attack maritime communities using ships as delivery vehicles for wmds or by exploiting chemicals or explosives in cargo ships or onshore storage tanks in populated port areas the homeland security council included terrori st attacks on ships carrying flammable and toxic chemical cargoes in us port among the hazard scenarios it developed in 2004 as the basis for us homeland s ecurity national prep aredness standards24 because the characteristics of infrastructure targets or human targets may be unique to any specific category of target eg propane tankers or community eg charleston understanding how target char acteristics relate to terrorist capabilities and objectives may offer valuable insights into the credibility of particular attack scenarios tactics maritime security analysts have discussed numerous potential tactics for terrorist attacks on us maritime targets the following passage from the nationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33787crs6 25 dhs and dod september 2005

security discussions terrorists can also develop effective ttack capabilities relatively quickly using explosivesladen suicide boats and light aircraft merchant and cruise ships as kinetic weapons to ram another vessel warship port facility or offshore platform commercial vessels as launch pl atforms for missile attacks underwater swimmers to infiltrate ports and unmanned underwater explosive delivery vehicles mines are also an effec tive weapon terrorists can also take advantage of vessels legitimate cargo such as chemicals petroleum or liquefied natural gas as the explosive component of an attack vessels can be used to transport powerful conventional explosives or wmd for detonation in port or alongside an offshore facility25 general tactics of ma ritime attacks like those above ve been further described in security bulletins based on specific terrorism intelligence for example in 2004 the federal bureau of investigation warned of possible improvised marine mines in waterborne flotsam commonly seen ar ound waterways or attached to buoys26 more specific tactics have also been articulated as part of us maritime security exercises discussed later in this report as the previous citations suggest analysis of terrorist tactics must take into account the specifics of the att ack in question some analysts believe that there is low probability that terrorists would try to use large ship as weapon because of the complexity of doing so but that attacks by small boats are more likely because they satisfy the overwhelming terrorist requirement for simplicity27 similarly the commandant of the us coast guard uscg has reportedly stated that there is significant threat by vesselborne improvised explosive devices and that vulnerability to small boat attacks stood out during 2006 threat assessment28 unlimited scenarios the dimensions of maritime terrori sm defined above may be used to characterize both historical terrorist attacks and potential future attacks against the

the possibility of generating numerous unique logically consistent and ope rationally credible attack scenarios based on different combinations of perpetrators objectives locations targets and tactics doing so exhaustively however leads to far more potential attack scenarios than likely ones and far more than could be meaningfu lly addressed with limited counterterrorism resources as one security anal yst has articulated the problem an accurate assessment of the current nature and scope of the global maritime terrorist threat should be driven by an ssessment of what is probable rather than merely possible however sober analysis of this issue has been clouded amid the anxiety created by the current global security climate with much discussion turning on the notion that terrorists c ould potentially strike any target with virtually any means available29 key challenge therefore for us security analysts and policy makers is prioritizing the nations maritime security activitie s among virtually unlimited number of potential attack scenarios how federal agencies have been addressing the unlimited scenarios problem is discussed in the following

independently of one another they encompass broad range of potential attack scenarios overseas exercises apart from exercises in us territorial waters the us navy uscg and other federal agencies participate in maritime security exercises overseas often in cooperation with other countri for example in 2006 the us navy and uscg joined with the thai navy and other international participants in simulating the hijacking of vessel with military cargo in the strait of malacca48 in 2006 the us navy also par ticipated in mu ltinational maritime exercise involving the hypothetical placement of sea mines by terrorists in coastal waters of the south china sea49 in 2003 the us japanese australian and french navies conducted an exercise involving the seizure of illegal wmdrelated cargo aboard commercial vessel in the coral sea50 these are only three illustrations of what appear to be numerous maritime counterterrorism ex ercises carried out by us agencies around the world ove r the past five years emphasizing scenario diversity based on the scenario summaries above it appears that the uscg the us navy and other agencies have structured their maritime terrorism exercises in manner that addresses diverse terrorism scenarios across many ports given that the portstep amstep and awi programs in particular are geared toward training and evaluation there are logical reasons they would employ such diverse scenarios the portstep program for example states that its exercises are scaled and tailored to each specific ports needs based on the recommendations of individual area maritime security committees51 since many aspects of terrori sm prevention and response eg communications are common to range of attack scenarios in given port area the choice of one scenario or another may reveal similar things about security plan performance scenario diversity also maximizes the operational and geographical experience among senior us agency planners in an environment of great uncertainty about future maritime terror attacks emergency responde rs may therefore be more likely to have at least some level of preparedness for any kind of maritime attack anywherehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33787crs12 52 us coast guard uscg guidelines for port security committees and port security plans required for us ports navigati on and vessel inspection circular 902 september 30 2002 p13 53 according to portstep official the uscg did rank us ports based on risk but the selection of ports for the program was based on broader criteria including port diversity 54 this figure includes 75 million in port security grants awarded under the dhss urban area security initiative in fy2003 55 transportation security administration t sa port security grant program awards round 2 june 12 20 03 available at h ttp wwwaapaportsorggovrelationsattacha doc 56 dept of homeland security ffice of inspector general review of the port security grant program oig0510 january 2005 p 17terrorism scenario diversity is also relatively simple with limited need for complex and time consuming risk assessments to establish scenario priorities the only key requirement common to all of the aforementioned scenarios appears to be credibility or as stated in uscg port secur ity guidelines that they be within the realm of possibilit and at min imum address known capabilities and intents as evidenced by past events and available intelligence52 it may be sufficient therefore that scenarios are credible and meet the particular needs of local port security officials not that they are demonstrably more or less critical than one another53 the principal disadvantage of di verse scenarios approach is that it may devote too many security resources to relatively unlikely s cenarios and not enough to more likely ones an alternative approach for example might be to conduct repeated exercises involving only few highconsequence s cenarios eg container wmds and only in the largest or most populous us ports dhs port security grants the department of homeland security dhs initiated its port security grant program psgp in 2002 to pr ovide competitive security enhancement grants to us ports the psgp awarded pproximately 870 million in port security grants by the end of 200654 the first four rounds of psgp grants appear to have been awarded in manner consistent with the broad scen arios approach scribed above for example the dhs awarded round two grants to over 125 us port areas ranging from major ports such as baltimore md houston tx and long beach ca to relatively minor ones such as christians ted vi fernandina beach fl and homer ak these awards also appear to have b een granted for protection of wide range of potential terrorist targets including container terminals rail yards sightseeing vessels ferries chemical plants energy facilities and port operations55 consistent with this conclusion 2005 review of the psgp by the dhs inspector general determined among other findings that the evaluation and selec tion process focused on awarding funds to as many applicants as possible56 according to the report this focus was influenced by tension between the fair and equitable award criteria mandated under the mtsa and the co mpetitive criteria mandated under tsa appropriations the report also noted that psgp awar ds were not based on

tampering and attack58 psgp round five awards were granted to 36 ports predominantly the largest us ports in terms of cargo tonnage or passenger traffic according to the dhs this approach was intended to allocate grant resources according to the overall risk among eligible ports and to fund projects with the greatest potential to reduce the risk of highpriority threats59 the psgps round six grant eligibi lity was expanded to what the dhs has determined are the nation s 100 most critical ports 60 this was an apparent reversal of the programs strategic shift in round fi ve which focused on

criteria for grantees continues to emphasize ieds mda and standardized credentialing but adds emergency drills and exercises and regional port collaboration as priorities emphasizing high priority scenarios the psgps current focus on specific types of weapons and targets and on the nations largest ports demonstrates an approach to the unlimited scenarios problem which emphasizes key scenarios while not excluding other scenarios the psgp round six and seven application materials appear to narrow down priority scenarios in terms of locations major ports targets ferries and crui ships and tactics ieds port security officials have also focused on priority scenarios although not necessarily the same stated by the psgp there are number of threat concerns that are believed to be more likely and therefore are the ones that most maritime security programs today are built ar ound these include the use of ports or vessels as means to smuggle weapons of mass destruction or terrorist operatives into the united states the use of ships as weapon to attack critical infrastructure the scuttling of ships in major shipping ch annels and terrorist attacks on ships such as ferries or oil tankers64 as indicated by dhs the priority scenario s approach has the advantage of applying the nations limited maritime security resources against terrorism attack scenarios of greatest relative concern based on intelligence and risk assessment the approach may also create potentially beneficial competition among grant applicants seeking funds for similar secur ity activities in different ports it reflects the dhss move towards riskbased distribution of all homeland security grants maritime and non maritime as recommended by the 911 commission65 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33787crs15 66

specific attack scenarios freque ntly cited in mar itime security policy discussions specific examples are discussed in the following section likelihood of us maritime terrorist attacks clear perspectives on the likelihood of specific types of maritime terrorist attacks are essential for prioritizing th nations maritime antiterrorism activities especially when security policies seek to concentrate resources against relatively limited number of terrorism scenarios as appears to be the case for dhs port security grants the responsible agencies must be confident that these scenarios are credible and do indeed pose the greatest threat to the united states in practice however there has been considerable public debate about the likelihood of scenarios frequently identified as having

challenges to obtai ning such device experts believe it unlikely that countries with nuclear w eapons or materials would knowingly supply them to terrorist group73 it also may be technically difficult to successfully detonate such nuclear device north korea experienced technical failures in conducting its 2006 nuclear weapons test and this test took place under highly controlled conditions74 attempting to detonate nuclear device in maritime terror attack could pose even greater operationa l challenges consistent with these perspectives secretary of homeland security michael chertoff has stated i dont think that in the near term theres significant likelihood of traditional nuclear device being detonated in the united states75 other experts concede that evaluating the likelihood of nuclear terrorism is inherently uncertain but that such potential attacks warrant attention even if they are unlikely the probability of terrorist attack with an actual nuclear weapon cannot be reliably estimated and it is surely lower than the probability of virtually any other type of terrorist attack bu t the devastation from such an attack would be so overwhelming that based on expected

and detonation of nuclear or dirty bomb device in shi pping container at us port is one of the threats most specifically and frequently mentioned by legislators in the context of maritime security89 shipping containers may be particularly vulnerable to terrorist infiltration compared to other types of cargo for three reasons first shipping containers are relatively large they come in standard sizes from 20 to 53 feet long although the most common are 40 feet or longerabout th size of truck semitrailer second the containers on any given ship are packed at the factories or warehouses of many different companies that can be dispersed far and wide from the loading port making it impossible for government authorities to ensure that only legitimate cargo has been packed third the containers are typica lly trucked to the port of loading during which the integrity of the shipments re sts entirely on the trustworthiness or due diligence of the truck drivers maritime security expert at the

congressional policy makers frequently cite passeng er ferries as key maritime security concern for example in 2005 one member of congress stated that there is serious security gap in our ferry systems and we need to ensure that passengers on our nations waterways are protected111 rand study in 2006 argued that attacks on passenger ferries in the united states might be highly attractive to terrorists because such attack s are easy to execute may kill many people would likely draw significant media atte ntion and could demonstrate terrorist groups salience and vibrancy112 one us coast guard risk analyst reportedly has stated that in terms of the probability of something happening the likelihood of it succeeding and the consequences of it occurri ng ferries come out at the very high end113 such attacks have occurred overs eas as noted earlier in this report terrorists linked to qaeda att acked and sank the philippine vessel superferry 14 in 2004 in 2006 report the us department

at marine facilities in the seattle area and at other us ports however officials in the seattle office of the federal bureau of investigation fbi reportedly suggested at the time that the dojs high ranking of the passenger ferry threat might be due to more aggressive reporting of suspicious incidents in that region than elsewhere in the country115 seattle fbi officials also reportedly stated

of greatest concern to us maritime security officials questions about the likelihood of these specifi c high priority scenarios beg the larger question of how likely is any maritime terrorism attack against the united states some experts suggest that some such att ack in one form or another is almost inevitable for example one senior us military officer has reportedly asserted that its just matter of time til the terrorists try to use maritime attack against us117 security analysts also point to know n terrorist plots to attack us maritime targets such as those passing the straits of gibraltar as evidence that global terrorist groups continue to plan ma ritime terrorism activities information from captured qaeda member abd rahman nashir i reportedly included plans for attacks on wide range of western maritime targets including military vessels oil tankers and cruise ships118 other analysts believe future maritime attacks against the united states are relatively unlikely especially in us waters notwithstanding specific acts of terrorism in the past such as the cole bombing they note that fewer than 1 of all global terrorist attacks since 1997 have involved ma ritime targets119 furthermore international terrorists have attacked maritime targets in us territory since the anticastro attacks in 1976 despite their demonstrated ability to do so overseas120 analysts also argue that us ports and waterways are increasingly wellprotected against terrorists due to the ongoing security activities of the us coast guard us customs and border protection cbp pr ovisions of the maritime transportation security act pl 107295 protections dded using dhs port security grants and other us maritime security measures121 classification issues may also influence differing perceptions of maritime terrorism risk since piracy unrelated to terrorism is common in southeast asia and may be conflated with terrorism in maritime security statistics122 key consideration in assessing the general likelihood of maritime attack against the united states is the inherent operational difficulty in mounting such attacks especially compared to land attacks which may alternatively satisfy terroristhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33787crs24 123 captain james pelkofski us navy before the storm qaedas coming maritime campaign proceedings us naval institute vol 132 12 december 2005 httpwwwusniorgproceedingsa rticles05pro12pelkofskihtml 124 ibidobjectives one us naval analyst has identified number of specific challenges for terrorists in the maritime environment maritime targets are relatively more scarce than land targets surveillance at sea offers ss cover and concealment than surveillance on land tides currents wind sea stat visibility and proximity to land must all be factored into maritime terror operation maritime terror operations may require skills that are notquickly or easily acquired such as special training in navigation coastal piloting and ship handling testing weapons and practicing attack techniques hallmarks of qaedas typically meticul ous preparation are harder and more difficult to conceal at sea than on land the generally singular nature of maritime targets the lowprobability of damage and casua lties secondary to the intended target and the problems associated with filming attacks at sea for terrorist publicity may also reduce the desirability of maritime targets 123 given these challenges it remains an open question how likely maritime attacks against the united states may be in terms of the scenario framework in this report although successful attack on us mar itime targets would likely satisfy certain objectives of known international perpet rators such as qaeda tactical uncertainties and security deterrents may lead terrorist planners to turn their attention elsewhere it bears repeating however that maritime terror attacks against the us have occurred and there is evidence they have been planned for the future despite the operational challenges the same naval analyst cited above calls for continued vigilance rather than develop false sense of security based on the belief that inherent difficulties will limit maritime terrorism caution is warranted in light of qaedas adaptability ingenuity tenacity and audacity successful development and applicati on of maritime tactics techniques and procedures has already occurre d within the terrorist community124 it appears therefore that while maritime terrorist attacks against the united states may be more difficult to execute and cons equently less likely to occur than other types of attacks they remain significant possibility and warrant continued policy attention the key challenge in determining th overall likelihood of terrorist attack on us port is reducing uncertainty about specific types of attacks and potential attackers because historical terrorist ac tivity is not necessarily reliable

plans of terro rist groups is limited and typically not in the public domain terrorist intelligence gathered by us and foreign agencies may reduce this uncertainty but is unlikely to eliminate it faced with this uncertainty decision makers are to some extent forced to rely upon their own best judgment to reach conclusions about the likeli hood of maritime terrorist attacks policy issues for congress maritime terrorist threats to the united states are varied and so are the nations efforts to combat them as cong ress continues its oversight of ongoing us maritime security activities it may focus on issues related to the consistency of maritime terrorism scenario assessment intelligence ga thering and responding to new intelligence consistency of terrori sm scenario assessment development and assessment of maritime terrorism scenarios is key element of federal port security exercises grant administration and legi slative oversight it appears however that these three dime nsions of the nations maritime security strategy emphasize terrorism scenarios in different ways port security exercises conducted under number of i ndependent programs addre ss the broadest range of terrorism scenarios with obvious focus on any particular scenario the dhs port security grant program currently emphasizes subset of these s cenariosied attacks on ferries and cruise ships in major ports fo r example federal legislators appear to focus oversight on different subset of s cenarios notably wmds aboard container vessels and attacks on lng tankers as this report states there is logical basis underlying the scenario priorities establis hed for exercises grants and oversight nonetheless if these activities are intended to derive from uniform federal maritime security strategy the question arises to what degree these activities are complementary or inconsistent if port officials grant administrators and legislators disagree on what types of attack scenarios are of greatest priority either because their security assessments are inconsistent or because they lack fficient intelligence about terrorist threats port security resources may be deployed inefficiently for example sharply increasing security against specific types of maritime attacks in specific locations may have limited benefits for overall port security if other significant vulnerabilities are not addressed as result key ques tion is whether policymakers are too focused on narrow spectrum of the threat former federal maritime commissioner has stated that it is fair to say there s been little to empha sis

intelligence about terrorist cap abilities and activities is key factor in terrorism scenario assessment congre ss may act to ensure that the responsible us intelligence agencies work to improve their intelligence gathering and reduce terrorism scenario uncertainty as depa rtment of defense fficial has reportedly remarked we have the operational capabilities to defeat any of these threats if we see the threat approachingthe most important thing we can do is to dramatically improve our overseas intelligence collection with specific orientation toward the maritime threat126 better intelligence may also help ensure that various federal maritime security activities are more closely aligned th government accountability office gao evaluated in december 2005 the port risk ssessment practices of the us coast guard the office for domestic preparedness and the information analysis and infrastructure protection directorateall agencies within the department of homeland security th gao report concluded each component faces many challenges in making further progress for example obtaining better quality data from intelligence agencies would help dhs components estimate the relative likelihood of various types of threatsa key element of assessing risks in the longer term progress will depend increasingly on how well risk management is coordinated across agencies because current approaches in many ways are neither consistent nor comparable127 responding to ne w intelligence given the dynamic nature of the rrorist threat congress may consider whether federal funding mechanisms for an titerrorism measures are flexible enough to respond to new threat intelligence between the time congress decides on the allocation of security grants among the various transportation modes in the annual appropriations process and the time that those grants are actually awarded can be almost year within this time frame new intelligence may indicate that security resources be reallocated to respond to diffe rent threat related oversight issue for congress is the capability of the us coast guard and cbp to shift staff and resources as new threat information becomes available for instance the us coast guard has developed maritime safety and security t eams consisting of about 75httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33787crs27 personnel that are designed to provide ra pid surge capacity at any port as the need arises cbp may have more difficulty in shifting resources because in addition to operating in seaports it operates in airports and at land border crossings and not all of its inspection equipment is easily adaptable across these three environments conclusion public information suggests that the threat of maritime terrorism is significant and can take myriad forms but that different dimensions of the nations maritime security activities prioritize these activities in different ways as oversight of the federal role in maritime security continues congress may raise questions concerning the relationship among these activities and the implications of differing terrorism scenario priorities among them improved gathering and sharing of maritime terrorism intelligence may enhance consistency across various us maritime security activities and increase the efficient deployment of maritime security resources in addition to these issues congress may assess how the various elements of us maritime security fit together in the nations overall strategy to protect the public from terrorist attacks for example bul k quantities of hazardous chemicals are found in marine vessels in rail and highway tankers and in chemical facilities on land terrorists may seek to exploit such chemical s in any of these sectors balancing the nations homeland security resources acr oss the maritime and nonmaritime sectors is policy challenge because specific sectors may fall under different homeland security authorities and regulations uncertainty about terrorist capabilities and activities complicates this problem by making it difficult to compare terrorist attack scenarios across sectors without such comprehensive perspective on terrorist threats security analysts may have difficulty identifying which assets to protect and how well to protect them with the limited security resources available reviewing how these security priorities and activitie s fit together to achieve common goals could be an oversight challenge for congress
