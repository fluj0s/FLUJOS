following several decades of divergence the businesses of commercial banking and securities activities have converged1 yet the regulatory framework for them crafted largely in the 1930s remains mainly under different statutory roofs2 this report3 summarizes the enforcement and compliance programs of federal banking regulators and those of the securities and exchange commission sec it begins by discussing the key objectives of banking and securities regulation which shed light on why enforcement programs differ there follow brief overviews of the statutory basis for enforcement the major enforcement tools and finally how regulators organize enforcement programs this report focuses on the primary goals of bank and securities regulation respectively banks are to be run in safe manner seeking to avoid risk and thus losses their regulation is largely in the background opaque although banking operations are subject to penetrating examinations by federal regulators agencies do not make most of the details public the sec on the other hand requires securities firms and securities issuers to disclose various details of their operations including all material information that may generate losses as well as expected profits in contrast to bank regulation therefore sec regulation of securities businesses may be labeled transparent that is although sources of volatility are acceptable in the industry they must be adequately and accurately revealed or disclosed in both sectors other goals are promoted by industry standards or selfpolicing and by government regulation among these are the following business continuity planning in case of natural and unnatural terrorist disasters that could weaken operations 4 preventing use of financial institutions as conduits for money laundering or terrorist financing5 providing consumer protection against fraud and misconduct safeguarding data security and the privacy of customer information and supervising technological service providers banking and securities regulators and institutions have long cooperated both nationally and internationally informally and formally and share cooperative arrangements of many kinds

g4g138g151g148g146g151g144g561 banking is one of the most heavily regulated businesses in the united states7 the reasons for this lie in the economics of banking typical bank balance sheet features longterm assets loans and investments and shortterm liabilities deposits this means that banks face liquidity problems if depositors suddenly choose to withdraw their funds furthermore run on single bank can become an industrywide problem if cautious depositors at otherwise healthy banks understanding that only some withdrawal claims can be satisfieddecide to get in line early banks are monitored closely through regulatory systems that require governmental chartering periodic reporting on virtually every aspect of their business systematic examination and supervision independent auditing and annual reports to shareholders depositors and the public 8 under the dual banking system banks may be chartered by state government or by the federal government although the chartering authoritystate or federalprescribes the requirements that banking institution must meet with respect to the basic aspects of its business an array of federal laws and regulations provide for close federal supervision of nearly all depository institutions in the united states major component of federal regulation of banking is the deposit insurance system to discourage runs on banks and reduce the risk of contagion congress began federal deposit insurance during the great depression following collapses of statesponsored deposit guaranty schemes 9 because under the deposit insurance program the federal government assumes part of the financial risk of bank failure federal law requires that banking regulators have access to confidential business data and gives them broad powers to assure that the managers of insured depository institutions operate them in safe manner nearly every aspect of the operation and management of an insured institution is subject to close regulatory supervision in an economic sense bankers and regulators are business partners bank that becomes insolvent is not just business failure it also represents failure of regulation as vigilant as the regulators may be bad business decisions are inevitable as are downturns in the economy that may result in negative effects flowing from risks that are otherwise acceptable in other words depositories cannot completely avoid risks with federal insurance of deposits however comes safety net that lessens the impact of bank failure on depositors and consequently on the entire monetary economy congress divides federal regulatory authority over banking institutions among five regulators the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic besides administering the federally guaranteed insurance fund that covers any insured deposit losses regulates statechartered banks and savings associations except those belonging to the federal reserve system frs the board of governors of the frs fed regulates such member banks the office of the comptroller of the currency occ regulates federallychartered national banks the office of thrift supervision ots regulates federallychartered and statechartered savings associations 7 see jonathan r macey and geoffrey p miller b anking law and regulation 73 2d ed 1997 8 see patricia mccoy b anking law manual 1203 matthew bender 2d ed 9 crs report rs20724 federal

subject to state banking laws and to supervision by state supervisory agencies10 federal regulators also have authority to monitor safety and soundness in various related organizations known as bank affiliates 11 which may be bank subsidiaries bank service companies or other entities related to the bank through corporate family structures known as holding companies regulation of holding companies and their subsidiaries depends on what kind of firm is at their core the fed regulates bankbased holding companies ots regulates savings institutionbased complexes and the sec securitiesbased investment bank holding companies 12 g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g146g142g156g561 the federal securities laws require companies that sell securities to the public to register with the sec in contrast to bank regulation however the act of registration with the sec does not mean that the government has deemed corporations securities to be safe investment registration documents known as prospectuses state in bold type at their beginning that these securities have not been approved or disapproved by the sec and any representation to the contrary is criminal event the prospectus for even highqua lity stock or bond issue sets forth long list of risk factors some of which are unlikely to occur while others such as weather labor cost and raw material conditions are intuitively obvious in fact the standard prospectus for highyield junk bond offering usually includes statements to the effect that it is highly unlikely that the issuing corporation will be able to pay interest on the bonds let alone repay the principal under federal securities law such an offer is entirely legal if all material information is fully and accurately disclosed to the public all parties concerned expect the value price of traded securities to fluctuate unlike bank deposits of fixed value in other words there is securities law term equivalent to safety and soundness the central notion of banking regulation one sees failure of publiclytraded corporation or the decline of its share price as sec failure if the firm has disclosed all material risks fully and accurately the sec seeks to protect investors from fraud not risk banking regulation transfers the risk of bank failure including any failure resulting from fraud from the customer to the government the sec also regulates and requires registration of brokerdealers investment advisers mutual fund operators and other members of the secu rities industry although the sec exercises regulatory authority over the securities industry its authority is somewhat limited an illustrative comparison is between the capital requirements imposed upon banks and the secs net capital rule which requires brokerage firms to maintain minimum level of capital above mere solvency lawmakers intend bank capital requirements to permit institutions to weather unexpected losses or unfavorable market developments the net capital rule on the other hand is liquidation ruleit seeks to ensure that failing brokerages are shut down while they have money left to meet customer claims even in such cases the brokerage industrys selffunded protection 10

organizations the sec has delegated significant authority to privatesector bodies for corporation accounting it has granted the financial accounting stan dards board and public company accounting oversight board major decisionmaking capabilities for securities firms it has allowed many oversight responsibilities to be carried on by the national association of securities dealers nasd self

provisions delegating various enforcement authorities to federal banking agencies under specified circumstances throughout us laws full range of the civil enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies is set out in section eight of the federal deposit insurance act 15 banking violations are also punishable under federal criminal laws and banking regulators often refer suspected violations to the department of justice for possible prosecution many prosecutions involving banks or banking officials are based on charges under general criminal statutes such as the federal laws against mail fraud wire fraud racketeering false statements and money laundering in addition many federal criminal laws apply more narrowly to banking these include 18 usc 215 bank briber 18 usc 656 theft or em

apply to violators like the banking regulators the sec cannot bring criminal charges itself but makes recommendations for prosecutions to the justice partment the principal securities statutes are four as follows the securities act of 1933 20 called truthinsecurities law requires that securities be registered with the sec before sponsorissuer sells them to the public registration requires disclosure of detailed information about the issuing corporations business management and financial condition failure to make complete and accurate disclosures creates liability for civil and criminal penalties the securities exchange act of 193421 created the sec and gave it broad authority to adopt rules and regulations to maintain fair and orderly securities markets this act requires ongoing disclosure and gives the sec control over the form and content of corporate financial statements quarterly and annual reports etc the act also applies to exchanges where securities are bought and soldstock bond and stock option markets must submit their rules for sec approval brokers the firms that employ them and other i ndustry professionals must register revocation of registration may

enforcement of federal banking laws generally in an institutions primary federal regulator each of the federal banking agencies issues regulations applicable to the entities under its authority typically these are coordinated through the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec25 it is an interagency body composed of the heads of the federal banking agencies which is charged with making uniform principles and standards and report forms for examination of financial institutions26 encouraging application of uniform examination principles and standards by state and federal supervisory agencies27 and reviewing all federal banking regulations at least once every 10 years to identify outdated or otherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements28 federal banking regulators have both considerable enforcement options and wide discretion in choosing among them besides the formal enforcement tools specifically authorized by statute each of the federal banking agencies employs informal methods of insuring that regulated institutions meet safety and soundness standards as well as regulatory and statutory standards these range from moral suasion to written requirements that corrective action be taken much of the information upon which informal enforcement actions are based derives from periodic bank examinations each banking agency has its own examination force that detects violations during recurring safety and specialpurpose examinations of bank books and operations upon completion of bank examination the regulator will present report of examination to the institutions board of directors which is to order remedial action or present information refuting the findings other forms of informal enforcement tools to correct perceived weaknesses in an institution include supervisory directives boardofdirector resolutions drafted by the regulator and written instructions or agreements from the regulator 29 institutions usually make correction and remediation voluntarily following the examination process and consider such selfcorrection normal part of their business because of the multiplicity and complexity of banking laws and regulations if this informal process of enforcement is unavailing the banking agencies resort to the formal mechanisms available to them they thus typically issue progressively stricter enforcement decrees against more serious weaknesses memoranda of understanding civil money penalties ceaseanddesist orders and 23 15 usc 80b et seq 24 crs report 94511 hedge funds should they be regulated by mark
