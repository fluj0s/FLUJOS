protectcommercial 2 policy questions responses in this section have been provided by the uk border agency ukba 21 purpose eborders is key component of the governments border technolo gy programme aiming to make the uk safer and speeding up travel for legit imate travellers the programme aims to deliver modern border c ontrol which is more secure effective and efficient the purpose of eborders is to collect and analyse passenger service and crew data provided by carriers air sea and rail in re spect of all journeys to and from the united kingdom in advance of travel supporting an intelligenceled approach to operating border controls eborders will improve the security efficien cy and effectiveness of the border it will in particular be capable of processing rapidly increasing numbers of travellers increasingly make legitimate travel easier along with use of other technology such as biometric passports iris and facial recognition systems keep out or monitor individuals that could cause harm maintain comprehensive travel history allowing the ukba to k now who has travelled to the uk whether as crew or passenger and when they left and help the ukba and police to target resources more effectively further information about the eborders programme is available t httpwwwukbahomeofficegovuktravelling totheukbeforetravel advanceinfopassengers 22 data submission 221 question why do we need to submit data to eborders answer in order to achieve the aims and objec tives of eborders the uk government has passed legislation that requires carriers arr iving or expected to arrive in the uk or leaving or expected to leave the uk to submit data to ebord ers an overview of the legislation may be found at httpwwwukbahomeofficegovuktravelling totheukbeforetravel advanceinfopassengers the statutory order may be found at httpwwwopsigovuksisi2008pdfuksi_20080005_enpdf 222 question what data needs to be submitted answer predeparture and postdeparture information is required for each passenger and member of crew on the voyage predeparture information provides the nbtc with sufficient time to process the data for each passenger and member of crew prior to std this allows for an early alert to be raised and subsequently timely intervention by the appropriate agency where required this message consists of service information see tables 68 in protectcommercial document ref ebrp01256 issue number 40 date of issue 01 september 2009 page 9 of 39 protectcommercial reference and travel document inform ation see table 9 in reference pre departure information can be provided in the following ways individual messaging per passenger or crew member this supports more timely operational interventions and bette r positions the carrier for any authority to carry scheme which may be introduced in the future batched submission of passenger or crew data which could constitute single predeparture batch multiple batches or combination of batch and individual messages departure information provides the nbtc with final confirmation of the passen gers and members of crew either inbound or outbound to or from the uk exactly one 1 postdeparture message must be submitted fo r voyage when the message contains traveller records for both passengers and crew where messages contain only crew or passenger records by design paxlst or choice g excel then exactly one 1 passenger and one 1 crew postdeparture message must be submitted these messages must contain the same si data as the predeparture ssages the identity of those on board must be indicated by using one of the f ollowing three message types where messages contain only crew or passenger records it is not necessary to use the same message type for submitting crew data as is used for submitting passenger data departure confirmation departure confirmation message identifies all travellers crew passenger or both on board as minimum tdnis must be reported for each traveller departure exception not on board departure exception message identifies all travellers crew passenger or both for whom predeparture record was sent but who did not depart on the voyage as minimum tdnis must be reported for each traveller departure exception nil return departure exception nil return message confirms that all travellers fo r whom predeparture record was sent departed on the voyage nil return message is identified by the fact that it contains traveller records caution should be taken when sub mitting nil return in any format other than paxlst as this will automati cally be taken as being for both passengers and crew 223 question we carry variety of vips heads of state royal family members amongst others for whom security is paramount and for whom we are not provided with all tdi how do we report these individuals answer the uk authorities require that tdi must be provided for all passengers without exception 224 question the crew operating our service into the uk do not carry their passports as they do not leave the aircraft is this problem and if so what documents should they carry answer crew must carry either valid passport pilots licence or crew member certificate all documents must contain description of t he holder including nationality and photograph this will be dealt with in practical nd pragmatic manner as it is today protectcommercial document ref ebrp01256 issue number 40 date of issue 01 september 2009 page 10 of 39 protectcommercial 225 question what is the threshold of carrier readiness needed before country can go live that is what percentage of the carriers operating into or out of country x n eed to be certified and ready to go live before golive date is issued answer the ukba has given an undertaking th at they will work towards 100 of carriers and volume for particular country before requiring data t be reported it may not always be possible to achieve this out come and the agency therefore reserves the right to require golive for particular count ry despite not having reached full coverage 23 data timings 231 question when does the data need to be submitted there are different timelines for the pre departure message depending upon whether the message is for passenger or crew data see the explanation below 232 predeparture information 2321 passenger data individual messaging 1 passenger data can be sent via individual messages from 24hrs std u ntil flight close ie until more passengers can board the plane passenger predeparture data cannot be provided earlier than std 24hrs 2 to support operational interventions it is expe cted that individual messages will be sent only once all tdi elements are known for that individ ual messages with missing data elements are not wanted the vast majority of individua l messages are expected by std 30mins 3 it is accepted that some individual messages may be received beyon d std 30mins especially where flight close does not take place until much cl oser to std or push back where delay has been experienced 4 tdi and si will need to be sent for each individual pre departure message please note carriers n eed to consider the operational impact of late interventions by agencies if they provide individual messages beyond std 30mins protectcommercial document ref ebrp01256 issue number 40 date of issue 01 september 2009 page 11 of 39 protectcommercial figure 1 individual messaging passenger 2322 passenger data batch messaging 1 passenger data can be sent via batch messag from 24hrs std until flight close ie until more passengers can board the plane passenger pr edeparture data cannot be provided earlier than std 24hrs 2 the authority expect that tdi will only be sent once all tdi elements are known messages with missing data elements are not wanted 3 to support operational interventions it is expe cted that single or number of batch messages is provided such that the late st information has been provided by std 30mins this is expected to cover the vast majority of passengers xpecting to travel 4 carriers are encouraged to provide batch drops earlier than std 3 0mins to provide informatio n as early as possible thereby minimising the impact of late interventions by agencies on their own operations 5 it is accepted that some passengers ma join the flight beyond std 30min s especially where flight close does not take place until much closer to std or push back where delay has been experienced where this happens carrier may provide either single batch covering all additional passengers since st d 30mins or b multiple batches as additional passengers become known the authority has strong preference for b under either scenario the later the data is submitted the greater the risk to carriers of operational impact from late interventions by agencies on outbound flights from the uk protectcommercial document ref ebrp01256 issue number 40 date of issue 01 september 2009 page 12 of 39 protectcommercial figure 2 batch messaging passenger 2323 crew data individual messaging 1 crew data can be sent via individual mess ages from 48hrs std until the point at which further changes are possible crew predeparture data cannot be provided earlier than std 48hrs 2 it is expected that all tdi will only be sent once all tdi elements are known for the crew member messages with missing data elements are not wanted 3 to support operational interventions it is expe cted that the vast majority of crew individual messages are s ent by std 60mins 4 it is accepted that some crew changes may take pla ce beyond std 60mins and up to push back in the case of delay when this happens td i for the new crew members should be provided as soon as it is known please note carriers need to consider the operational impact of late interventions by agencies if they provide individual messages beyond std 60mins figure 3 individual messaging crew protectcommercial document ref ebrp01256 issue number 40 date of issue 01 september 2009 page 13 of 39 protectcommercial 2324 crew data batch messaging the same principles apply as with batch messaging for passengers the following key differences are highlighted 1 crew data cannot be provided earlier than std 48h rs rather than 24hrs for passengers 2 the vast majority of batch messages are expecte d by std 60mins for crew rather than 30mins for passengers 3 it is accepted that some crew changes may take pla ce beyond std 60mins and up to push back in the case of delay when this happens c arrier can provide either single batch covering all additional crew since std 60mins or b multiple batches as additional crew become known the authority has strong preference for b under either scenario the later the data is submitted the greater the

whether an i ndividual or batch message solution was used predeparture push back pax post departure databbbb b push back 30minspush back crew post departure databb bbb push back 30mins figure 5 post departure information 234 question if carrier has finish ed transmitting all passenger check in messages 30 minutes prior to departure and are then cleared to depart early are they permitted to leave answer if all checkedin and connecting passengers have boarded withi n the 30minute window the carrier is not required to wait 30 minutes fro m the time the data is transmitted prior to secure the vesseltrainai rcraft and departing the requirement is to transmit the data 30 minutes prior to the std it is understo od the actual departure time may vary the postdeparture message must be transmitted within 30 minutes of actual pushback not the original expected pushback time 235 question can carrier transmit data prior to 48 hours before departure say up to 14 days before for round trips such as charter andor package holiday answer the window for submission is as defined in reference and reiterated in this document 236 question collation and transmission of departure data is difficult at some remote locations both for infrastructure and other reasons and must be sent from offsite in such circumstances can the post departure message be sent outside the 30 minute window answer departure message either departure co nfirmation or departure exception is required to be sent inside the required time window if for insurmountable reasons the message does not become available in time the message may be transmitted outside protectcommercial document ref ebrp01256 issue number 40 date of issue 01 september 2009 page 15 of 39 protectcommercial the window if neces sary the timing of each carriers data submission to eborders will be monitored and reported as part of eborders data quality mo nitoring function if it is considered that the in frastructure or other factors at location make reporting within the normal time window impractical carriers may submit req uest for an adjustment to the time window including all relevant tails 237 question can passenger checkin message be sent later than 30 minutes before departure answer all checkin data that is available mu st be submitted later than 30 minutes before scheduled departure it is accepted that some passengers may join flight later than 30 minutes before scheduled departure especially where flight close does not take place until much closer to departure time or push back whe re delay has been experienced where this applies predeparture data is also required for the late arriving passengers it is the strong preference of t he agencies for carriers to configure their systems so that details for the late passenger s are sent in real time as soon as these become known however carriers are also permitted to store up late arrivals and submit them in single second predepartur data batch at flight close clearly under either scenario the later the data is submitt ed the greater the risk of operational impact from late interventions by agencies on outbound flights from the uk 238 question can passenger be in cluded in departure message when they have not been included in previous checkin message answer the correct procedure is that checkin message should be sent under all circumstances even if it is late d eparture messages containing passengers not previously reported in corresponding checkin message will be mon itored and reported as part of eborders data quality monitoring 239 question we have some hubs wher late notice crew changes can take place which are not passed to our main base for incorporation into the crew system until after the flight has departed and the departure message sent are we required to report such changes and if how answer all crew changes that are submitted pr ior to the departure message being sent must be reported if changes are regularly submitted after the departure message has been sent carriers should consider requesting an extension to the submission window to allow their incorporation the timing and ac curacy of each carriers data submission to eborders will be monitored and reported as part of eborders dat quality monitoring 2310 question for crew data our sy stem only receives notification of takeoff time from the aircraft not pushback can we use this as the trigger for the sending of the postdeparture message instead answer yes the ukba is aware of the is sues and problems involved and where pushback time is not available take off time may be used as substitute protectcommercial document ref ebrp01256 issue number 40 date of issue 01 september 2009 page 16 of 39 protectcommercial 2311 question service information includ scheduled time of departure std and scheduled time of rrival sta our departure and arrival times can vary acc ording to which system is used as the data source which times should be reported answer the std and sta to be reported are to be those reported by the computerised reservation system crs selected by the carrier as its primary data source j1 2312 question we sometimes have fli ghts which are delayed for several hours which for various reasons require the dcs std and sta to be changed to reflect the new parture and arrival times the updated times will be reflected in the flight departure message is this allowed answer the std and sta reported by the carrier primary crs are required to be reported in all predeparture and departure messages j2 in exceptional circumstances such as during irregular operations it is accepted that the times used within the carrier and dcs syst ems must be updated and will not reflect the originally reported crs stdsta times in such circumstances the following options should be employed in order of preference predeparture messages should not be transmitted until the expected sdt and sta are known and should then be used consistently up and inclu ding in the departure message b where an essential change in carrierdc s system std time after the transmission of any previous messages in re lation to the flight will result in change of std in ny subsequent messages andor the departure message previously submitted traveller records must be retransmitted reflecting the amended timings to nsure consistency note change in sta alone does not require previous messages to be submitted only when changed in conjunction with change in std 2313 question we have travellers who arrive at the airport with non standard travel documents embassy or consulate letters after losing their travel documents what deta ils are required to be reported answer where travellers have lost their travel document they should be in possession of letter from the embassy or consulate this letter if it does not have serial number will have file reference the letter serial number or file reference should be entered as the travel document number the ghacarrie r should enter the travellers name gender and dob as given in the letter if any details are missing from the letter they should be obtained from the traveller the letter should be used to obtain the date of expiry the embassy or consulate that issued the letter should be entered as both the traveller nationality and the issuing state for the travel document if the letter does not have an expiry date since it is singleuse get you home document the date of use should be entered if it has validity period enter the last date of the validity period if the document does not have serial number then the file protectcommercial document ref ebrp01256 issue number 40 date of issue 01 september 2009 page 17 of 39 protectcommercial reference should be entered removing any symbols and concatenat ing the resulting alphanumeric string eg fo23197 12 june 2009 would become fo2319712062009 i f the length of the string is too long for the sy stem then it should be truncated by omitting the final characters the document should be entered as type f other valid tra vel document 24 aircraft leasing 241 question sometimes we operate fli ghts where we either dry lease or wet lease the aircraft we also have occasions where we damp lease the aircraft providing our own cabin crew in such circumstances who is responsib for providing the required passenger and crew pre and post departure messages answer the lessor as owner or agent of the ai rcraft is responsible for providing the data in all circumstances with the sole except ion of that of dry lease where the lessee becomes responsible for providing the data as the agent of the aircraft this does not mean that the lessor must submit the data themselves there will be circumstances where crew and passenger data could be submitted by different companies for it legislative or other reasons ho wever the lessor retains responsibility for ensuring that the data is submitted notes 1 the term lessor defines the person or organisation who assig ns the lease to anothe r party in all cases except that of dry lease this should be the company who provide the aoc or other country equivalent for the aircraft 2 the term lessee defines the party to whom lease is give n or takes on the lease of the aircraft in the case of dry lease th is should be the company who then provides the aoc or other country equivalent for the aircraft 3 the flight number or carrier code assigned to flight is not the defining facto r as this may be provided by the lessee the lessor re tains responsibility in all cases except for that of dry lease 4 aircraft lease definitions wet lease the lessor provides the aircra ft crew maintenance and insurance and typically charges the lessee on the basis of block hours damp lease damp lease is similar to wet lease but the lessor provid the aircraft without cabin crew who are provided by the lessee dry lease the lessor provides the basic aircraft without crew maintenan ce or insurance dry lease normally requires t he lessee to put the aircraft on his own aoc and provide aircraft registration 25 reporting metrics 251 question we wish to ensure we do not fall below the standards required in accuracy and timeliness for the submission of data can protectcommercial document ref ebrp01256 issue number 40 date of issue 01 september 2009 page 18 of 39 protectcommercial you provide us with the metrics andor percentages used as thresholds and how these can be monitored answer carriers must provide tdi that is timely ie for each service data will be provided within t he agreed timescales complete ie data will include ll mandatory data fields fo r all passengers and crew travelling on each service together wi th complete service information accurate carriers must take all reasonable st eps to ensure that passenger and crew data is identical to that provided in the travel document the eborders system will generate regular data quality reports that will be used to monitor data quality carriers will be advis ed of problems with submitted messages and supported in resolving any issues that arise 252 question we are concerned that some of our message submissions may be marked as having been submitted late because of inaccuracies in the flight monitoring systems used as reference data such as flight cancellations and lays how do we ensure we will not be penalised if such errors occur answer concerns over the accuracy of flight reference data have been noted if quality issues identified during live service are found to be the result of inaccurate reference data appropriate action will be taken to addr ess the issue and we will work with carriers to achieve resolution 26 the common travel area domestic travel 261 question which states form the ct and what discussions has the uk government had with other cta governments about the operation of the cta answer the common travel area is formed of the united kingdom the republic of ireland and the crown dependencies consisti ng of the isle of man and the channel islands the uk government in partnership with the governments of the republic of ireland and the crown dependencies has developed numbe r of proposals for modifying the operation of the cta 262 question what changes are pr oposed on air and sea routes between the crown dependencies and the uk answer for operations on routes between the crown dependencies and the uk we do not intend to introduce document requirement or collect ebo rders data we will instead treat the crown dependencies as being inside the eborders security ring protectcommercial document ref ebrp01256 issue number 40 date of issue 01 september 2009 page 19 of 39 protectcommercial 263 question what changes are pr oposed on air and sea routes between the republic of ireland r oi and the uk when will these begin to take place and what in formation will be required answer for air and sea routes between the uk and republic of ire land roi the intention was to use the borders citizenshi p and immigration bci bill to provide us with an unequivocal legal basis for our plans to introduce intelligence led checks on intra cta journeys the cta clause was withdrawn from the bci bill before it be came an act to prevent any delay to the passage of the bill through parliament the cta proposals are crucial if we are to make the border between the uk and the republic of ireland stronger than ever we still intend to pursue these changes and we will be looking to bring these proposals bac k to parliament at the first possible opportunity with the legislation in place the intenti on is to introduce eborders on routes between the republic of ireland and the uk along wi th requirement for persons travelling on these routes to carry their passport or national identity card subject to the legislation it is anticipated that data colle ction on these routes will comm ence in late 2010 it is expected that the required data will be all td i elements found in the mrz on an icao format machine readable travel document in the short term t here will be substantial changes to operations at the primary line and rolling out eborders to roi will support an intelligence led approach to enforcement 264 question we understand that there wi ll be future requirement to provide information on domestic travel dti within the uk what information will be required to be reported to eborders and in what timeframe answer section 14 of the police and justice act 2006 introduced new power to allow the police to collect travel information on interna l uk domestic flights and voyages the intention is to focus this power on air and sea routes b etween northern ireland and great britain this is police power chiefly for counter terrori sm purposes should the government decide to proceed there will be 12 week regulatory impact assessment where all interested parties will have the opportunity to comment on the proposals 27 maritime issues 271 question we operate cruise sh ips which may dock to allow passengers to disembark for shore excursions at several locations after the first arrival at uk port are we required to provide check in and departure messages for each stopdeparture answer if ship plans to visit the uk pre nd postdeparture mess ages must be sent listing all crew and passengers on board rega rdless of any intent to disembark if the ship intends to visit more than one uk port before departing for another foreign port then the port of arrival and the subsequent port must both be id entified in the submitted messages in the case of further subsequent multiple stops in the uk message is protectcommercial document ref ebrp01256 issue number 40 date of issue 01 september 2009 page 20 of 39 protectcommercial required until the vessel sets sail for foreign port pre and postdeparture messages must then be sent prior to the ship departing the uk for foreign port stating the uk port of departure and the first foreign port of arrival 272 question what about freighters th at are unloadingrefuelling before going to another domestic port or another international port but where crew or passengers are either embarking or disembarking answer if ship plans to visit the uk pre nd postdeparture mess ages must be sent listing all crew and passengers on board the vessel regardless of their intention to remain on board during the period of the visit the message m ust be sent in respect of the first port of call in the uk for an arriving vessel and the last uk port of call for vessel setting sail for foreign destination 273 question we often sail for the uk or europe without knowing our destination port eg tankers may leave the gulf with destination of lefo lands end for orders wh destination will be provided once the purchaser of the cargo is known hence we do not know the port date of arrival or time of arrival upon departure how do we report the journey answer if the journey destination at the time of departure is t known to be the uk reporting is required once the intention to land at uk destination is known pre and postdeparture messages must be submitted the submitted si data should include the last port of call before arrival in the uk together with the actual date and time of departure 28 data protection 281 question we are required to comp ly with the data protection laws of the states from which we op erate what assurance can you provide us that we will not be in fringing these laws by providing the data you request answer the eborders programme is engaged with the uk information c ommissioners office the information commissioner has visited the nbtc j3 and is satisfied the borders system is compliant from both uk data protection act 1998 and overseas law perspective there is awareness of specific industry co ncerns concerning the collection storage and transmission of such data in other states these and any other concerns will be dealt with on case by case basis if any carrier encounters specifi c problem with officials in any country the issue should be rais ed with the ukba and then dealt with on country to country basis fac ilitated by the uk border visa policy authorities there is code of practice on the manag ement of information shared by the border agencies and commitment to continue to review with the in formation

mechanical weather etc mu st the checkin data for that passenger be submitted again or can the passenger simply be added to the departure message for the new flight answer data previously submitted for the origi nal flight cannot be associated with the new flight the data has to be resubmitted checkin data and departure confirmation must be submitted for the flight t he passenger actually travels on passengers that are checkedin for fli ght and for whatever reason do not depart on that flight must either be reported in departure exception message or omitted from departure confirmation

issue number 40 date of issue 01 september 2009 page 23 of 39 protectcommercial answer predeparture crew reportin messages may be submitted by both companies as eborders is able to accept multiple re portin messages from multiple sources as long as the si data is consistent across all messages however eborders requires single depa rture message covering all crew members whilst the legal responsibility for submission of the data lies with the lessor company the decision as to which company actually submits the combined data is decision for the companies involved 33 transit and

new voyages si data 362 question can voyage keep using th originally submitted si data if the scheduled time of departur is delayed into the next day answer the intent of requiring si data to be uni for day is to ensure that there can be confusion concerning which flight tr aveller actually takes if the voyage will be completed prior to the departure of the next rvice using the same route id the original si should be maintained if any overlap betw een the two services may occur then an alternate flight id should be used for one or both of the services if flight id is changed previously

in the pre departure message and the postdep arture message is it the published time or the time as ame nded for delays such as weather etc answer the departure time to be reported in the si portion of the messages is the plannedscheduled time at which the carrier normally expects t he service to depart usually this will be the carriers published scheduled depart ure time once time has been used within an initial checkin or reportin message fo r the voyage the same time must be used for all subsequent messages submitted for the same voyage any messages sent with different time will be regarded as dif ferent voyage 416 question what character sets does eborders accept answer the eborders system accepts messages coded using utf8 which supports multiple character sets including latin letters with diacritics and characters from the greek cyrillic coptic armenian hebrew arabic syriac and t ɨna alphabets where messages are sent in standardis ed message format such as paxlst or noad the content should adhere to the standard if more pre scriptive 417 question what do we enter as th sender id in the paxlst unb and ung segments answer unb element 0004 should be populated with the id

have the same travel document number tdn are we still allowed to just submit the tdn and issuing state in departure message even if all tho originally checkedin did not depart answer yes the possibility of discrepancy bet ween the number who were checkedin and those who departed is recognised and ac cepted in such circumstances if the carrier wishes to avoid ambiguity then full tdi should be sub mitted for individuals travelling on the same travel document in the postdeparture message 423 question we provide unique identifi ers for all passengers when we submit us cbp paxlst message using multiple rff segments can we use these in eborders checkin messages to provide updates to passenger details when th ey arrive at the airport and in the postdeparture message answer the eborders system is designed to support data submittals across range of industries air maritime and rail using message formats where unique identifiers are not universally supported therefore the eborders system does not follow the us cbp practice of using multiple rff segments to assign unique p assenger identifiers while multiple rff segments may be included in the message they will not be used by eborders eborders only ut ilises an rffavf segment to s ubmit an opi locator code tdi must be provided in subsequent messages as detailed in the eborders documentation carriers may submit unique i
