2008 pl 110 289 which was signed into law on july 30 2008 is the requirement that two governmentsponsored enterprises gses fannie mae and freddi mac contribute percentage of the value of their total new business purchases to two new affordable housing funds the congressional budget ffice estimates that these two funds the housing trust fund and the capital magnet fund could together receive approximately 624 million in fy 2012 the first year in which they will be fully funded the director of the federal hous ing finance agency fhfa new agency created by pl 110289 to be unified regu lator for the gses is required to suspend contributions to the affordable housing f unds in the case of gse financial trouble in fy2009 the gse contributions are to be used to support the hope for homeowners program also created by p l 110289 this support is to be reduced and support for the housing trust fund and the capital magnet fund increased until in fy2012 the hope program gets 25 nd the affordable housing funds get 75 of the total contributions of the share llocated to the affordable housing funds the housing trust fund is to receive 65 nd the capital magnet fund is to receive 35 the secretary of the department of housing and urba n development is to develop formula to allocate the housing trust fund money to the states the us treasury is to develop competitive grant process to distribute the capital magnet funds to community development fina ncial institutions and nonprofit housing corporations critical issue behind the gse contribu tions to the affordable housing funds is the rationale for using the gses as the f unding source the justification is that the gses have special charters from congress that give them special treatment such as exemption from state and local income taxes and the ability to borrow up to 225 billion from the us treasury in return for these privileges the gses charters limit their business activities to purchasing home mortgages and supporting affordable housing opponents of gse contributions to affordable housing funds are concerned that the cost of the contributions would be passed on to mortgage borrowers and that the contributions could creat an incentive for advocates of the funds to encourage the gses to grow beyond what is financially sound on september 7 2008 the federal housing finance agency put fannie mae and freddie mac under its conservatorship and the treasury agreed to provide up to 100 billion in emergency funding to each on november 13 2008 fhfa informed fannie mae that it should suspend its

advocated for the establishment of national affordable housing trust fund proponents of trust fund wanted permanent funding stream that would not be subject to the annual appropr iations process would not come out of other housing programs and would be dedicated to ffordable housing activities for lowincome households the idea of an affordable hous ing trust fund was not new several states and localities have already dopted their own state and cal trust funds however organizations such as the national low in come housing coalition one of the leading proponents of national affo rdable housing trust fund ar gued that federal fund should be established to compleme nt these state and local efforts1 opponents of national housing trust f und argue that the federal government already provides funding for affordable hous ing through other programs and that national housing trust fund coul d be duplicative of these programs in recent yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34158crs2 2 for

concerns bout growing federal budget deficits as an argument against establishing nati onal affordable housing trust fund legislation to establish national affordable housing trust fund has been introduced in every congress since the 106th2 one major question surrounding the creation of an affordable housing trust fund has been how the program would be funded early legislation proposed usin g

the payasyou go rule paygo3 later legislation proposed using cont ributions from fannie mae and freddie mac two governmentsponsored enterprise s gses as potential funding source since the gses are private entities using contributions from fannie mae and freddie mac would not count as new government spending there is some disagreement over whether it is appropriate for the govern ment to require the gses to contribute to affordable housing funds opponents of gse contributions argue that the gses should not be asked to balan ce public policy objectives against the interests of their shareholders proponents point to the speci privileges that gses receive and the housing goals that they already have to justify their contributions to affordable housing funds governmentsponsored enterprises the governmentsponsored enterprise s are the federal national mortgage association fannie mae the federal ho loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and the federal home loan banks fhlbanks

trust fund which is to provide formulabased grants for states to increase housing opportunities for extremely w and very lowincome renters and home owners the secretary of hud is requi red to develop formula for allocating the monies in the housing trust fund among the states10 within 12 months of the laws enactment the allocation formula is to be based in part on the following factors the relative number of affordable standard rental units available to extremely lowincome renter househol ds in the state this factor is given priority emphasis the relative number of affordable standard rental units available tovery lowincome renter households in the state the relative number of extremel lowincome renter households living with incomplete kitchen or plumbing facilities more than one

very lowincome families who will use the home as principal residence and are firsttime home buyers meaning that they have not owned home in the prior three years home buyers must also complete prepurchase financial counseling requirement the home is subject to initial purchase price and resale restrictions the sum of these factors will then be multip lied by the relative cost of

activities some of those opposed to the creation of gse affordable housing funds argue that it is unfair to require privately owned company to balance the interests of stockholders against public policy othe rs opposed to the gse affordable housing funds are concerned that the funds would be another cost of doing business and that like other costs in any competitive market they would be passed onto consumers mortgage borrowers in this case or re duce dividends to stockholders pl 110289 includes language prohibiting the gses from passing on the cost of the housing funds to others however in market where mortgage interest rates mortgage terms and home prices change as frequently as the mortgage market it might be difficult to identify the reason for specific interest rate or price change finally concern over gse portfolio risk taking has led some regula tors and others to call for limits on the size of the gses portfolio s some gse affordable housing fund opponents have argued that using gse cont ributions to support affordable housing funds could give proponents of the funds an incentive to encourage gse growth beyond what is financially sound current issues financial uncertainty with increases in mortgage delinquencies since the middle of 2007 the gses capital positions have deteriorated the gses regulator found both gses adequately capitalized during each quarter of 2007 but noted significant declines in the amount of capital held as percentage of that required by their regulator in november and d ecember 2007 fannie mae increased its capital by selling 79 billion in prefe rred stock and freddie mac so ld 6 billion in preferred stock fannie mae raised an additi onal 74 billion in new capital in may 200817 these actions were widely viewed as motivated by losses on mortgages that the gses had guaranteed this raises the issue of under what circ umstances the gses c ontributions to the affordable housing funds could be suspe nded pl 110289 requires the director of fhfa the gses new unified regulator to temporarily suspend contributions by either gse if he finds that the contributi ons 1 are contributing or would contribute to financial instability 2 are causing or would cause gse to be classified as undercapitalized or 3 are preventing or would prevent gse from successfully completing capital restoration project however the legislation does not define how long temporary suspension could last nor does it specify criteria for the director to rely on in making such finding httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34158crs12 18 see crs report rs22950 fannie mae

authority to take over the gses if he determined that such an action was necessary to protect taxpayers stabilize financial markets and prevent disruptions in mortgage availability on septembe r 7 2008 fhfa decided to exercise that authority and placed both fannie mae nd freddie mac under its conservatorship18 this move could affect the afford able housing funds in two ways first as discussed above the legisla tion requires the director of fhfa to suspend contributions to the affordable housing funds in the case of gse financial trouble at the time the gses were placed under conservatorship they were generally believed to face certain financial futures on november 13 2008 fhfa informed fannie mae that it should suspe nd its contributions until further notice19 this suspension of contributions will not di rectly affect the affordable housing funds until they are set to begin receiving allo cations in fy2010 because all of the gse contributions in fy2009 were slated to go to the hope for homeowners program discussed earlier second the longterm plan for th gses remains unclear but some policymakers have stated that the gses portfolios should be forced to shrink beginning in 2010 the amount of the gses contributions to the affordable housing funds is based on the volume of their new bus iness purchases not on the size of their portfolios however if shrinking the si ze of gses portfolios leads the gses to purchase smaller volume of mortgages then the affordable housing funds could receive less funding than orig inally believed lternatively the gses could continue to maintain or increase their volume of new business purchases but still shrink their portfolios by packaging the mortgages they buy and selling them as mortgagebacked securities to other investors this scenario would not reduce contributions to the affordable housing funds the legislation allows the housing trust fund and the capital magnet fund to receive funding from sources other than the gse contributions but as of the time when fannie and freddie were placed under conservatorship the gse cont ributions were the only identified funding source for either the housing trust fund or the capital magnet fund as noted above the affordable housing funds are not due to begin receiving contributions until fy2010 in fy2010 and fy2011 decreasing percentage of the gse contributions is to continue to fund hope for homeowners because the affordable housing funds share the contribu tions with hope for homeowners in the first three years any decrease in gse contributions would lead to even less money for the affordable housing funds however because the affordable housing funds do not receive funding in the first year it is possible that the gses financial outlook would have improved by the time the affo rdable housings funds are due to begin receiving allocations in fy2010 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34158crs13 appendix 1 legislative history of
