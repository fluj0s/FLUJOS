employers face number of disadvantages relative to larger employers when seeking to provide health insurance as benefit to their employees while most surveys suggest that the high cost of health insurance is the primary reason1 that more than 40 of small firms2 do not offer health benefits there are other barriers as well small employers cannot leverage their size in negotiations with insurance carriers over benefits and prices like larger groups can do not benefit from administrative economies of scale for example it is less costly for an insurer to market to and enroll one large employer with 500 workers than to market to and enroll 150 smaller employers with total of 500 workers and employ lowerwage workers and workers who move among firms more often than employees of large firms factors that also affect coverage rates in the small group markets for insurance significant contributor to the relatively higher cost of coverage for small employers is their size smaller employers often face higher premiums than larger employers for similar coverage3 because the size of the group does not allow for broad spreading of risk for example an employer with 500 employees is able to balance the risk that few employees will have very expensive medical claims during the year with the certainty that the remaining employees will have closer to average or lower cost claims small employer however doesnt have the large number of average or lowcost enrollees to balance the risk that one or more of its workers will have expensive medical needs consequently insurers charge higher premiums to smaller employers to account for this phenomenon4 1 p fronstin and r helman small employers and health benefits findings from the 2003 small employer health benefits survey ebri issue brief 253 employee benefit research institute january 2003 at httpwwwebriorgpdfbriefspdf0103ibpdf 2 employer health benefits 2005 annual survey the kaiser family foundation and health research and educational trust at httpwwwkfforginsurance7315indexcfm 3 us general accounting office private health insurance small employers continue to face challenges in providing coverage gao028 oct 2001 4 for more information on the basic principles of health insurance see crs report rl32237 health insurance primer by bernadette fernandez crs2 finally large employers are often able to selfinsure their own health coverage rather than purchase insurance from traditional insurance carriers or health maintenance organizations when large employers do so their health coverage plans are not subject to states laws regulating the business of health insurance as result the plans are not subject to myriad of state laws regulating the prices of the plans for participating employees the benefits covered by those plans or the financial solvency to name few areas of state insurance law the relative regulatory burden for small employers is seen by some as an additional disadvantage for smaller employers seeking lowcost plans because it adds to the cost and complexity of products in the small group market for insurance small business health insurance proposals the 109th congress is considering number
