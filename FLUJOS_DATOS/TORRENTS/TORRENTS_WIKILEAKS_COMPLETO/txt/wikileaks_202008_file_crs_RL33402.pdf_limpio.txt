small business health insurance proposals background small employers face number of disadvantages relative to larger employers when seeking to provide health insuran ce as benefit to their employees while most surveys suggest that the high cost of health insurance is the primary reason1 that more than 40 of small firms2 do not offer health benef its there are other barriers as well small employers cannot leverage their size in ne gotiations with insurance carriers over benefits and prices like larger groups can do not benefit from administra tive economies of scale for example it is less costly for an insurer to market to and enroll one large employer with 500 workers than to market to and enroll 150 smaller employers with total of 500 workers and employ lowerwage workers and workers who move among firmsmore often than employees of large firms factors that also affect coverage rates in the small group markets for insurance significant contributor to the relativel higher cost of coverage for small employers is their size smaller employers often face higher premiums than larger employers for similar coverage 3 because the size of the group does not allow for broad spreading of risk for example an employer with 500 employees is able to balance the risk that few employees will have very expensive medical claims during the year with the certainty that the remaining employees will have closer to average or lower cost claims small employer however doesnt have the large number of average or lowcost enrollees to balance the risk that one or more of its workers will have expensive medical needs conseque ntly insurers charge higher premiums to smaller employers to account for this phenomenon4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33402crs2 5 for discussion of small group health insurance and current legislative proposals see crs report rl31963 association sponsored health plans legislation in the 109th congress by jean hearnefinally large employers are often able to selfinsure their own health coverage rather than purchase insurance from traditional insurance carriers or health maintenance organizations when large empl oyers do so their health coverage plans are not subject to states laws regulating the business of health insurance as result the plans are not subject to myriad of state laws regulating the prices of the plans for participating employees the benefits c overed by those plans or the financial solvency to name few areas of state insurance law the relative regulatory burden for small employers is seen by some as an additional disadvantage for smaller employers seeking lowcost plans because it adds to the cost and complexity of products in the small group market for insurance small business health insurance proposals the
