election raised questions about whether changes are needed in the voting technologies used in the united states and what should be the federal role elections are administered by states and localities through approximately 10000 jurisdictions at the county level or below the main federal agency involved is the office of election administration which is part of the federal election commission and assists state and local election officials in 1990 the fec released voluntary standards for computerbased voting systems the standards were developed in response to congressional direction and have been adopted in whole or in part by thirtytwo states updated standards are in development currently five different kinds of voting technologies are used handcounted paper ballots mechanical lever machines computer punchcards votomatic and datavote marksense forms also called optical scan and direct recording electronic systems dre the last three systems are computerbased all systems except lever machines and dre use document ballots on which the voter records choices punchcard systems are the most common used by about onethird of registered voters with marksense systems used by about onequarter in all but few states more than one kind of technology is currently in use for some of the technologies concerns have been raised about ballot design voter errors and counting accuracy effective ballot design involves balancing the fairness and clarity of presentation as well as goals such as promoting completion of the entire ballot by voters different technologies place different constraints on ballot design the three basic kinds of error are overvote undervote not necessarily an error and unintended choice technologies differ in how they help voters prevent or correct such errors and consequently the incidence varies with the technology employed it may also depend on the condition of equipment and the demographics of the population vote counting involves issues such as the accuracy of the counting methodology its speed its integrity and security and recounting where necessary those depend on many factors including the characteristics of the technology used the design and condition of the equipment and software and human behavior reports on the accuracy of different systems vary questions have also been raised about the impacts of remote voting including absentee and mailin balloting another form of remote voting currently in development is internet voting which so far has been used only on very limited basis the overall prevalence of remote voting is increasing raising concerns in particular about potential compromises to ballot secrecy central issue is what role the federal government should play in addressing the concerns that have been raised about voting systems current debate centers on several questions what is the extent of congressional authority to regulate voting technology and procedures should national standards be voluntary or mandatory should the scope of the standards be broadened to include ballot design counting procedures and other aspects of election management should uniform technology be adopted nationally or on statebystate basis should federal funding be made available to states or local election jurisdictions for upgrading voting systems significant legislative activity is expected in the 107th congress

change to those ballots came with the invention of the australian secret ballot in 1856 prior to its adoption us voters obtained printed ballots containing the names of the candidates for whom they wished to vote and placed those ballots in the ballot box such ballot called prox or ticket was printed by each political party or otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30773crs3 4 sj ackerman the vote that

of the ticket ballot is still used in few countries the basic ballot used in the united states is the australian or mark choice ballot which lists the names of all candidates voters mark their choices on the ballot the most common form of this ballot type lists candidates by office the office group or massachusetts ballot one variant gives voters the option of choosing an entire slate with single mark the party column or indiana ballot or choosing slate with exceptions the australian ballot was adopted in the united states beginning in the 1880s after series of scandals involving votebuying and other problems paper ballots are still used in about 3 of precincts mostly in less populous areas the percentage of voters using paper ballots has declined by half since 19925 all voting technologies used in federal elections employ ballots with the basic characteristics of the australian ballot all possible choices are displayed for all offices the voter marks choices through some mechanism and those choices are secret also only ballots provided by the relevant election office can be used and controls ensure that voter submits only the ballot that he or she was issued lever machines the next technological advance in voting came with the introduction of the lever voting machine in 1892 in this technology there is document ballot voter enters the voting booth and chooses candidates listed on posted ballot by pulling lever for each candidate choice the votes are recorded by advances in counting mechanism that are made when the voter leaves the booth the lever machine therefore eliminates the need to count ballots manually instead poll workers read the numbers recorded by the counters because there is document ballot recounts and audits are limited to review of totals recorded by each machine writein votes however must be recorded on separate document ballots about 22 of precincts currently use lever machines that percentage has declined substantially since 1992 and is expected to continue to decrease because the machines are longer manufactured although parts are still available punchcards the first technological approach utilizing computers to count votes was the punchcard system first used in 1964 in this system the voter records choices by punching holes in appropriate locations on paper computer card that is later fed into computer reader to record the vote the piece of card that is punched out is called chad the computer card serves as the document ballot on which the votes are recorded as with other document ballots punchcards can be manually recounted and audited there are two basic types of punchcard system in one numbered boxes are printed on the card with each box corresponding to particular ballot choice the choices corresponding to those numbered boxes are indicated to the voter in postedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30773crs4 6 originally brand name the term votomatic has passed into general usage to refer to this

race or other item on the ballot turning page in the booklet exposes another set of boxes on the card corresponding to another set of ballot choices the card may be prescored partially cut through at the locations within each box where hole can be punched the votomatic6 system used in palm beach county florida and elsewhere is an example of this system writein choices are not placed on the card itself but are written elsewhere such as on the envelope in which the card is placed if the card used is not prescored special springloaded stylus is used to punch the holes about 33 of precincts use this type of system it is therefore the most widely used voting technology at present the number of voters using the system has declined since 1992 and that decline is expected to continue in the other kind of punchcard system called datavote voters punch holes next to the names of candidates or other ballot choices that are printed on the cards themselves there is ballot book the voter places the ballot card in voting apparatus that has staplerlike punching mechanism on slide the cards are not prescored writein votes can be placed directly on the card about 4 of precincts use the datavote system and usage of this system has also declined marksense forms this technology also called optical scan has been used for decades in scoring standardized tests it first became available for use in voting in the 1980s in this system voter using paper form and an appropriate writing instrument7 fills in box or oval or completes an arrow corresponding to each candidate choice the completed ballot is then read by computerized device that senses and records the marks writein votes can be placed directly on the ballot about 25 of precincts use marksense voting systems the percentage of voters using this technology has almost doubled since 1992 and that increase is likely to continue electronic voting this technology was first introduced in the 1970s8 called direct recording electronic dre technology this system is somewhat analogous to although more sophisticated than the lever voting machine rather than marking paper ballot the voter chooses candidates from posted ballot depending on the equipment used the ballot may be printed and posted on the voting machine or it may be displayed on computer screen voters make their choices by pushing button touching the screen or using similar device the voter submits those choices beforehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30773crs5 9see kevin coleman and richard m nunno internet voting issues and legislation crs report rs20639 16 january 2000 recent

percentage of voters using dre has almost doubled since 1992 and is expected to continue to increase one form of electronic voting currently in developm ent is internet voting in which voters make their choices online internet voting differs from dre systems in several ways first it is often done using general purpose personal computer rather than customdesigned voting machine although such machines can also be used second results are not accumulated at the polling place but are sent to the tabulating computer when cast third results ballots or counts are not sent over direct modem connection or physically transported to the central tabulator but are sent over the internet those features make internet voting promising technology in some ways but pose special challenges for ensuring authentication secrecy and security in the voting process9 the use of internet voting is currently limited to demonstration projects for example for the november 2000 election voters in several counties in california cast nonbinding votes online from online voting machines placed in central locations10 in the same election 84 overseas military personnel cast their actual votes via the internet through small pilot project run by the federal voter assistance program fvap11 remote voting the voting technologies described above were designed primarily for use at designated polling places the systems using document ballots those that are paper or cardbased permit remote voting via absentee or other mailin balloting levermachine and dre systems cannot accommodate remote balloting so in those cases documentbased alternative must be used however internet voting could change that if used in the polling place it would be analogous to dre however it could also provide the possibility of voting from home or another location if used in that way it would be analogous to mailin balloting httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30773crs6 12data are from table listing historical absentee

local election officials on matters related to election administration activities of other agencies are limited the national science foundation has undertaken study of internet voting the department of defense through its federal voting assistance program office and in cooperat ion with several states undertook test mentioned above of internet voting during the november 2000 federal election14 the national institute of standards and technology does not have any current activities in voting technologies although its predecessor the national bureau of standards had undertaken studies of this matter15 issues the presidential election of the year 2000 has drawn attention to several issues relating to the voting technologies currently in use issues discussed below include the following ballot design prevention and correction of voter errors vote counting standardization and upgrading voting systems httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30773crs7 16as used here the term ballot design refers to both document and posted ballots that is it refers not only to the ballots themselves but also to the presentation of candidate choices that includes the voting booklets used in votomatic and similar punchcard systems and the identifying information placed next to levers or other choosing devices in lever and electronic voting machines 17r darcy and anne schneider confusing ballots rolloff and the black vote western political quarterly 42 3 1989 347364 stephen m nichols and gregory strizek electronic voting machines and ballot rolloff american politics quarterly 23 3 1995 300318 ballot design ballot design16 is not simple art and standards vary from state to state concerns raised in the presidential election about the design of ballots in particular those used in the florida counties of palm beach and duval have led some observers to call for improvements in ballot design central question is how can ballot best be designed to ensure both fair and clear presentation of choices issues of fairness include factors such as the order of presentation of candidates and the use of uniform typefaces those are often addressed by state law or regulation for example some states require alphabetical presentation of candidates and some require that the order of presentation be rotated for different parties from one election to another or even among precincts during the same election another question is how to minimize ballot fatigue also called voter falloff or rolloff which refers to voter completing only the first part of ballot the length complexity and manner of presentation of the ballot which depends in part on the voting technology used may all have some effect on the prevalence of this welldocumented phenomenon and even on the percentage of voters who complete the first ballot item rolloff may even vary depending on whether the ballot items are all placed on one page or several pages and the position of an item on the page17 the issue of clarity is perhaps more difficult as it requires the ballot designer to weigh potentially conflicting design goals for example election officials may wish to enhance the readabilit of ballot by using fairly large typeface if however there is long list of candidates for an office that may require splitting the list between two separate pages of ballot book as was done in duval county or placing them on facing pages the socalled butterfly ballot used in palm beach county both approaches could however contribute to errors by voters with the former approach some voters may inadvertently vote for candidates on both pages thereby invalidating their vote for that office and with the latter some may inadvertently vote for different candidate than the one intended or punch two adjacent holes the kinds of errors cited for the butterfly ballot particularly can be problem if the ballot is not designed to unambiguously guide the voter to the appropriate hole to punch or if there is any misalignment of the ballot in the voting machine that makes it difficult to discern the appropriate hole the feature of some marksense ballots that requires voters to complete an arrow pointing to the candidate of choice is an example of design that might serve to substantially reduce the risk of such ambiguity similarly lever machine may be designed so that pulling lever points it at the name of the candidate such feature is not possible with punchcard systems the example therefore illustrates that different voting technologies placehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30773crs8 18there appears to have been little research to date on ballot design with respect to usability see however susan king roth the unconsidered ballot visible lang uage 28 4 1994 4867 and susan king roth disenfranchised by design voting systems and the election process information design journal 9 1998 18 available at httpwwwinformationdesignorgpubsroth1998html 19undervotes associated with ballot fatigue are an example of the latter 20other terms used for this include falloff novote uncounted vote residual vote and even undervote undervotes are also sometimes called blank ballots and overvotes spoiled ballots although ballots can be spoiled in other ways such as by having marks that could potentially be identifying this proliferation of terms can be potentially confusing 21see for example george b mather lost votes effects of methods of voting on voter participation iowa city university of iowa 1986different constraints on the way ballot can be designed to improve its clarity and ease of use there are number of views on ballot design one is that broad improvements are necessary because it is the responsibility of the voter to mark the ballot properly and to get help if there is problem another approach would be the development of standard national ballot for federal elections such common ballot would eliminate the risk of problems that might arise from local differences in designs and is discussed further below in the section on standardization third alternative would be the development of uniform voluntary standards for ballot design that are based on wellestablished design principles widely used in other interactive applications such as internet web sites such standards might also include guidelines for using established procedures to test ballots for usability18 voting errors there are three basic kinds of error that voter might make overvote undervote and unintended choice an overvote is vote for more candidates for particular office than is permitted such as voting for two candidates for president and is usually considered an error an overvote on ballot item invalidates the vote for that item an undervote is vote for fewer than permitted such as voting for candidate for president an undervote may or may not be an error voter might on the one hand have tried to vote for candidate but was unsuccessful in marking the ballot unambiguously or might on the other hand have chosen not to vote for any candidate19 an unintended choice is inadvertently voting for candidate other than the one intended the use of secret balloting precludes determining whether an observed overvote undervote or counted vote is an error or intentional in this report the combination of overvotes plus undervotes will be referred to as rolloff20 voting technologies differ in how they help voter prevent or correct errors and consequently the incidence varies to some extent with the technology employed21 lever machines can prevent overvoting through the use of interlocking mechanisms that prevent voter from pulling lever for more than one candidate for given office electronic systems can prevent overvoting through an electronic equivalent of such mechanism some marksense systems can reduce overvoting by permittinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30773crs9 22stephen m nichols and gregory strizek electronic voting machines and ballot roll off american politics quarterly 23 3 1995 300318 23schocket effect of voting technology 24 susan king roth the unconsidered ballot visible language 28 4 1994 4867a ballot to be checked by the tabulator sometimes called smart ballot box before submission and indicating if there is an overvote the voter can then be given new ballot system can prevent undervotin g but electronic systems can potentially reduce them by indicating via light or other mechanism the offices for which voter has not yet cast vote22 or by guiding the voter through multipage ballot electronically thereby reducing the risk of inadvertent pageskipping paper or marksense ballots can easily be mismarked for example by voter circling the name of candidate rather than marking the appropriate box such mismark would likely be read by machine as an undervote that kind of mismark is probably less likely with punchcard ballot since it is marked with stylus not pen or pencil marksense systems that use smart ballot boxes can potentially reduce undervotes if the tabulator is set to check for them but that may be impractical if the incidence of ballot rolloff is high unintended choices also cannot be prevented however how often they occur depends in part on the clarity of the ballot design and functioning of the voting equipment for example concerns have been expressed that misalignment of punchcard ballots in voting machines may lead to mistaken choices some touchscreen electronic systems can potentially reduce the risk of unintended choice by allowing the voter to review summary of the choices made before submitting the ballot the incidence of errors may also depend on the condition of voting equipment and the demographics of the voting population for example faulty lever or mechanical counter on lever machine or problem with circuit on an electronic system may cause failure to record vote malfunctioning stylus or deteriorated equipment in punchcard voting machine might increase the risk that punch would be incomplete also some studies have found that inexperienced and elderly voters tend to make more errors with punchcard than with other systems23 there is even some evidence that the height of voter can affect the frequency of ballot rolloff with lever machines24 voting technologies also vary with respect to how voters can review their choices and correct any errors they might have made with both lever and electronic systems voters can review their choices and make changes before they leave the voting booth although they have way of checking to ensure that their choices were accurately recorded by the voting machine with other systems voters who wish to make change must leave the booth and obtain new ballot with marksense systems where tabulation is done at the precinct ballots may be checked by the tabulator for some kinds of error before being submitted however marksense systems where tabulation is done at central location do not permit such machinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30773crs10 assisted error correction with paper ballots and punchcards voters must check the ballots for errors although some precinctbased card readers can also be programmed to check for errors some observers contend that such errorchecking does in fact reduce the incidence of overvotes and spoiled ballots differences between the votomatic and datavote systems illustrate some of the errorhandling tradeoffs involved in ballot design votomatic ballot usually requires only single card if voter wants to check the ballot to make sure that vote was not miscast he or she has to find the hole that was punched out find the corresponding number and check that against the number in the ballot book that must be done for each ballot item complex process datavote ballot may require several cards and may need to be marked on both sides that raises the possibility that voter might miss card or fail to vote on both sides however because the names of candidates are printed on the cards voter can more easily check datavote ballot for errors counting the counting of votes after they are cast involves several issues including the accuracy of the counting methodology its speed and its integrity and security counting may be done either in individual precincts or at central location within the election jurisdiction or both it may be performed by machine or by human inspection or both paper ballots are counted manually usually at the precinct with lever machines and electronic systems there are document ballots counts are taken at the precinct from lever machines with marksense or electronic systems counts can be performed electronically at the precinct and sent electronically via modem or by other means to central location with punchcard systems ballots are usually taken to central location for machine counting and are tabulated by precinct however they may also be counted at the precinct in some cases the accuracy of vote count depends on many factors including the characteristics of the technology used the design and condition of the equipment and software and human behavior for example since paper ballots are counted manually the accuracy of the count depends on the performance of the people doing the counts lever machines reduce some kinds of human error but problems with counts may occur as result of malfunctioning machines or from errors made by the poll workers who read them punchcards and marksense forms are read by machine reducing some kinds of human error other problems may arise from software or hardware errors or from the ballots themselves for example with prescored cards voters may not completely remove chad when punching the cards such incompletely removed hanging or swinging chad or even detached chad that is loose in the counting device may block punched holes and be read by the counting machine as undervotes with marksense systems voters might make ambiguous marks that tabulating machine may read differently depending on factors such as the alignment of the ballot sheet when it is fed into the machine since dre systems record each vote electronically as it is cast there is risk of human error in counting and voters cannot make ambiguous or unreadable choices problems might still arise from other sources such as software or hardware failure however httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30773crs11 25saltman accuracy integrity and security in computerized votetallying 5 recommended maximum error rate of 1 in 100000 26ford fessenden and christopher drew alas votecount machines are only human the new york times friday 17 november 2000 sec 1 25 the error rate of particular technology can be of concern especially in very close election where the margin of victory is very small for example the final margin of 537 votes out of almost 6 million cast in the 2000 presidential election in florida was equivalent to about 1 out of every 11000 votes cast which suggests that an ideal error rate might best be considerably smaller than 1 in 10000 27 for example about 180000 ballots or 3 of all those

the secretary of states web site ftpwwwsosstategauselections2000_electio n_reportpdf in addition recent preliminary analysis of voting systems used across the united states found that dre systems had higher rolloff than marksense systems lever machines or even paper ballots however the study did not analyze precinct versus centraltabulated systems and did not attempt to continuedreports on the accuracy of different systems vary for example some have claimed that punchcard readers can have an error rate as low as 1 vote out of each 10000 counted under ideal test conditions25 error rates as high as 1 in 100 have been reported from prior elections and some experts believe that votomatic punchcard systems using prescored cards may be the least accurate of the available technologies26 however estimates from actual elections are based on rolloff ballots for which votes were not counted and cannot distinguish errors that occur because of inherent limitations of the technology from rolloff resulting from mistakes voter error or intentional actions by voters27 assessment of the accuracy of particular voting technology should also take into account other factors that might affect the observed rolloff such as population size or other demographic variables voting systems that reduce or eliminate overvoting lever machines dres and precinct tabulated marksense or punchcard systems

punchholes when fed through the reader however marksense readers may also produce some variability for example if some ballots are marked in way that is close to the readability limits of the tabulator 31fessenden and drew votecounting machines 25system in given election may depend as well on the particular design and condition of the voting and counting equipment and the degree to which technical procedures and specifications are followed by the election administrators pre and postelection tests are widely performed on votingmachine systems to check for accuracy and also to guard against tampering in addition manual recounts may be routinely performed on small percentage of ballots as check on the validity of the machine count accurate operational tests are most difficult with electronic and levermachine systems where there is ballot document and the count is recorded at the voting booth thorough test would require hundreds of simulated votes to be placed on each machine voting technologies may also affect recounts with lever machines and in many cases dre systems recounts are limited to checking the vote totals recorded by each machine some observers consider that an advantage because it limits the potential for human or machine error to affect the recount others consider it disadvantage because it does not allow for ballotby ballot paper audit trail29 with punchcard and marksense systems machine recounts may not produce fully repeatable results tallies may vary slightly if recounts are repeated30 whether hand recounts are more accurate than machine counts has been the subject of considerable debate some observers claim that machine tabulators may miss valid votes misidentifying them as undervotes or overvotes and that manual counting can detect more accurately the voters intent others assert that manual counting is less objective and that voters should be required to follow instructions for properly marking ballots state laws vary with respect to when manual recounts are appropriate and what standards are to be used all current technologies except paper ballots can produce large counts rapidly once polls are closed systems in which ballots are counted electronically as they are submitted in the precinct can probably produce the most rapid results with votomatic systems accuracy may be increased if the cards are manually inspected to remove loose chad before counting but that will sacrifice some speed31 security requirements and measures also vary among the technologies used document ballots require security measures and controls from the initial printing ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30773crs13 32at least one system also provides the capability of electronically checking the printed ballot against the electronically recorded one however dre system that also provides printed ballot is likely to be expensive as each voting booth must include printer as well as the voting machine 33ballot configurations may also vary within jurisdictions for example hillsborough county florida had 82 different versions of the ballot in the november 2000 election to accommodate different intracounty races iorio election reform 34ackerman the vote that failed 35for example in casting absentee ballots it is common practice that the ballot is placed in an unsigned envelope that is then placed inside the mailing envelope which is signed election continuedthe ballots through counting and storing them however the ballots can serve as basis for an audit trail which is not available for lever machines dre systems can produce electronic audit trails by storing anonymized electronic ballots for each voter or by printing document with ballot choices that the voter deposits in ballot box but which is retained solely for audit or recount purpose s32 experts differ on the importance of such paper audit trail for ensuring the security and integrity of the voting process special measures and controls have also been developed for both hardware and software used in computerbased systems some observers believe that the very diversity and decentralization of the voting systems used in the united states enhance the integrity of the voting process by making widespread tampering more difficult not only are there five different basic kinds of voting technology in use but dozens of different models are used that makes tampering much less feasible than if single system were used furthermore election jurisdictions differ in how they configure their voting equipment to meet the requirements of the particular election being administered that includes how ballots are arranged and therefore how votes are recorded33 that variability makes widespread tampering with software or computerized counting machines much more difficult one important aspect of security is maintaining ballot secrecy this is concern particularly for remote voting and has increased as that form of voting has become more common ballot secrecy is widely considered crucial mechanism for preventing vote tamperin g and fraud the rapid widespread adoption of the australian ballot in the united states at the end of the 19th century came about because of scandals resulting in part from the fact that the ticket ballot was not secret34 modern pollingplace voting ensures that voters cast secret ballots in two ways first voter identification and ballot casting are performed in two separate steps second ballots are cast in private remote voting such as by mail or the internet can increase voter participation but can potentially create problems for ballot secrecy two basic aspects of ballot secrecy are first that once ballot is cast it cannot be traced by second party to an individual voter and second that voter cannot demonstrate to others how he or she voted failure to maintain those aspects of ballot secrecy is of concern because it can facilitate corruption while controls can be put in place that can greatly reduce the risk of traceability it is not clear how to prevent remote voters from proving how they voted35 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30773crs14 35continued officials can then check to ensure the identity and eligibility of the voter without seeing how the person voted however voter could still photocopy the ballot or show it to another person before mailing it thereby proving how he or she voted also the ballot may not be filled out in private 36for discussion of the voting rights act see garrine p laney the voting rights act of 1965 as amended its history and current issues crs report 95896 14

httpwwwfecgovpagesfaqsvsshtm 10 july 1988 39specifically those states have adopted either the standards or the testing of systems against the standards by independent testing authorities itas designated by the national association of state election directors fec faqs about standards standards testing has not been continuedaccessibility federal law sets some requirements for elections with respect to accessibility the voting rights act of 1965 as amended requires that ballots other relevant materials and assistance be provided in the language of citizens from nonenglish speaking minorities who constitute sufficiently large population in state or political subdivision 42 usc 1973aa1a36 in some jurisdictions materials and assistance will need to be provided in several languages assistance must also be allowed for voters who are blind disabled or unable to read or write 42 usc 1973aa6 the voting accessibility for the elderly and handicapped act of 1984 42 usc 1973ee requires that election jurisdictions make available accessible polling places and aid to elderly and disabled voters some states may also have additional requirements for accessibility and assistance voting technologies differ in how easily they can accommodate those requirements dre systems provide the greatest flexibility for example with touch screen systems each machine can be programmed to display ballots in any required language electronic systems can also be designed to accommodate wheelchair bound voters and to provide auditory assistance via headphones for blind voters with other technologies special ballots may need to be printed and individual assistance provided standardization states not the federal government regulate the voting technologies they use however in response to concerns raised in the 1970s and 1980s about the then largely unregulated votingtechnology industry37 congress directed the federal election commission to develop voluntary standards for computerbased voting systems38 the standards developed in collaboration with the national association of state election directors and approved in 1990 had been adopted in whole or in part by 32 states as of november 200039 they were developed for both hardwarehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30773crs15 39continued applied to all such systems however for example some older systems already in use when the standards were adopted and were grandfathered in 40for example florida is one of the 31 states listed by the fec as adopting the standards or tests using them yet the use of those standards did not prevent the kinds of problems widely cited in florida with respect to the november 2000 election among those problems some were arguably caused by differences in the voting technologies used and others occurred with respect to aspects of election administration such as ballot design not covered by the current standards 41 while many other countries use standard national system in many of those cases paper ballots and manual counting are used see note 32 42 article i gives congress authority to regulate congressional elections but it is less clear that continuedand software and include functional and documentation requirements performance characteristics and testing procedures for punchcard marksense and dre systems updated standards are expected next year one focus of current debate is whether need exists for more standardization some have suggested that mandatory rather than voluntary standards be adopted nationwide for existing voting technologies others have proposed adoption of single voting technology nationwide and still others creation of standard national ballot for presidential elections the adoption of mandatory national standards might provide more uniformity in the performance of different kinds of voting technology such standards might also be expanded in scope from the current set which is limited to computerbased systems and does not address issues such as to what extent system reduces voter error new standards might cover all technologies and other aspects of election administration such as election management and ballot design however such standards are unlikely to anticipate all circumstances under which technology is actually used and their adoption by states may not resolve problems caused by such circumstances or by other differences that the standards do not address40 adoption of standard national ballot would likely require adoption of single technology as well since different types of voting systems require different ballot designs either of those two approaches would make the development of standards easier and would eliminate the risk of problems arising from local differences in voting technology for example in close statewide election in which different election jurisdictions use different technologies some observers have expressed concern that the outcome of the election could be affected by differences in the accuracy of the systems used the economies of scale associated with national adoption of single technology could reduce perunit cost and improve efficiencies in other ways41 concerns have been raised about adopting uniform national technology or standard national ballot the extent of congressional authority to impose such system on local election jurisdictions as well as its desirability is subject of some debate while the us constitution gives congress authority to regulate congressional elections42 election jurisdictions must hold state and local elections ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30773crs16 42continued article ii provides such authority for selection of the presidential electors for discussion of this issue see kenneth r thomas congressional

13 march 2001 43the canadian system provides an interesting example the canada elections act httpcanadajusticegccaenlawse2texthtml provides for uniform voting system for national elections that system has codified the use of single technology paper ballots therefore there is significant incentive to develop or adopt new technologies for use in national elections nevertheless some jurisdictions may use other technologies for local elections for example in recent election for mayor and certain other offices residents of toronto voted using either marksense form or touchscreen dre system toronto

kropf who uses inferior voting technology january 2001 available from the authors well elections are often consolidated with ballots listing federal state and local candidates and other ballot items such as referenda standard national technology might reduce the flexibility of local governments to respond to local circumstances and converting to such system would probably be expensive jurisdictions would be unlikely to adopt technology for use solely in federal elections if it could also be used for local election s some observers also argue that adoption of common system could greatly reduce the market for new voting technologies thereby reducing economic incentives to develop further advances43 others claim that the very diversity of the voting systems used in the united states makes systematic tampering more difficult as discussed in the previous section of this report some observers have proposed that rather than developing national standards each state should be encouraged to adopt uniform voting technology for the entire state currently almost all states use more than one voting technology and few use all five discussed in this report this proposed approach might ease some of the concerns associated with adopting single technology but the potential benefits might also be reduced some observers have argued that uniform statewide system might be necessary to avoid future election challenges based on violation of the equal protection clause of the us constitution for example concerns have been raised that voting technologies thought by some observers to be particularly prone to voter error such as votomatic punchcards may be disproportionately used by minority or poor populations however recent analysis found little support for that assertion with respect to the nationwide distribution of voting equipment44 other observers recommend modernization rather than adoption of uniform systems arguing that many improvements are best left to the election jurisdictions themselves the national association of secretaries of state established national election standards task force that drafted resolution adopted in february 2001 calling on state

to upgrade voting system inevitably involves tradeoffs among different goals such as costefficiency speed and accuracy paper ballot technology is the most laborintensive alternative and may cost several times as much to operate as computerbased systems but it requires little technological infrastructure and comparatively low maintenance costs lever machines are longer made although replacement parts are available maintenanc storage and transportation costs can be high costs of other systems vary depending on the vendor and features given the variety of systems available the varying needs and circumstances of different election jurisdictions and the uncertain effect of economic factors such as economies of scale accurate estimates of the costs of the different

angeles times 13 december 2000 part 1 the basis for the estimate was not provided however total costs would depend in part on the technology adopted for example adoption of dre systems could cost

with new technology that provides full accessibility for persons with disabilities testimony before senate committee on rules and administration hearing on election reform 14 march 2001 populations dre systems have often been considered the most expensive except perhaps for lever machines but they are also arguably the most adaptable with the greatest potential for speed and accuracy in any case replacing an existing system will usually require substantial capital expenditure by the relevant jurisdiction figures cited are often million dollars or more for jurisdiction depending on the kind of system and population size among other factors upgrading may therefore be considered low priority compared to other needs such as schools and roads some also argue that the nature of the market for voting technologies affects their development and cost the market is relatively small and is highly regulated and that might result in higher costs and less incentive for industry research on voting systems some states have already committed to or are expected to upgrade their voting systems for example the florida election task force has recommended that marksense systems be leased for use throughout the state in the 2002 elections49 the florida secretary of state has reportedly recommended in addition the statewide adoption of dre system by 200450 the district of columbia is replacing its datavote system with precincttabulated marksense technology51 currently federal programs specifically provide funding for upgrading voting systems recent estimates are that nationwide upgrade would cost from 29 billion52 however substantial improvements could probably be made at considerably lower cost by focusing for example on upgrading those systems that have the highest documented rates of rolloff or other problems should congress decide that federal assistance is necessary there are at least two options for providing funding discretionary grants in which funding would be based on the specific proposals submitted by the relevant jurisdiction or block or formula grants in which the amount of funding would be tied to population or some other relevant factor congress could designate particular eligibility requirements such as adherence to national standards or that only certain kinds of voting systems would be eligible for replacement under the program such funding
