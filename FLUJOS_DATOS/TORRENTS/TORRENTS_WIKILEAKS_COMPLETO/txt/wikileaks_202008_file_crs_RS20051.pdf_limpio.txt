dprk drug activity multiply and the incidents cumulate i t seems more likely than not that the state itself is involved in criminal activity fo r example alleged large sc ale opium cultivation could likely not be undertaken without the explicit knowledge of the north korean government the same could be said of larg scale imports of ephedrine known precursor chemical for methamphetamine concerns over north korean drug production and trafficking are also expressed in the 1997 r eport of the international narcotics control board incb the report i n circumsp ect language common to such documents notes that the board s received disquieting reports on the drug control situation in the democratic people s republic of korea therefore the board expresses its concern that the government of the

opium per year14 methamphet amine production in north korea is reported to have started in 199 6 after heavy rains decreased income from poppy production this coincides with tim when markets for

highest quality product fo r export according to the incb north korean legitimate pharmaceutical needs fo r ephedrine traditional precursor for methamphetamine are 25 tons per year one ton higher than us investigative gency source estimates incb officials confirm receipt of allegations of north korean involvement in diversion of 20 tons of ephedrine16 moreover the dprk may be bypassing the highly reg ulated market for ephedrine in favor of an alternate techno logy for benzine based product raising speculation that us and allied petroleum assistance to north korea may be used to sustain illicit drug production conservative estimates suggest north k orean criminal activity carefully targeted to meet specific needs generated about 85 million in 1997 71 million from drugs and15 million from counterfeiting looking at all available estimates 100 million figure 17 although admittedly low falls in the general range where estimates overlap however there are strong indications that the figures are considerably higher 500 million to 1 billion annually from criminal activities 18 if credence is to be given to department of state reporting and dea shared information as well as press reports citing north korean defectors and south korea n intelligence sources pat tern of activity emerges which indicates that 1 in the 1970s north korean officials bought and sold foreign source illicit drugs 2 in the mid1970s north korea b egan cultivating opium poppy as matter of state policy 3 in the dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20051crs6 1980s north korea began refini ng opium poppy for export and exporting refined opium products 4 and i n the mid1990s after heavy rains reduced opium production in 1995 and 1996 north korea began manufacturing and exporting methamphetamine t expanding markets in southeast asia if this patter n reflects reality an important question is the degree to which the government of north ko rea may respond to increased financial pressures and expanding methamphetamine markets by dramatically increasing currently reported levels of drug trafficking activity recent seizures of dprk sourc methamph etamine in japan taiwan and south korea may well reflect such disturbing trend some analysts howeve r question the reliability of information reported in the press attributed to north korean defectors and south korean governmen t sources in the context of what is seen as cold war propaganda battle between the two koreas they note that in closed state such as north korea hard data is difficult to obtain thus what i s obtained is fragmentary and indirect at best north korea continues to dismiss medi reports and speculation on government involvement in drug trafficking activities s slander based on politically motivated adversary propaganda sources such as south korean intelligen ce services north korean officials stress privately that corruption drug use trafficking and criminal activity in general are maladies to which individuals in all societies may fall prey and that any in volvement by north korean individuals in such activity is in way stateconnected or state sanctioned further officials have stressed that i n instances where such activity has come to the attention of authorities individuals involved have been duly punished finally dprk officials maintain that drug trafficking an d production are matters that should be handled and are best handled by their government as internal matters officials also point to the politically charged milieu of allegations of drug trafficking by north korea and point ou t that drug smuggling by individuals in the diplomatic community is by means limited to north korea issues for congre ss at least thirty documented drug trafficking incidents coupled with credible if unproven allegations of large scale north korean state sponsorship f opium poppy cultivation and heroin and methamphetamine production and trafficking raise significant issues for congress the administration and ame ricas allies in combating international drug trafficking the challenge to policy makers is how to pursue soun d counter drug policy and comply with us law wh ich may require cutting off aid to north korea while effectively pursuing other high priority us foreign policy objective s including 1 limiting possession and production of weapons of mass destruction 2 limiting ballistic missile production and export 3 curbing terrorism counterfeiting and international crime and 4 addressing humanitarian needs the state departments first incsr report on north korea was released february 26 1999 central to the policy debate is the need for hard data such as satellite imagery t confirm the extent of reported opium poppy cultivation in north korea enhancing law enforcement focus and intelligence cooperation on targeting reporting and trackin g north kore an opiumheroin and methamphetamine trafficking and production is another option which warrants consideration
