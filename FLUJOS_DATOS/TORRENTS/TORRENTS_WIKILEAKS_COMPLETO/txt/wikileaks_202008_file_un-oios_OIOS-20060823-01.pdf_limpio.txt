handling the sor and sow projected that fullydeployed mission in seven locations in sudan would consume 6495445 litres of fuel diesel and jet fuel combined monthly3 this estimate was calculated by mr

dpkolsdsss specifically mr taylorson to recalculate the fuel requirements in response to the constant proposed changes in logistics planning in august 2004 mr ashley lynn arrived in khartoum and assume d the position as the fuel officer with the responsibility for calculating the fuel requirements 33 preparations for the shortterm fuel c ontract continued throughout the summer and autumn of

estimates were discussed ps requested skylink to submit its best and final offer bafo skylink did so on 15 november 2004 citing monthly fuel consumption of 10735179 litres8 34 dpko assessed the bafo nottoexceed nte amount at us85907554 the calculations for bafo were made by mr ta ylorson in consultation with the mission and were discussed within dpko including mr johnson who was by then the chief administrative officer of unamis and the subject who at the tim had returned to new york to serve as the chief of the supply section the subject told the ptf that he relied on the calcul ations prepared by mr taylorson although he did not know whether they were verified by mr taylorsons supe rvisor ms aamodt or by anyone else the subject informed the ptf that there was clear consensus by sss ps and the mission to accept these figures 35 subsequent to these discussions on 13 december 2004 the subject submitted memorandum to staff member 1 chief ps stating that we have now following thorough consultation with ps and unamis been able to accurately articulate the fuel support that is required the subject further requested that ps urgently submit case to the hcc arguing that we have

us85907554 was prepared by mr yakovlev and according to the subject was endorsed by his section in dpko 36 the effect in the increase in fuel requirements is reflected in the increase in fuel costs in

review of relevant records have dem onstrated that even if the estimates were calculated improperly or achie ved through intentional malfeas ance the subject was not involved in any such effort 39 in sum the ptf has not identified that th subject engaged in any improper conduct or otherwise exerted any improper influence in th increase of the overall fuel requirements for the mission which were elevated from 65 million to 10 million litres per month c alleged collusion to award the contract to skylink 40 the audit expressed concern that collusion ex isted to favour skylink in the contract selection process after broad investigati on the ptf did not fi nd evidence that the subject participated in any alleged effort to purposefully favour skylink in this process it should be noted that this allegation rests in the first in stance on the suspicion that an increase in fuel consumption estimates followed shortly after an internal meeting on 20 july 2004 where it was discussed between fficials in ps and lsddpko that skylink had been determined to be the only technically compliant bidder however the subject did not attend this meeting and after thoroug h review of all of the circumstances that concern him the ptf maintains the view th at the subject did not participate in any collusive effort the ptf continues to investigate the accuracy of this allegation in the context

which occurred over several months lsddpko reaffirmed its evaluation scores lsddpko argued that they believ ed that accepting the sudan ess proposal even if it fell just belo w the passing grade was

of the initial discussions on the cancellation of the first bid informed ptf investigator s that he supported the missi ons view that there were options other than the cancellation of the bid that
