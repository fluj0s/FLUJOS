congressiona l interest in us latin american trade rela tions it will be updated developments in usl atin american trade trade is one of the more enduring issues in contemporary uslatin america relations although not the largest latin america is the fastest growing us regional trade partner with the exception of africa which has had strong export growth based largely on the rise of petroleum prices between 1996 and 2007 total us merchandise trade exports plus imports with latin am erica grew by 137 compared to 110 for asia driven largely by china 114 for the european union 294 for africa and 120 for the world see figure 1 for us direction of trade there are two import trend changes first mexico has historically been by far the largest us trade partner in latin america but total trade with many other tin american countries increased faster in 2007 individual country data appears in the appendix second for the first time in years us exports grew faster than us imports in 2007 us trade worldwide continued the expansion begun after the 2001 global economic downturn but at slower pace than in 2006 us exports to the world grew by 121 in 2007 following 145 increase in 2006 among the larger trade partners us exports grew by 182 to china 68 to south korea 146 to the european union 79 to canada and 52 to japan httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98840crs2 source us department of commerce data as presented in world trade atlas us exports to latin america grew in line with the rest of the world at 91 in 2007 export growth to mexico the second rgest us export market grew by only 14 while us export growth to the other major latin american markets expanded briskly to peru by 414 venezuela 133 chile 221 brazil 281 colombia 284 argentina 229 and costa rica 122 these trends reflect strong national economic growth experienced in much of latin america exports to major latin american trading blocs varied expanding by 276 to the southern common market mercosur 208 to the andean community ac 143 to the caftadr countries but only 70 to the caribbean community caricom countries on the import side slower growth in th us economy and the declining value of the us dollar resulted in slower growth in the demand for foreign goods including those from latin america us imports from the world rose by 55 in 2007 compared to 109 in 2006 among the larger us trad partners imports expanded by 117 from china 18 from japan 70 from the eu 38 from south korea and 48 from canada imports from latin america ro by 42 on average and by 125 from argentina 73 from venezuela 63 fro m mexico and 54 from honduras imports fell from peru 102 the dominican republic 67 and chile 53 mexico made up 111 of us trade in 2007 and as seen in the appendix it is the largest latin american trade partner accounting for 56 of the regions trade with the united states these trends point to the longterm and increasing economic integration between the two countries in part the result of their deliberate trade liberalization efforts including the north american free trade agreement nafta by contrast the rest of latin america together makes up only 78 of us trade leaving room for significant growth brazil for example has the sec ond largest economy in latin america is the second largest latin american trade partne r of the united states but accounts for only 85 of us trade with latin ameri ca or oneseventh that of mexico in the united states total merchandise trade exports plus imports has become an increasingly important component of the economy growing from 82 of gross domestic product gdp in 1970 to 254 in 2007 latin americas growing importance as us trade partner is key aspect of this trend since the 1980s many latin american figure 1 us direction of total trade 1996 and 2007httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98840crs3 2 data provided by interamerican development bankcountries have adopted trade lib eralization as part of broa der economic reform programs average latin american import tariffs have declined from 45 in 1985 to 93 by 2002 although the rates varied among countries2 trade reform has not been embraced with equal vigor by all countries and us expor ts are not all treated equally under varying liberalization schemes also trade reform has been delayed or even reversed in some countries when faced with economic instability or changing political philosophy tariff rates have fallen th roughout latin america and so only partially explain differences in economic integration among countries two other simple measures of trade openness appear in table 1 and point to cases where trade liberalization may be more apparent than in others for example mexico chile and costa rica are considered among the early and more successful reformer s of trade policy for each in 2006 total merchandise trade was more than 50 of gdp by contrast in two countries historically associated with incomplete trade reforms total trade accounted for much smaller 19 of gdp in brazil and 46 in argentina the latter reflecting only recent growth based on government export promotion policies table 1 measures of trade openness for seven top us trading partners in latin america trade in

the tradetogdp ratio however may reflect other than trade policy factors the ratio can be smaller for those countries with large domestic markets that are less trade dependent this may be the case for braz il which has large domestic manufacturing base conversely the ratio may be larger for small economies that are relatively more trade dependent such as the dominican repub lic which as part of its pursuit of trade liberalization has also developed manufacturing export ba tightly linked to the united states still the lower tradetogdp ratio for brazil the per capita dollar value of goods country imports from the united states is another specific measure of trade openness table 1 brazil and argentina increased their per capita dollar value of us impor ts from 1990 to 2006 but to only fraction of that for mexico costa rica chile and the dominican republic mexicos high figure again reflects an evolving trade liberaliz ation policy dating to the mid1980s and

f hornbeck 4 in fact some see the stalemate over the ftaa as due in part to the united states and brazil being unable to address protectionist policies that most affect the others main exports see abreu marcelo paiva the ftaa and the political economy of protection in brazil and the us interamerican development bank washington dc march 2006 pp 14 6162 historical ties with the us economy cost ricas high per capita consumption of us goods reflects similar relationship that s seen enormous growth in recent years including strong intraindustry production sharing trade brazil and argentina by contrast have higher restric tions on trade with the united states and other countries in part reflecting trade policy nd trends defined by the re gional customs union mercosur and tradition of industrial policy and broader diversifi cation of trading partners3 differences in income can also be an im portant factor explaining variations in consumption of us imports but per capita gross domestic produc t gdp data shown in table 1 suggest that they do not stand out in this case the trade data suggest that there may be room for growth in trade between south america and the united states trade policy changes at the margin could provide some of the basis for growth in ussouth american trade but they may not be immediately huge given south americas historically small interest in the united states and the limited size of their markets still many economists believe that lowering barriers to us trade with south america and guaranteeing market access may generate longterm trade and investment opportunities simila rly access to high quality us exports and the large us market presents attractiv opportunities for latin american countries as well uslatin ameri ca trade relations the united states and latin america have pursued trade liberalization through multilateral regional and bilateral negotiations with mixed results in part this reflects their divergent priorities for many tin american countries reducing barriers to agricultural trade is top of the list for successful agreement this goal includes reducing market access barriers such as tariffs and ta riff rate quotas trqs domestic subsidies and the use of antidumping provisions alt hough there are many other issues agriculture has played big part in slowing progress in the world trade organization wto doha development round and the free trad area of the americas ftaa4 in contrast the united states has made clear its unwillingness to address most agricultural and antidumping issues in regional agreement like the ftaa to preserve its bargaining leverage in the wto against other subsidiz ing countries like the european union and japan latin american counties have their own sensitive issues and particular concern for easing its subsistence agricultural sectors slowly toward trade liberalization in addition to market access the united states focuses its trade negotiating goals on areas where it is most competitive such as services financial tourism technology professional among others intellectual property rights i pr government procurement and investment not surprisingly these ar areas where many tin american countries are more reluctant to negotiate hence there is near reversal of priorities that hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98840crs5 slowed the progress of comprehensive agreements at the multilateral and regional levels reflecting inherent differences between developed and deve loping countries the result in the western hemisphere has been the proliferation of bilateral and plurilateral agreements the united states has implemented some ftas nafta caftadr chile and peru and signed others with colombia and panama that await congressional action us ftas are permanen t unlike unilateral be nefits extended under the andean trade preference act atpa the caribbean basin trade partnership act cbtpa and the generalized system of pr eferences gsp which must be periodically reauthorized by congress brazil as th major regional economy not in an agreement with the united states has moved ahead parately by adding associate members to mercosur supporting venezuela s accession to mercosur as full member and leading in the formation of deeper economic and political integration pacts in south america although these are neither deep nor comprehe nsive trade arrangements they do signal political will to consolidate regional bargaining interests in juxtaposition to the us backed ftaa two clear challenges emerge from this picture first brazil and the united states appear to have difficulties moving off their respective positions which will likely continue to stall the ftaa the addition of venezuela and possibly other countries with less than sympathetic attitudes toward the united states as full mercosur members could solidify this standoff nationa lizations of key indus tries and other efforts to increase the role of the state in managing the economies of venezuela bolivia and ecuador also do not bode well for broadening support for marketbased trade solutions second multiple ftas by definition promote cumbersome trading system with each fta having its own rules of origin to dete r transshipment of goods and related customs administration and enforcement requirements that can complicate investment and trading decisions resolving this situation will not be easy and may require progress on multiple fronts for example it seems that wit hout advancement in agricultura l issues at the wto action on comprehensive ftaa is unlikely less comprehensive ftaa may not be considered worth expending the political capital needed to approve it and offers far less compelling alternative to multilateral agreement on economic grounds therefore the ftaa may not emerge in the near future despite the logical solution that hemispheric wide agreement presents to integrating di sparate web of cumbersome subregional ftas political concerns in congress may hinder implementation of ftas signed with colombia and panama and perhaps future ftas as well these circumstances suggest that new chapter of trade negotiations between deve loped and developing countries may await which may take patience and new creative solutions to navigate despite these difficulties the debate has not been abandone d because trade issues are unavoidably part of larger concerns with economic reform development and globa lization all themes at the forefront of us and latin am erica foreign economic policy agendashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98840crs6 appendix us merchandise trade with selected latin american countries and groups 19962007 country 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2007 change 20062007 change
