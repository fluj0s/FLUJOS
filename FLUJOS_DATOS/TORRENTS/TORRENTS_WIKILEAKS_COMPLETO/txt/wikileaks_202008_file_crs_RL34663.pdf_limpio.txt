expires at the end of fy2008 pursuant to pl 108293 although the fmc does not itself grant the antitrust exemption that congress has provided to certain ocean liners in series of shipping acts the agencys reauthorization might provide an opportunity for congress to reconsider the current viability of that exemption which dates back to the early 1900s the european union eu for exampl recently decided to outlaw collective ratesetting among container carriers engaged in eu trade lanes shipping lines contend such arrangemen ts are still necessary to stabilize rates and service in liner shipping shippers argue that this exemption is longer necessary and allows container carriers to charge more than they would otherwise us exporters contend that this exemption is contributing factor in their inability to obtain enough containers and vessel space to meet surging demand for their goods after years of large us trade imbalances in which imported c ontainers outnumbered exported containers by more than two to one the decline in the us dollar and rising incomes abroad have led to dramatic ri in demand for us goods while the united states is longer provider of ocean container services it is large user of them the persistent us merchandise trade deficit manifests itself in the container trade over three times more containers are imported from asia than are exported to that region while nearly two times more containers are imported from europe than are exported to europe as result of th is imbalance outbound shipping rates to asia and europe have been about half as much as inbound rates while recent market changes have started possible revival of the us outbound trade that has long been nonremunerative the import market s till dominates shipowner decisions about where to deploy vessel space the persiste nt merchandise trade deficit is thus doubleedged sword for us exporters because of it they ship at below cost yet it also means that they are dependent on import market conditions for the supply of shipping space inasmuch as desire for international comity is one factor that has shaped us shipping policy congress could decide to follow the eus lead and repeal antitrust immunity or it could take waitand see approach to observe any positive or negative effects that the repeal may have on european trade repealing antitrust immunity may lead to lower freight rates but also greater price volatility and some amount of turmoil in the liner market th historical development of us shipping law has reflected balance between maintain ing viable usowned liner fleet for national security purposes and consideration of the interests of us importers and exporters for reliable shipping at competitive rates now that the us liner fleet in foreign commerce has almost disappeared policymakers may wish to reevaluate that balance the focus of this report is on the commercial aspects of the us liner trade it does not provide legal analysis of antitrust

to reexamine the congressionally mandated antitrust exemption for ocean liner carriers introduction unlike most other industries which are generally fully subject to us antitrust laws1 ocean container lines liner carrier s have limited exemption from these laws and are therefore permitted to discuss and set freight rates among themselves this exemption dates back to the early 1900s beginning with the shipping act of 19162 and has been continued through the pres ent in the 1961 amendments to that act3 the shipping act of 19844 and the ocean shipping reform act of 1998 osra5 permission to engage in join t pricing activity was thought necessary to stabilize rates and service in liner shipping liner carriers argue that this immunity is still needed due to chronic overcapacity in liner serv ices caused by government programs to promote nationalflag fleets and domestic shipbuilding shippers the businesses that own the cargo and hire the ocean carriers to transport it argue that this exemption is longer necessary and allows container carriers to charge more than they would otherwise us exporters in particular contend that this exemption is contributin g factor in their inability to obtain

comity is one factor that has shaped us shipping policy in the past although the european union eu recently decided to repeal antitrust immunity for container carriers engaged in eu trade lanes effective this fall8 the rest of the world has generally not placed any restrictions on liner collective rate setting and therefore traditional shippi ng conferences cartellike organizations continue to exist on trade routes not involving the united states or europe accordingly congress may wish to eval uate the need for continued us liner antitrust immunity as it proceeds to r eauthorize the federa l maritime commission fmc whose authorization expires at the end of fy20089 the fmc is the agency that exercises jurisdiction over the liner carriers and oversees the conditions congress has placed on their ratesetting activities d iscussed further below including their antitrust exemption the policy issues congress might consider include should the united states follow eur opes lead and repeal antitrust immunity or should it take wai tandsee approach to observe any positive or negative effects that the repeal may have on european trade if repeal were to result in lower ocean freight rates but also greaterprice volatility with higher peaks and lower troughs would this development be net bene fit to the us economy in the past us shipping policy wa s shaped by desire to retain usowned liner fleet engaged in foreign commerce now that this fleet has almost disappeared shoul d us policy be shaped more by the interests of us shippers given the tremendous disparity in total volume and dollar value of us containerized imports versus exports should the stated purpose of us liner shipping policy be expanded to include the interests of importers in addition to exporters this report provides some historical and commercial context for evaluating these questions after describing the type s of agreements liner carriers have made with one another the report discusses th

fmc before the antitrust modernization commission october 18 2006 available at http govinfolibrary unteduamcindexhtmltypes of agreements among liner carriers pricing agreements rate discussions among container ca rriers often focus on general rate increases gris or ancillary surcharges th at are added to the base ocean freight rate the porttoport rate these gris and rcharges have raised the ire of shippers because they are substantial in combination they can exceed the base freight rate and are typically charged uniformly by the carriers the surcharges are intended to recover variable costs or shoreside re lated costs in ocean shipping such as fluctuations in fuel prices and currenc values peak seasonrelated congestion repositioning of empty contai ners terminal handling ch arges and others the carriers argue that these charges are properly separated from the base ocean rate because they are costs out of the carriers control and itemizing them on the freight invoice provides transparency in shippi ng charges of the 219 liner carrier agreements that were on file with the fmc in 2006 47 of these agreements related to pricing of liner services10 of the 47 29 were discussion agreements 8 were conference agreements and 10 were other types of agreements asset sharing agreements liner ocean carriers also make agreements with each other to share vessel space called vessel sharing agreements vsas or to share chassis11 chassis pools at given port or rail terminal vsas are typically made among two to four ocean carriers whereby they agree to provide container slots on each others vessels in given trade route sharing chassis among carriers allows them to reduce their inventory of this equipment and saves valu able space in ports or rail yards vsas and chassis pools are not opposed by shippers as they recognize that pooling resources among carriers allows for more efficient asset utilization lowering the overall price of shipping12 of the 219 liner carrier agreements on file with the fmc in 2006 172 did not include pricing aut hority and of these 139 were vsas13 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34663crs4 14 the first successful conference appeared in 1875 in the trade between england and calcutta 15 as required by law 46 usc app sec 17023 the fmc publishes annually list of government controlled carriers historical rationale for shipping conferences shipping conferences first appeared in the latter half of the 19th century as traditional sailing ships attempted to safeguard their business from the emergence of faster steamships14 in the postworld war ii era shipping lines have formed conferences as means of counteracting the effects of government support for merchant fleets many governments promote the deve lopment of their shipping industry some governments do this becau of national pride shipbuilding is viewed by some nations as sign of indus trialization and fleet of ships is viewed as sign of international presence some governments support their shipping industry for national and econo mic security reasons the bulk of overseas trade as well as military supplies in wa rtime is carried by ships governments may not want to be dependent on foreign carriers if overseas trade is vital to their economic welfare governments may want access to commercial fleet they can control if military need arises for these reasons many nations provide subsidies and other preferential treatment to domestic shipyards and shipowners in few cases the shipyards and ships are owned and contro lled directly or indirectly by the governments themselves15 this includes two chinese container lines china shipping and china ocean shipping cosco and one from singapore apl that are major players in the us market one of the effects of government in tervention in the shipping industry is oversupply of shipping space while there are periods of tight supply in given trade lane and in particular direction more often ocean shipping is plagued by overcapacity there are generally more ships available than there is cargo to fill them conference agreements were made among carriers in particular trade route in order to limit the supply of shipping

providing governmentbacked loans for the purch ase of usbuilt ships prohibiting foreignbuilt and operated ships from engaging in us coastal trade and reserving significant portion of government impelle d cargoes like food aid for usflag carriers the us navy keeps fleet of cargo ships on standby in case of war or national emergency it has also made agreements with privately owned and operated liner carriers to turn over their ships for the us militarys use when needed these ships receive an operating subsidy to partia lly offset the additional cost of sailing under the usflag forty out of the 47 usflag container ships currently engaged in foreign commerce are parties to this agreement the forty ships are owned by maersk apl and hapaglloyd16 like some other industrialized nations seeking to retain merchant fleet the united states re cently changed its tax structure to allow usflag carriers engaged in foreign trades to pay flat tax based on the size of their fleet rather than paying tax based on their earnings17 the prior tax system based on income earned from shipping is blamed by some for the sale of usbased carriers like sealand and apl to foreign buyers shipowners assert that the economic stru cture of liner shipping is another cause for persistent overcapacity in the near rm the supply of shipping space is fixed as carriers must adhere to th eir advertised sailing schedul moreover the supply of shipping space is lumpycompared with its demand new container ship can cost about 60 to 70 million require one to three ears to plan and c onstruct and has servicelife of about 25 years while dema nd in particular trade route may increase or decrease incrementally measurable in container units or container slots on ship supply can only adjust by adding or withdrawing an entire ship also if demand falls ships cannot be easily converted to some other use so they tend to remain in service exacerbating overcapacity once ship is in service in given trade lane the cost of carrying an additiona l container on that ship is almost nothing in perfectly competitive market price tends to approach marginal cost driven by the desire to fill their ships carriers frequently find themselves carrying cargo at rates that are at best ma rginally profitable for the above reasons persistent boom and bust cycle characterizes the liner shipping market the current market is case in point while us exporters are frustrated by shortage of vessel space to asia and europe vessel owners fear pending global overcapacity carriers ordere d new ships in recent years because of steady yearly increases in cargo volumes however these new ships are being delivered just in time for significant slow down in global trade forecasters predict that there will now be an increase in scrapping of older vessels and lay up of some additional vessels18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34663crs6 19 public 260 64th congress 39 stat 728 46 usc app 801 et seq legislative history of us shipping law during the initial era of conferences some conferences began using fighting ships and deferred reba tes to limit competition from nonconference carriers conference would deploy fighting ship that would underprice the nonconference carrier the conference carriers would share in the losses of the fighting ship until the new entrant was forced out of the trade or agreed to join the conference another controversial practice was the deferred rebate system in which carriers would return portion of their freight earnings to the shipper but only after two subsequent periods in which the shipper demonstrated ex clusive loyalty to the conference thus shipper would suffer substantial mone tary penalty if it shipped with non conference carrier this practice was meant to tie the shipper to the conference and keep their business away from competing carriers the anticompetitive practices described above led shippers to complain and prompted governments to scrutinize the shipping market more closely in the united states this scrutiny has resulted in ries of regulatory acts that endorsed conferences but also included provisions eroding their influence over time the historical development of us shipping law reflects struggle between the national interest in viable usowned liner fleet and the interests of us importers and exporters for reliable shipping at competitive rates while us law reflects recognition of the potential benefits of conferences it also established regulatory regime to curb their abusive practices the shipping act of 191619 congress began investigating shipping conferences in the early 1900s congress concluded that the conferences were used to restrict competition but that overall they were beneficial for international commer ce because they provided price and service stability in ocean shipping they also we re seen as necessary device to protect small shippers against large shippers w ho could extract rate discounts from carriers the shipping act of 1916 legitimized c onferences exempting them from us antitrust laws however the act also established ground rules for conference activities in us trade lanes the act cr eated the us shipping board predecessor to todays fmc to regulate the activities of the conferences the act required that conferences serving the us trade be open meaning that they could not restrict new carriers from joining as closed conferences did the act also required that conference rate agreements be approved by the shipping board fighting ships and deferred rebates were ou tlawed the sanctioning of liner conferences in the context of government control has become the foundation of pr esentday regulation the shipping act of 1916 represented compromise between the united states general desire for free enterprise and reco gnition that the rest of the world generally condoned shipping conferences much of the 1916 act pertained to prom oting national merchant fleet rather than for regulating the foreign trades at the time of its passage it was the provisions providing promotional authority to enla rge usowned liner fleet that werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34663crs7 20 pl

provisions in the act the shipping board was given promotional duties in additi on to regulatory powers later in 1961 these functions were divided between the present day maritime administration promotional duties and the fmc regulatory duties the 1961 amendments20 after the 1916 act conferences began the practice of offering dualrate contracts which offered disc ounts usually 15 to shippers that promised to ship certain amount of their cargo with them unlike the outlawe d deferred rebates described above this discount was made available at the time the shipper paid the freight bill nonconference carriers objected to these contracts and the us supreme court outlawed them in 1958 finding that their purpose was to stifle competition21 in 1961 congress legislatively reversed the supreme courts decision with passage of what are commonly known as the 1961 amendments they required that all ocean carriers file their tariffs with the fmc while the 1961 amendments recognized the need for conferences and reaffirmed their immunity from us antitrust laws it also streamlined the fmc and gave it more power to scrutinize liner conferences the shipping act of 198422 congress overhauled the 1916 act with the shipping act of 1984 the shipping act of 1984 was passe d in the context of move towards deregulation that occurred in other modes of transportatio n in the late 1970s and early 1980s the staggers rail act of 198023 and the motor carrier act of 198024 helped to streamline inland transport of shipping containers by allowing for through bills of lading and cooperative agreements among intermodal ca rriers the 1984 shipping act further strengthened and clarified carriers antitrust immunity by providing that shippers could not seek antitrust relief under the clayton antitrust act for practices that violated the shipping act the 1984 act was response to court decisions that reinterpreted the antitrust immunity provisi ons in the 1916 act and actions by the department of justice which resulted in significant fines against ocean carriers however the 1984 act weakened the cohesi veness of shipping conferences because it allowed individual carriers within conference to enter into individual service contracts with shippers at lower rates than the conference rate in exchange for the lower rate the shipper agreed to ship cer tain amount of cargo during the life of the contract usually year these contract s had to be made public and the carrier had to give the same offer to similarly situated shippers ie common carriage the conference could not interfere with the i ndependent actions ta ken by their member carriershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34663crs8 25 pl 105258 112 stat 1902 26 us advisory commission on conferences in ocean shipping report

cover intermodal through rates intermodal through rates in clude the price of inland carriage by truck rail or combination thereof for overland connections to and fro m final destinations and origins this feature expanded the ca rriers ability to offer onestop shopping to those customers seeking doortodoor as opposed to merely porttoport service the 1984 act also expedited the process fo r approving new or modified conference agreements it required that they become effective 45 days after being submitted unless the fmc filed suit with the federa l courts against the proposed agreement previously conference filing did not b ecome effective until the fmc approved it process that could take years the ocean shipping reform act of 199825 the 1984 act set up an advisory committee to study the effects of the act beginning five and onehalf years after its enactment the advisory committee reported its findings to congress in 199226 stimulating further legislative debate and ultimately leading to the ocean sh ipping reform act of 1998 osra27 the intent of osra was to expand the flexibility of carriers and shippers to tailor their contractual relationships in manner that best meets their n eeds in contrast to the 1984 act significant provision in the 1998 ac t stated that contracts longer had to be made public and carriers did not have to offer the same rates to similarly situated shippers thus conferences st the ability to enforce agreedupon terms among their members shippers were dissatisfied with the 1984 act because requiring service contracts to be made public had enabled the conference to police its members the act essentially represented move away from common carriage to one of contract carriage28 about 95 of liner cargo now moves under confidential service contract according to the container line shipping association29 the 1984 and 1998 acts undermined the infl uence of conferences since then conferences have become less relevant and to large extent have been replaced with more loosely structured discussion groups or stabilization ag reements these discussion groups may include conferen ce and nonconference carriers and are supposed to be voluntary agreements on pr ices rather than binding arrangements also undermining the influence of conf erences has been the improved servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34663crs9 30 reports transcripts and testimonies of the amc are available on its website at httpwwwamcgovperformance of independent nonconference carriers histor ically independents competed with conference carriers by offering lower rates but it was recognized that their service may not be as reliable more recently that perception of lower service quality has been erased the focus of rate discussions may be the base rate for ocean transport but more often as mentioned earlier the focus is on ancillary surcharges such as container repositioning charge peak season surcharge or general rate increases gri among others these rcharges are resented by shipper groups and are usually the focus of their oppositi on to antitrust immunity because they are generally not included in the fixed terms of contract whether or not member carriers of discussion agreement actually charge their customers these surcharges is highly dependent on market conditions and the potential volume of cargo given shipper has to offer carrier the rate established by the discussion agreement typically serves as benchmark from whic h discount is negotiated between carrier and shipper legislative activity since

ministry of shipping to curb the practice however indias ministry of shipping appears to favor further oversight of current shipping practices ra ther than an outright ban on conferences37 the apparent conflict of in terest has prompted liner conference operating in this trade route to request clarification japan japan appears to favor the status quo that is allowing the conference system to continue japan ma prove to be holdout for the conference system due to the fact that large shippers are linked to large ocean carriers in japan through the keiretsu or group system of business organization38 also japan may favor the carriers perspective because ja panese ocean carriers rely more on trade outside japan than they do on trade to or from japan as the asc chairman stated japan

inbound market has turned negative in terms of growth in other words carrier capacity is driven by the more lucrative import market and export volume alone does not presently ju stify investment in

could become what carriers call the headhaul or the route that drives the business and carriers would begin to design their serv ices around the eastbound leg rather than the westbound leg however at least one ca rrier executive does not think this will happen in the near term stating the true definition of headhaul is the leg that pays the underlying cost of the trade nd were not there yet we still need significant increase in eastbound rates or significant decrease in westbound rates to get there55 from liner carriers perspective number of factors limit the profitability of us export cargo us export cargo gene rally is of lower value than import cargo because export cargo tends to be primary or intermediate g oods while import cargo tends to be finished consumer goods high er value cargo can bear higher transport rate during periods of peak demand on the import leg carriers may even consider returning some containers empty even if payloads are available because empty containers can be turned around faster overseas than loaded containers because current export cargoes are generally heavier than import cargoes an outbound container ship cannot carry as many loaded containers as an inbound ship an outbound vessel may reach its load line with only 70 of its container slots filled draft limitations in the panama canal further restrict the load capacity of certain

globalization may 27 2008 60 ibid 61 slomo in europe special report asia europe shipping journal of commerce continuedunited states import containers are primarily destined for cities while exports tend to originate in agricultural production areas the cost of repositioning containers from import unloading centers to export loading centers is generally covered in the import rate since this has traditionally been the headhaul leg in asia empty containers are repositioned on f eeder vessels from southeast asia to china this is because while china is the dominant point of origin of us imports from asia us exports to asia are slightly more disper sed and include exports to india indonesia and southeast asia the persistent merchandi trade imbalance is doubleedged sword for us exporters because of it they ship at below cost yet it also means that they are dependent on the import market for the s upply of shipping space exporters are facing an empty container shortage because there is shortage of import shipments to subsidize container repositioning costs two developments could increase the re venue generated by us export cargo for container carriers with rising sta ndards of living in china and india meat products could become an increasingly im portant revenue source for liner carriers frozen or chilled meat products are high er margin cargo for container carriers secondly if the relative wea kness in the value of the us dollar were to persist over the long term higher value manufactured goods like machinery parts could become more significant part of the export mix rising fuel costs have led to specula tion as to how the current geography of trade might change containerization by lowering transport costs is credited as being as influential as free trade agreemen ts in spurring overseas trade growth in recent decades for instance it is estimate d that the cost of shipping pair of sneakers from asia amounts to as little as 26 cents in 50 pair of shoes57 reportedly fuel now accounts for about 50 to 60 of the total cost of operating vessel58 to save on fuel container ships have begun slow steaming reducing cruising speed from 24 to 25 knots to 19 or 20 knots however because of soaring oil costs according to one trade observer the explosion in global transport costs has effectively offset all the trade liberaliza tion efforts of the last three decades and current transport costs are equivalent to an average tariff rate of more than 959 while labor cost differentials are still signif icant factor in us trade with china and southeast

cargo values stakeholder views some impartial observers argue that the issue of antitrust immunity is somewhat moot because the rise of independent nonconference carriers and the advent of confidential contracts has significantly diminished the pricing power carriers once enjoyed some believe that since osra market forces not carriers essentially dictate freight rates other observers while acknowledging that the influence of conferences has certainly d eclined contend that the em ergence of discussion groups which include rate discu ssions between conference and independent carriers means that price collusion has extended to larg er group of carriers giving carriers more market power liner carriers shipowners and other defenders of antitrust immunity argue that immunity is needed to keep rates from falling so low that carriers are forced into bankruptcy leaving cargo stranded at docks and creating an uncertain and chaotic environment for oceanborne commerce they believe repea ling antitrust immunity would result in greater potential for m onopolistic behavior because the number of carriers would dwindle due to bankruptcies currently in terms of container ship capacity the top five container lines have combined market share of 43 the top ten have market share of 61 and the top twenty have market share of 8362 they believe the carriers most likely to prevail would not nece ssarily be the most efficient ones but the ones that receive the most government support they argue that price collusion acts as an artificial stabilizer ensuring reliable and predictable market for ocean shipping services th ey view antitrust immunity as necessary price for maintaining scheduled services moreover carriers argue that their efficiencyenhancing agreements allow them to pass on operational cost savings to the shippers in the form of lower rates they argue that these arrangements have increased competition in the market because they make it easier for carriers to enter into additional trade lanes by allowing carriers to share ship space rather than independently deploying their own ships the cost of entering into new markets is lower they argue that repeal of the exemption could encourage shipowners to return to th use of smaller vessels as vsas decline thus losing the economies of scale that larger vessels allow these types of agreements

other opponent s of antitrust immunity argue that immunity allows carriers to charge higher ra tes especially when supply is tight than shippers would otherwise have to pay th ey contend that price fixing arrangements protect the least efficient members of carrier conferences or discussion groups because prices are set so that all member s will achieve some vel of profitability for this reason they argue antitrust immunity is contributing factor to the chronic oversupply problems by keeping prices artif icially high carriers are driven to over invest in capacity and have less incentive to innovate and operate more efficiently while they acknowledge that repealing an titrust exemption may cause some short term instability over the longterm they believe the most efficient carriers will survive resulting in lower rates rather than having carriers fix prices among themselves shippers argue that the solution to rate volatility is for carriers to fix prices with their customers by means of timevolume service contracts shippers also contend that the claim by shipowners that their protection from antitrust laws is warranted because of th unique characteristics of their industry is not valid argument shippers contend that railroads air carriers and pipeline carriers also have high fixed costs pr ovide regularly scheduled service and experience seasonal and directional imbal ances in cargo flow but do not require collective price setting in order to prosper port truckers drayage carriers truckers that dray shipping containers between the port and shipper or between the port and rail terminus also oppose ocean antitrust immunity because they be lieve it gives ocean carriers an unfair advantage in negotiating rates and service parameters issues for congress congress could decide to follow the eus lead and repeal antitrust immunity or it could take waitandsee approach to observe any positive or negative effects that the repeal may have on the european liner trade both shippers and carriers generally believe that repeal would likely result in lower freight rates but also greater rate volatility with higher peaks and lower troughs63 in addition to the lowest possible transport cost importers and expor ters seek some amount of rate stability for the same reason they seek stable exchan ge rates traders seek some assurance as to future market conditions in or der to guide investment decisions if antitrust immunity were to be repeale d in the short run one could expect rate wars to ensue with some carriers unable to survive over the long term carrier consolidation

the long run outcome one rationale for granting antitrust immunity to liner carriers is that other nations did the same and thus doing otherwise would put us firms at disadvantage due to the intern ational nature of the shipping business in the case of europes decision to ban conferences this ar gument can now be made in reverse if repeal of antitrust immunity leads to lower rates in the european trades then congress might consider whether carrier s would attempt to recoup their revenue losses in other trade lanes such as the us transpacific the largest carriers today participate in all the major trade routes beyond evaluating the commercial eff ects of repealing antitrust immunity congress may reconsider the objectives of u s liner shipping policy the following four objectives are stated in current law64 to establish nondiscriminatory re gulatory process for the common carriage of goods by water in th foreign commerce of the united states with minimum of government intervention and regulatory costs to provide an efficient and econo mic transportation system in the ocean commerce of the united states that is insofar as possible in harmony with and responsive to in ternational shipping practices to encourage the development of an economically sound and efficient united statesflag liner fleet capable of meeting national security needs and to promote the growth and development of united states exportsthrough competitive and efficien t ocean transportation and by placing greater reliance on the marketplace the first three of these objec tives were established by the shipping act of 1984 while the fourth objective was added with th ocean shipping reform act of 1998 in the past us liner policy sought to balance the interest of shippers with an interest in preserving the us liner fleet for national security purposes the virtual disappearance of the us liner fleet in foreign trade raises the issue whether the interests of shippers should be given greater weight in shaping policy since continuing antitrust immunity appears to have had effect in preserving us liner fleet it would seem incapable of aiding in the reestablishment of us fleet other policy instruments such as direct subsidies could be more effective but even these have had little success in the face of co mpetition from flag of convenience nations and lower cost foreign suppliers whether their lower cost is due to comparative advantages or larger government subsidies national security issues aside congress might consider whether the united states needs us liner fleet to

indicated above one purpose of current policy is to promot us exports but makes mention of imports while exports increase producer income and create jobs imports increase consumer income by lowering prices between 1997 and 2004 for instance the real price of audio equipment decreased by 26 tv sets by 51 toys by 34 and clothing by 9 all goods imported in containers69 policymakers may consider
