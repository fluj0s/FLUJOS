subject private and confidential addressee only date fri 7 nov 2008 194147 0000 from mbatemandavenportlyonscom to bluesmangreenhotmailcom private and confidential addressee only dear sir trevor sears we write on behalf of trevor sears in respect of your harassment of him on sunday 2 november 2008 this email will be followed by hard copy letter on monday the outline of relevant events is as follows last sunday you together with unidentified others arrived at mr sears home without giving him any prior notice we do not know how you obtained his home address he was alerted to your presence by his wife at about 215pm she told him that someone was at the gates to their drive and was asking to speak to him mr sears went to the gate and as it opened saw you with 6 or 7 other people at least one of whom had camera mr sears was taken completely by surprise you came forward and said that you wanted to ask mr sears some questions mr sears as you must have known he would refused to answer any questions he said goodbye and closed the gates you remained outside his home with the others for some time mrs sears was very concerned about and upset by the presence at their home of this uninvited and unexpected crowd there was good reason for you to have arrived at the sears home whether alone or with others mrs sears was distressed both mr and mrs sears felt threatened mr sears called the police and eventually you and your associates left the area after you left mr sears discovered that you had affixed and left large poster attached to the perimeter fence of the sears home this was in abusive and insulting terms britain against crooked lawyers trevor sears we do not know how many people saw that poster before mr sears took it down in separate but closely related incident that same day you were responsible for the circulation of second abusive and offensive document single page leaflet headed britain against crooked solicitors which contained photograph of mr sears and apart from the insulting ugly face applied to him the words crook liar conspirator fraudster racist and conman this leaflet is highly defamatory we do not know how many copies of it you produced or distributed it was brought to mr sears attention on monday 3 november 2008 and copy left at the railway public house eastbourne road south godstone not far from mr sears home was retrieved your conduct in respect of the above incidents clearly amounts to harassment we understand that the police have already written to you about these matters this letter is to give you notice of the fact that harassment constitutes both criminal offence and civil wrong under the protection from harassment act 1997 and to seek your clear confirmation that there will be further such incidents of harassment at or anywhere near mr sears home or indeed other acts of harassment of this nature we do not propose to rehearse in this letter the sorry history of your repeated making of unfounded and defamatory allegations about mr sears we say yet again if you have any evidence to support any allegation of any kind against mr sears please produce it to us and to the proper authorities you have referred in previous correspondence to complaint having been made including to the metropolitan police and the solicitors regulatory authority both of which have investigatory powers and to mr sears client iata and in relation to such alleged complaint you have referred to evidence and to full file yet you have not produced single jot of evidence to us despite many requests by us to the best of our knowledge you have not produced any evidence to the police to the sra to iata or to anyone else as you know full well mr sears denies these allegations we have seen nothing to suggest that there is the slightest foundation for any of them we accept that if there were any evidence it should be fully and properly investigated in the light of your failure to produce any evidence however the inevitable conclusion is that you have evidence if you have any evidence then please produce it now if you do not produce any evidence within 7 days we shall proceed on the basis that you have none we return to the question of harassment mr sears reserves his position in respect of your conduct prior to 2 november 2008 however he cannot let your activities that day pass without complaint your mobhanded visit to his home the display of the poster and your distribution of the leaflet can have had legitimate purpose these matters constitute harassment and must have been intended so to do your purpose appears to be to seek to intimidate and threaten him perhaps to deter him from acting on behalf of iata in support of their proper claims against an agency in default of its obligations we will be writing separately to ash green travel limited about this matter you must not repeat this conduct or engage in any similar conduct we ask you to confirm 1 that you will not approach mr sears at or near his home 2 that you will not publish the poster or leaflet or any similar publications at or near his home including in any local public house shop or business or neighbouring home and 3 you will not engage in similar conduct if you wish to contact mr sears please do so through the davenport lyons office correspondence should be directed to mark bateman of this firm we have previously indicated that so far as your claims about mr sears are concerned you may if you wish communicate with alan gomb or david gore both partners of the firm we look forward to receiving your confirmation on 1 2 and 3 above by return please address your response to mr bateman our client will if necessary apply to the court for injunctive relief to prevent further harassment davenport lyons
