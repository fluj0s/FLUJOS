analysis simplification legislative action summary federal need analysis system underlies the annual allocation of billions of dollars over 73 billion in fy2005 in student financial aid supported by title iv of the higher education act hea pl 89329 as amended prior to 1992 many characterized the need analysis system as too complex arguing that the system was barrier to students seeking financial assistance especially lowincome students in the 1992 amendments to the hea the congress sought to create simplified system consisting of common application form and single methodology for determining the expected family contribution efc for students desiring to attend postsecondary school the new system was intended to simplify the process not only for applying for federal student aid but also for state and institutional aid as well today many researchers and policymakers contend that the need analysis system remains too complex and can be further simplified particularly for lowincome students several members of congress have expressed interest in this issue during the th 108 congress the federal advisory committee on student financial assistance was charged with conducting study of need analysis and simplification pl 108199 on january 23 2005 the advisory committee issued its final report regarding need analysis simplification entitled the student aid gauntlet making access to college simple and certain the report offers ten recommendations pertaining to simplification of federal need analysis and improving access to higher education according to the advisory committee eight of the ten recommendations do not require an increase in program costs aspects of two of the recommendations require small investment that if necessary can be phased in over several years p i of the ten recommendations two call for specific changes to the calculation of the efc that in general would reduce the number of data items that some filers will have to supply or respond to eligibility issues identified in pl 108199 five speak directly to the structure form and processing of the fafsa and three address the broader issues of how potential college students learn about available financial aid and when they file the fafsa during both the 108th and 109th congresses there have been numerous bills proposed by members regarding need analysis simplification it is expected that the entire hea including need analysis simplification will be considered for reauthorization during the 109th congress debate over proposals to simplify need analysis will likely consider how to balance simplificationrelated changes with other possible concerns such as gathering sufficient information to make reasonable distinctions among applicants maintaining the applications utility not only for

federal need analysis system to create simplified system consisting of common application form and single methodology for determining the expected family contribution efc for students desiring to attend postsecondary school the new system was intended to simplify the process for applying for not only federal student aid but also for state and institutional aid as well more than 12 years later simplification of need analysis remains perennial issue federal need analysis system underlies the annual allocation of billions of dollars over 73 billion in fy2005 in student financial aid supported by title iv of the hea pl 89329 as amended prior to the 1992 hea amendments the system was characterized by many as too complex creating barrier for students seeking financial assistance especially lowincome students in spite of changes made in the 1992 amendments many researchers and policymakers continue to debate the complexity of the federal need analysis system during the 108th congress the federal advisory committee on student financial assistance advisory committee2 was charged with undertaking study of need analysis and simplification pl 108199 the final report entitled the student aid gauntlet making access to college simple and certain was released in january of 20043 congress also required the secretary of education to redesign the existing free application for federal student aid fafsa the application used to apply for federal state and institutional financial assistance it was specified that the redesign should include testing of simplified versions of the fafsa in addition to pl 108199 number of bills addressing need analysis simplification were introduced during the 108th congress need analysis simplification bills have also been introduced in the 109th congress see legislative action below 1 james stedman specialist in social legislation domestic social policy division was coauthor of prior versions of this report 2 under the provisions of the higher education act section 491a the advisory committee is established as an independent entity in the us department of education to provide advice and counsel to the congress and to the secretary on student financial matters 3 the full report is available at httpwwwedgovaboutbdscommlistacsfa edlitesimplificationhtml the advisory committee also released interim recommendations in july 2004 these recommendations are available at httpwwwedgov aboutbdscommlistacsfajgregg_simplificationstudyrecspdf crs2 it is expected that the entire hea including need analysis simplification will be considered for reauthorization during the 109th congress debate over proposals to simplify need analysis will likely consider how to balance simplificationrelated changes with other possible concerns such as gathering sufficient information to make reasonable distinctions among applicants maintaining the applications utility for not only federal aid but also state and institutional aid and minimizing adverse effects on applicants eligibility status and on program costs this report will provide brief description of federal need analysis it also reviews the final recommendations for need analysis simplification issued by the advisory committee and concludes with an overview of legislative action relating to need analysis simplification during the 108th and 109th congresses this report will be updated as warranted by significant legislation or other relevant developments4 need analysis need analysis is complex system that is used to allocate billions of dollars of federal student aid under title iv of the hea it entails gathering financial data which is provided by the student via the fafsa5 calculating the expected family contribution efc and packaging of the applicants financial aid award by the postsecondary institutions financial aid administrator this section provides brief description of the efc and how it is calculated and the role of the fafsa this description is very generic for detailed information regarding the efc calculation and the fafsa the us department of education ed has posted descriptions for recent years6 expected family contribution the efc is the amount that the family is expected to contribute toward postsecondary education expenses in calculating the efc consideration is given to available income and for some families available assets in addition living expenses retirement needs and federal and state tax liability are factored in cost of attendance coa is determined by each higher education institution the aid administrator determines the students need for federal student aid and other sources of aid based primarily upon the efc and coa this is true for all federal student aid programs except for the pell grant program for nearly all pell recipients the award is calculated by subtracting the efc from the maximum appropriated pell grant for the year ie without regard to the coa7 the final outcome is the financial aid award or package which consists of the 4 separate companion report crs report rl32083 federal student aid need analysis background and selected simplification issues by adam stoll and james b stedman discusses federal need analysis and simplification in more depth 5 the fafsa can be submitted through the internet using fafsa at httpwwwfafsaedgov electronically through higher education institution or with standard paper application 6 httpwwwifapedgovifapwebappcurrentefcinformationpagjsp 7 for additional information regarding the pell grant program see crs report rl31668 federal pell grant program of the higher education act background and reauthorization by charmaine mercer crs3 specific sources and amounts of student aid each applicant will receive to help pay for hisher education related expenses the calculation of the efc varies depending upon the applicants dependency status this is important because parental financial information is not considered if the applicant meets the statutory definition of an independent student there are three separate dependency classifications for individual applicants dependent student independent student without dependents and independent student with dependents to be classified as statutorily independent title iv section 480d an applicant must meet one of the following conditions 24 years of age or older married enrolled in graduate or professional program have dependent other than spouse orphan or ward of the court or was up until age 18 or military veteran students who do not meet any of the aforementioned conditions are considered to be dependent for the purposes of title iv student aid in addition to creating common application form and single methodology for determining need the congress has also sought to further reduce the application burden for those applicants with family incomes at or below specified threshold under the simplified needs test snt the efc calculation does not consider assets for the student or spouse if married or parent if student is dependent if their adjusted gross income agi is less than 50000 and certain conditions regarding federal tax returns are met8 the automatic zero efc hereinafter autozero efc 9 sets the expected family contribution to zero for dependent students parents and the dependent student or an independent student who has dependents and has an agi that is not greater than 1500010 the autozero efc is not provided to independent students without dependents free application for federal student aid the fafsa is used to collect most of the information that is utilized to calculate the efc applicants are required to report identifying information such as their name and social security number information about the institutions where their information should be forwarded and financial information pertaining to income and assets as mentioned above there are three ways to complete the fafsa via the web electronically through higher education institution or using paper form the number of applicants completing 8 to be eligible for the simplified needs test the student and his or her parents must not have to file an income tax return or must file or be eligible to file federal tax form 1040a or 1040ez this requirement is also met if the parents or student file form 1040 if that form is filed only to claim the federal hope or lifetime learning tax credit the same requirement applies to independent students and their spouse if any 9 the tax formfiling requirements specified for the simplified needs test must also be met 10 this amount is the current maximum amount of income rounded to the nearest 1000 that one can earn and still be able to claim the maximum federal earned income tax credit crs4 fafsa on the web continues to increase annually however substantial number of applicants continue to complete the paper form the paper and electronic including the web versions of the fafsa differ in the way that submitted data are treated as result the electronic versions of the fafsa provide advantages that the paper form does not for example the electronic versions contain internal and endofentry data edits which require the applicant to resolve conflicts and complete all necessary fields prior to submission in addition the electronic versions contain skip logic which enables applicants if they choose to skip over the sections of the fafsa that do not pertain to them as result applicants who apply via the electronic formats are able to take advantage of either the snt or autozero efc because the technology allows sections to be skipped where applicable at present there is comparable approach available for paper form filers advisory committees recommendations this section reviews the charges to the advisory committee on student financial assistance concerning need analysis simplification and its final recommendations released on january 23 2005 legislative charges in response to growing concern about need analysis complexity the congress mandated that the advisory committee study the feasibility of simplifying the methodology for determining financial need and the process of applying for federal student aid consolidated appropriations act for fy2004 pl 108199 the advisory committees primary objectives in this effort are simplifying aid application forms and the aid application process and substantially reducing the number of data items requested the committee is to pay particular attention to the needs of lowincome and moderateincome families in the aid process the legislation identifies specific topics to be addressed in this feasibility study simplifying the calculation of the efc without significant negative impact on such elements as program intent cost and distribution of aid reducing the data used in calculating the efc and reducing the number and complexity of questions asked of aid filers considering whether the process of determining the data used in the efc calculation including the updating of offsets and allowances is the fairest most effective and most efficient way to determine available income and assets considering whether the treatment of income earned by dependent students and the impact of that treatment on pell eligibility effectively and fairly determines available income and student need identifying additional streamlining of among other elements of the aid process the nature and timing of the fafsa determination of eligibility and awards and delivery of aid crs5 permitting students to complete just the portions of the fafsa considered necessary based on their financial circumstances and state of residence estimating approximate eligibility for different forms of federal aid when the simplified application is completed and verified qualifying students for the simplified needs test based on data provided on forms used to determine eligibility for other federal needbased aid programs eg supplemental security income food stamps and earned income tax credits and considering whether proposed changes to data elements the application form or aid application process may have adverse consequences for program costs integrity award distribution and application development or processing as part of its analysis the advisory committee is to consult broadly with different interested parties as well as with forms design expert regarding revised application form that is easily read and understood the advisory committee is also to consult regularly with the education committees of the congress the house committee on education and the workforce and the senate committee on health education labor and pensions ed is to provide requested assistance as practicable within six months of enactment of pl 10819911 the advisory committee was required to issue an interim report to the education committees of the congress and the secretary of education the final report was due within one year of enactment on january 23 2005 the advisory committee issued its final report regarding need analysis simplification the report offers ten recommendations pertaining to simplification of federal need analysis and improving access to higher education according to the advisory committee eight of the ten recommendations do not require an increase in program costs aspects of two of the recommendations require small investment that if necessary can be phased in over several years p i of the ten recommendations two call for specific changes to the calculation of the efc that in general would reduce the number of data items that some filers would have to supply or respond to eligibility issues identified in pl 108199 five speak directly to the structure form and processing of the fafsa and three address the broader issues of how potential college students learn about available financial aid and when they file the fafsa most of the recommendations are not accompanied by an estimate of their potential impact on the costs of federal student aid programs or on the number of students receiving benefits the two recommendations that the advisory committee states require an investment are accompanied by estimates however they are limited to the federal pell grant program the estimates are included where available efc calculation recommendations in general the advisory committee recommendations regarding the calculation of the efc seek to expand the population for whom efc is expected increase the eligibility of working students for aid 11 the legislation was enacted on jan 23 2004 crs6 and reduce the amount of asset and untaxed income information collected specifically the advisory committee recommends that the automatic zero efc apply to applicants with an agi of 25000 or less an increase from the current 15000 threshold the agi threshold for the automatic zero efc be indexed to the consumer price index cpi12 eligibility for the simplified needs test be expanded to include applicants with an agi of less than 50000 and who qualify for benefits from federal meanstested program such as food stamps13 the income protection allowances14 for all students be raised by 1000 the assessment rate on available income for dependent students themselves and for independent students without dependents be lowered to 40 from the current 50 rate the state and other tax allowances15 be eliminated and all income protection allowances be raised sufficiently to protect as many students as possible from any adverse consequence of its elimination16 and some questions on worksheets and b17 regarding nontaxable income be eliminated specifically those involving nontaxable income primarily received by individuals with agis below 25000 or nontaxable income which is received by few applicants or in 12 the cpi is measure over time of changes in prices paid for various goods and services for additional information see httpwwwblsgovcpicpifaqhtmquestion_1 13 it is unclear whether this recommendation is in addition to or replaces the current simplified needs test eligibility criteria that involve determination of the irs tax returns filed by the applicant 14 the income protection allowance is an exclusion for the basic living expenses of the family the amount varies according to the number of persons in the household and the number of students in college 15 the state and other tax allowance represents an exclusion of percentage of the parents total income and approximates the average amount paid in these taxes the percentage varies depending upon the state of residence and if the parents income is equal to or more than 15000 or is less than 15000 16 it would appear that the state and other tax allowance tables would still have to be produced in order to determine the size of the increases in the income protection allowances and whether they were adequate to hold harmless as many students as possible the committee recommends that in the event sufficient funding to increase the income protection allowances as required is not appropriated future updates of the state and other tax tables should be phased in to avoid loss of pell grant eligibility for large numbers of students 17 worksheets and b are forms that accompany the fafsa and assist the applicant with determining annual amounts received from sources such as tax credits the earned income credit untaxed social security benefits and child support the forms are not submitted with the fafsa crs7 small amounts examples offered include the earned income tax credit the child tax credit and untaxed social security benefits estimated impact according to the advisory committee increasing the ipa by 1000 for all students would result in approximately 130000 new students acquiring eligibility for pell and 19 million students receiving higher awards for total cost of approximately 523 million the report further states that reducing the income assessment rate from 50 to 40 for independent recipients without dependents and for dependent recipients themselves would add an estimated 140000 new pell recipients and increase the pell awards for more than 930000 recipients for cost of approximately 292 million additionally the advisory committee estimates that increasing the autozero efc to 25000 would increase the number of new pell recipients by approximately 29000 for total increase in program costs of 319 million nonfinancial eligibility the advisory committee proposes that the fafsa questions related to past drug convictions18 and selective service registration be dropped from the application the committee further recommends that the underlying statues be amended presumably to eliminate selective service registration and prior drug convictions as conditions for aid eligibility structure form and processing of the fafsa the advisory committees recommendations concerning structure form and processing of the fafsa center primarily on the role of technology in simplifying the process of filling out and submitting the fafsa to that end it recommends that paper fafsaez be created for all students eligible for an automatic zero efc and the full paper fafsa be gradually eliminated the use of the fafsaez be extended to independent recipients without dependents who are also eligible for the snt and earn less than 25000 per year the fafsa on the web be modified to eliminate all questions for each applicant that are unnecessary to calculate his or her efc including tailoring the questions asked to each applicants state of residence and the application verification process that higher education institutions are required to conduct be simplified19 18 for additional information regarding federal student aid eligibility and drug convictions see crs report rs21824 student eligibility drug convictions and federal financial aid by charmaine mercer and laura monagle 19 34 cfr 66854 states an institution shall require each applicant whose application is selected for verification on the basis of edits specified by the secretary to verify all of the applicable items specified in sec 66856 except that institution is required to verify the applications of more than 30 percent of its total number of applicants for assistance under the federal pell grant federal direct staffordford loan campusbased and federal stafford loan programs in an award year crs8 estimated impact assuming the recommendation to increase the autozero income threshold to 25000 is adopted the advisory committee estimates that 23 million students would be eligible to use the paper fafsaez in addition extending the use of fafsaez to independent recipients without dependents who are eligible for the simplified needs test would allow an additional 17 million applicants to utilize the form it is estimated that this would cost approximately 64 million the advisory committee estimates that the eventual phaseout of the full paper fafsa will save approximately 5 to 9 million early awareness and filing responding to its charge concerning the nature and timing of aid applications and the award process the advisory committee recommends that an early awareness system be implemented that will provide students with information about financial aid including potential eligibility for pell grants and other aid earlier in the middle and high school years efcs be calculated earlier in the college application process at least in the fall of the year prior to enrollment with pilot program to identify the consequences of not requiring updating of the estimated income and asset data used in determining these early efcs and national partnership be created to make access to college and financial aid simple and certain legislative action this section reviews major legislation in the 108th and 109th congresses that addresses need analysis simplification there have been several bills introduced that pertain to need analysis however this section is limited to those that specifically address simplification these proposals are discussed below legislation during the 108th congress two of the proposals introduced during the 108th congress charged the advisory committee with undertaking study relating to simplification of the fafsa and the need analysis process hr 2956 and hr 3039 in addition the proposals would have required the secretary of education to undertake special outreach efforts targeted toward individual applicants who are eligible for the simplified needs test or the autozero efc both hr 2956 and hr 3039 would have required the secretary of education to make special efforts to notify families participating in the school lunch and food stamp programs and other programs the secretary identifies of their potential eligibility for the maximum pell award some bills charged the secretary to develop fafsaez for applicants who are eligible for the simplified needs test and automatic zero efc hr 3180 and s 2477 similar to the advisory committees recommendation this new form would require filers to provide only the data needed to determine aid eligibility under either crs9 of those conditions in addition the secretary was to provide potential aid applicants with way to determine whether they were eligible to file the fafsaez as well as determine the approximate amount of grants workstudy earnings and loans for which they might be eligible all of the bills proposed changes to the existing eligibility criteria for the simplified needs test and automatic zero efc three of them hr 3039 hr 2956 and hr 3180 proposed making recipients of meanstested federal benefits exempt from eligibility requirements regarding federal income tax forms and filing for either condition hr 3039 would have limited this change to independent students hr 2956 would have included dependent students in addition to proposing that applicants who received benefits under federal meanstested benefit program be automatically eligible for the snt and autozero efc s 2477 also would have extended eligibility when one parent is dislocated worker in the case of dependent student or the student or students spouse where applicable is dislocated worker current legislation to date there have been limited number of bills introduced during the 109th congress that deal with need analysis simplification two bills have been introduced that would preclude implementation of the revised state and other tax allowance tables for any student to the extent such revision would reduce their level of federal aid s 187 and hr 11420 both bills have identical titles ensuring college access for all americans act and both state that the updated state and other tax tables shall not apply to student to the extent the updates will reduce the amount of federal student aid for which the student is eligible in addition the two bills would preclude the application of the revised tables to the calculation of student aid awards for the 20052006 pell grant award year21 hr 1277 proposes that the state other tax allowance tables be eliminated from federal need analysis22 thus far action has been taken on any of these bills the veterans education affordability act of 2005 hr 120623 was introduced on march 9 2005 and referred to the house committee on education and the workforce it proposes that education benefits received under the montgomery gi bill be excluded from determining need similar to two bills introduced during the 108th congress hr 1277 would require the secretary to create simplified paper financial aid form known as the 20 s 187 was introduced by sen corzine and 30 cosponsors on jan 26 2005 and was referred to the senate committee on health education labor and pensions on the same day hr 114 was introduced by rep holt and 16 cosponsors on jan 4 2005 and referred to the house subcommittee on 21st century competitiveness on feb 9 2005 21 the 20052006 pell grant award year starts on july 1 2005 and ends june 30 2006 22 hr 1277 was introduced by rep rahm and 33 cosponsors on mar 14 2005 and referred to the house committee on education and the workforce on the same day 23 hr 1206 was introduced by rep m simpson crs10 ez fafsa for applicants who are eligible for snt and autozero efc this is also one of the advisory committees recommendations among other things hr 1277 would provide that applicants who are eligible for snt and autozero efc only be required to complete the data elements necessary to determine their eligibility for snt or autozero efc hr 1277 also would require the secretary to report to the congress the impact of the digital divide the difference between individuals with access to technology and those without on students who apply for title iv student aid and what steps are being taken to eliminate the digital divide hr 609 and hr 15124 both propose changes in the way that college savings plans are treated in federal need analysis25 hr 151 states that qualified education benefits shall be treated as assets as defined in section 480f of the hea but they should not be considered an asset of the student similarly hr 609 also proposes to treat college savings plans as an asset of the parent of dependent student it further defines the value of such plans as follows the refund value of any tuition credits or certificates purchased under section 529 of the internal revenue code of 1986 on behalf of beneficiary or the current balance of any account which is established under such section for the purpose of meeting the qualified higher education expenses of the designated beneficiary of the account any distribution from qualified tuition plan established under section 529 of the internal revenue code of 1986 that is not included in gross income under such section 529 would be excluded under section 480e of the hea in addition hr 609 and hr 1277 propose changes to the eligibility requirements for snt and autozero efc eligibility comparable to the three bills introduced during the 108th congress hr 3039 hr 2956 and hr 3180 hr 609 and hr 1277 would require that applicants who receive benefits under federal meanstested benefit program eg social security food stamps free and reduced lunch or other programs determined by the secretary be automatically eligible for the simplified needs test and automatic zero efc finally hr 609 also proposes to increase the income protection allowance for dependent students from 2200 to 3000 and designate active duty members of the armed services as having independent status for the purposes of federal financial aid hr 1277 proposes that all of the existing dollar figures in the income protection allowance tables for all dependency groups be increased 24 hr 609 was introduced on feb 8 2005 by rep boehner and referred to the house committee on education and the workforce on the same day hr 151was introduced by rep menendez on jan 4 2005 and referred to the house subcommittee
