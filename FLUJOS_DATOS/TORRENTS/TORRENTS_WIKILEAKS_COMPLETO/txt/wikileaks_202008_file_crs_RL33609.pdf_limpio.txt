suggests th at influenza pandemics occur regularly4 controlling or preventing an influenza pa ndemic involves the sa strategies used for seasonal influenza these strategies are vaccination treatment with antiviral medications and the use of infection control5 specifically targeted vaccine would not be available immediately since the exact strain of the virus would not be known until the epidemic occurs and there may be limited supplies of an tiviral medications therefore the use of other infection cont rol measures may be critical the uses of quarantine and isolation as well as social distancing and snow days have been discussed in the homeland security c ouncils pandemic influe nza implementation plan6 as ways to attempt to limit the spread of influenza7 quarantine is defined as the separati on of individuals who have been exposed to an infection but are not yet ill from others who have not been exposed to the transmissible infection8 isolation is defined as the separation of infected individuals from those who are not infected9 social distancing is defined as infection control strategies that redu ce the duration andor intimacy of social contacts and thereby limit the transmission of influenza10 social distancing can include the use of face masks teleconfer encing or school closures snow days type of social distancing are the recommendation or mandate by

absenteeism were discussed in some detail and included the use of staggered shifts and telework unem ployment insurance was mentioned as potentially available as was disaster unemployment assistance the guidance also observed that the fmla may offer some job security protections15 the national governors asso ciation center for best practices nga center conducted nine regional pandemic preparedness wo rkshops during 2007 and 2008 to examine state pandemic preparedness particularly in nonhealthrelated areas such as continuity of government maintenance of essential services and coordination with the private sector report analyzing the information gained during these workshops identified areas in which new or imp roved policies and procedures are necessary to improve pandemic preparedness one of these areas was workforce policies the nga center concluded every sector examined in this report will be affected by the availability of workers during pandemic in general states and the private sector should develop and test policies affecting the willingness and ability of personnel to perform their duties whether in traditi onal or alternative settings potential strategies and or guidance addressing telecommuting alternative schedules or modified operating hours for retail establishments and internet or distancelearning programs for school ch ildren would be particularly useful during pandemic almost everyone will be susceptible to the illness central disease control strategy will be keeping sick people away from others to minimize the spread of infection employers should examine their human resource policies and if needed create new policies that would allow sick workers to stay at home during pandemi c when possible states and private sector employers should collaboratively velop policies that effectively balance the need of some workers to care for sick or healthy family members for extended periods of time with the requi rements

of public policy the employmentatwill doctrine governs the employment relationship between an employer and employee for most workers in the private sector an employee who does not work pursuant to an employment contract including collective bargaining agreement that may permit termination only for cause or may identify procedure for dismissals may be terminated for any reason at any time although the employmenta twill doctrine provides th default rule for most employees it has been eroded to some degr ee by the recognition of certain wrongful discharge claims brought against employers in general these wrongful discharge claims assert tort theories against the employer cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy is one such claim if isolation or quarantine were used to attempt to limit the spread of pandemic influenza virus and an employee was terminated because of absence from the workplace claim for wrongful discharge in violati on of public policy might arise claim for wrongful discharge in viola tion of public policy is grounded in the belief that the law should not allow an empl oyee to be dismissed for engaging in an activity that is beneficial to the public welfare in general the claims encompass four categories of conduct refusing to commit unlawful acts eg refusing to commit perjury when the government is investigating the employer for wrongdoing exercising statutory right eg filing claim for workers compensation reporting unfair labor practices fulfilling public obligation eg serving on jury duty and whistleblowing17 although most states appear to recognize claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy it is possible that state may allow claim only under certain circumstances for example texas recognizes such claim only if an employee is terminated for refusing to perform an illegal act or inquiring into the lega lity of an instruction from the employer18 while the four categories of conduct iden tified above represent the classic fact patterns for claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy other actions could be deemed beneficial to the public welfare and result in wrongful dischargehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33609crs5 19 421 ne2d 876 878 ill 1981 20 700 sw2d 859 871 mo ct app 1985 21 but see mark rothstein and meghan k talbott job security and income replacement for

ever held that it violates public policy to discharge an individual because he or she missed work due to quarantine 22 29 usc 26012654 for additional discussion of the family and medical leave act see crs report rs22090 the family and medical leave act background and us supreme court cases by jon shimabukuroclaim if an employee is terminated for engaging in such actions some courts have broadly defined what constitutes public policy for example in palmateer v international harvester co the illinois supreme court indicated that there is precise definition of the term in general it can be said that public policy concerns what is right and just and what affects the citizens of the state collectively it is to be found in th states constitution and statutes and when they are silent in its judicial decisions19 similarly in boyle v vista eyewear inc the missouri court of appeals stated that public policy is that principle of law wh ich holds that one can lawfully do that which tends to be injurious to th public or against the public good20 these broad definitions suggest that an employees is olation or quarantin during pandemic in some states could possibly provide public policy exception to the atwill rule of employment it would seem possible for court to conclude that the isolation or quarantine of individuals during pandemic serves the public good and that the termination of individuals who are isolat ed or quarantined violates public policy21 if the government were to direct indivi duals to isolate or quarantine themselves either because they are infected or because of the risk of infection it would seem that an even stronger argument for public policy exception to the atwill rule of employment could be articulated in such case the government would appear to be identifying policy that would benefit th public good however even if the government recommended isola tion or quarantine rather th an mandated such actions strong argument for public policy exception to the atwill rule would still seem possible in either case the government would seem to be establishing policy in furtherance of the publics best interests the family and medical leave act the family

the care of spouse child or parent infected by such virus would not be protected by the fmla if such an employee sought isolation or quarantine to avoid exposure and was absent from the workplace the fmla would not prohibit the employer from terminating the employee at least six states recognizing that the lack of statutory protection for employees in situation where isolati on or quarantine may be necessary have enacted legislation that explicitly prohibits the termination of an employee who is subject to isolation or quarantine in delaware iowa kansas maryland minnesota and new mexico an

with disabilities act39 ada has often been described as the most sweep ing nondiscrimination gislation since the civil rights act of 1964 it provide s broad nondiscrimination protection in employment public services public accommodation and services operated by private entities transportation and lecommunications for individuals with disabilities as stated in the act the adas purpose is to provide clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities40 the starting point for an analysis of rights provided by the ada is whether an individual is an individual with disability the term disability with respect to an individual is defined as physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment as described in paragraph341 the ada was amended by the ada amendments act of 2008 pl 110325 to expand the interpretation of the definition of disability from that of several supreme court decisions42 although the statutory language is essentially the same as it was in the original ada pl 110325 contains new rules of construction regarding the definition of disability which provide that the definition of disability shall be construed in favor of broad coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the act the term substantially limits shall be interpreted consistently withthe findings and purposes of the ada amendments act an impairment that substantially limits one

williams as well as lower court cases have narrowed and limited the ada from what was intended by congress pl 110325 specifically states that the current eeoc regulations defining the term substantially limits as significantly restricted are inconsistent with congressional in tent by expressing too high standard the codified findi ngs in the original ada are also amended to delete the finding that 43000000 amer icans have one or more physical or mental disabilities this finding was used in sutton to support limiting the reach of the definition of disability the ada amendments act states that th purposes of the legislation are to carry out the adas objectives of the elimin ation of discrimina tion and the provision of clear strong consistent enforceable standards addressing discrimination by reinstating broad scope of protection available under the ada pl 110325 rejected the supreme courts holdings that mitigating measures are to be used in making determination of whether an impairment substantially limits major life activity as well as holdings defining the substantially limits requirements the substantially limits requirements of toyota as well as the eeoc regulations defining substantially limits as significantly restricted are specifically rejected in the new law the eeoc had promulgated regulations and issued other publications on the definition of disability contained in the ada as originally enacted the appendix to the regulations stated temporary nonch ronic impairments of short duration with little or long term or permanent impact are usually not disabilities such impairments may include but are not limited to broken limbs sprained joints concussions appendicitis and influenza44 similarly in questionandanswer publication on the ada

infected with pandemic influenza virus and who manifests symptoms would have substantial limitation on major life activity such as breathing therefore it could be argued that an individual who is isolated because of this illness would be covered under the ada however although the ada amendments act of 2008 broadened the definition of disability so that arguments against coverage that could have been made prior to the statutory change are longer rele vant the enactment of pl110325 does not mean that there is ambiguity about cove rage there will still be requirement for making the determination of whether disability is cove red under the definition the statement of managers to accompany s 3406 the bill which became pl 110325 specifically states the following by retaining the essential elements of the definition of disability including the key term substantially limits we reaffirm that not every individual with physical or mental impairment is covere d by the first prong of the definition of disability in th ada an impairment that does not substantially limit major life activity is not disability under this prong that will not change after enactment of the ada amendments act nor will the necessity of making this determination on an individual basis wh at will change is the standard required for making this determination this b ill lowers the standard for determining whether an impairment constitutes disab ility and reaffirms the intent of congress that the definition of disability in the ada is to be interpreted broadly and inclusively61 therefore since determination of c overage under the ada is dependent on an individualized determination the mere fact of having particular condition does not necessarily make an individual an individual with disability if an individuals symptoms were mild or shortterm the c ondition might not be considered to be substantial limitation on major life activity as interpreted by the ada amendments act therefore an argument could be made that an individual who is isolated due to infection with pandemic influenza virus would not be considered to be an individual with disability however this argument is dependent on an individualized determination nd may turn on the severity of the particular infection and whether an individual had any longl asting residual effects from the infection in addition

be construed broadly62 makes it more likely that disability will fall within the purview of the ada if an individual who was isolated due to infection with pandemic influenza virus was determined to be an individual with disability the next step in determining whether there would be ada c overage would be to determine whether the individual is qualified individual with disability w ho with or without reasonable accommodation can pe rform the essential functions of the job since an individual in isolation would most likely be too ill to work the major question would concern the use of leave paid or unpaid as reasonable accommodation63 definition of disability employment discrimination and quarantine quarantine separates individuals who have been exposed to an infection but are not yet ill from others who have not been exposed to the transmissible infection64 since the individual who is quarantined is not yet sick and may never become sick the first prong of the definition of disability having physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual is not appli cable the second prong of the definition having record of disability would also not be applicable since the individual has not been ill the third prong protects individuals who are regarded as having disability and would appear to be the most applicable in this situation pl 110325 amended the ada definition of regarded as providing that an individual meets the requirement of being regarded as having disability if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this act because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit major life activity65 the regarded as prong does not apply to transitory and minor impairment transitory impairment is defined as an impairment with an actual or expe cted duration of six months or less66 i n addition the ada amendments act provi des that reasonable accommodations do not have to be provided to an individua l who is covered under the regarded as prong67 assuming that an

continuedwith or without reasonable accommodation can perform the essential functions of the job can an individual who is quarantin ed perform the essential functions of job the answer to that question depends in large part on what the job is if the job is serving food at restaurant the answer is clearly however an individual might be able to perform job on computer by teleworking the eeoc has interpreted reasonable accommodation as including work at home68 and the use of paid or unpaid leave69 however several cases have found that physical attendance at job is an essential function of j ob relying on employers arguments concerning the need for supervision and teamwork70 these interpretations regarding reasonable accommodation are unlikely to apply since under the ada amendments act of 2008 an individual covered under the reg arded as prong does not have to be provided reasonable accommodation definition of disabilit and snow days snow days type of social distancing is the recommendation or mandate by authorities that individuals and families limit social contacts by rema ining within their households71 since there would not even be the connection to possi ble infection that there might be in quarantine situation an argument that individuals taking snow days would be individuals with disabilities would be unlikely to be successful similarly it is unlikely that an argument that individuals taking snow days are regarded as having disability would be successful however it is possible to argue that individuals taking snow days may be unimpaired but ar treated as having mental or physical impairment if this argument were successf ul the next step would be to determine whether the individual is qualified indivi dual with disability who with or without reasonable accommodation can perform the ssential functions of the job the analysis of these issues would be the same as discussed previously regarding individuals who are quarantined summary of ada application the preceding discussion illustrates the complexity of applying the adas nondiscr imination mandates to employment issues arising during an influenza pandemic ada c overage is to be i

reasonable accommodation varies depending on whether th determination of disability is made on the first two prongs of the definition or on the third if an individual is found to be an individual with physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one of more major life activities or has record of such an impairment reasonable accommodations may be required in the context of pandemic influenza this may mean that telework or other accommodations may be available however the third prong of the definition of disability being regarded as having disability does not require the provision of reasonable accommodation73 as practical matter this would mean that the provision of telework for individuals who are quarantined or subject to snow day would not be re quired under the ada even if an individual were to meet the requirements of the third prong of the definition
