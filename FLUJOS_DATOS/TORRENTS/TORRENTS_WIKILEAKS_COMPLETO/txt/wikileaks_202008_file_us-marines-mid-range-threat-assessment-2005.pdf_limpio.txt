environment ngos are often seen as semiofficial distributors of western government relief rather than independent impartial agen cies who are there to help those in need regardless of politics

may address some of the backlashes to globalization organized criminals organized crime thrives in resourcerich states under going significant political and economic transforma tion it also thrives in countries where governments are weak vulnerable to corruption and unable or unwilling to consistently enforce the rule of law the danger to marine forces from organized crime comes in the shape of syndicates that form loose alliances with insurgent movements for specific operations as is the current case in iraq the greatest danger from organized crime is the trafficking in nuclear biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction this danger will increase over the time of this estimate transnational criminals increased global travel information access and com munications capabilities

afoundation for that areas distinct environment cul ture is made up of social political ethnic economic religious historical and linguistic factors it definespeople their behavior beliefs institutions norms morals and values culture can unite peoples across national boundaries as easily as it can divide peoplewithin those boundaries cultural barriers are often wrongfully oversimplified by treating them as lan guage barriers however even language barriers arenot that simple the language barrier is not limited to wordforword translations but also includes idioms slang nonverbal gestures and social conventionswhich all make up communication the translators role is made easier when heshe has grasp of all the elements that make up the language of culture cultural knowledge and intelligence has become increasingly important because traditional methods of warfare have proven inadequate in 21 st century flicts such as those in iraq and afghanistan us technology training and doctrine designed to counter the soviet threat are not adequate for lowintensity coun terinsurgency operations where civilians mingle freelywith combatants in complex urban terrain the major combat operations that toppled saddam husseins regime were relatively simple because they required the us military to do what it does best conduct maneuver warfare in flat terrain using over whelming firepower with air support however since the end of major combat operations in the campaigncoalition forces have been fighting complex war against an enemy they do not fully understand the insurgents organizational structure is not military buttribal their tactics are not conventional but asymmet rical their weapons are not tanks and fighter planesbut improvised explosive devices ieds and suicide bombers they do

us movies music history lan guage business methods and political ideologies show up in countless foreign nations commercialismglobalization and capitalism have made the united states more transparent than any other country this can be force multiplier for potential adversaries asamerican vulnerabilities and weaknesses are more easily illustrated and understood placing us forces at disadvantage for example iraqi jihadists believe they have stronger will than us troops because of media portrayals of american society as frivolous andcan therefore outlast them in war they feel that their devotion to their cause will be rewarded in the after life their religiousbased belief acts as force multiplier which feeds the insurgencys persistence effective cultural intelligence is not only force multi plier but can also dispel dangerous and misleading categorizations and generalizations humans fear what they do not understand that fear manifests itself in mistreatment of people who are foreign and disrespectfor practices that are unfamiliar us forces must be well informed and prepared to fight an enemy that has extensive knowledge of american culture and history military and political that it may use to its advantage the us military has unique advantage in the cultural and religious diversity of the united states this advantage can be exploited when facing an increas ingly informed enemy who seeks the upper handthrough its own intelligence and close observation of american culture mirror imaging while the consequences of lack of cultural knowl edge might be most apparent or perhaps most deadlyin counterinsurgency failure to understand foreign cultures has been major contributing factor in multi ple national security and intelligence failures in thedays preceding pearl harbor the us government picked up japanese signals including conversationsunclassifiedfor official use only 7 unclassifiedfor official use onlydecoded cables and ship movements yet failed to distinguish signals

own standards in analysis of anothers antici pated actions indias nuclear tests on 11 and 13 may1998 came as complete surprise to cia analysts the analysts believed indians would not test their nuclear weapons because americans would not test nuclear weapons in similar circumstances such ethnocentrism the inability to put aside ones own cultural attitudesand imagine the world from the perspective of differ ent group is especially dangerous in nationalsecu rity context because it can distort strategic thinking the conflict in iraq also demonstrates the cultural importance of successful intelligence misunderstand ing jihadist motivations has caused the united statesto readdress its assessment of the tenacity of the ongo ing insurgency in the country building cultural foundation firepower may achieve temporary battlefield superiority in conflict but it will not necessarily achieve favorable conflict resolution in the current and poten tial expeditionary operating environments where mili tary operations extend beyond combat and may alsoinclude nationbuilding and stability operations it is imperative that equal weight be given to military and cultural factors understanding culture can helpaddress important military and civil issues such as determining the extent of the enemys will to fight of resistance groups to persevere or of the population tosupport insurgents tribal leaders or warlords cultural intelligence is rapidly becoming as important to sion fulfillment as are high technology weapons deep cultural knowledge of future adversaries and populations within potential operating areas will be essential to successful us military operations distance culture reviews of previous academic research is not an adequate substitute for onsite culture knowl edge developed through focused fieldwork firsthandknowledge is far more difficult to develop during conflict when association with americans could put sources at risk it is imperative that the groundwork oncultural intelligence be conducted prior to the onset of crisis cultural databases must be populated prior to putting military forces on the ground immigrant and refugee

theseresources can contribute to clearer picture of the human terrain marines can expect religion while religion has become significant driver in world dynamics it is important to understand what drives the apparent resurgence of religious violence in the past 70 years the united states fought two political movements fascism and communism that threatened to take over many governments both ofthese ideologies were born of modern secular ideas their belief in science and an educated ruling class took the place of religion for many with the defeat ofthe nazis and the fall of the soviet union many expected the world to embrace secular capitalism the september 2001 attacks on the united states proved otherwise religion particularly in much of the devel oping world is part of everyday debate the perceived values of globalization from global regard for treatment of women in the middle east to the loss of traditional families in china are driving many of theglobal religious movements today modern religious fundamentalism represents to an extent widespread rebellion against the acceptance of secular modernity while communist and authori tarian regimes suppressed religion for their own gainsmuch of the oppression came under the guise of mod ernization creating somewhat understandable suspi cion of western governance where there is reformthere are constituencies saying that moving toward democracy means adopting western ideals and invites an increase in sexual immorality crime and violencesegments of the population believe they have to return to more protective environment in which the gov ernment actively favors particular notion of religiousand ethnic identity and the enforcement of religiously sanctioned values this often leads to conflict in every culture wherever modern westernstyle soci8 unclassifiedfor official use onlyunclassifiedfor official use only ety has been established religious counterculture has developed alongside it in conscious rebellion funda mentalist movements are rooted in belief that their way of life and values are at risk of being destroyed and with that comes strong reaction massive change also drives religious movements as countries attempted to do in 50 years what took the west 300 modernization meant neglecting the spiritual aspect of transition and viewing religion as an obstacle to progress moreover development too often failed to deliver even the material benefits it promised the current resurgence of religion is modern attempt to harness traditional identities for contemporary usethis has had implications not just in islamic states but also in those attempting counter fundamentalism through christianity judaism sikhism hinduism buddhism and confucianism this backlash has cre ated challenges for the united states religions effect on national identities much of the rise in religious politics could be regarded as filling the void while the secular nationstate is in period of transition especially states that are still authoritarian andor corrupt globalization has significant implications to traditional nationalism and the nation state in several ways it has weakened them economi cally not only through the global reach of transnational businesses but also by the transnational nature of theirlabor supply currency and financial instruments for many globalization has eroded their sense of national identity and unity through the expansion of media and communications technology and popular culture some of the most intense movements for ethnic and religious nationalism have arisen in states where local leaders have felt exploited by the global economythey feel unable to gain military leverage against what they regard as corrupt leaders promoted by the united states and resent what they see as an invasion of us popular culture on television the internet and in motion pictures religion and ethnicity define public communities the need for national identity persists because there is single alternative form of social cohesion and affiliation that can dominate public life the way the nationstate did inthe 20 th century as such religion ethnicity and tradi tional culture establish nationalist activity and identity while this has occurred in many religions islamic extremism provides the most current example seen as an islamic nationalist usama bin ladin looks at saudi arabia and egypt as states governed by apostates orinfidels who corrupt and pollute the entire muslim faith he believes it is his obligation as devout muslim to incite armed revolt to transform those governments andothers like them with an ultimate goal of transnational form of islamic rule palestinian terrorism is similar example significant plo objective is to win independent statehood for the palestinian people but for seg ments of the population as well as for many non palestinian muslims that goal also has strong religioussignificance and the struggle of the palestinian nation alist is interpreted as part of wider islamic campaign religions effect on war and terrorism war and violence are rarely solely about faith they involve politics economics nationalism even per sonal sense of humiliation however conflict is often religiously influenced such as in sri lanka sudanand israelpalestine religion in conflict provides legitimacy mechanism for recruitment and vast array of asymmetric tactics conflict for religious purpose has instant legitimacy concepts of cosmic war are accompanied by claims of moral justification it is not so much that religion has become political toolbut that politics has become religious tool through enduring absolutism worldly struggles have been lifted into the level of sacred battle fighters are notjust joining war but partaking in redemption for the disenfranchised this can be significant motivation strict religious codes impart sense of redemption and dignity to those who uphold them the very act of kill ing on behalf of moral code is political statementyet these are not just personal acts these violent efforts of symbolic empowerment have an effect beyond personal satisfaction and feelings of potencysuch acts break the states monopoly on morally sanc tioned killing by assuming the right to take life in their own hands the perpetrators of religious violencemake claim of power on behalf of

of corruption in countries that discover large amounts of oil before their economies diversify oil can have devastating effects on the population and environment oil prices will likely remain high in the midrange more oil revenue will allow authoritarian regimes tobuild support making transitions to democracy more difficult competition for resources may allow corrupt regimes to maintain ties with

smuggling of diamonds in west africa coltan in the democratic republic of the congo and gold in indonesia have all been linked to violence andcivil conflict similarly minerals have helped finance qaidas terrorist operations when managed well valuable mineral trade plays significant role in enhancing economic growth and sta bility such as in botswana namibia chile bruneiand gabon however the

another highly contagious and sometimes fatal infectious disease in the 20th century smallpox killed 300 million people more than the total war casualties of 20th century although outbreaks have occurred over thousands of years the disease was sidered eradicated after successful worldwide vacci nation program during the late 1970s scientists havenot found treatment for the disease vaccination is the only way to prevent contracting the disease the last naturally occurring case of smallpox in the united states was reported in 1949 and in the world in1977 somalia scientists fear that if the disease re emerged the fatality rate would be higher than 30 per cent because vaccination is longer widely practiced and the ability to produce an adequate supply of vaccine to contain an outbreak has diminished smallpox is considered dangerous bioweapon it is highly contagious lethal stable easily deployable andrequires low infective dose however the threat is limited by the difficulty in obtaining samples and the technology needed to develop and keep the virus alive successful disease prevention and treatment depends on culture illustrative of this dependence is the followingnarrative regarding the 2003 decision to discontinue poliovaccinations in northern nigerian province for 15 years health officials were remarkably successful in containing and eradicating polio in 1988 there were350000 new cases of polio in 125 countries most of themin the developing world that year four groups whorotary international unicef and the us centers fordisease control cdc made it their goal to vaccinatepolio out of existence and with the help of private andgovernment funding they came close by 2003 the viruswas confined to six countries nigeria niger egypt pakistan afghanistan and india and seemingly headed forextinction by 2005 however the hardline muslim clerics in northern nigeria boycotted the immunizations due to religious and politicalrivalries failed drug trial and reports of the controversial 1999 book the river which linked aids to poliovaccinations in the congo in the 1950s muslim imamsand local politicians spread rumors that the vaccine couldmake women sterile transmit aids andor that it wasmade with pork products the timing could not have been worse of the 35 million nigerians under 5 years old 20percent have polio vaccinations it took more than year for health authorities to convince the population of the benefits of vaccinations but it wastoo late cases of polio genetically consistent with thenigerian strain had spread in succession through morethan 10 neighboring countries including chad cameroon central african republic ivory coast and sudanin late 2004 the same virus appeared in saudi arabia 2months before the hajj time when 2 million muslimsfrom around the world trekked to mecca and returned totheir home countries by may 2005 polio had spread toindonesia its first outbreak in 10 years to date 16 previously poliofree countries have reported new cases whilethe number of deaths from this outbreak were low many ofthese countries quickly moved to revaccinate their population this illustrates the vulnerabilities associated withincreased

by mutation of human and avian influenza these avian virus strains have an astonish ing ability to mutate thus defeating existing vaccines human infections with avian influenza viruses detected since 1997 have not resulted in sustained humanto human transmission however because influenza canmutate and spread rapidly monitoring for human infec tion and transmission is vital because each years flu

to the armed forces medical intelligence center disease and nonbattle injuries accounted for the largest percentage of hospitalization amongdeployed us troops during every major battle in the 20th

setting the stage the threat environment facing todays marines can be defined in three words unconventional unforeseen andunpredictable as the united states continues to be the worlds dominant military force potential adversaries seek to undermine its strengths asymmetrically nontraditional methods of warfare will be used and will vary widely adversaries both states and nonstate actors will adapt be creative and become increasingly sophis ticated they will learn from encounters with american weapons tactics and doctrines and apply those lessonslearned with increasing complexity adaptability and skill by using nonlinear irregular operations us military operations in the 21 st century will likely focus on neutralizing asymmetric threats nonstate actors such as terrorists and insurgents will likely bethe primary threat to american national security and its interests for years to come asymmetric warfare is based on surprise doing the unthinkable or unconventional to undermine the enemys strengths and exploit his weaknesses states and nonstates actors will compensate innovatively for military and techno logical weaknesses future adversaries to the united states will be driven by ideologies that do not restrict the nature of conflict success will be measured by the breadth of damagenumbers killed and amount of fear created and will have borders boundaries or rules the united states will remain the dominant power for at least the next 10 years its economy has weathered global financial crisis well it leads the world in development and use of the most significant technologies civilian and military and it has the most fluid and effective capital markets in addition the unitedstates advanced industrial research and development spending is nearly half the worlds total each year and it maintains strong alliances with key nations the superiority of us military concepts technology and capabilities has been illustrated consistently sinceoperation desert storm however adversaries understand their inability to build forces equal to our current conventional warfighting capabilities mostfuture adversaries will only be able to pursue their objec tives if they can avoid direct us military confrontation andor develop asymmetric means operational and tech nological to reduce us military superiority render it irrelevant or exploit perceived weaknesses most nations develop and maintain militaries not as means to fight the united states but to defend themselves locally and regionally as such conventional military threats will continue to come primarily from iran north korea and china in addition china andrussia export military equipment less advanced sys tems from china and more advanced systems from russia to multitude of countries these weapon systems are more advanced than what the buyers cur rently have in their inventories the extent to which these weapon systems will actually pose threat onthe battlefield varies with each countrys military edu cation levels cultural views on redundant training and resource and maintenance constraints in many casesthe psychological effect of nation having the regions most capable weapons systems is sufficient deterrent to conflict or provocationi make the enemy see my strengths as weaknesses and my weaknesses as strengths while i cause his strengths to become weaknesses and discover where he is not strong sun tzu security search in an asymmetric environment22 unclassifiedfor official use onlyunclassifiedfor official use only in the midterm warfare will be increasingly shaped by the four following assumptions these will define the new operational challenges facing marines strategically war will not be defined by direct mili taryonmilitary attack instead violence will focus asymmetrically on undermining deployed troops andus policies since the us military is perceived to be too strong to beat conventionally its future adversaries will focustheir efforts on undermining the united states legiti macy for maintaining presence in their regions and on affecting the political and popular will the linesbetween war and peace as well as civilian and com batant will be blurred intentionally to isolate and cre ate confusion adversaries will attack economicpolitical and social institutions to frustrate the local population into challenging any authority charged to maintain stability asymmetric tactics will becomestandard and adaptable concepts of guerrilla terror ist and criminal will become blended and blurred tactically warfare will include attempts to disrupt order and distract us forces and undermine popular support and legitimacy for us intervention creating chaos disruption and insecurity intimidates the local population causing people to shift loyaltiesrefocus goals or retreat it triggers questions about thecosts of us intervention and obligates considerable us presence to maintain order the enemys tactical goal is to block attempts at societal order that could affirm american objectives to do this adversaries will become skilled in manipulating disenchantment with us leadership by disrupting basic services combatants can create insecurity and discord they can then take advantage of the disgruntled population and recruit members by offering better alterna tive even though they caused the initial problems future warfare will replace the marines warrior role fora mayoral one the enemys goal is not to test the three block marine but to require marine on every block organizationally warfare will move from the hierar chy of military command to more cellbased leader less group structure that maximizes convenience andtactical adaptation emphasizes and minimizes net work vulnerability nonstate adversaries will organize around continu ously adapting cells or nodes that are ideal for the asymmetrical trends previously described their small dispersed nature makes these cells difficult to penetrate and target they can be motivated by greed patri otism religious fervor naiveté revenge or boredom they may have true central direction may or maynot work toward common purpose and may work in groups or alone ultimate goals might vary among the factions but all cells will be united in their hatred anddistrust of the united states distrust that has signifi cantly increased such cells can recruit not only former military components of the state but also anyable person wanting to fight us forces as technology improves these cells will become more efficient and more independent internet connections and cell phone communication allow organizations to consolidate lethal knowledge funding and manpowerreports of successful tactics can be relayed through out the network creating faster adaptation loop in which people learn and gain momentum factions cancoordinate through thirdparty websites of greatest effect organizations longer must rely on local constituency or state sponsor for money and personnelas was the case in traditional guerrilla war today cells can recruit anyone with internet access with this international potential ideology becomes crucial ideologically warfare will be driven by new identities outside basic nationalism state cultural religiousand individual perspectives will combine to create evolving groups and objectives ideology may be the most radical concept in asymmet ric warfare because ethnic tribal and religious iden tities compete with the nation state ones identity is nolonger tied to the state in which he lives but to what he believes traditional and cultural boundaries will be blurred as individuals place their loyalties in something that can provide them structure and order the united states has effectively battled standing armies to protect the conventional territorial state however itwill be more difficult to counter the tactics of an ideo logical organization like communism that operates outside traditional cultural boundariesunclassifiedfor official use only 23 unclassifiedfor official use onlyasymmetric warfare the lack of military competitors to the united states means that us military operations in this

combat is postworld war ii phenomenon originating in developing nations formed by cultural viewpoints that children are resource and enabled by the proliferation ofsmall arms and light weapons according to united nations estimates there are approximately 300000 child soldiers worldwide and the number is expectedto increase children follow orders require minimal logistics and pay and due to their immaturity have fewer inhibitions toward committing violence theirsize and agility are advantageous in guerrilla warfare the presence of child soldiers will complicate marine corps operations and force marines to balance self preservation against traditional american values regarding children expeditionary forces will have toprepare for the psychological impact of witnessing atrocities carried out by children as well as being in situations where they are forced to kill or woundarmed children in combat rehabilitating child soldiers during postconflict peacekeeping or reconstruction operations will also becrucial often since the only skill former child sol diers have is killing much work has to be done before child veterans can become productive members ofsociety and not return

concern chinas future course as either partner or an adversary will largely be determined by the evolution of its nationalism and political economic system global involvement will play key role in both of these areas nationalism is an intrinsic part of chinas political and economic development chinas leadership uses eco nomic growth as one of its primary levers of influenceover the chinese public without continued growth the regimes stability and legitimacy would be threat ened apart from an economic downturn causing inter nal unrest there is an additional scenario that could interfere with the regimes ability to maintain economic health chinas current politicaleconomic sys tem is delicate mixture of freemarket capitalism authoritarianism and socialism eventually chinasleadership will be forced to reconcile its restrictive political system with an open economic system the reconciliation could be gradual and peaceful or abruptand disruptive the push and pull of an increasingly varied set of interests within chinese society will to large extent determine the pace of this processalthough many chinese are benefiting from economic growth there is growing segment of chinese society that feels disenfranchised should economic growth stall chinese leadership will likely rely on nationalism to maintain control despitethe political regimes efforts communism has been undermined by capitalism along with increased eco nomic wealth there has been rise in ethnic groupidentification and religious expression as well as sparks of political expression the sense that china

thelegitimacy of the regime rests on its ability to reunify taiwan with the mainland in the view of the chinese reunification will optimally be achieved throughpeaceful means forcible reunification would cause severe economic and diplomatic repercussions for china if taiwans leadership were to declare indepen dence however china would likely use military forceagainst taiwan given the

has created its own crackdown movement whether secular or theocratic iranians are united in their desire for the country to be acknowledged as leading power even the leading power in the area nuclear ambitions fit into this goal with pakistan india and israel all being nuclear powers iran sees it insulting that the world believes persians should not beallowed to have nuclear weapons the clerics also see it as the only means to deter us invasion and buy some time to undermine internal dissent however it would be mistake to believe that nuclear ambitions would evaporate with the removal of the clerics nuclearweapons are not an islamic goal but an iranian goal currently the government opposition seems to be stalled high oil prices have allowed the cleric class to buy off enough critics or send them abroad if the price of oildipped significantly for example into the us20 range anger and frustration would likely again bring people out on the street however growing disillusion and

unintentionally led to their increased influence through quarter of century of intermittent military rule pakistans generals have nurtured the islamists and their ideology of jihad this provided them with useful auxiliary force inafghanistan and kashmir but musharraf has gone further in his efforts to create viable and functioning democracy by eliminating corrupt secular party lead ers he inadvertently set conditions for unprecedented cohesion of islamic parties and their subsequent electoral gains musharraf has succeeded in relegating the islamists to the opposition by securing slight
