documentation that indicates satisfactory immigration status due to recent changes in federal law individuals who declare that they are citizens also must present documentation that proves citizenship and documents personal identity this medicaid citizenship documentation requirement was included in the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 and modified by the tax relief nd health care act of 2006 trhca pl 109432 it applies to medicaid eligibility determinations and redeterminations made on or after july 1 2006 the law specifies documents that are acceptable for this purpose and exempts certa in groups from the requirement including people who receive medicare benef its social security benefits on the basis of disability supplemental security income benefits or child welfare adoption or foster care assistance under title ivb or title ive of th social security act before dra states could accept selfdeclaration of citizenship for medicaid although some chose to require additional supporting evidence4 the citizenship documentation requirement does not apply to the state childrens health insurance program schip however some states use the same enrollment procedures for all medicaid and schip appli cants as result some schip enrollees might be required to present evidence of citizenship citizenship documentation issues proponents of the new citizen ship documentation requireme nt say that it will deter unauthorized aliens and other ineligible noncitizens from ob taining full medicaid benefits by falsely claiming to be citizens that it levels the playing field by holding citizens to the same documentation sta ndards as noncitizens and that the burden on individuals should be minimal because similar docum entation is required in othe r settings such as obtaining drivers license opponents say there is little evidence that noncitizen fraud has been problem that many eligible individuals will experience delayed or denied enrollment because they do not have the necessary docum ents on hand and that the requirement is burdensome for states since th enactment of dra as well as the publication of interim and final rules5 the requirement has received considerable media and interest group attention some of the most pro minent issues are discussed below newborns under provision of federal law that predates the citizenship documentation requirement child born to woman eligible for and receiving medicaid on the date of the childs birth is automatically deemed eligible for medicaid for one year so long as the child is member of the mothers household and the mother remains or would remain if pregnant eligible for medicaid6 at the end of the year the childs eligibility must be redetermined as result of the new citizenship documentation requirement which does not provide an exception for newborns the childs citizenship must be documented as part of the redeterminationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22629crs3 7 crs report rl33079 us citizenship of persons born in the united states to alien parents by margaret mikyung lee 8 national health law program state responses to the cms policy change on medicaid coverage for newborns september 2006 9 section 1902a34 of th social security actin the past at least 20 states chose to deem eligibility for children who are us citizens by virtue of their birth in the united states7 born to noncitizen women on emergency medicaid as they did for children born to women receiving full medicaid benefits8 however in the preamble to its ju ly 2006 interim final rule on citizenship documentation the centers for medicare nd medicaid services cms stated that children born to women on emergency medicaid should not be deemed eligible because the mother would not remain eligible for medicaid if pregnant therefore medicaid application must be filed fo r the newborn who is likely to qualify for coverage through povertyrelated eligibility pathway and the childs us citizenship must be documented cms changed its position in march 2007 press release and in its july 2007 final rule which states that deemed ligibility applies to ll qualified children born to women receiving medicaid including emergency medicaid as with other deemed eligible newborns citizenship documentation is still required when the childs eligibility is redetermined at the end of the year number of groups had expressed concern that the previous cms interpretation of the deemed eligibility statute could impede acce ss to care for newborns by delaying their medicaid enrollment and increasing the chances that health care provider would refuse to see them because they lack insurance coverage to bridge the coverage gap between medicaid application and approval states can opt to use presumptive eligibility an option in federal statute that allows certain individuals to receive temporary coverage while their application is processed however states must do so for all children under age 19 making it potentially unattractive to those that would prefer to target specific age group such as newborns under anot her provision of federal law st ates must provide retroactive coverage for individuals who w ould have been eligible in the three months prior to their application for medicaid9 this allows health care provi ders to be reimbursed albeit on delayed schedule for services provided before medicaid app lication is approved although deemed eligibility may longer be an issue some still assert that child whose birth occurs in us hospital and is paid for by medicaid should be entirely exempt from the citizenship documentation requirement for these children the argument is that states own medicai d records are enough to prove that they are us citizens reasonable opportunity citizens and noncitizens appear to face disparate treatment when it comes to the availability of medicaid benefits before evidence of citizenship or immigration status has been presented as with the interim final rule the final rule on citizenship documentation requi res states to provide citizens with reasonable opportunity to present evidence before taking action on their medicaid eligibility but specifies that citizen applicants should not be made ligible until they have presented the required citizenship documenta tion federal law also requires states to provide noncitizens with reas onable opportunity to present evidence however unlike the rule on documentation for citizens states may not delay deny reduce or terminatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22629crs4 10 section 1137d4 of the social security act it is unclear how states may be implementing this requirement in practice for example dela ware indicates that it will provide 30day period of eligibility when noncitizen meets all other eligibility requirements aside from documentation in contrast hawaii indicates that it will only gran t eligibility to an alien that has not submitted documentation if the state fails to provide re asonable opportunity or if the 10day reasonable opportunity period goes beyond the 45th day followi ng the date of application policies were obtained from database compiled by cch proprietary

documents some have pplauded cms for expanding on the list of acceptable documents provided in dra and allowing states to obtain documentation through electronic data matchi ng others have argued for an even broader list and expressed concern that restrictions not required by dra have been imposed for example the final rule requires all documents to be originals or c opies certified by the issuing agency although many states ve simplified their ligibility processes by allowing applications and rene wals by mail some argue that individuals may view visit to medicaid office as their only option when the alternatives include sending original documents such as passports birth certifi cates and drivers licenses through the mail with guaranteed return or payi ng to obtain certified copies instead state implementation although the citizenship documentation requirement took effect on july 1 2006 so states delayed implementation citing reasons such as the need to train eligibility staff and adequately notify beneficiaries for example california implemented the requirement in june 2007 despite the possi bility that federal medicaid funds could be withheld from states for peri ods when they were not in compliance with the law cms spokeswoman has said it is unclear whether there is zeal to do so11 based on recent survey by the govern ment accountability office gao 22 of 44 states report declines in enrollment due to the new citizenship documentation requirement12 based on another survey by the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured 13 states report significant negative impact on enrollment and another 24 states report modest impact13 among seven states detailed in an earlier report from the center on budget nd policy priorities14 only wisconsin has data system that can identify denials and ter minations due to lack of citiz enship documentation and it reports that about 19000 people had their medicaid ligibility denied or terminated for this reason

services provided to newborns who are deemed eligible for year of continuedeven if most or all of the reported medicaid enrollment declines are due to the citizenship documentation requirement key

enrollment declines to gao majority 16 states attr ibute them to medicaid coverage delays or losses for people who appear to be us citizens the extent to which the citizenship requirement is deterring in eligible noncitizens from appl ying for medicaid is unknown15 administrative costs are also an issue according to both gao and kaiser most states report that they are spending more time completing applications and redeterminations gao reports that 27 states appropriated or budgeted funds in state fiscal year sfy 2007 or 2008 to implement the c itizenship documentation requirement16 kaiser reports that 19 states indicated significant increase in administrative costs and that another 26 states indi cated modest increase states will receive federal reimbursement for these costs using the 50 rate that applies to most medicaid administrative functions since existing enrollees must present documentation at their next eligibility redetermination process that generally occurs at least once year administrative costs should peak in the year following implementati on of the requirement costs in later years should be lower reflec ting the ongoing expense of documenting those who are new to

children born to women on medicaid including emergency medicaid from the citizenship documentation requirement during their first year of life hr 1238 would have the effect of permanently exempting all children born to women on medicaid including emergency medicaid from the citizenship documentation requirement by allowing states own medicaid records to serve as proof of citizenship in cases where childs birth is paid for by the program hr 1328 s 1200 as passed by the nate in february and s 2532 would require additional documentation options for federally recognized indian tribes s 751

more than three years between an individuals last period of eligibility and subsequent application for medicaid this is because states are only require d to retain records for three years longer
