compact fluorescent light bulbs cfls issues with use and disposal linda luther analyst in environmental policy resources science and industry division summary compact fluorescent light bulbs cfls sm aller version of fluorescent tubes are produced with technolog that allows them to fit into standard lighting products such as lamps and ceiling fixtures the bulbs use onefifth to onequarter the energy and can last 10 times longer than traditional incandescent light bulbs these factors have led to significant increase in the sales of cf ls according to the us environmental protection agency epa cfl sales doubled in 2007 and now represent 20 of the us light bulb market sales may be expected to increase with the implementation of new energy efficiency standards for lightin g specified in the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 enact ed december 19 2007 those standards require certain light bulbs to use 25 to 30 less energy than todays products beginning in 2012 cfls already meet the standards the increased use of cfls has led to concern among some groups over the presence in the bulbs of mercury potent neurotoxin by way of example epa has likened the amount of mercury in individual bulbs to that which could fit on the tip of ballpoint pen ranging from 2 to 6 milligrams mg at these levels mercury is virtually harmless to consumers still epa recommends that caution be taken in cleaning up broken cfls to minimize potential mercury exposure epa also recommends that spent bulbs be recycled instead of disposed of with household garbage in areas where cfl recycling is availa ble federal regulations that apply to the disposal of mercurycontaini ng products eg lighting switches thermometers do not apply to households further epa has noted that increased cfl use may actually reduce overall mercury emissions to the environment by pot entially reducing power use coalfired power plants are the greatest i ndividual source of merc ury emissions in the united states this report discusses reasons why cfl sales have increased dramatically in the past two years concerns that have arisen rega rding their use and disposal and some media reports that have

accounted for 88 101 b illion kilowatt hours of us household electricity use incandescent lamps whic h are commonly found in households are highly inefficient sources of light because about 90 of the energy they use is lost as heat1 for that reason lighting has been one focus of fforts to increase the fficiency of household electricity consumption lighting manufacturers are now producing products that are significantly more energyefficient than incandescent bulbs ch lighting includes fluorescent bulbs long considered more economical choice for co mmercial and industria l lighting compact fluorescent light bulbs are becoming more attractive to household consumers the primary difference between compact fluorescent light bulb cfl2 and fluorescent tube is the size unlike tubes cfls are made to fit into products that can be plugged into standard household light sockets like tabl lamps and ceiling fixtures compared to incandescent bulbs that use heated filament to produce light cfls contain gas that produces invisible ultraviolet uv light when the gas is excited by electricity uv light hits white coating inside the fluorescent bulb which alters the light into light visible to human eye because fluorescent bulbs do not use heat to create light they are far more energyefficient than regular incandescent bulbs3 in the past complaints about the high cost harsh light quality and the inability to use with dimmer made cfls less attractive to some consumers howeve r improvements in technol ogy have resulted in less expensive cfls that illuminate more softly emitting light similar to light from an incandescent bulb that are capable of dimming increased use of cfls cfl sales have increased significantly in the past two years according to the us environmental protection agency pa 290 million energy starqualified4 cfls were sold in 20075 that is nearly double the number so ld in 2006 the year that cfl market share increased from steady 5 to 11 and represents almost 20 of the us light bulb market energy efficiency of cfls the primary factors contributing to the rise in popularity of cfls are their energy effici ency and longer life according to the department of energy doe cfls us about 75 less energy than standard incandescent bulbs and last up to 10 times long er further according to epa the increasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22807crs3 6 for more information

small numbers of broken fluorescent lamps may 2004 available online at httpwwwnemaorglamprecyclebroken lampsdocin sales is due in part to increases in c onsumer education and promotion by energy star retail partners such as walmart lowes home depot costco ace hardware and sams club new energy efficiency standards for lighting another factor that may further increase the use of cfls is the development of energy efficiency standards for lighting sections 321 and 322 of the energy independence and secur ity act of 2007 pl 110140 enacted december 12 2007 referred to her eafter as the energy act established energy efficiency standards for certain type s of incandescent lamps incandescent reflector lamps and fluorescent lamps the standards specify the maximum wattage that can be used to power lights within range of lumens measure of the perceived power of light for example standard north american incandescent light bulb that emits approximately 1700 lumens uses 100 watts of power cfl emitting comparable lumens uses approximately 23 watts the new standard would require incandescent lamps emitting comparable lumens to use more than 72 watts the deadlines for meeting the new standard fall between january 1 2012 to january 1 2014 depending on the range of lumens emitted by various bulbs cfls already meet the energy acts energy standard the energy act has been interpreted by some as prohibition on the sale or production of incandescent bulbs or as mandatory requireme nt to use cfls neither is true the energy act only blishes standards that incandescent bulbs must meet it does not prohibit their use nor does it mandate the use of cfls6 concerns regarding mercury in cfls mercury is highly volatile naturally occurring element it conducts electricity is liquid at room temperature combines easily with other metals and expands and contracts evenly with temperature change these properties make mercury useful in variety of household medical and industrial products nd processes mercury is also potent neurotoxin that can at certain exposure vels cause brain lung and kidney damage mercury is an essential compone nt of cfls that allows bulb to be an efficient light source fluorescent bulbs unlike many other mercurycontaining c onsumer products are among the few products for which nonmercur substitutes do not exist still over the past 20 years the mercury content in fluor escent tubes and bulbs has declined steadily cfl generally contains 2 to 6 milligrams mg of mercury an amount that poses virtually risk of harm7 by comparison mercury has been present for decades in the following house hold products watch batteries 25 mg dental amalgams 500 mg thermometers 500 mg to 2 grams g ther mostats 3 g electrical switches and relays 35 g and standard fluores cent tubes up to 40 mg ligh ting manufacturers now produce lowmercury fluorescent tubes that generally contain less than 9 mg of mercury concerns about mercury releases

compact fluorescent light bulbs cfls available online at httpwwwenergystargoviapartners promotionschange_lightdownl oadsfact_sheet_mercurypdfin the home during use or after disposal the amount of mercury that may be released by cfl depends on variety of factors including bulbs age at the time of disposal as the bulb ages the mercury content becomes bound to the glass where it is not readily available for release into the environment unless it is burned ie disposed of in an incinerator8 therefore it is possible to essentially eliminate potential mercury releases from cfls if they are not broken par ticularly when new or incinerated mercury is not released from cfls durin g normal use consumers would be exposed to mercury only if bulb were to break at room temperature some of bulbs metallic mercury will evaporate and form mercury vapors however the danger posed from exposure to the amount of mercury in an individual cfl is minimal9 although the potential risk of harm associated with cfl use is relatively low certain precautions are recommended to avoid spreadin g of mercury vapor several federal and state agencies have published cleanup and dispos recommendations for cfls10 guidance from the different agencies varies slightly but generally recommends the following steps open window and leave the room for 15 minutes and keep pregnant women children and pets away from the area until it is cleaned up gather glass fragments and powder on hard surfaces use stiff paper orcardboard do not vacuum and on car pet pick up large pieces wearing disposable gloves use sticky tape such as duct tape to pick up any remaining small glass fragments and powder wipe the area clean with damp paper to wels or disposable wet wipes and place all waste and cleaning materials in glass jar with metal lid or in sealed plastic bag and immediat ely place all materials outdoors and check with local or state govern ment about disposal requirements in guidance provided by the energy star pr

of electricity needed to power an incandescent bulb compared to 23 mg of mercury emissions from cfl over the same period13 the use of cfls in place of incandescent bulbs could also lead to comp arable decreases in carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions all pollutants emitted from coalfired power plants any additional mercury emissions associated with cfls could be minimized if bulbs are kept out of the wast stream ie recycled rather than discarded when spent issues regarding cfl di sposal and recycling products containing mercury may meet the federal regulatory definition of hazardous wast pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra14 epa has established regulations regarding the transport treatment storage and disposal of hazardous wastes ho wever households are essentially exempt from rcra this means that household hazardous waste eg paint batteries thermostats certain cleaning fluids and pesticides may be disposed of in municipal solid waste landfills or incinerators the mercury levels in cfls would potentia lly cause them to be deemed household hazardous waste as such epa suggests that the bulbs not be discarded in household garbage if better dis posal options exist15 epa recommends that household consumers contact their state or local environmental regulatory ag ency for information about proper disposal options if household garbage dis posal is the only option epa recommends that certain precautions be taken since cfls discarded in the trash will likely break and release mercury epa recommends that bulbs be put in two pl astic bags and sealed before placement in outdoor trash or protected outdoor location since virtually all components of fluorescent bulb can be recycled epa recommends recycling as the preferred method to manage spent cfls the scope of programs to recycle cfls varies from state to state for example recycling program operating in minnesota allows residents to leave cfls at any of hundreds of retail stores across the state program in indiana accepts cfls at certain sears stores also regional groups have formed to develop recycling options for example the northwest compact fluorescent lamp recycling project is in th process of designing pilot project to recycle cfls in oregon and washington16 another possibility is that more retailers will begin to accept cfls for proper disposal ikea currently accepts spent cfls and home depot has begun to accept them at stores in canada but not yet in the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22807crs6 17 see

manufacturers and us retailers to expand disposal options finally under 321h of the energy ac t epa is directed to submit to congress report describing recomme ndations relating to the means by which the federal government may reduce or prevent the re lease of mercury during the manufacture transport storage and disposal of light bulbs media reports rega rding danger from mercury in cfls perceived danger posed by the use of cfls has been fed at least in part by some media reports claiming hidden costs and dangers associated their use these reports escalated after an incident involving broken cfl in home in prospect maine on march 14 2007 after contacting various sources the homeowner sought cleanup advice from the maine department of environmenta l protection dep dep representative advised the homeowner to contact an environmental re mediation company to remove any residual mercury from the home the homeown er was given 2000 cleanup estimate the maine dep later acknowledged that b ecause cfls were re latively new to the market department personne l had been unfamiliar with proper cleanup and disposal requirements for the bulbs the agency subsequently posted cleanup guidance on its website along with an account titled the histo ry and facts on cfl breakage in prospect maine17 the initial incident was repeated by various media outlets some of which exaggerated the potential danger and cost ssociated with cfl use and disposal for example one journal stated in part there is problem disposing of incande scents when their life is over you can throw them in the trash can and they wont hurt the garbage collector they wont leech deadly compounds into the air or wate r they wont kill people working in the landfills the same cannot be said bout the mercurycontaining cfls18 as noted previously significantly higher leve ls of mercury have been present for decades in several other consumer products there have been reports of landfill worker fatalities related to mercury exposure additional elements of the incident in maine have been widely repeated particularly the cl aim that it will cost consumer 2000 to clean up broken cfl at home even though many of the original details and claims have been refuted19 the maine incident is often cited in online news stories and web logs particularly when the pot ential dangers associated with cfls are discussed
