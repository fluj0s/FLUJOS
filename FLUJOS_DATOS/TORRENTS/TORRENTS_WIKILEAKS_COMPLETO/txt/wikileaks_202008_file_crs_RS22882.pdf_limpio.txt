general election day or casting ballot in person at the office of the circuit court clerk prior to election day to present photo identification card issued by the government often referred to as the v oter id law it does not apply to absentee ballots submitted by mail and excepts persons who reside and vote in statelicensed facilities such as nursing homes1 it further provides that voter who is indigent or has religious objection to being photographed may cast provisional ballot that will only be counted if the voter executes an appropriate affidavit before the circuit court clerk within 10 days after the election2 under indiana law photo identification is not required for registering to vote and for qualified voters the state offers free photo identification3 shortly after enactment of the v oter id law the indiana democratic party and the marion county democratic central committee hereafter referred to as the democratic party filed suit in federal district court against state officials responsible for enforcement of the law seeking judgment declaring the statute invalid on its face4 and enjoining its enforcement seeking the same relief second suit was filed on behalf of two elected officials and several nonprofit organizations representing groups of elderly disabled poor and minority voters and the cases were consolidated in defense of the law the state of indiana intervened 5 in sum the plaintiffs alleged that the v oter id law substantially burdens the right to vote in violation of the fourteenth amendment that it is neither necessary nor appropriate means of avoiding election fraud and that it will arbitrarily disenfranchise qualified voters without the requisite identification and place an unjustified burden on those who cannot obtain such identification in granting defendants motion for summary judgment the federal district court found that the plaintiffs had not introduced evidence of single individual indiana resident who will be unable to vote as result of the v oter id law or who will have his or her right to vote unduly burdened by its requirements 6 rejecting an experts report that up to 989000 registered indiana voters did not possess either drivers license or other acceptable photo identification as utterly incredible and unreliable the court estimated that as of 2005 when the statute was enacted approximately 43000 indiana residents did not possess drivers licenses or stateissued identification 7 the democratic party appealed in affirming the lower court ruling the us court of appeals for the 7th circuit held that the democratic party had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the v oter id law on its face next pointing out that plaintiff was claiming that the law would deter him or her from voting the court inferred that the motivation for the suit is simply that the law may require the 1 ind code ann 3118251e 2 ind code ann 311751 3117525c 3 ind code ann 9241610b 4 filed before the law took effect such facial challenges seek to strike down an entire statute in contrast asapplied challenges only seek to prevent application of law in specific circumstance facial challenges are frequently utilized

invalidated virginia statute conditioning the right to vote on the payment of 150 poll tax the harper court concluded that whenever state makes the affluence of voter or the payment of fee an electoral standard it violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment11 the opinion further notes that under harper even rational restrictions on the right to vote are invidious if they are unrelated to voter qualifications12 clarifying that standard however the lead opinion finds that in the courts 1983 decision anderson v celebrezze 13 the court confirmed the general rule that evenhanded restrictions that protect the integrity and reliability of the electoral process itself are not invidious and indeed satisfy the harper standard14 as the opinion explains rather than applying any litmus test that would neatly separate valid from invalid restrictions we concluded that court must identify and evaluate the interests put forward by the state as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule and then make the hard judgment that our adversary system demands15 application of this balancing test the opinion further points out was made in subsequent election decisions by the court16 8 id slip op at 4 quoting indiana democratic party 458 f supp 2d at 952 9 in the concurring and dissenting opinions the opinion writte n by justice stevens is referred to as

law is justified by legitimate state interest the opinion analyzes each of the three interests identified by the state of indianadeterring and detecting voter fraud preventing voter fraud and safeguarding voter confidenceand finds that they are unquestionably relevant to the state interest of protecting the integrity of the electoral process17 furthermore it notes that even the petitioners in this case while charging the statute was motivated by partisan goals did not question the legitimacy of the interests identified by the state of indiana on the issue of voter fraud it determines that the only type of voter fraud that the v oter id law seeks to address is inperson voter impersonation at the polls but that the record contains evidence of such fraud ever occurring within indiana 18 on the other side of the coin the crawford lead opinion also discusses the burdens that the v oter id law imposes on voters burdens that are not imposed by nonphoto identification requirements for example it points out the possible inconveniences of voters photo identification being lost or stolen or longer representing the likeness of voter thereby creating an impediment to voting however it concludes that burdens of that sort arising from lifes vagaries are neither so serious nor so frequent as to raise any question about the constitutionality of the v oter id law the availability of the right to cast provisional ballot provides an adequate remedy for problems of that character 19 the relevant burdens imposed by the law the opinion finds are those that are placed on people who are eligible to vote but do not possess photo identification that complies with the v oter id law if the state of indiana required voters to pay tax or fee to obtain the requisite photo identification the fact that most voters already possess valid drivers license or other acceptable identification would not save the statute under the courts holding in harper the lead opinion notes however in indiana free photo identification cards are available through the bureau of motor vehicles bmv in view of that fact th opinion concludes that for most voters the inconvenience of making trip to the bmv gathering the required documents and posing for photograph surely does not qualify as substantial burden on the right to vote or even represent significant increase over the usual burdens of voting 20 for limited number of persons based on evidence in the record and facts of which the court takes judicial notice the v oter id law may still impose somewhat heavier burden however the lead opinion determines that the severity of that burden is mitigated by the fact that eligible voters may cast provisional ballots that will ultimately be counted while casting provisional ballot requires traveling to the circuit court clerks office within 10 days to execute an affidavit it is unlikely that the requirement would create constitutional problem unless it is wholly unjustified moreover even if the burden cannot be justified to few voters it would be insufficient to establish the relief sought by the petitioners in this case invalidation of the v oter id law in all its applications 21 in view of such relief sought by the petitioners the opinion finds that they bear heavy burden of persuasion asking the court in effect to perform unique continued weigh the asserted injury to the right to vote against the precise interests put forward by the state as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule id at 434 quoting anderson 460 us at 789 17 id slip op at 7 18 id slip op at

who may experience special burden and weigh that against the state of indianas interests in protecting election integrity22 on the basis of the record before the court the lead opinion determines that it cannot conclude that the v oter id law imposes excessively burdensome requirements on any class of voters23 and that it imposes only limited burden on voters rights which are justified by the interests advanced by the state of indiana 24 it also finds that if nondiscriminatory law is supported by valid neutral justifications those justifications should not be ignored merely because partisan interests may have provided one motivation for its enactment25 finally the opinion cautions that even if the statute constituted an unjustified burden on some voters the petitioners failed to demonstrate that the proper remedy was to invalidate the entire statute26

the concurrence written by justice scalia finds that the indiana v oter id law is generally applicable nondiscriminatory voting regulation and disputes the notion that individual impacts are relevant to determining the severity of the burden it imposes27 indeed according to the concurring opinion it is the job of state legislatures to assess the costs and benefits of election regulations and their judgment must prevail unless it imposes severe and unjustified overall burden upon the right to vote or is intended to disadvantage particular class 28 judicial review of such election regulations must be applied in such an objective and uniform manner that legislatures know beforehand whether the resulting burden is too severe specifically criticizing the lead opinion the concurrence characterizes it as recordbased resolution that neither rejects nor embraces the rule of our precedents provides certainty and will embolden litigants who surmise that our precedents have been abandoned 29 in sum the concurrence labels it an indulgence that the state of indiana accommodates certain voters by permitting the casting of provisional ballots finding it not to be constitutional requirement instead it concludes that it is constitutionally sufficient that the v oter id law does not significantly increase typical burdens of voting and that the states interests are enough to sustain that minimal burden according to the concurrence that should end the matter30 22 id slip op at 17 23 id slip op at 18 quoting storer v brown 415 us 724 738 1974 24 id slip op at 18 quoting

the souter dissent warns that the v oter id law poses threat of nontrivial burdens on the voting rights of tens of thousands of indianas citizenry and accordingly is likely to result in substantial percentage of those individuals being deterred from voting31 it concludes that the law is unconstitutional under the standard the court established in its 1992 decision burdick v takushi finding that state may not burden the right to vote merely by invoking abstract interests even if legitimate or compelling but must make particular factual showing that threats to its interests outweigh the particular impediments it has imposed 32 in view of evidence of inperson voter impersonation fraud in the state33 the dissenting opinion determines that the state of indiana failed to justify the practical limitations on voting rights created by the law and finds that it creates an unreasonable and irrelevant burden on voters who are poor and old34
