instability in financial markets to uncertainty surrounding the value of widely held securities that are based on mortgages and mortgagerelated assets losses on these securities have led to the unexpected and relatively sudden failure of several large financial institutions credit markets have nearly frozen at times as financial institutions demanded very high interest rates on traditionally routine shortterm lending while there is limited evidence that financial turmoil has caused widespread damage in the broader economy it is feared that significant real economic effects may be forthcoming particularly if credit markets remain frozen responding to these economic fears the house took up the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 eesa as an amendment to hr 3997 on september 29 2008 this amendment failed by vote of 205228 following this the senate took up bill of the same title with number of additions and passed it by vote of 7425 on october 1 2008 as an amendment to hr 1424 on october 3 2008 the house passed the amended version of hr 1424 by vote of 263171 the president signed the bill into law pl 110343 on the same day the centerpiece of both versions of the act is the troubled assets relief program tarp intended to address recent instability in the financial market through variety of measures including an insurance program for troubled assets this insurance program would provide us government guarantees for some of the securities that are perceived as being at the root of the current financial instability the eesa required report on the treasurys implementation of the tarp insurance provisions within 90 days of enactment this report was filed on december 30 2008 it describes relatively small program to be used with extreme discretion guarantees have been made under the program though it may be used in conjunction with the asset guarantee announced in the november 23 2008 assistance for citigroup in the 111 th congress chairman barney frank introduced bill amending tarp hr 384 on january 9 2009 and the bill has been scheduled for floor action the week of january 12 2009 although not amending the insurance portion of tarp section 102 directly it includes language that would clarify the authority under tarp to provide support to the municipal securities market which has been undermined by the failure of private insurers such support could come through the insurance section of tarp however there may also be issues regarding section 149b of the internal revenue code that limits federal guarantees for taxexempt securities this report briefly summarizes and analyzes the insurance program contained in the enacted version of the eesa the treasury announcement of the guarantee program to be implemented under the eesa and current legislation that would affect the tarp insurance program it will be updated as warranted by legislative and market events

decades mortgages have increasingly been funded indirectly through asset backed securities and nonbank lenders rather than directly through deposits in the traditional banking model in most cases once mortgage was made the mortgage was sold by the entity that originated the loan to another institution which pooled large number of these loans together from this pool of loans the institution then issued securities whose returns were based on the payments made on the underlying mortgages in the pool for variety of market and regulatory reasons these mortgagebacked securities mbs became widely held by nearly every financial institution in the united states and in many institutions worldwide in addition to the securities directly backed by mortgages financial institutions created numerous other complex securities and derivatives based on the initial mbs these secondary products such as collateralized debt obligations cdo and credit fault swaps cds were also very widely held in 2006 and 2007 the rates of default and nonpayment by mortgage holders increased significantly this in turn caused the securities and derivatives ultimately based on these mortgages to lose value in some cases securities thought to be safe were completely wiped out these losses have rippled through the financial system causing problems for institutions in number of unexpected ways as well as stress to the general financial system the failure of large financial institutions including bear stearns indymac lehman brothers aig and wachovia was largely due to this turmoil due largely to the uncertainty about what future mortgage default rates will be as well as who is currently holding mbs financial markets have nearly frozen at various points in time since august 2007 on september 19 2008 the secretary of the treasury called for broad program of financial intervention to stabilize markets the treasury proposal called for government purchases of up to 700 billion in mortgagerelated securities in the hope that by partially purging the system of these troubled assets normal functioning of the financial markets could be restored the idea of broad asset purchases as in the initial treasury plan is only one of number of methods that could be used to address the uncertainties regarding mortgagerelated assets among the other concepts put forward in congress has been that of federal guarantee program to insure mortgagerelated assets insurance on municipal securities has been issued by private insurers since the 1970s and in the past decade many insurers broadened their insurance offerings to include mortgagerelated securities most of the insurers specializing in this type of insurance have suffered major losses and ratings agency downgrades in the last year as legislative proposal federal insurance program for troubled assets appeared in the troubled asset relief program tarp portion of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 eesa house amendment to hr 3997 this amendment failed in the house on vote of 205228 on september 29 2008 another version of the eesa which included the original eesa plus several other provisions not in the first bill 1 was offered on october 1 in the senate as an amendment to the previously passed hr 1424 the amended version of hr 1424 was approved by senate vote of 7425 it was then taken up by the house and passed by vote of 263171 on october 3 2008 the president signed the amended version of hr 1414 now pl 110343 the same day as house passage 1 additional provisions included temporary increase in the limit on fdicprovided depos itory insurance as well as extensive tax provisions that had previously been considered by one or both houses of congress

secretary of the treasury creates program to purchase troubled assets as authorized in section 101 he or she shall also create program to guarantee troubled assets troubled assets under the bill are defined as residential or commercial mortgages and any securities obligations or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages2 the underlying mortgages in question must have been originated before march 14 2008 the bill also gives the secretary of the treasury after consultation with the chairman of the federal reserve the authority to purchase any other financial instrument necessary to promote market stability congress must be notified of such purchase but explicit approval from congress is not needed aside from the requirement to establish the program the secretary of the treasury has relatively broad authority as to the structure of the prog ram he or she may not guarantee the prompt payment of more than 100 of the insured securities interest and principal payments100 is typical of bond insurance in the private sectorbut the secretary is free to guarantee less than 100 as well aggregate premiums for the insuranc are required to cover the expected losses from the insurance program and the secretary has the authority to base individual premiums on the risk of the security to be covered but there is requirement that premiums be riskbased the combined size of the purchase and insurance programs for troubled assets authorized in the bill is limited to 700 billion but the secretary of the treasury is free to decide what percentage of the overall amount the two programs occupy the secretary must report within 90 days on the tarp insurance program

host of other uncertainties in the current financial climate it is difficult to assess the potential impact of the federal guarantee program in theory such program could have significant impact by improving confidence in the financial markets in previous market experience with private bond insurance once security was guaranteed it was generally treated as security with the same credit rating as the insurer thus for example single rated municipal sewer authority could issue bond that would be treated as aaa if the bond was then insured by aaarated insurer if the federal government were to issue 100 guarantee on mortgagebacked security even one backed by subprime loans with high default rate the market may treat it essentially as us treasury security which is widely considered to be the safest and most liquid security that can be held 3 if this occurred for wide swath of the mbs that are currently illiquid and looked at with great skepticism by the markets theory would suggest that it would restore the confidence that has been absent in the financial markets in recent weeks 2 pl 110343 section 3 3 there is potentially an important difference between treasu ry securities and securities that might be guaranteed under this insurance program treasury securities are clearly backed by the full faith and credit of the us government and are paid for out of the general taxing authority of the federal government under pl 110343 claims on the troubled asset insurance program are to be paid for out of the prem iums collected there is explicit authority for the program to borrow from the treasury as with other federal insurance programs such as flood insurance if the claims ex ceed the funds collected through premiums it is unclear how these claims would be paid

provide the same widespread boost to market confidence an insurance prog ram may have advantages compared with the purchase plan the insurance plan would result in little or government ownership of assets with the attendant questions of how these assets are then to be disposed of the insurance plan as structured would be selffinancing there are provisions in the plan for the outlay of taxpayer monies an insurance program would also avoid accounting problems that could emerge if the purchasing plan results in asset sales at significant discounts to previous prices under markto market accounting rules such asset sales may trigger accounting losses in other companies holding similar securities and might even threaten the solvency of other financial institutions such hoped for benefits of the insurance program however may also be offset to some degree by practical questions concerning how the plan might actually work many of these questions revolve around the overall cost of the insurance program and the individual premiums to be charged for the government guarantee providing guarantees for mbs has in practice proved very risky and costly business over the past year most of the bond insurance companies if they have been able to remain solvent have seen their stock prices collapse and their credit ratings downgraded as losses have mounted on guarantees for mbs the primary new entrant to insuring bonds subsidiary of berkshire hathaway has specifically indicated it will not insure such securities it is unclear if and how federal insurance program would be able to incur fe wer losses than private insurers if the goal of the program is to improve the functioning of the financial system by removing the impediments posed by troubled assets some would argue the pr ogram would not be functioning as intended if the securities it guaranteed were not suffering losses some losses may be avoided by insuring the mortgagerelated securities at less than 100 value as specifically authorized in the act the recent history on mortgage default rates however suggests that any significant guarantee program on mortgagerelated securities might incur significant losses the program established in pl 110343 specifies that the losses from the guarantee program will be covered by the aggregate premiums paid by financial institutions holding the guaranteed securities this brings up the most critical point in any insurance endeavor whether public or private namely determining the premiums to be charged for the coverage provided if the overall premiums are set too low the endeavor will ultimately fail as the money coming in will not cover the money going out if the overall premiums are set too high in this case fewer mortgage related securities would be insured than would be possible this would presumably be counter to the acts goal of restoring liquidity and stability to the u s financial system setting optimal premiums for mortgagerelated securities would require an accurate estimate of what mortgage default rates will be around the country in the future and how these default rates will affect the payment streams on mortgagerelated securities the inability to make such accurate estimates is identified by many to be at the heart of the uncertainty bedeviling the financial system today in addition to the question of setting overall premiums so the program remains solvent the question of setting individual premiums for specific securities is also challenging the bill includes the authority but not requirement to vary premiums according to the credit risk associated with the particular troubled asset that is being guaranteed if individual premiums are not riskbased then the program may suffer from adverse selection meaning that the program will attract primarily securities that are relatively high risk if these high risk securities result in higher losses than anticipated the overall premiums would ultimately have to be raised to keep the program solvent higher premiums would likely result in fewer institutions participating in the program and the remaining guaranteed securitie s being on the whole higher risk than before if individual premiums are to be riskbased the insurance will encounter the problems mentioned

the difficulties in estimating the impact on individual securities and thus tablishing individual riskbased premiums would be much greater than simply estimating the overall amount of premiums needed for the program to remain solvent g22g155g142g138g156g158g155g162g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g156g561g21g146g151g140g142g561g7g151g138g140g157g150g142g151g157g561 the focus of the treasury since enactment has been neither the asset purchase program as initial envisioned in the treasury proposal from september 2008 nor the insurance program outlined in section 102 of the eesa instead the majority of the actions under tarp have been direct capital injections through the purchase of preferred shares on november 23 2008 the treasury agreed to guarantee up to 5 billion in prospective losses on 306 billion pool of securities as part of an intervention to aid citigroup though the tarp insurance section was not specifically cited as authority to provide this guarantee on december 30 2009 the treasury released the required report to congress on the tarp insurance program 4 this report described an asset guar antee program agp that would bear little resemblance to the insurance for securities that exists in the private market the treasury agp is to be used only for assets held by systemically significant financial institutions that face high risk of losing market confidence due in large part to portfolio of distressed or illiquid assets treasury indicates that such guarantees would be applied with extreme discretion and that the program is not anticipated to be widely available the model for the agp may be the previous guarantee of citigroup assets and the report indicates that treasury is considering using the agp to provide this previously promised guarantee treasury reports that it is reviewing options for developing further insurance programs under tarp identifying two design considerations of particular importance the first consideration is the accounting for the insurance program under the eesa section 102 specifies that the up to 700 billion in purchasing authority under tarp is reduced by the total value of the asset guaranteed less the premium paid for the insuran ce thus in accounting terms insuring an asset under tarp has similar impact as purchasing that asset the second consideration is the impact of adverse selection and the difficulty of pricing the insurance as detailed in the analysis above g343g343g343g157g145g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561

securities market which has been undermined by the failure of private insurers as detailed above variety of forms of such support could be authorized under the insurance section of tarp including direct federal replacement for the private bond insurers who have largely disappeared from the market or some form of federal reinsurance backstop for the m unicipal bond insurance industry providing such insurance would likely face fewer logistical challenges than insuring mortgagerelated assets because municipal securities tend to default at substantially lower rates and more data exists on such default rates one complication to applying tarp to supporting the municipal securities market however may be section 149b of the internal revenue code this section limits federal guarantees for tax exempt securities thus under current law if an explicit guarantee is to be provided for municipal bonds under tarp these bonds would longer be exempt from federal taxes the loss of tax exempt status would make these securities less attractive to some and thus counteract to some degree the attempt to support the market g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 many argue that central driver of the recent turmoil in financial markets has been uncertainty and fear regarding mortgagerelated securities that are widely held in the financial system among the mechanisms recently passed by congress to address these problems is federal program to insure troubled assets private insurance to enhance the creditworthiness and attractiveness of securities has operated for more than 30 years this record shows that an insurance mechanism can have role to play in the securities marketplace recent private experience insuring mortgagerelated assets however has been negative such insurers have experienced large losses and many have faced difficulties remaining solvent the department of the treasury faces significant practical challenges as it implements federal program to insure troubled assets particular difficulties include ensuring the overall solvency of the program through sufficient aggregate premiums and setting individual premiums commensurate with the risks posed by mortgagerelated securities the initial treasury outline for the tarp insurance program seeks to minimize these difficulties by limiting the size and scope of the federal guarantees to be provided
