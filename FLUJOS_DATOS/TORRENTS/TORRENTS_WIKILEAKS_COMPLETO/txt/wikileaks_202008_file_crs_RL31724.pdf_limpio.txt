not necessarily foreclosed by 18 usc 4001a which provides that us citizen may be detained except pursuant to an act of congress however the court appears to have limited the scope of individuals who may be treated as enemy combatants pursuant to that authority and clarified that such detainees have some due process rights under the us constitution7 petitioners for padilla maintain that 18 usc 4001a bars hi s detention without trial8 the district court for the district of south carolina has agreed and ordered the government to end his military detention background the attorney general announced on june 10 2002 that an american citizen jose padilla also known as abdullah muhajir was arrested may 8 2002 upon his return from pakistan allegedly with the intent of participating in plot to use radiological bomb against unknown targets w ithin the united states padilla was detained under court order as material witness til the department of justice faced court deadline to either bring ch arges or release him after prosecutors reportedly either lacked the physical evidence or were unwilling to disclose classified evidence necessary to bring charges against padilla president bush signed an unspecified order declaring him to be an enemy combatant and transferred him to the custody of the department of defense9 the administration takes the position that the law of war allows the united states to detain indefinitely members agents or associates of qaeda and other terro rist organizations without charging them with crime under either criminal statut or the international law of war notwithstanding their american citizenship10 the administration also initiallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31724crs3 11 public defender was appointed to represent padilla while he was detained as material witness pursuant to the mate rial witness statute 18 usc 3144 the judge determined that this relationship is sufficient to qualify he r as next friend of padilla with standing to pursue petition for writ of habeas corpus on his behalf 233 fsupp2d at 578 12 the administration takes the position that in the case of citizens who take up arms against america any interest those individuals might have in obtaining the assistance of counsel for the purpose of preparing habeas petition must give way to the national security needs of this country to gather intelligence from captured enemy combatants although the right to counsel is fundamental part of our criminal justice system it is undeniably foreign to the law of war imagine the burden on our ability to wage war if those trying to kill our soldiers and civilians were given the opportunity to lawyer up when they are captured respectfully those who urge the extension of the right to counsel to these combatants for the purpose of filing habeas petition confuse the context of war with that of the criminal justice system see alberto r gonzales remarks to the amer ican bar association standing committee on law and

argued is not possible given the fact that president bush has declared that member of the taliban continueddenied padilla access to his attorney11 arguing that he has constitutional right to an attorney because he has not been charged with crime12 after federal judge ruled that padilla has right to challenge his detention and the concomitant right to consult with an attorney13 the government moved for reconsideration of the order based on its assertion that conditions were possible that would permit padilla to communicate with his lawyer without endang ering national security which the judge considered but rejected14 the judge certified the case for interlocutory appeal to the us court of appeals for the second circu it including the issue of the presidents authority to order padillas detention as an enemy combatant15 the second circuit held that the president does not have the inherent authority nor has congress authorized him to declare us citizen s captured on us territory in noncombat circumstances to be enem combatants and place them under military jurisdiction16 the government granted padilla limited ri ght to meet with his attorney under government

supra note 8 while noting that specific procedure is required by law wh ite house counsel gonzales described the procedure as follows in any case where it appears that us citizen captured within the united states may be an qaeda operative and thus may qualify as an enemy combatant information on the individual is developed and numerous options are considered by the various relevant agencies the department of defense cia and doj including the potential for criminal prosecution detention as material witness and detention as an enemy combatant options often are narrowed by the type of information available and the best course of action in given case may be influenced by numerous factors including the assessment of the individuals threat potential and value as possible intelligence source when it appears that criminal prosecutio n and detention as material witness are on balance lessthanideal options as longterm solutions to the situation we may initiate some type of informal process to present to the appropriate decision makers the question whether an individual might qualify for designation as an enemy combatant but even this work is not actually commenced unless the office of legal counsel at the department of justice has tentatively advised based on oral briefings that the individual meets the legal standard for enemy combatant status 22 see ex parte quirin 317

prisoners of war are considered noncombatants and must be protected by the detaining power see id the term enemy combatant appears most frequently in the context of military rules of engagement which

suffering to that which can be justified by military necessity to limit exposure of civilians to military attacks combatants are required as general rule to distinguish themselves from civilians combatants who fail to distinguish themselves from civilians run the risk of being denied the privilege to be treated as prisoners of war if captured by the enemy the treatment of all persons who fall into the hands of the enemy during an international armed conflic t depends upon the status of the person as determined under the four geneva conven tions of 1949 under these conventions parties to an armed conflict have the right to capture and intern enemy soldiers28 as well as civilians who pose danger to the security of the state29 at least for the duration of hostilities30 the right to detain

court declined to review the determination by th alien enemy hearing board that the petitioner was dangerous and noted that question as to the validity of the administrative hearings had been raised

treatment of battlefield detainees in the war on terrorism crs report rl31367 the question appears to turn on wh ether the label unlawful combatant may be applied across the board to all members of belligerent group or whether it applies only on an individual basis to those who participat unlawfully in combat it would seem that denying belligerent status to all members of gr oup amounts to denying the group as whole belligerent status in which case it would not be possible to engage in armed conflict with it as one observer comments according to their terms the geneva conventions apply symmetrically that is to say they are either applicable to both sides in conflict or to neither therefore the white house statement that the geneva conventions do not extend to qaeda is effectively declaration that the entire military campaign against terrorism is not covered by the geneva conventions see dworkin supra note 1of war encourages capture and detention of enemy combatants as more humane alternative to accomplish the same purpos than by wounding or killing them enemy civilians may be interned for similar reasons although the law of war does not permit them to be treated as lawful military targets as citizens of an enemy country they may be presumed to owe allegiance to the enemy the law of war traditionally allowed for their internment and the confiscation of their property not because they are suspected of having co mmitted crime or even of harboring ill will toward the host or occupying power but rather they are held in order to prevent their acting on behalf

not punitive in nature35 us precedent for detention of citizens as enemy combatants the department of justice reads the hamdi decision as supporting its reliance primarily on two cases to support its cont ention that the constitution permits the detention without criminal charge of amer ican citizens under cer tain circumstances the government argues that th 1942 supreme court decision in ex parte quirin the german saboteurs case and the 9th circuit case in re territo read together permit the government to hold american citizens as enemy combatants regardless of their membership in any legitima military organization ot hers however distinguish those cases as dealing with occurrences during war declared by congress and involving members of the armed forces of hostile enemy states and further argue that the civil war case ex parte milligan forecloses this theory ex parte quirin after eight nazi saboteurs were caught by the federal bureau of investigation fbi the president issued proclamation declaring that the safety of the united states demands that all emies who have tered upon the territory of the united states as part of an invasi on or predatory incursion or who have

citizenship were tried by military commission for entering the united states by submarine shedding their military uniforms and conspiring to use explosives on certain war industries and war utilities in the case of ex parte quirin the supreme court denied their writs of habeas corpus although upholding their right to petition for the writ despite language in the presidential proclamation purporting to bar judicial review holding that trial by such commission did not offend the constitution and was authorized by statute37 it also found the citizenship of the saboteurs irrelevant to the

to the jurisdiction of military tribunals40 whether the accused could have been tained as enemy combatants without any intent to try them before military tr ibunal was not question before the court41 but the court suggested the possibility it stated by universal agreement and practice the law of war draws distinction between the armed forces and the peaceful popul ations of belligerent nations and also between those who are lawful and unlawfu l combatants lawful combatants are subject to capture and detention as prisoners of war by opposing military forces unlawful combatants are likewise subject to capture and detention but in addition they are subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals for acts which render their belligerency unlawful42 in its discussion of the status of unlawful combatant the court did not distinguish between enemy soldiers who forfeit the right to be treated as prisoners of war by failing to distinguish themselves as belligerents as the petitioners

treatment of members of enemy forces under the law of war neither case addresses the constitutionality of the process used to determine who is member of an enemy force and whether detainee qualifies

seem to apply to neither qaeda nor the taliban for the same reasons that have been given to preclude their treatment as prisoners of war55 it may be argued that qaeda is not directly subject to the

cannot arise from threatened invasion the necessity must be actual and present the invasion real such as effectively closes the courts and deposes the civil administration60 the government had argued in the alternative that milligan could be held as prisoner of war as if he had been ta ken in action with arms in his hands61 and thus excluded from the privileges of statute re quiring courts to free persons detained without charge the government argued finally if the military tribunal has jurisdiction the petitioner may be held as prisoner of war aiding with arms th enemies of the united states and held under the authority of the united states until the war terminates then to be handed over by the military to the civil authorities to be tried for his crimes under the acts of congress and

today in that case the court made repeated reference to the fact that its inquiry into whether the military tribunal had jurisdiction to try and punish milligan rned in large part on the fact that milligan was not prisoner of war but resident of indiana arrested while at home there that fact was central to its conclusion had milligan been captured while he was assisting confederate soldiers by carrying rifle against union troops on confederate battlefield the holding of the court might well have been different the courts repeated explanations that milligan was not prisoner of war suggest that had these different circumstances been present he could have been detained under military au thority for the duration of the conflict whether or not he was citizen70 moyer v peabody the

the insurrec tion off the governor is the final judge and cannot be subjected to an action afte r he is out of office on the ground that he had not reasonable ground for his belief74 the court based its views in part on the laws and constitution of the state of colorado which empowered the governor to repel or suppress insurrections by calling out the militia which the court noted envisioned the ordinary use of soldiers to that end that he may kill persons who resist and of course that he may use the milder meas ure of seizing the bodies of those whom he considers to stand in the way of restoring peace such arrests are not necessarily for punishment but are by wa of precaution to prevent the exercise of hostile power75 the court further clarified if we suppose governor with very long term of office it may be that case could be imagined in which the length of the imprisonment would raise different question but there is nothing in the duration of the plaintiffs detention or in the

evacuation from the west coast of persons of japanese descent citizens as well as aliens followed which soon transformed into system of compulsive internment at relocation centers117 persons of german and italian descent and others we re treated more selectivel receiving prompt though probably not full and fair loyalty hearings118 to determine whether they should be interned paroled or release d the disparity of treatment was explained by the theory that it would be impossible or too timeconsuming to attempt to distinguish the loyal from the disloyal among persons of japanese descent119 in series of cases the supreme court limited but did not explicitly strike down the internment program in the hirabayashi case the supreme court found the curfew imposed upon persons of japanese ancestry to be constitutional as valid wartime security measure even as implemented against us citizens emphasizing the importance of congressional ra tification of the executive order120 hirabayashi was also indicted for viola ting an order excluding him from virtually the entire west coast but the court did not review the constitutionality of the exclusion measure because the sentences for the two charges were to run concurrently121 because the restrictions affected citizens solely becau of their japanese descent the court framed the relevant inquiry as question of equal protection asking whether in the light of all the facts nd circumstances there was any substantial basis for the conclusion in which congress and the military commander united that the curfew as applied was protective

restrictions even if it were to turn out that only small percentage of japaneseameri cans were actually disloyal123 however he noted that more serious question would arise if c itizen did not have an opportunity at some point to demonstrate his loyalty in order to be reclassified and longer subject to the restrictions124 in korematsu 125 the supreme court upheld th conviction of an american citizen for remaining in his home despite the fact that it was located on newly declared military area and was thus off limits to persons of japanese descent fred korematsu also challenged the detention of japaneseamericans in internment camps but the court declined to consider the constitutionality of the detention itself as korematsus conviction was for violating the exclusion order only the court in effect validated the treatment of citizens in manner similar to that of enemy aliens by reading executive order 9066 together with the act of congress ratifying it as sufficient authority under the combined wa r powers of the president and congress thus avoiding having to address the st atutory scope of the alien enemy act in ex parte endo 126 however decided the same day as korematsu the supreme court did not find adequate statutory unde rpinnings to support the internment of loyal citizens the court ruled that the authority to exclude persons of japanese ancestry from declared military areas did not encompass the authority to detain concededly loyal americans such aut hority it found could not be implied from the power to protect against espionage and sabotage during wartime127 the court declined to decide the constitutional issue presented by the evacuation and internment program instead interpreting the executive order along with the act of march 27 1942 congressional ratifi cation of the order128 narrowly to give it the greatest chance of surviving constitutional review129 accordingly the court noted that detention in relocation cent ers was not mentioned in the statute or executive order but was developed during the implementation of the program as such the authority to detain citizens could onl be found by implication in the act and must therefore be found to serve the ends congress and th president had intended to reach since the detention of loyal citizen did not further the campaign against espionage and sabotage it could not be

emergency detention act in toto in 1971 and enacted in its place prohibition on the detention of american citizens except pursuant to an act of congress173 the new language was in tended to prevent return to the pre1950 state of affairs in which citizens might be subject to arbitrary executive authority without prior congressional action174 executive order 9066 was formally rescinded in 1976175 congress repealed 18 usc 1383 later that year176 it may be argued that congress in passing the emergency detention act in 1950 was legislating based on its constitutional war powers to provide for the preventive detention during national security emergenc ies of those who might be expected to act as emy agents though not technically within the definition of alien enemies it does not therefore appear that congress contemplated that the president already had the constitutional power to declare such individuals to be enemy combatants subject to detenti on under the law of war except under very narrow circumstances the much earlier legislative history accompanying the passage of the alien enemy act may also be interpreted to suggest that the internment of enemy spies and saboteurs in

war prisoner or claim that his rights under the 1929 geneva convention had been violated hamdi however reportedly cl aimed that he is not member of qaeda or the taliban and was present in afghanistan only to provide humanitarian assistance180 the fourth circuit agreed that it has long been established that if hamdi is indeed an enemy combatant who was captured during hostilities in afghanistan the governments present detenti on of him is lawful one181 the fourth circuit ordered the district judge to dismiss the petition holding essentially that determination by the military that an individual is an enemy combatant is conclusive so long as it is supported by some evidence182 in the first interlocutory appeal the fourth circuit vacated district court order that the prisoner be provided immediate unmonitored access to an attorney urging the district court to show deference to the government in its examination of the issue but expressly declining to embrace th sweeping proposition that with meaningful judicial review any american citizen alleged to be an enemy combatant could be detained indefinite ly without charges or counsel on the governments say so183 on remand the district court ordered the government to provide additional information to support its conclusion that hamdi is an enemy combatant184 the court found the petitioner to be entitled to due process of law under the fifth amendment and expressed the intent to inquire into the authority of the person making the determination of hamdis status whether the screening criteria used to determine such status meet due process requirements the national security aims served by his continued tention and whether the rele vant military regulations and international law require different procedure185

would necessitate the evidentiary hearing or dered by the district court which could also involve significant inte rference with the war effort 188 the court also disposed of the legal arguments put

with crime or determined to be material witness padillas attorneys had based their argument on the dissenting opinion of four supreme court justices who would have found padillas detention barred by the nondetention act and the language in hamdi seemingly limiting the scope of authorization to combatants captured in afghanistan the government argued that padillas detention is covered under the

would be necessary and that the aumf contains such authority since petitioners alleged terrorist plan s were thwarted when he was arrested on the material witness warrant the cour t finds that the presidents subsequent decision to detain petitioner as an emy combatant was neither necessary nor appropriate204 accordingly the court found that padilla s detention is barred by 18 usc 4001a the government further argued that even if congress had not intended to permit the capture and detention of persons outside of the battlefield the presidents interpretation and application of the aumf is entitled to great deference because he was operating under broad grant of author ity from congress in an area where he possesses independent constitutional authority205 the court was not persuaded certainly respondent does not intend to argue here that just because the president states that petitioners detenti on is consistent with the laws of the united states including the authorization for use of military force that makes it so not only is such statement in direct contravention to the well settled separation of powers doctrine it is simply not the law moreover such statement is deeply troubling if such position were ever adopted by the courts it would totally eviscerate the limits pl aced on presidential authority to protect the citizenrys individual liberties206 the court disagreed that the president has inherent author ity as commanderin chief of the armed forces to dete rmine wartime measures quoting the hamdi court that where the exercise of commanderinchief powers matter how well intentioned is challenged on the ground th at it collides with the powers assigned by the constitution to congress fundamental role exists for the courts207 the government has appealed

interpret quirin to establish legal standard for designating persons as enemy combatants see gonzales supra note 8 at 8 the legal standard for determining enemy combatant status was articulated by the supreme court in quirin where the court made clear that at minimum citizens who associate themselves with the military arm of the enemy government and with its aid guidance and direction enter this country bent on hostile acts are enemy belligerents within the meaning of the law of war and thus may be detained the important factor therefore is that the person has become member or associated himself with hostile enemy forces thereby attaining the status of enemy combatantthe facts behind ex parte quirin federal judge in the second circuit had agreed with this argument finding that the allegation that padilla traveled to the united states to detonate dirty bomb on behalf of qaeda if true would validate the governments authority to tain him under military custody208 the petitioner argued that quirin is inapposite given that the ei ght saboteurs in 1942 were charged and tried by military commissi on and were given access to an attorney the court of appeals for the second circuit agreed with the petitioner reversing the district courts finding209 the district court in the fourth circuit followed the second circuit opinion padillas attorneys argue that the case bears closer resemblance to the civil war case ex parte milligan210 than to either the quirin or territo cases the government argues that milligan is inapposite to the petition of padilla on the grounds that padilla like petitioners in quirin is belligerent associated with the enemy who sought to enter the united states during wartime in an effort to aid the enemys commission of hostile acts and who therefore is subject to the laws of war211 this presumably is to be contrasted with the case of milligan who was civilian and had never traveled outside th state of indiana the government does not allege that padilla entered the country illegally or landed as part of military offensive212 in quirin the petitioners were members of the german armed forces and admitted to having entered the country surreptitiously by way of german naval submarine the governments argument appears to presume that there is relevant difference between the landing of the german saboteurs and padillas entry into the united states by means of commercial flight neither under disguise nor using false identification213 under this theory the relevant factor would appear to be whether the petitioner had ever left the country and traveled to enemy territory regardless of how he reentered the country httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31724crs39 214 entering the country through coastal defe nses was an explicit

by means of enemy vessels that would ve been lawful targets had the navy or coast guard identified them as such was major determinant of the petitioners status as enemy combatants214 had they entered the c ountry openly and lawfully they might not have lost their right to be treated as prisoners of war padillas arrival by apparently lawful means arguably s bearing on whether he is subject to military jurisdiction the government disputes padillas claim that the laws of war do not apply to qaeda and thus could never apply to him the government finds support for the opposite claim in the aumf and the prize cases 215 because the president has by executive order recognized state of wa r against qaeda the government argues the laws of war must apply and anyone associated with qaeda may therefore properly be deemed to be an enemy belligerent however it is not clear that qaeda is belligerent under the law of war because such status would ordinarily imply belligerent rights that the administration has been unwilling to concede the government argues that milligan is inapposite whereas milligan was not engaged in legal acts of hostility against th government the president determined that padilla engaged in hostile and warlike acts216 however the quoted language from ex parte quirin may be somewhat misleading inasmuch as milligan was indeed alleged to have engaged in hostile and warlike acts but these were not legal acts of hostility because milligan was not lawful combatant thus whether milligan applies may depend on the emphasis placed on the legality of the acts of hostility of which milligan was accused rath er than whether milligan was engaged in acts of hostility at all the milligan opinion seems to view the nature of the legality of the acts to be based on milligans legitimacy as belligerent rather than the nature of the acts it may be argued that padilla like milligan was not engaged in legal acts of hostility because he is not lawful belligerent milligans membership in the sons of liberty did not secure his legitimacy as belligerent but neither did it give the government the ri ght to detain him as prisoner of war217

milligan is inapposite in this case because milligan not being part of or associated with armed forces of the enemy could not be held as belligerent while padilla in contrast is alleged to be associated with the armed forces of the enemy however it might be recalled that the government had argued that milligan was allegedly associated with the confederate army recognized belligerent and that he was in effect accused of acting as an unlawful belligerent218 therefore it may be argued that the important distinction in quirin was the nature and status of the enemy fo rces with whom he was associated rather than whether he was associated with hostile force at all the petitioners in quirin were all conceded to be working for the ar med forces of an enemy state in declared war what association with the enemy short of membership in its armed forces might have brought the saboteurs under military jurisdiction is unclear the continuing validity of milligan has been questioned by some scholars even though the quirin court declined to overrule it while others assert that the essential meaning of the case has only to do with situ ations of martial w or perhaps civil wars furthermore it has been noted that the portion of the plurality in milligan asserting that congress could not constitutionally authorize the president to use the military to detain and try civilians may be considered dicta with correspondingly less precedential value inasmuch as congre ss had implicitly denied such authority however the hamdi court in distinguishing milligan from hamdi placed emphasis on the fact that milligan was not considered prisoner of war suggesting that it may recognize the distinction between milligan and quirin as function of combatant status legal authority to detain enemy combatants the law of war permits belligerents to seize the bodies and property of enemy aliens219 the administration has taken the view that the authority to detain enemy combatants

constitutional 1 when the president acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of congress his authority is at its maximu m for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that congress can delegate seizure executed by the president pursuant to an act of congre ss would be supported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation and the burden of persuasion would rest heavily upon any who might attack it 2 when the president acts in absence of either congressional grant or denial of authority he can only rely upon his ow n independent powers but there is zone of twilight in which he and congress may have concurrent authority or in which its distribution is uncertain ther efore congressional inertia indifference or quiescence may sometimes at least as practical matter enable if not invite measures on independent presidential responsibility in this area any actual test of power is likely to depend on the imperatives of events and contemporary imponderables rather than on abstract theories of law 3 when the president takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of congress his power is at its lowest ebb for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of congress over the matter courts can sustain excl usive presidential control in such

padilla and hamdi and their supporters generally argue that such constitutional authority if it exists is dependant upon specific aut horization by congress which they argue is missing or even explicitly denied pursuant to 18 usc 4001a in the present circumstances placing the c ontroversy into the second or third category above the government on the other hand sees the issue as one that falls squarely into the first category asserting that congressional aut hority for the detentions clearly exists although such authority is not strictly necessary congressional authority the government argues may be found in the authorization to use force225 and provision of title 10 usc authorizing paym ent for expenses related to detention of prisoners of war accordingly the following sections examine the constitutional authority to take prisoners in war and if congressional au thority is required whether congress has provided it or with respect to us citizens prohibited it the

does not require declaration of war237 it should be noted that these offenses are associated w ith conduct on the battlefield the government notes that its military practice has long been to detain enemy combatants in conflicts where war was not formally declared and congress did not expressly authorize the capture of enemies however we are not aware of any modern court ruling as to whether and unde r what circumstances citizens may be held as enemy combatants where formal declaration of war has been enacted hamdi confirms that the authorization to employ ground troops against an enemy army necessarily encompasse s the authority to capture battlefield enemies because it is an essential aspect of fighting battle international law does not permit the intentional killing of civilians or soldiers who are hors combat preferring capture as the method of neutralizin g enemies on the battlefield238 however the war powers involving conduct off the battlefield such as those authorizing the detention of alien enemies or regulating commerce with the enemy are not necessarily vital aspect of the use of the military and have traditionally been subject to legislation and not implied by circumstance for example the supreme court held that the president has implied authority to promulgate regulations permitting the capture of enemy property during hostilities short of declared war even where congress had authorized limited war239 it may be argued that because the internment of enemy aliens as potential spies and saboteurs pursuant to the alien enemy act240 requires declaration of war or presidential proclama tion it would seem reasonable to infer that the express permission of congress is necessary for other forms of military detention of non military persons within the united states especially those who are us citizens241 to conclude otherwise would appear to re quire an assumption that congress intended in this instance to authorize the presiden t to detain american citizens under fewer restrictions than apply in the case of enemy aliens during declared war242 however it might also be argued that the united states is battlefield in the war against

this view the united stat is under actual and continuing enemy attack and congress legated to the president the authority to declare those persons he determined to be subject to the aumf to be wartime enemies the us military would be authorized to use force to kill or capture persons it identifies as enemy combatants even within the united states243 however those seeking less expansive interpretation of the aumf might argue that it must be read if possible to conform to internationa l law and the constitution under this view for example it might be questioned whether those sources

but has long been in cluded in appropriations bills for the department of defense it first appeared in the third supplemental national defense appropriation act of 1942247 when the army requested an addition to the defense appropriations bill to provide the authority for the secretary of war to utilize any appropriation available fo r the military establishment under such regulation as the secretary of war may pres cribe for all expenses incident to the maintenance pay and allowances of pr isoners of war other persons in army custody whose status is determined by the secretary of war to be similar to prisoners of war and persons detained in army custody pursuant to presidential proclamation248 it was explained that the expenses were in connection with keeping and maintaining prisoners of war and others in military custody not provided for by any appropriation the example given was the c onstruction of stockade authorized to be built in honolulu and water supply for prisoners on oahu249 the following colloquy took place during senate debate on the bill mr danaher mr president will the senato r from tennessee permit to invite his attention to page 9 of the bill

allowances of prisoners of war and notably other persons in army custody whose status is determined by the secretary of war to be similar to prisoners of war that is new language apparently and i should like to have the senator explain what other class of pers ons there may be in army custody whose status is similar to that of prisoners of war mr mckellar enemies w ho are found in this country

doubt that it is necessary is there existing law under which they are at present being taken up by the army mr mckellar the army did not want to take chance about it mr danaher is ther an existing law under which such persons are today being taken up by the army and being held as prisoners mr mckellar the advice to the committee was that there is not and in order to make it absolutely sure the

taken up if there be such authority anywhere then i think we should very promptly and properly direct our attention to such field we certainly are not going to authorize it mere ly by providing in an appropriation bill for an allotment of money to be paid after they are taken up mr mckellar the senator misunderstands the appropriation is not to pay for their being taken up but it is to maintain them and to keep them safely after they are taken up by whatever authority that this appropriation is recommended mr danaher the senator feels he is qu ite correct in saying that up to now there is authorization provided by statute for their being taken up by the army mr mckellar there is authorization for taking care of them and feeding them and imprisoning them and place to imprison them as i understand mr danaher i thank the senator250 prior to the amendment coming up for vot senator danaher took the occasion to look up which sections of law provided author ity for the army to detain persons and concluded the authority was to be found in the alien enemy act 50 usc 21 which he read into the record in its entirety and explained i understand that since the first of the week the president has in fact issued proclamations under the authority of the s ection just quoted and that so much of this section as applies to prisoners of war and those whom the secretary of war may deem to be similar in status to pris oners of war is comprehended within the terms of the proclamations that are app licable outside the immediate territorial limits of the united states in view of the fact that that important section does implement both the statute and the procla mations issued pursuant thereto i feel that it is important that the record should show what the situation is251 the amendment was agreed to similar language has appeared in subsequent defense appropriations until 1983 when it was added to title 10 as note to section 138252 and then codified in 1984 in its present form253 the senate debate did not question the presidents authority to detain prisoners of war despite the absence of express statutory authority but only questione d the meaning of other persons similar to prisoners of war the legislative hist ory could be interprete d to demonstrate that the language was meant only to pay for the exercise of authority found elsewhere in particular the provisions of 50 usc 21 it is unlikely that 10 usc 9565 would be interpreted as amending 50 usc 21 with respect to the requirement for declared war or presidential proclama tion as an appropriations

that statutory support for the detention of u s citizens as enemy combatants can be found they cite 18 usc 4001a which provides citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the united states except pursuant to an act of congress this language originated with the repeal of the emergency detention act256 in 1971 the legislative history demonstrates that congress intended to prevent recurrence of internments in detention camps such as those that had occurred during the second world war with respect to japaneseamericans257 the language imprisoned or otherwise detained in 18 usc 4001a has been construed literally by the supreme court to proscribe detention of any kind by the united states absent congressional grant of authority to detain258 the four justices of the hamdi plurality and presumably justice thomas in his dissent agreed that it does not prohibit detention pursuant to the law of wa r justices souter and ginsburg agreed with that as general principle but

the opposite view further it notes that 18 usc 4001b refers to federal penal and correctional institutions except for military or naval institutions and thus concludes that 4001a likewise refers onl to federal penitentiaries260 the fourth circuit previously found in hamdi iii that 4001a was not intended to apply to enemy combatants since there was evidence in the legislative record that congress had intended to overturn the longstanding rule that an armed and hostile american citizen captured on the battlefield during wartime may be treated like the enemy combatant that he is261 the fourth

intelligence or military efforts to gather unimpeded vital information from the detainee and otherwise to protect national security interests 89 further the bill would find that the executive must be

before article iii courts the condition might arguably be satisfied by trial by military commission or some other administrative tribunal264 the president would also have to certify that detention is

pursuant to the authority of the act it is unclear who would be subject to the provisions of hr 1076 but not detained pursuant to them perhaps the phrase subject to the act is meant to cover those who

also includes separate subsecti on that defines us person or resident to include an alien lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence it is unclear whether this language is intended to cove r broader category of persons than the definition already referenced in subsection 1 it appears that hr 1076 would not reach aliens lawfully admitted to the unite d states on temporary basis or who are awaiting final approval of their applications for permanent residence nor would it reach aliens present in the united states unlawfully this omission could be read either to imply that the president has th inherent authority under the constitution to detain persons not covered under the definition in secti on 7 or unless congress has provided such authority elsewhere it could be read to preclude the detention of such persons as enemy combatants section 8 termination of authority section 8 is sunset provision terminating the above authority as of december 31 2007 the authority would effectively terminate earlier if the armed c onflict with qaeda were to end prior to that date possible legal issues petitioners on behalf of us citizens held in military custody argue that 18 usc 4001a which prohibits the deten tion of us citizens except as authorized by an act of congress prohibits the militarys detention of us citizens as enemy combatants while hr 1076 would appear to resolve the question of whether statutory law prohibits the detention of us citizens as enemy combatants it leaves open some legal questions pertaining to the detention of persons as enemy combatants that may arise under the constitution and inte rnational law some constitutional questions the supreme court has never expressly upheld the administrative detention or in ternment of us citizens and nonalien enemies during war as preventive measure congressional authority i n ex parte milligan 265 the supreme court invalidated military detention and sentence of civilian for violations of the law of war despite accusations that milligan conspired and committed hostile acts against the united states266 plurality of the milligan court agreed that congress was not empowered to authorize the president to assert military jurisdiction in areas not subject to martial law but scholars disagr ee as to whether that portion of the opinion is binding as law or is merely dicta the administration may take the view that only the president and not congress has the constitutional authority to detain enemy combatants but it appears from the historical survey above that the contention lacks any

passed the emergency detention act eda269 which authorized the president to declare an internal security emergency during which the president could authorize the apprehension and detention of any person deemed reasonably likely to engage in acts of espionage or sabotage however this authority was never exercised and the eda was repealed without any court having had the opport unity to evaluate its constitutionality270 hr 1076 would guarantee access to counsel and the right to challenge detention by petitioning for writ of habeas corpus but gives the executive little other guidance as to what due process the act requires bill of attainder hr 1076 may be subject to criticism for possibly violating the constitutional prohibition of bills of attainder271 the constitution prohibits congress from enacting legislation to punish specific persons or easily identifiable groups of persons272 section 3 of hr 1076 would au thorize the president to detain persons based on their membership in qaeda or knowing cooperation with member of qaeda although the stated purpose for the detention appears to be preventive rather than punitive the nature of the restraint and the

coopera tion with terrorists that took place prior to the enactment of the act such detainee might challenge the act as imposing new burdens for past conduct in violation of the ex post facto c l u s f t h constitution however detention under the act could continue only for so long as an investigation with view toward prosecution prosecution or posttrial proceeding with respect to particular detainee were ongoing and only if the president certifies that detention is warranted to prevent further acts of terrorism in which case detention could be permissible under ordinary penal statutes the legality of the detention will likely depend on the extent to which the procedures put in place by the executive satisfy the constitutional requirements for temporary deprivation of liberty due process for nonresident aliens hr 1076 does not apply to non resident aliens and other noncitizens not lawfully admitte d for permanent residence in the united states although hamdi may be read to

declare war 41 d uke lj 27 1991 declarations of war and authorizations for the use of m ilitary force historical background and legal implications crs report rl31133conclusion it appears likely that the supreme court has not issued its last word on enemy combatants and executive detention as means to prosecute the war on terrorism287 lower courts that have ddressed questions the suprem court left unanswered have not achieved consensus although it app ears that the trend does not favor the expansive view of executive power urged by the government as consequence the extent to which the congress has authorized the detention without trial of american citizens as enemy combatants will likely remain an important issue for determining the validity of the administrations tac tics while the broa d language of the authorization for the use of military force aumf288 authorizes the use of such military force as the president deems appropriate in order to prevent future acts of terrorism it remains possible to argue that the aumf was not intended to authorize the president to assert all of the war powers usually rese rved for formal declarations of war289 history shows that even during declared wars additional stat utory authority has been seen as necessary to validate the detention of citizens not members of any armed forces courts however have not explicitly ruled on the point with respect to circumstances like these congressional activity since the quirin decision suggests that congress did not interpret quirin as significant departure from prior practice with regard to restriction of civil liberties during war if that is the case it may be that congress intended to authorize the capture and detention of individuals like hamdi persons captured on the battlefield during actual hostilities for so long as military operations remain necessary while withholding the authority to detain individuals like padilla an accused emy agent operating domestically except in accordance with regular due process of w if congress were to pass legislation authorizing the detention of persons as emy combatants future detentions wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31724crs58 290 see padilla 352 f3d at 699 as this court sits only short distance from where the world trade center once stood we are as keenly aware as anyone of the threat qaeda poses to our country and of the responsibilities the president and law enforcement officials bear for protecting the nation but pres idential authority does not exist in vacuum and this case involves not whether those responsibilities should be aggressively pursued but whether the president is obligated in the circumstances presented here to share them with congresslikely face fewer hurdles in court290 however even with the express authorization of congress constitutional due process issues seem likely to arise
