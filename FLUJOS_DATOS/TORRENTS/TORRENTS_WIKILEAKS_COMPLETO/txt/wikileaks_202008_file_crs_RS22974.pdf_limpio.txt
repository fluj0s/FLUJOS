commission sec recently released proposed rule that would effectively reclassify equity indexed annuities as security product in addition to being an insurance product since insurance products are solely regulated by the states rather than by the sec this proposed rule would expand sec authority over these annuities the sec cited numerous problems with improper marketing and sales of these annuity products as primary reason for increased sec oversight this proposal has been controversial with more than 1000 public comments made to the sec before the initial comment period closed on september 10 2008 on october 17 2008 the sec published notice in the federal register that they reopened the comment period until november 17 2008 this report presents the different types of annuities

form an annuity can be thought of as the opposite of life insurance in basic life insurance contract person pays an insurer small sum for many years and then upon the insureds death large payment is made to beneficiary in the simplest form of annuity large sum is paid to the insurer and then smaller sum is paid out to the insured over his or her lifetime more formally an annuity can be defined as contract that provides an income for specified period of time such as number of years or for life 2 as with life insurance annuities can be more complex with insurers offering wide variety of both insurance and investment features in the annuity contracts that they sell annuities can be classified as follows immediate versus deferred under an immediate annuity an individual pays an insurance company sum of money and the insurance company begins making regular monthly payments to the individual immediately under deferred annuity an individual pays the insurance company sum of money and the insurance company begins making regular monthly payments some time after purchase for example an individual at age 45 might buy 20year deferred annuity that would start making monthly payments when the individual reaches age 65 deferred annuities may also be funded over time with person making periodic payments into the annuity as they might with 401k account or other savings vehicle after this accumulation phase is finished the annuity would then make period payments based on the value of the final contributed amount fixed versus variable fixed annuity pays flat monthly amount for the life of the annuitant whereas variable annuity pays monthly payment amount tied to the performance of an investment portfolio containing assets such as corporate stocks or bonds under variable annuity the annuitant bears the risk that the monthly annuity payment could go down level payment versus graded payment in level payment annuity the monthly payments remain the same whereas in graded annuity the monthly payments increase each year the payments may increase at specified rate such as 2 per year or may increase at the rate of inflation singlelife versus jointandsurvivor singlelife annuity makes regular monthly payments for the life of one person jointandsurvivor annuity makes regular monthly payments for the lives of two people the primary annuitant and secondary annuitant typically the spouse of the primary annuitant as noted above annuities can be complex products and insurers have introduced many different annuity variations significant and relatively new hybrid type of annuity is called an indexed 1 this section is based on crs report rs22439 the market for retirement annuities by neela k ranade 2 vaughn emmett j and therese vaughn fundamentals of risk and insurance 9th ed

of fixed and variable annuities in an equity indexed annuity the annuity payment is based on the rate of return of stock index in addition the insurer offers minimum return provision such as 3 that limits the downside risk to the purchaser g22g138g161g561g22g155g142g138g157g150g142g151g157g561g152g143g561g3g151g151g158g146g157g146g142g156g561 one of the primary advantages of annuities compared to other financial products such as mutual funds or certificates of deposit is the deferral of tax on the investment earnings of the annuity contract these earnings are taxed only when the annuitant actually receives the annuity payments according to formulas specified in the law and irs regulations internal revenue code section 72 provides that the taxable income from an annuity contract in given year is the total amount received under the contract that year less that years prorated share of the cost of or investment in the contract this allows the investment income to compound taxfree for potentially several years before any tax is due the tax due on annuity investment income however is calculated at ordinary income rates as with interest from savings accounts and certificates of deposits rather than at the reduced rates that currently apply to capital gains and dividends ordinary income tax rates are as high as 35 while most longterm capital gains and dividends end up being taxed at 15 although capital gains rates can be as low as 0 3 this potentially higher tax rate for annuity investment income can have significant impact on the economic rationale for consumer purchasing an annuity and thus makes the annuity market and the insurers offering annuities very sensitive to tax proposals that might change rates on investment income

the 1945 mccarranferguson act which identifies the states as the primary regulators of insurance this state oversight generally includes regulation of insurer solvency regulation of the content of insurance products and regulation of the market conduct of insurers and those selling insurance products annuities particularly variable annuities have attracted attention for allegedly abusive sales tactics the national association of insurance commissioners naic has responded to the abuses with buyers guide for prospective purchasers of annuities and model laws on annuity suitability and annuity disclosure naic model laws however must be enacted by the individual states before having any effect according to the naic 33 states have enacted the naic model law on annuity suitability and 22 have

securities products are generally regulated at the federal level primarily by the securities and exchange commission sec sec securities regulation is typically less extensive than state insurance

required to be members of the financial industry regulatory authority finra nongovernmental selfregulatory organization for the securities industry much of the direct oversight of securities dealers occurs through finra rather than through the sec though the sec retains authority over finra and may require it to adopt or not adopt certain policies or rules there is little sec oversight equivalent to state solvency requirements for insurers federal securities regulations only apply to those financial products that are considered securities under the federal securities laws for number of years after the introduction of the variable annuity some controversy existed as to whether or not these products are securities the supreme court decided that variable annuities should be considered securities under federal law 6 following this decision variable annuities are generally subject to sec and finra requirements while other types of annuities are not

annuities7 these annuities as mentioned bove are relatively new type of product combining features of variable annuities and fixed annuities typically an equity indexed annuity will base the returns from the annuity on the returns from basket of publicly traded stocks combined with guarantee of minimum returns up to this point these annuities have generally been treated purely as insurance products and thus have not been subject to sec regulation the proposed rule would change the definition of an annuity contract such that many if not most of the sales practices of those selling equity indexed annuities would be regulated by the sec as well as by state insurance commissioners specifically the proposed rule 151a would remove an annuity contract from the insurance exemption in the securities act of 1933 if the amounts payable by the insurer under the contract are more likely than not to exceed the amounts guaranteed under the contract 8 the same proposal would also add rule 12h7 which would exempt stateregulated insurance companies from the requirements under the securities exchange 5 see crs report rl33235 banking and securities regulation and agency enforcement

comment period for this rule ended on september 10 2008 on october 10 2008 the sec released proposed rule reopening the comment period for an additional 30 days the effective date of the rule would be 12 months after the rule is finalized in proposing the rule the sec cited the need to protect investors particularly older investors from fraudulent and abusive practices related to the sale of equity indexed annuities annuity sales practices have drawn complaints from consumers and various regulatory actions from state regulators and the secfinra over many years annuity products especially variable annuities and equity indexed annuities are frequently very complicated such complexity can make it possible for unscrupulous sellers to take advantage of lesssophisticated buyers while high commissions on some annuities may give sellers substantial financial incentive to sell these products the alleged sales abuses seem to particularly concern older consumers for example joint investor alert by the sec finra and the north american securities administrators association nasaa cites variable annuities as one of number of products that are commonly used to defraud senior citizens 9

large majority of them being either opposed to its adoption or requesting an extension of the time limit for filing comments10 two complaints frequently made by those opposed to rule are 1 equity indexed annuities fundamentally are not securities and thus should not be regulated as such and 2 state regulation of insurance products is superior to sec regulation of securities products so the proposal would add layer of complexity and duplicative regulation for little benefit eighteen members of congress led by representative gregory meeks sent letter to the sec calling for an extension of the comment period for an additional 90 days the authors of this letter11 observed that the proposed rule would have significant impact imposing layer of federal regulation on top of state regulation and expressed concern that stakeholders including state insurance regulators and the insurance industry were not consulted in the development of the rule such concerns and the request for delay were echoed in letters from various state insurance regulators and state legislators as well as by individual comments made to the sec
