and right fueled by drug money in the context of the global war on terrorism and with the growing recognition of the relationship between drug tr afficking and the guerrilla insurgency proponents argue that colombia and its neighbors should be supported with c ounterna rcotics and counterterrorism assistance be fore the situation deterior ates further they favor expanding the scope of military assistance to strengthen the ability of colombian security forces to combat the leftist gu errillas and to expand their control throughout rural areas thereby undercutting the rati onale and support fo r paramilitary groups they also argue that guerrilla forces regularly cross borde rs using neighboring countries territory for refuge and s upplies and that th is has potentially destabilizing

exploration and transport colombia expor ted 256000 barrels per day of crude to the united states in 2002 which is approximately half of colombias output6 opponents of us policy argue that th counterdrug program uses repressive military approach to curbing drug produc tion which could provoke popular reaction in rural areas they argue for halting aerial fumigation of drug crops and aid to the colombian military believing that coca farm ers cannot be expected to abandon coca farming voluntarily until adequate economic alternatives are in place they fear that forcing such farmers to give up coca growing will only drive many to the ranks of the armed groups or to become displaced persons dependent on the state further they argue that any decreases in coca cultivation in colombia will be offset by increases in neighboring countries as was witne ssed in 2002 when reported acres of coca cultivation in peru and bolivia increased instead many urge that counternarcotics policy should stress interdiction rather than eradication so that the direct costs to peasant producers would be less some cr itics of us policy would support policy that focuses largely on economic and social aid

to ta p phones and search homes without warrants in all parts of the country at the end of 2004 the colombian congress passed legislation amending the constitution allowing for the consecutive

the inducement of amnesties or the possibility of paying reparations to victims instead of serving jail sentences paramilitary leaders and fighters will be unwilling to demobilize and spiral of violence will continue in colombia cr itics of the proposal include colombian legislators political commentators and international human rights organizations they argue that auc forces have been responsible for so of the worst violations of human rights including massacres of civilians and that the international covenant on civil and political rights to which colombia is party requires that states will ensure that violators are brought to justice other critics argue that the paramilitaries are not respecting the accord and are conti nuing military activities president uribes proposal would allow the president to termine which member s of illegal armed groups would qualify for suspended senten ces combatants who qualify would have to agree to disarm and to demonstrate support for the peace process combatants would also agree to make reparations of money or assets to victims directly or into government fund for victims the amnest process requires that fighters appear before
