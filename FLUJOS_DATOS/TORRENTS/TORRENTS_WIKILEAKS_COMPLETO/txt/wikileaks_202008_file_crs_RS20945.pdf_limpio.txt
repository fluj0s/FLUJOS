continue to be challenged by chronic budgetary weakness and concern by some member states that its activities could constitute intervention in their internal affairs it is nonetheless moving slowly to

fy1998 background founded in 1963 during the era of decolonization the organization of african unity oau has as its primary charter objective the promotion of unity and solidarity among african states the oau has served over the years as the primary forum for negotiating disputes among its 53 members1 and for forging common positions on african issues such as decolonization and apartheid the organization however has been widely seen as ineffective in addressing intra or interstate conflict among its members it has often been precluded from playing more active role in that area because the principles of national sovereignty and nonintervention in member states affairs written into its charter have been strictly interpreted by member governments so as to avoid any interference in disputes they considered internal the oaus supreme organ is the assembly of heads of state and government which meets annually taking decisions by consensus the assemblys work is supplemented by biannual meeting s of the foreign ministers plus several standing commissions but the organizations daytoday activities are carried out by general secretariat based in addis ababa the secretary general currently salim ahmed salimhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20945crs2 2 oau enhancing peace and security in africa the oaus program for strengtheni ng the conflict management center addis ababa

term expires in 2002 is the effective voice of the organization between assembly meetings but lacks substantive executive powers the oaus activities are hampered by perpetual lack of resources the operating budget has stagnated at about 30 million per year for some time and large number of members do not pay their annual assessments on timely basis if at all even though the voting rights of members have been suspended at times due to nonpayment the organization continues to suffer from budget shortfalls and arrears of almost 50 million objectives and priorities since the end of the cold war and the elimination of apartheid the oau has gradually directed its focus toward its second charter objective that of achieving better life for the peoples of africa it has developed priority agenda which encompasses regional socioeconomic cooperation integration and development democratization and good governance and the promotion of human rights and the rule of law within that very broad spectrum of possible activities the organization has chosen to concentrate its limited resources primarily on conflict prevention and resolution arguing that the socioeconomic agenda is not achievable without first reducing the scourge of local conflicts2 conflict avoidance and resolution the oau charter calls for the peaceful settlement of disputes between members originally it provided for commission of mediation conciliation and arbitration the commission was never effective hampered by the principle of nonintervention and ignored by member states it was eliminated in 1970 the conflict resolution role was assumed to the extent possible by the secretaries general facing the same constraints however they had to limit their role largely to ad hoc efforts to mediate existing conflicts or provide good offices for resolution clear successes were few mainly on border disputes3 moreover the failures of its two substantial interventions an oauorganized peacekeeping force sent to chad in 1982 and an underfunded military observer group sent to rwanda in 1991 to some degree inoculated the organization against an activist role in peacekeeping by the 1990s ussoviet competition in africa came to an end but crippling intra and interstate conflict on the continent persisted and even expanded consensus began to develop among african leaders that envisaged more dynamic oau role in conflict resolution goal championed by the then new secretary general salim salim prepared report for the 1992 assembly in which he proposed the abandonment of the strictly ad hoc approach to conflict management and the establishment of permanent and proactive body this body to be known as the mechanism for conflict prevention management and resolution was tasked primarily with conflict prevention in the following year andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20945crs3 4 d p project raf997028 in spite of member states concerns about its possible impingement on their sovereignty the assembly agreed to establish the mechanism the mechanism when the mechanism was established it was given the primary mission of conflict prevention this is both because that role was less threatening to the sovereignty of member states and because the organization did not have the managerial or financial capability to undertake peacekeeping operations the mechanism was provided with an executive council called the central organ and consisting of 15 member states which is elected annually and meets regularly at the level of ambassadors to the oau it also has permanent body the conflict management center or cmc set up within the political affairs division of the secretariat the cmc is designed to provide the secretary general and the central organ with early warning information analysis and options for action that would allow the oau to play an active role in conflict prevention management or even resolution it is financed through special peace fund to which 6 of the oaus annual budget is dedicated this fund can also receive voluntary donations from member states and other donors both within and outside of africa in setting up the mechanism the assembly provided capacity for creation of observer missions to areas of conflict but explicitly discouraged oau engagement in peacekeeping instead it encouraged recourse to the for such expensive and difficult operations the mechanism and the cmc have now been in operation for over 5 years and have had some limited successes but have suffered from the oaus lack of resources until 2000 the cmc operated with permanent staff of only 14 scarcely enough to perform its basic function of providing the secretary general with early warning information about potential conflicts much less their prevention although the permanent staff has since been increased to 23 in an effort to build up its early warning and analysis capability the cmc is still dependent on outside donors to flesh out its planned roster of almost fifty employees cooperation with the is substantial and growing with standing liaison arrangements with the department of peacekeeping operations providing for regular exchanges of information and the development program providing five staff members and other support to the cmc4 the european union also provides assistance the cmcs current objective is to build up an early warning capacity that would allow it to provide regular information and meaningful options to the secretary general for possible oau interventions in developing conflicts although its analytical and institutional capacity is being strengthened the cmc will still have to base its analyses on open source information or intelligence supplied by its member states potentia l weakness in the event that member states chose not to cooperate the cmc also plans to develop capacity to predict areas of potential conflict and to create models for conflict prevention on more immediately practical level it has begun in cooperation with the african chiefs of staff to develop logistical coordinatio n guidelines and standard operating procedures including rules of engagement to guide future field missions recent conflict management activities the oaus record since embarking on its more activist role has been mixed one the mechanism itself is very much work in progress underfunded and understaffed its specific achievements to date are generally seen as minimal two oau observer missions have been deployed under thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20945crs4 5 more specifically the intervention was carried out by the ecowas ceasefire monitoring group ecomog set up in 1990mechanismss auspices mission to burundi from 19931996 and one to the comoros in 19971999 both were modest successes and provided the mechanism with valuable experience for mounting and supporting such missions in the future even as the cmc has been building up its institutional capacity it has provided the secretary general with staff support for his own activist role moreover the regular meetings of the central organ from which emerge authoritative oau statements of position on african conflicts have served to acclimatize the member governments to more interventionist oau role while gradually building up his institutions capacity to play systemic role in managing future conflicts secretary general salim has continued to engage the oau in its traditional ad hoc efforts at mediation faced with plethora of regional conflicts and continued resistance by some member states to what they see as potentially interventionist oau role he has chosen his engagements carefully for example the oau has played role at all in the sudan conflict and has taken back seat in the angola and congo mediation efforts however salim has kept the organization active in the search for solutions in other areas through wellchosen special oau factfinding envoys or mediators for example to liberia guinea bissau sierra leone ethiopiaeritrea and the comoros his active liaison with the secretariat has facilitated the deployment of blue beret peacekeeping missions once the regional parties have reached agreement while his coordination with the african subregional organizations has ensured that they and the oau were working in concert on resolving regional conflicts however the only clear conflict management success that the oau has been able to record was its mediation effort between ethiopia and eritrea led by algerian president abdul aziz bouteflika and actively supported by the united states in the other conflicts on the continent the major role has been played by existing or adhoc subregional organizations the economic community of west african states ecowas in liberia and guinea bissau5 the intergovernmental authority on development igad in sudan and somalia members of the south african development committee sadc in lesotho the democratic republic of the congo and another adhoc grouping in angola the oau has welcomed the role and the resources of those organizations in managing or resolving current conflicts seeking to maintain its own broader policy role however the rapid growth of their experience and capacity may in time create problems of coordination for the more slowly developing oau mechanism humanitarian and economic activities the oaus mandate in the fields of economic and social development human rights and democratization is much larger than its capabili ty particularly financially of necessity therefore the organization has tended to draw up documents that affirm the need for common action but leave implementation to members and seek major financing from external sources case in point was the abuja declaration of april 2001 on the hivaids pandemic such approaches of course are not without effect as witnessed by the 1995 agenda for action which stimulated establishment of the uns special initiative for africa as new source of assistance both to member states and to the oauhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20945crs5 6 oau decision afgdec141 xxxv of the 35th assembly algiers 1999the new agenda for the resolution of internal conflict must include the funda mentals of governance for while classical negotiations can bring an end to internal hostilities it is only genuine political reform economic development and providing greater opportunity for all our people which will act as insurance against instability and conflict building democracy will require buildin g the institution s of democracy to oversee the political process secretary general salim salimthe oau has limited institutional capacity to deal with these issues at an operative level the member states concern for their sovereignty coupled with the organizations budgetary problems have hampered development of strong oau institutions an african economic community agreed to in 1994 is still awaiting ratification as is 1999 oau convention on prevention and combating terrorism convention on refugees dealing with treatment of refugees in camps has been approved but the commission on refugees returnees and displaced persons has only monitoring and coordination authority and small program budget similarly the limited staff of the commission on human and peoples rights established in 1986 has focused to date on building baseline of country studies from country submissions and the commission has made few if any recommendations to the assembly for action on specific human rights abuses in spite of these weaknesses the oau has gradually staked out new grounds for oversight if not intervention into its members internal affairs the 1995 plan of action for example dedicated some 29 of its 42 articles to issues of domestic prioritysetting or good governance the oau has also been active in promoting democratic elections sponsoring independent election commissions and sending out election observers on over fifty occasions and in an interesting but still untested new departure the assembly took decision in its 1999 algiers conference6 not to recognize any unconstitutional changes of government on the continent although guidelines and definitions to flesh out the decision remain to be worked out the oau has staked out through that step basic position against military coups in africa and has accepted the principle of sanctions against noncompliance us policy toward the oau until the 1990s the us paid minimal attention to the oau limiting contacts largely to liaison and information gathering performed by officers at the american embassy in addis ababa following the oaus shift toward more active approach to conflict management issues however it has drawn more favorable attention from the us government and even as in its horn of africa mediation effort active us support and collaboration in 1992 presidential determination made the organization eligible for american assistance in 1994 the us began to support the oaus conflict resolution activities with an allocation of 15 million that same year the african conflict resolution act pl 103381 was passed authorizing 15 million in foreign assistance to the oau annually from fy1995 through 1998 to strengthen the oaus conflict resolution capability although that authority has expired some economic support fund esf and peacekeeping pko funds requested for fy2002 would help support thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20945crs6 7 text available at wwwoauouaorglomeintroductory_noteoaus conflict management activities in the horn and congo in parallel measure congress has also authorized pko funds to support the training of selected african military units for peacekeeping responsibilities under the african crisis response initiative acri the fy2002 request for such training is 20 million prospects and challenges the oau will soon be reconstituted into new organization to be called the african union the change has been pushed by libyas leader muammar qaddhafi who has focused on africa over the past few years new constitutive act 7 for the union has been approved by oau members it provides for new organs including an advisory pan african parliament and approval in principle to eventually establish institutions such as an african central bank and monetary fund qaddhafis energetic lobbying for the union has garnered the number of ratifications necessary for approval and provided the necessary instruments of ratification are deposited the union should be inaugurated officially at the next annual meeting in 2002 while the terms of reference of the new organization continue to enshrine the principle of nonintervention in member states internal affairs they also include language that would authorize intervention in the internal affairs of member when the assembly finds grave circumstances ie human rights violations or genocide whethe r oau or african union the organization will probably continue to suffer from lack of funding and from the unwillingness of many member states to grant it wider powers in spite of those constraints the organization has been making progress in direction most see as positive under an activist secretary general it has gradually moved into areas such as democratization human rights and conflict management previously considered the exclusive domain of the member governments although achievements to date have been limited the focus of the organization has shifted possibly permanently toward practical matters and effectiveness in the field of conflict management in which the united states has substantial interest the oau has made limited progress it has begun to develop an institutional capability for early intervention to develop guidelines for observer and other missions and at the same time learned to share information and responsibilities with the and the subregional organizations which have played the prime peacekeeping roles in recent conflicts most importantly the organizations new activist role linked with actual deployments by the subregional organizations has led to wider acceptance of the idea of international intervention in resolving africas internal conflicts however the prospect of permanent autonomous african peacekeeping capacity either under the oau or in coordination with the subregional organizations remains in the views of regional experts only distant possibility
