senators and representatives is an important element of their roles as community leaders spokespersons and freely elected legislators congressional staff are often called on to help prepare draft remarks for such purposes writing for the spoken word is special discipline it requires that congressional speechwriters products be written primarily although not exclusively to be heard not read speeches are better cast in simple direct and often short sentences that can be easily understood by listeners rhetorical devices such as repetition variation cadence and balance are available to and should be used by the speechwriter it is important for speechwriters to analyze audiences according to factors such as age gender culture profession size of audience political affiliation if any and the occasion for and purpose of the speech most effective speeches do not exceed 20 minutes in length after researching topic speechwriters should prepare an outline from which the speech will be developed they should strive to maintain clear theme throughout the speech most speeches will have threepart structure consisting of an introduction body and conclusion the accepted style of contemporary american public address is natural direct low key casual and conversational this puts listeners at ease and promotes sense of community between audience and speaker punctuation should reflect the sound structure of the speech reinforcing the rhythm and pace of actual speech clarity of expression is as important consideration in speech grammar as rigid adherence to rules for written language effective delivery can greatly improve speech congressional speechwriters should make every effort to become familiar with the speaking style of the member for whom they are writing and adjust their drafts accordingly wide range of speechwriting resources are available for congressional staff from the congressional research service and other sources

aristotle is the power of determining in particular case what are the available means of persuasion this report reviews some effective means for the rhetoric of persuasive communication in speeches written by congressional staff for senators and representatives by speeches this report means draft statements prepared for oral delivery by members such speeches are often prepared under the pressure of deadlines that leave minimal time for extensive revision moreover they must often be drafted in whole or part for members who may have little opportunity to edit and amend them the burdens of public office as well as of campaigning and the insistent demand for speeches of every kind for variety of occasions require some degree of reliance on speechwriters reliance that is heightened by the limitations of time and the urgencies of the media speech thus ghostwritten should nevertheless reflect the intention and even the style of the speaker the best ghostwriters are properly invisible they subordinate themselves to the speaker in such way that the final product is effectively personalized in the process of actual communication the only ways to achieve or even approach this ideal are practice and experience this report seeks to provide some guidance for congressional staff on the principles and practice of speechwriting the suggestions offered herein when combined with practice attention to audience and occasion and most importantly the members attitudes convictions and style can help create speech that can be seamless garment when delivered by the member

speechwriter must learn to write aloud while the best speeches read as well as they sound the novice speechwriter should give priority to the ear and not the eye his or her speech must be written to be heard not read this means that easy intelligibility should be paramount concern so that the listening span is not strained one of the first rules of the speechwriting profession is that sentence written to be heard should be simple direct and short when the speechwriter writes aloud george orwells advice to cut out any word that can possibly be cut is helpful so long as the resulting effect is clarity and not verbal shorthand2 ciceronian oratory on the one hand and dickandjane simplicity on the other are extremes to be avoided the speechwriter thus faces the challenge of crafting words that convey the speakers meaning clearly but that also draw on the rich nuance and texture of spoken english 1 this report revises and expands an earlier report of the same title prepared by charles h

is considered more difficult for listeners to follow by ear and according to one expert may be too long for the average listener to absorb and analyze quickly3 by comparison written sentences of up to 30 words are easily understood by average readers4 given these generally accepted limitations what devices are available to the writer to make more complex sentences and speech wording accessible to the listener complex sentences can be clarified by repeating key words and using simple connections by numerous rhetorical techniques the speaker states restates and states again in different ways the central themes of the speech g20g142g153g142g157g146g157g146g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g24g138g155g146g138g157g146g152g151g561 repetition with variation is basic speechwriting tool used by many of the greatest speakers to emphasize key elements while avoidi ng monotony some examples follow martin luther kings i have dream speech was striking example of this technique using that phrase to introduce series of his visions for better future lincoln at gettysburg emphasized the significance of the days events by restating the solemnity of the occasion in not fewer than three variations we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground similarly winston churchills world war ii speeches used repetition with variation to build powerful climax we shall fight in france and on the seas and oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and growing streng th in the air we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be we shall fight on the beaches and landing grounds in fields in streets and on the hills we shall never surrender franklin d roosevelts 1937 one third of nation speech imparted sense of urgency by his deliberate repetition of here are construction to describe conditions in the country followed again and again with now here is onethird of nation illnourished illclad illhousednow here are thousands upon thousands of farmers wondering whether next years prices will meet their mortgage interestnow here are thousands upon thousands of men and women laboring for long hours in factories for inadequate paynow

where the speaker and the writer need cooperation to ensure success the tradition of public speaking in the english language owes much to the poetic tradition which was originally an oral tradition as one observer noted the language of the speech should also be poetic replete with alliteration metaphor and other figures of speech such adornments far 3 edward bernays quoted in mary g gotschall the

among ideas5 as difficult to define as to achieve cadence and balance impart movement and harmonious effect to any speech essentially matter of ordering groups of words and ideas into rhythmic patterns cadence and balance can be attained by such classical rhetorical devices as the ones described below do not be put off by the classic greek names of some of these rhetorical devices in practice we use them naturally in conversation and writing every day g20g145g162g157g145g150g146g140g561g22g155g146g138g141g156g561 the grouping of words into patterns of three can lead to memorable effect provided the device is not overused some notable examples from classic oratory include veni vidi vici never was so much owed by so many to so few the kingdom the power and the glory i have not sought i do not seek i repudiate the support of one third of nation illclad ill nourished illhoused g18g138g155g138g149g149g142g149g146g156g150g561 the linkage of similar words or ideas in balanced

sentences that is those in which the main clause comes at the end or loose sentences in which the main clause is presented at or near the beginning to be followed by other main or subordinate clauses sentence variation also includes the use of such devices as those described below g20g145g142g157g152g155g146g140g138g149g561g19g158g142g156g157g146g152g151g156g561 is peace rash system is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery the speaker leads the audience to the conclusion he hopes they will draw by asking question that makes his point and that he intends to answer himself either immediately with flourish or at greater length during his remarks through patient exposition

the speaker dramatizes the situation by reducing it to stark declaration which he renders more striking by pausing to let the facts sink in after each sentence fragment

is not animated by imaginative imagery by metaphor in its many forms the hatred of entrenched greed america will always stand for liberty democracy is the healthful lifeblood which circulates through the veins and arteries of society whether in chains or in laurels liberty knows nothing but victories extended metaphors or analogies comparing similarities in different things should be used with care so that the principal subject will not be lost in the image two or more metaphors in single sentence or thought can be safely ventured only by the most experienced writersto take arms against sea of troubleswithout incurring ridicule as in the famousand perhaps apocryphalexample attributed to the newspaper pravda the onetime propaganda organ of the soviet communist party the fascist octopus has sung its swansong above all in the spoken word there must be an element of identity and rapport with the listener whether the speaker uses natural conversational tone or more oratorical style effective speechwriting for congress is not branch of creative writing its rules are meant to foster clarity of expression whatever the occasion and purpose of any given speech mere clarity is not enough for persuasive rhetoric however indeed there are times when clarity brevity and the like are not appropriate the issues because of their import and complexity may preclude such treatment similarly the gravity or delicate political nature of the occasion may call for some measure of deliberate ambiguity the best speechwriter will take into account the context of the speech and the speakers personality the image that is projectedthat is the speaker whom the audience sees and hears the section on speech analysis in this report attempts closer look at lincolns great farewell

g6g142g150g152g144g155g138g153g145g146g140g156g561 bates and others list number of criteria useful in audience analysis including among others age gender culture education profession size of the audience and affiliation 7 age is obviously an important factor high school students young parents and senior citizens have different levels of life experience different interests reflecting the challenges they face at their particular stages of life and to some extent they even speak different languages although gender differences in societal roles are less pronounced than generation ago some believe that certain persistent disparities of viewpoint between many men and women on some topics persist with respect to culture william wiethoff in writing the speech states that it has escaped standard or preferred definition speechwriters however may envision culture as the race 6 jefferson bates writing with precision washington acropolis books 1985 pp 8285 7 wiethoff writing the

education profession and income level can be pitfall for the unwary speechwriter never confuse education with intelligence or professional status and worldly success with moral superiority or virtue or modest means and educational attainment with the opposite the writer must be sensitive to these varying frames of reference found in an audience draft remarks should be familiar sympathetic and topical without being condescending they must as always be phrased in way that is natural for the member it is painfully obvious to an audience if member is not comfortable in his role or with his words g3g158g141g146g142g151g140g142g561g21g146g163g142g561 the size of an audience is another important factor in preparing speech large audience and formal occasion usually call for greater formality in language and delivery lengthier remarks and greater reliance on some of the classical rhetorical practices cited in this report by comparison many members will require only talking points for town meeting and will almost certainly speak extemporaneously in still more intimate gatherings in the age of cable and satellite television and webcasts the member is often asked to address what may appear to be very small group of listeners physically present at the broadcast venue at the same time however many others perhaps thousands may be viewing from other locations or from their homes it is the writers task to craft remarks that simultaneously take into consideration the people physically present in the studio or location and those who may be watching from home or other locations

affiliation or lack thereof in the intended audience gathering of the party faithful is usually ready for some red meat an audience consisting of nonpartisan citizens group such as the league of women v oters is almost certainly not the writer must also always remember that while the member is affiliated with one political party and comes from particular part of the state or district he or she represents all the people and gives due attention and respect to the legitimate views and aspirations of all constituents g17g140g140g138g156g146g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g18g158g155g153g152g156g142g561 another of the speechwriters tasks is to assess the occasion at which the member has been asked to speak and tailor the remarks accordingly in contemporary society the delivery of remarks by public figures is an expected element in almost every secular public ceremony and at many religious services the speechwriter must ensure that the occasion and the speech agree with one another in both tone and content for instance veterans day and memorial day are among the most solemn public holidays in the calendar for these two events the speechwriter should focus on themes of commemoration service and sacrifice the atmosphere should appropriately be both somber and hopeful their 8 ibid p 23

high school and college commencements are of different genre altogether the occasion may demand inspirational remarks but as one observer noted ive heard speakers deliver tedious solemn policy address at graduation ceremonies in which the graduates and families just want to hit the exits and have good time9 conversely formal address to learned society will differ dramatically from friendly remarks at neighborhood picnic town meeting or retirement home simply put the writer should exercise common sense in preparing remarks appropriate in tone and content to both the audience and the occasion another useful consideration for congressional staff is to plan the delivery of substantive remarks on substantive occasions if the member is scheduled to announce major policy statement or initiative it should be delivered in commensurate surroundings and on occasions when media coverage will be adequate timing is also serious factor speeches delivered at midmorning at lunchtime or early afternoon at the latest are far more likely to be covered that same day by local tv news the purpose of speech and the occasion at which it will be delivered are closely related most frequently the latter will govern the former william wiethoff suggests purpose template for speechwriters in writing the speech 10 in it he establishes three categories of purpose information persuasion and entertainment g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 these speeches seek to convey facts or information to the audience the speaker first identifies the information that is about to be presented seeking to link the new facts with others the listeners may already be aware of next the speaker elaborates on the details of the information just conveyed while avoiding level of complexity and detail that would confuse the audience finally the speaker draws together the facts and ideas related earlier ideally recapitulating the main points in order to fix them in the listeners memory g18g142g155g156g158g138g156g146g152g151g561 the persuasive speech is twoedged sword it can seek to instill in the listeners either the acceptance of or at least more favorable opinion toward particular condition fact or concept this variant is described as advocacy conversely speech may also attempt to change an audiences impressions opinions or most ambitiously their convictions wiethoff calls this dissent and asserts that it is more difficult than advocacy since the speaker faces the burden of proving to the listeners that what they have heretofore accepted should be modified or rejected 11 in both cases the writer must marshal the arguments that will convince the audience 9 robert rackleff the art of speechwriting vital speeches of the day vol 54 mar 1 1988 p 311 10 wiethoff

category of speech purpose is entertainment great percentage perhaps majority of member speeches will fall into this category the choice of title for this group may be misleading however these are not necessarily frivolous occasions and they are not unimportant to the life and people of town or village students at school or members of club who constitute the audience for such remarks speeches in this category serve the vital function of reinforcing the common ties and experiences that bind communities together and help reinforce the vitality of civic life in america as wiethoff notes these speeches are delivered during ceremonies or rituals that are significant in themselves they do not need clarification in order to be understood they do not need proof of their importance instead on these occasions people share an expectation of what will happen and they are dissatisfied if the events do not take place as expected 12 entertainment speeches may be solemn in nature such as memorial day address or celebratory such as remarks at the opening of new school library or childcare facility they remind citizens of their joint identity as members of community these events seemingly everyday or even trite are actually vital expressions of civic life the members role as community leader and spokesperson on these occasions should not be underestimated it is great honor for him or her to deliver remarks at these community rites and congressional speechwriter should devote talent and originality to them obviously the three purpose categories cited here are not necessarily mutually exclusive in order to convince an audience speaker often needs to combine persuasion with information similarly while some types of remarks are intended purely for entertainment such as celebrity roast the careful speechwriter will always seek to entertain audiences in order to capture and retain their attention g22g146g150g142g561g138g151g141g561g14g142g151g144g157g145g561 how long should member speak the answer to this fundamental question of speechwriting like so many others depends on wide range of factors audience analysis and occasion have been previously noted but the habits and attitudes of the speaker must also be taken into consideration the natural inclinations of the member must be examined is the member person of few words or is he or she good talker does the member stick to the text or lay it aside to share anecdotes personal reminiscences or even humor with the audience these and other related questions can be answered only through experience on the part of the congressional speechwriter learning the members style and preferences will result in better product that communicates more effectively 12 ibid

considered by the writer in the morning people are relatively fresh and are generally better prepared physically to listen attentively by late afternoon or after luncheon however the audience may need to be stimulated either by coffee or by lively remarks finally lengthy afterdinner remarks should almost never be inflicted especially on paying audience the potential auditors are full tired and ready to go home its best to give them their wish as quickly as possible g10g152g160g561g15g138g151g162g561g25g152g155g141g156g501g561 finally comes the classic question how many words should the speechwriter prepare once again the factors of audience occasion member preference and time of day should be considered the question of length of time however must be dealt with at some point number of classic speech authorities suggest that in most cases 20 minutes should be the upward limit conventional wisdom often holds that most listen ers tune out perceptibly or not after that period 13 ritual or pro forma speeches such as occasional remarks at schools churches or public functions where the member is guest but not the main attraction benefit from brevity perhaps being limited to five to 10 minutes although substantive public policy speeches may merit greater length in modern america only presidential inaugural and state of the union messages seem to exceed the 20minute limit regularly with the latter often weighing in at over an hour the question of pace is also important is the member fast talker different speakers exhibit considerable variety in pace ranging from 115 to 175 words minute once again the speechwriter will factor these personal differences into his work as benchmark however an oftencited ruleofthumb is that the average 20minute speech contains about 2600 words or about 130 per minute most word processing programs will provide total document word count as part of their spell check feature 14 having fixed time stimulates careful preparation both time limit and notes or text help guard against logorrhea or excessive verbiage time limits also encourage speakers not to be overly comprehensive saying everything there is to be said on the speech topic this is temptation difficult to resist but speech is by nature precis or digest excessive complexity or verbiage are capable of transforming an effective speech into something ponderous and exhausting

selfdeprecating or gentle humor is usually more effective than satire or ridicule jokes aimed at peoples personal lives or at religious and ethnic groups are invariably offensive regardless of the speakers motives avoid them statistics should be used with care and moderation like the points in an outline they are better alluded to in context than cited in tedious detail speech filled with statistics becomes statistical abstract not speech when selecting material the responsible speechwriter will take great care to quote accurately and give full credit for whatever is borrowed outright plagiarism is often illegal and always unethical on the other hand it is entirely proper to adapt existing materials to ones own purpose in preparing new speech for any occasion as thomas jefferson wrote in response to accusations that he had plagiarized parts of the declaration of independence from other works i did not consider it as any part of my charge to invent new ideas altogether and to offer sentiment which had ever been expressed before straining after originality which has been defined by an anonymous wit as imitation not yet detected can ruin the best of speeches finally the seasoned speechwriter soon learns to recycle the best parts of previous efforts to save time and effort and also to preserve particularly fine turn of phrase

use of an outline the novice speechwriter may be tempted to dispense with this device on the grounds that it adds time consuming extra step to process that is often constrained by tight deadlines on the other hand it forces the writer to plan and organize his thoughts to determine in advance what he intends to say and to begin at the beginning speech outline generally is not nearly as detailed as an outline for an academic work such as journal article or even research paper the outline serves as skeleton framework to carry the flesh and blood of the fully developed speech at the same time this skeleton should eventually be invisible clothed in delivery with ideas and emotions and as simple as possible beware of explicitly enumerating too many points or topics outlines may be written in topics or key sentences or in complete thoughts so long as there is an orderly sequence the frugal writer will retain speech outlines since they can easily be reworked for future efforts in whole or in parts these can be placed in folders in word processing program or written out into looseleaf notebook binder or even on index cards from any of these media the outlines can be quickly cut rearranged or added to as future occasions may require president ronald reagan for example was legendary for his expert use and reuse of note cards that included facts and themes he sought to

addressing it in different ways much in the manner that good sentences are constructed for paragraph the arrangement of ideas and themes should follow logical progression each fact establishes certain point which leads to the speakers next po int and so forth ultimately climaxing with the thematic conclusion while it is more dramatic to gain an audiences attention by opening speech with grand conclusion be sure that the initial dramatic assertion is followed up by the essential process of weaving the argument the member seeks to make do not try to say too much particularly when the speech is intended as the vehicle for major announcement or initiative the most memorable presidential inaugural addresses have been those that set single theme or coherent group of related themes 15 stick

speech in reverse begin with the conclusion which should summarize the central message while abridging and restating whatever goes before if the introduction sets the tone and establishes initial

one popular option for developing speech is the attentionproblemsolution method especially for longer speeches of nonpartisan character useful for many different occasions this method begins by

concludes with the proposed best solution presented so as to win listener support g22g145g146g156g561g152g155g561g16g152g157g145g146g151g144g561 another option the thisornothing method advocates policy mainly by presenting and refuting proposed alternatives as inadequate or worse it lends itself well to partisan occasions or to stirring those already convinced in every case the speaker seeks to reinforce and strengthen his principal ideas as they are unfolded in the speech prior audience analysis and subject preparation will often help the speech write itself speaker should ever apologize for his or her presence or for the content of the speech if it truly deserves apologies it is better left unsaid further prudent speaker rightly wary of the impulse to speak offthecuff will make

the most formal occasions use natural words and phrases in speech let the sentences flow conversationally it is helpful for some writers time permitting to prepare first draft in longhand shaping the sentences slowly speaking aloud the phrases they intend to use the first person is perfectly acceptable in modern public discourse and when combined with other personal pronounsremember to avoid i strainit can help connect listener to speaker and create sense of community within the audience while the first person singular is sometimes deprecated it is its excessive use that should be avoided conversely speakers should avoid referring to themselves in the first person plural we or the third person singular he or she the former has been reserved to monarchs and is considered archaic in modern speech the latter too often conveys sense of excessive self importance to listeners for instance member should think twice before referring to himself or herself in the third person singular dave or mary smith thinks the problem of hunger is the greatest challenge facing america today writers should generally use simple declarative sentences preferably in active voice when making important statements of fact assertion or opinion use of the passive voice should not be dismissed out of hand however it is sometimes the more desirable form and can lend grace and variety to the

of actual speech one writer has further distinguished three methods of punctuating by structure or logic to indicate the sense of what is being said by the rhythm of word order and intended meaninga subtle use best avoided by novice speech writers and by respirationthat is by the physical ease of natural speech which assumes that what is read is really spoken16 this last method essentially the same as the elocutionary style is the most widely used and certainly the most appropriate for speeches in short punctuate according to the ear and not the eye this also means punctuating for the lungs give the member time to breathe long and convoluted sentence something to be avoided in general can leave the member literally gasping for breath as he or she concludes it useful practice for congressional speechwriters is to declaim aloud speak aloud not in conversationa l tone but as if one were speaking to an audience any lengthy sentence intended for the member if the writer finds it taxing on the lungs then so will the member in such cases it is advi sable either to fashion shorter sentences or to repunctuate the original using such obvious t ime out devices as the colon and semicolon both of which are described in the next paragraph commas and dashes are useful to the speaker and listeners alike as guideposts to what lies ahead in speech they also provide pauses where the speaker can let the import of the previous sentence sink in or simply catch his or her brea th opinion is divided on colons and semicolons some consider them as serving the same functions as commas and dashes while others suggest that they are more emphatic demanding full stop in the flow of remarks rather than short pause they are also sometimes criticized as leading to long compound sentences that are difficult for audiences to process and that are better replaced by shorter declarative ones in the final analysis the members personal preferences and style should be the

english usage that is appropriate to the occasion while it is highly desirable the formal grammar of the written language is not an end in itself it exists to further the clarity of expression far more important than the grammarians rules is the communication of personality by which speech as opposed to lecture is clothed with emotion and enthusiasm so that the speaker is perceived to be sincere and trustworthy neither talking over peoples heads nor talking down to them while this may belong more to the presentation or delivery the writer should strive for it in speech preparation as

bestprepared speeches and sometimes does although delivery is not the concern of the speechwriter as such it must be always in mind as speech is actually written the speakers pace his or her style mannerisms tendencies such as departing from text peculiarities or special difficulties words to avoidthese are elements with which the writer should be well acquainted before preparing any speech knowing how member speaks is essential in preparing draft that is both useful and realistic ideally speech draft ought to be reviewed three timesby the writer by the prospective speaker and by disinterested third party of these three priority should ordinarily be given to the speaker the revised product is likely to be more effective with speeches as with food however too many cooks are undesirable moreover time seldom permits this much critical evaluation and rewriting it may even be easier to provide for some appraisal of the speechs impact and audience reaction after delivery for example it is said that senator robert f kennedys speech writers would follow his delivery of speech word by word noting those phrases or ideas that were well received or others that created problems an effective political speech is defined not by rules of rhetoric but by the character of response it evokes the speaker then is always concerned to measure that response and to elicit positive feedback this means network of contacts that can report on the opinions and reactions of the audience and evaluate the interest generated and evident week or more after the event it requires an awareness of media coverage and subsequent treatment from constituents the sponsoring organization and others in short it means adding political relevance to the familiar phrase keeping in touch although there are substantial distinctions betwee n legislative and nonlegislative speeches the basic principles of preparation and presentation are identical for both good writing is nurtured by wide reading which in turn fosters sense of style enriched vocabulary accuracy in grammar and feeling for english syntax the best speechwriters will through regular daily reading bring an ever more abundant background to their work everything is grist for the speechwriters mill moreover nothing is surer in speechwriting than that practice makes perfect the more one writes the easier the task becomes and the smoother and more conversational the flow of the members remarks as with so many aspects of speechwriting and delivery the physical form of speech is matter of personal preference some speakers prefer to work from completely polished text one that may include carefully tailored spontaneous anecdotes and jokes at appropriate places and may even incorporate hints on speech delivery or effective body language in the text others prefer to speak from notes derived from such text proceed from series of talking points or simply extemporize whichever method is used preparatory notes or an outline are recommended with the cautionary warning that dependence on manuscript can deaden the delivery just as the excessive use of notes or cards can stimulate verbosity

presidentelect lincolns farewell speech at spri ngfield illinois on february 11 1861 is arguably the shortest great speech ever delivered from the back of train its railway car setting recalls to mind the nowvanished connection between political events and the railroad including the whistlestop campaigns of most presidential candidates from william jennings bryan to dwight eisenhower what jacques barzun called linc olns workaday style would become the american style par excellence undermining the monopoly exercised by purveyors of literary plush17 the springfield speech illustrates with extraordinary brevityit is only 15 line paragraphthe lincolnian qualities of precision vernacular ease rhythmic virtuosity and elegance the sense of right order and emphasis throughout culminates in the closing sentenceone of the greatest cadences in english speech18 the effect is achieved by the simple yet artful devices of parallelism the balancing of similar and antithetical words phrases and ideas evoking rich biblical overtones among his hearers lincolns style is rooted in the speaking intonations and humanly simple vernacular of everyday speech heightened by form and rhythm the distinctively american tradition seen at its best in such writers as emerson and frost19 although some hold that today there is place for rhetorical eloquence arguing that bluntness and clarity and simplistic thoughts are the norm20 others assert that the craft of speechmaking the impact of skilled political rhetoric is as significant as ever in our history21 lincolns mastery of that craft remains formidable example my friends one not in my situation can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting to this place and the kindness of these people i owe everything here i have lived quarter of century and have passed from young to an old man here my children have been born and one is buried i now leave not knowing when or whether ever i may return with task before greater than that which rested upon washington without the assistance of that divine being who ever attended him i cannot succeed with that assistance i cannot fail trusting in him who can go with and remain with you and be everywhere for good let us confidently hope that all will yet be well to his care commending you as i hope in your prayers you will commend i bid you an affectionate farewell 22

television23 repetition and retention of few simple ideas are stressed more than complex concept24 in consequence some have noted growing trend toward what some have characterized as numbing mediocrity since the 1920s more political speakers have addressed larger audiences on wider range of topics than at any time in history yet so marked is the declin in the quality of style that the majority of speeches are pedestrian prosaic and impotent25 this last may be an excessively pessimistic evaluation of the state of contemporary political speech few moreover would advocate return to the florid style of public speaking that prevailed as recently as the 1920s the remedy in part may be the cultivation of styl time should be devoted writes l patrick devlin to using impressive language which he defines as the most vivid clear concise and meaningful style26 it will be most effective if it bears the personal stamp of the speaker the process of persuasion is more matter of communicating values than logical information27 in essence good speechwriting requires that the speake r assume role to some extent he or she must be able to impart confidence and to sense the character of an audience we need not agree with talleyrands cynical observation that speech was given to man to disguise his thoughts to recognize that effective persuasion calls for the ability to win the hearts and minds of listeners to seem natural is not easy as george fluharty and harold ross wrote in public speaking the speaker is estimating his audience and his audience is estimating him his ethics his integrity understanding and humanity are strong forces for good and also strong components of his ethos or personal effect upon not only his present but also his future audiences the speaker should therefore make sure that the actual situation permits him to use given persuasive device 28 once again the words of abraham lincoln himself mean practitioner of the public speakers art may serve to summarize the speechwriters ultimate goal when the conduct of men is designed to be influenced persuasion kind unassuming persuasion should ever be adopted it is an old and true maxim that drop of honey catches more flies than gallon of gall so with men if you would win man to your cause first convince him that you are his sincere friend therein is drop of honey that catches his heart which say what he will is the great highroad to his reason and which when once gained you will find but little trouble convincing his judgment of the justice of your cause if indeed that cause really is good one 29 23 james l golden political speaking since the 1920s in contemporary american speeches will linkugel rr allen and richard l johannesen eds 2nd ed belmont ca wadsworth pub co 1969
