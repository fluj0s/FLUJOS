from the mission responsibilities of the laboratory th government provides support in the way of overhead for research and development rd performed in the federal laboratory and is prohibited from providing direct funding to the partner in the collaborative effort currently over 5000 cradas have been signed including nasa space act agreements as the 106th congress begins the debate ove r its approach to science and technology the role of cradas is expected to be discussed within the context of federal support for rd rationale in pursuit of mission require ments federal departments and agencies spend approximately 76 billion per year on research and development almost third of this to support rd performed in the government laborat ory system such an effort has resulted in new and improved technologies and ma nufacturing techniques that may provide additional benefits beyond speci fic missionrelated use for example while the major portion of total federal rd spending has been in the defense arena government financed work has led or contributed to new commercial products and processes including but not limited to antibiotics plastics jet aircraft computers electronics and genetically engineered drugs eg insulin and human growth hormone technology transfer is one way proponents argue th at federally funded rd can be further developed and applied by the pr ivate sector to meet other national needs associated with economic growth the increasing competitive pressures on us firms in the international marketplace coupled with the governments requirements for goods and services can make the collaboration between federal laborator ies and industry through technologyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95150crs2 1for detailed discussion of the technology transf er issue see congressional research service technology transfer use of fe derally funded research and d evelopment by wendy h schacht crs issue brief 85031transfer beneficial to both sectors lthough opponents may argue that these activities detract from budgeted research the knowledg base created by agencysupported rd may serve as foundation for additional commerc ially relevant efforts in companies while the government research enterprise is advanced through interaction with innovative firms this transfer is facilitate d by cooperative research and development agreements cradas particular legal instrument creat ed by the federal technology transfer act of 1986 pl99502 the federal interest1 the movement of technology from the fede ral laboratories to industry is achieved through technology transfer process by which technology developed in one organization in one area or for one purpose is applied in another or ganization in another area or for another purpose technology transf er can have different meanings in different situations in some instances it refers to the transfer of legal rights such as the assignment of patent title to contractor or the licensing of governmentowned patent to private firm in other cases the transfer endeavor involves the informal movement of knowhow informati on knowledge and skills through persontoperson interaction successful transfer is in the actual use of the product or process without this the benefits from more efficient and ffective provision of goods and services are not achieved the federal interest in the transfer of technology is ba sed on several factors with the rapid pace of technological advancement in industry th expertise skills products and processes necessary for the agencies to meet their mission requirements often is only available in the private sector thus coope rative activities with indus trial scientists and engineers can be critical to the laboratorys successful completion of its research agenda the government also requires certain goods and services to operate much of the research it funds is directed at developing the know ledge and expertise necessary to formulate these products and processes however because the govern ment has neither the mandate nor the capability to commercialize the results of the federal rd effort it must purchase technologies necessary to meet mission requirements from the private sector technology transfer is mechanism to get federally generated technology nd technical knowhow to the business community where it can be deve loped commercialized and made available for use and adaptation in the public sector federal involvement in technol ogy transfer also arises from an interest in promoting the economic growth that is vital to the nations welfare and security it is through further development refineme nt and marketing that the results of research become diffused throughout the economy and can gene rate growth econo mic benefits of technology or technique accrue when product process or service is brought to the marketplace where it can be sold or used to increase quality and productivity when technology transfer is successful new nd different products or processes become available to meet or induce market demand transfer from the fe deral laboratories also can result in substantial increases in employment and income generated at the firm levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95150crs3 in addition it may be way to assist comp anies that have been dependent on defense contracts and procurement to convert to manufacturing fo r the civilian marketplace in the past despite the potential offere d by the resources of the government laboratory system the commercia lization level of the results of federally funded research and development remained low there were various reasons fo r this one of which is the fact that many technologie s and patents have commerc ial applicati on or have little value in the marketplace because fede ral laboratory rd is generally undertaken to meet an agencys mission or because there are insufficient incentives for private sector investment in research that the government deems in the national interest decisions regarding laboratory priorities re flect public sector rather than commercial needs thus transfer often depended on attempts to ascertain new commercial applications of technologies developed for government use rather than on the development of technologies in respons to market demand additional barriers to transfer involve cost s it has been estimated that research accounts for approximately 25 of expenditures associated with bringing new product or process to market thus while it might be advantageous for companies to rely on government funded research there are still significant added inve stments necessary to achieve commercialization af ter the transfer has occurred however industry unfamiliarity with these technol ogies the not invented he re syndrome and ambiguities associated with obtaining title to or exclusive license for federally owned patents also serve to limit technology transfer the legislative foundation the legislative basis for technology tran sfer is pl 96480 the stevensonwydler technology innovation act of 1980 as amended th is law explicitly states that it is the continuing responsibility of th federal government to ensu re the full use of the results of the nations federal inves tment in research and devel opment technology transfer was mandated as an expressed part of each agencys mission various institutional mechanisms were created by which federa l departments and thei r laboratories could accomplish such efforts the initial response to new opportunities for use of federal laboratory resources was less than expected on behalf of both the privat and the public sectors as consequence additional incentives were considered by the congress resulting in enactment of pl 99 502 the federal technology transfer act of 1986 this law established new tool the cooperative research and development agreemen t to be used for joint work between federal laboratories and the business community first limited to governmentowned

patent policy and the commercialization of technology by wendy h schacht crs report 94501 1994cradas defined crada is specific legal document not procurement contract which defines the collaborative venture it is intended to be developed at the laboratory level with limited agency review in agencies which operate their own laboratories the laboratory director is permitted to make decisions to participate in cradas in an effort to decentralize and expedite the technology transf er process however at agencies which use contractors to run their laboratories specifically the department of energy the crada has to be appr oved by headquarters the work performed under cooperative re search and development agreement must be consistent with the laborat orys mission in pursuing these joint efforts the laboratory may accept funds personnel services and pr operty from the collabor ating party and may provide personnel services and property to the particip ating organization the government can cover overhead costs incurred in support of the crada but is expressly prohibited from providing direct funding to the industrial partner in gogo laboratories this support comes directly from budgeted rd accounts the energy department generally relied on competitive selection proce ss run by headquarters which allocated funding specifically designated to cover the federal portion of the crada however the fy1994 appropriati ons eliminated the line item for technology transfer in the nondefense laboratories instructing that such efforts be part of ongoing programmatic activities the line item still exists in the doe defense laboratories budgets although at significantly decreased level of funding the legislation does not specify the di spensation of patents derived from the collaborative work allowing the agencies to develop their own polic ies however under crada title to or licenses for inventi ons made by laboratory employee may be granted in advance to the participating compan by the director of the laboratory the director may also negotiate licensing agreements for related governmentowned inventions previously made at that labor atory to facilitate c ooperative ventures in addition he can waive in advance any righ t of ownership the gove rnment might have on inventions resulting from the joint effort regardless of size of the collaborating company this latter provision diverges from other patent law which requires that title to inventions made under federal rd funding be given only to small bus inesses notforprofits and universities in all cases the governme nt retains nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable paidup license to practice or have practiced the invention for its own needs2 laboratory personnel and former employ ees are permitted to participate in commercialization activities if these are consistent with the agencies regulations and rules of conduct federal employees are subject to conflict of interest restraints in the case of governmentowned contractoropera ted laboratories p l 101189 required that conflict of interest provisions regarding cradas be in cluded in the operating contracts within 150 days of enactment of the law preference for cradas is given to small businesses companies which will manufacture in the united states or foreign firms fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95150crs5 3for additional

benefits of cooperative rd agreements washington dc 1994 rced9552 december 1994 countries that permit american companies to enter into similar arrangements according to the senate report srept 99283 which accompanied the legislation the authorities conveyed by the section dealing with cr adas are permissive to promote the widest use of this arrangement to date ove r 5000 cooperative research and development agreements have been signed across all fe deral departme nts and agencies including nasa space act agreements which are similar but mandated by diffe rent legislation it should be noted here that cradas ar only one form of cooperative activity but because they can be easily identified and quantified they tend to be the most visible other mechanisms include personnel exchanges nd visits licensing of patents work for others educational initiatives information dissemination the use of special laboratory facilities and centers set up in particular technological areas cooperative assistance to state and local programs and the spinoff of new firms currently federal laboratories legislatively are prohibited from competing with the private sector and can only offer the use of expertise and equipment which is not readily available elsewhere technology transfer and cooperative effort s are expressly forbidden to interfer with the laboratories rd missionrelated activities observations and issues over the past 15 years the congress has enacted various laws designed to facilitate cooperative rd between and among governme nt industry and academia these laws include but are not limited to tax credits fo r industrial payments to universities for the performance of rd changes in the antitrust ws as they pertain to cooperative research and joint manufacturing and improved technology transfer from federal boratories to the private sector3 the intent behind these legislative initiatives is to encourage collaborative ventures and thereby reduce the ri sks and costs associated with rd as well as permit work to be undertaken that cr osses traditional boundaries of expertise and experience leading to the development of new technologies and ma nufacturing processes for the marketplace there has not been an independent cro ssagency evaluation of cradas in part because of the inherent time lag between research and commercialization and in part because of an absence of standardized depa rtmental measures of success the general accounting office gao reviewed 10 cradas among group selected by agencies as having achieved their goals in this december 1994 study4 gao found that the benefits of collaboration include new commercial products advancemen ts in rd programs and assistance in meeting agency mission requi rements noting that the cradas studies were not necessarily represen tative of all such efforts the report concluded that cradas can be valuable asset and govern mentindustry collaborati on can have positive impact on certain economic h ealth and environmental n eeds of the united states in both the 104th congress and the 105th congress there were indications that majority of members favored refocusing federal funding to support basic research ratherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95150crs6 5for additional discussion see congressional research service rd partnerships and intellectual property imp lications for us policy by wendy h

glenn j mcloughlin crs report 9881than technology development indirect meas ures to encourage technological advancement in the private sector eg tax incentives appeared to be preferable to direct federal spending cradas in particular are mean s to take government funded basic research from the federal laboratory system and move it to the industrial community for commercialization to meet both agency ssion requirements and other national needs associated with the economic growth which comes from new products and processes it should also be recognized that the government is expressly prohibited from providing direct financial support to partners in the cooperative venture under crada therefore this approach may meet the criteria expressed as acceptable to the congress as the new congress determines its approach to science and technology the role of cradas is expected to be debated the recent increase in the number of cooperative research and development agreements and th expanded industry inte rest in this activity implies that both the public and private sectors see value in this activity the fact that companies must invest time and money in tec hnology transfer projects helps to insure that the rd is relevant to industry needs support for cradas from departmental rd budgets is designed to guarantee that the work is consistent with the missions of the federal agencies however the successful implementation of the technology transfer mandate has raised issues related to specific crada arrangements and thus led to additional questions5 is the technology transfer mandate in conflict with other governmental objectives such as economic security because industries and companies are interdependent can the technology transfer interests of us firms that have technological lead be balanced with those that do not ho w does the government balance the interest of one industry or one compan with another how can the governments interests be balanced with those of industr does the current system allow both the laboratories thus the american public and th private sector to achieve commensurate benefits the way in which these issue are resolved and the manner in which specific circumstances are addressed may influence whether or not cradas continue to be viable mechanism to transfer technology from the federal government to the private sector and from industry to the federal laboratories
