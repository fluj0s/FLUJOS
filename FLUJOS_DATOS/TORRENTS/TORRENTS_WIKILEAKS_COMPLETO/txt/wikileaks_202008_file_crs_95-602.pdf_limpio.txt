rulers who followed him in september 1988 an armed group attacked and burned aristides chur ch killing 13 and wounding 70 surrounded by his parishioners aristide escaped unharmed to his detractors aristide was potentially dangerous demagogue whose inflammatory oratory they maintained encouraged the rampages known as dechouka jes or uprooting in creole in which suspected tontons macoutes were attacked or killed by angry mobs aristide reportedly denies that his book 100 verses of dechoukaj condones violence nonetheless the salesian religious orde r expelled him for preaching politics from

were impossible as long as duvalierists still had hold on economic and political power noneth eless he joined the race in response to former tontons macoutes chief roger lafontants potential candidacy

against those who disagreed with him for example aristide at that time refused to condemn the practice of pere lebrun or burning someone to death with tire necklace he reportedly said that the practice was not barred by the constitution and that althoug h he would eventually like to see the practice discontinued its elimination was conditiona l on the eradication of corruption after the

social economic and political problems in the hemisphere after eight months in office aristide had received mixed reviews he was credited with curbing crime in the capital reducing the number of employees in bloated state enterprises and taking actions to bring the military under civilian c ontrol some observers questioned the governments commitment to democracy however neither aristide nor his prime minister belonged to political party and leaders of other political parties criticized him for not reaching out and establishi ng spirit of cooperation among the democratic elements many legislator s including some from aristides own coalition protested the presidents appoi ntment of supreme court judges and ambassadors without consulting the senate as required by the constitution aristide later agreed to consult the legislature but relations between the two branches remained strained president aristide was also criticized for his attitude toward the judicial system former

resistance from several powerful haitian sectors the oas then imposed trade embargo in early october 1991 for more than three years the regime resisted international demands that aristide be restored

the government installed ma rc bazin conservative economist and aristide rival as prime minister wher eby the interim president stepped down leaving the presidency vacant and bazin to form government the oas became frustrate d because ne ither the embargo nor diplomatic initiatives brought about return to c onstitutional rule the european community could not agree on an embargo and continued to

population according to one humanitarian assistance organization operating in haiti the situa tion after the coup deterior ated from extreme poverty to state of virtual famine in some parts of the country the oass frustration lead to the involvement of the united nations special envoy dante caputo representing both the and the oas began discussions in december 1991 these lead to the posting of an oasun civilian observer mission to oversee the restoration of order and monitor human rights conditions as the facto haitian government resisted the call for aristides return the international

called fo r by the oas in october 1991 on june 4 1993 president clinton imposed new sancti ons targeted at the haitian leadership and on june 23 the imposed world wide oil and arms embargo these new sanctions coupled with the resignation of prime minister bazin on june 8 created the conditions for new round of talks in late june caputo he ld talks with both president aristide and military chief

october 1993the oas and united states reimposed sanctions many advocates of aristides return acknowledged concerns over aristides commitment to the democratic process but argued that the international community had an obligation to restore democratically elected head of state as matter of principle if aristide was found to be vi olating the constitution they said then the community should encourage haiti to address the problem through the democratic process including impeachment if nece ssary rather than through coup us policy after the coup following the september 1991 coup in iti the main us foreign policy concern was the restoration of democracy closely related to this was the issue of haitians attempting to flee to the united states by boat important questions for us policymakers were whether the oas and would be able to promote an enduring solution in haiti and whether these measures would be able to forestall haitians attempting to flee to the united states as the expanded embargo and diplomatic efforts did not force the facto haitian regime to allow aristides return to office us policymakers had to consider whet her to continue the embargo which many claimed was hurting itis poor the most take stronger action such as military intervention or disengage from iti when aristides return was arranged policymakers faced issues such as aristid personal security the possibility of violent popular backlash and whether ar istide could govern effectively and democratically under the bush administration us po licy aimed at pressuring the regime through trade embargo with the participation of other oas members the cutoff of us aid to the regime and support for di plomatic efforts through the oas many observers believed that president clinton intensified pressure on the haitian regime and helped advance negotiations to restore democracy to haiti but after the governors island accord collapsed pressure increased for change in policy the administration then took

as medicine and food but in february 1992 the bush ad ministration lifted the embargo for some assembly plants in may 1992 in response to the regimes refusa l to cooperate with the oasbrokered agreement the oas voted to tighten its trade embargo against haiti by barring from all ports in the he misphere ships from oas member countries that violated the embargo by running oil and other commercial g oods to haiti the bush administration soon took action to comp ly with the tightening of the sanctions and prohibited ships that stopped in haiti from entering the united states without prior authorization in august 1992 the oas initiated new diplom atic efforts to try to resolve the political crisis delegation led by oas secretary general joao baena soares visited haiti to promote dialogue leading to the resumption of the haitian democratic process this led to talks between representatives of aristide and the facto regime which resulted in sept ember 1992 agreement for an 18member subsequently reduced to 16 member oas civilian mission to be sent to haiti the civilian mission was supposed to have responsibility for monitoring the human rights situation the effects of

throughout the country to observe the human rights situation and work at facilitating negotiations to bring about the eventual return of aristide the agreement was hailed by secretary of stat warren christopher as breakthrough for mediation efforts the clinton ad ministration pledged 2 million to support the mission it was hoped that the mission s success might lead to decrease in repression and progress in negotiations and then to the gradual lifting of the embargo against haiti negotiations faltered in the spring some analysts said military leaders were emboldened to reject two proposals because they believed that in ternational threats lacked credibility and were reluctant to give up the income many in the military were reportedly making from traffick ing in drugs and contraband in march 1993 president clinton met w ith president aristide and committed the united states to contributing its fair portion of fiveyear 1 billion program to rebuild haitis economy president c linton

april 1993 th administration contended that there was still room for negotiations nd that they were using slower carrot andstick approach co mbining pressure with offers of future aid on june 4 1993 however the clint on administration imposed further sanctions targeted at haitian leaders members of the military the civilian government and the private sector who s upported the coup were prohibited entry into the united states and along with the cent ral bank and other institutions had their us assets frozen the administration c ontinually expanded the list of those subject to targeted sanctions

beating mutilation and rape910 for decades the haitian army had been responsible for widespread human rights violations under the militarydominated interim governments after the fall of the duvalier dictatorship in 1986 the army fre quently impeded the democratic process since the departure of the last military dictator in march 1990 however some observers believed there had been transf ormation of the army to one supportive of democracy throughout the 1990 electoral process the 7000man army proved itself capable of establishing and maintaining or der initially the army accepted aristides assertion of authority including his purge of the haitian army high command brig general raoul cedras who oversaw security for the december elections and was named commanderinchief by aristide was reportedly reluctant participant in the initial coup but as its s pokesman he said aristide was ousted for meddling in army affairs and he led the military regime during its threeyear rule when it first took office the aristid government was expected to meet resistance from the army in its attempts to implement provisions of the haitian constitution that impose civilian authority over the military for example the constitution calls for the separation of the police from the army with the police under the command of the ministry of justice not the army the law also mandates that cases involving military abuses against civilians be tried in civilia n courts not by the military the military had resisted previous efforts to execute those laws nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95602crs14 military personnel were prosecuted for human rights abuses under any of the interim governments aristide was trying to attack corruption carry out reforms in the army and create civilian police force when he was overthrown these changes were to be attempted again under the governors island agreement many believe that it was resistance to reform as well as suppression of resistance that led to the upsurge in violence following the signing of the governors island accord and contributed to the armys opposition to aristides return haitian migration the us policy of interdicting haitian migrants on the sea was severely criticized after the septem ber 1991 coup the interdic tion policy was based on bilateral agreement negotiated between the reagan administration and the duvalier government in september 1981 that permitted the us coas t guard to interdict boats on the high seas and to return undocumente d passengers to haiti haiti was the only country with which the united states had such an agreement from september 1981 through october 1990 the coast guard inte rdicted 22651 haitians at sea during those nine years fewer than dozen haitians were allowed into the united states to apply for asylum the year 1990 saw the lowe st level of interdic tions in seven years and the coast guard reported that during some months of aristides 1991 term they did not encounter single haitian refugee boat both haitian and us officials reportedly attributed this to the new hope haitians had for imp roved conditions under the newly elected government after aristides ouster on september 30 1991 the exodus rose sharply during aristides exile 66954 haitians we re interdicted by the us coast guard for the first six months after the coup the us coast guard took the haitians to the us naval facility in guantanamo bay cuba where the us immigration and naturalizati on service conducted prescr eening interviews more than 10000 of those prescreened or about 30 were allowed to go to the united states to seek asylum on may 24 1992 however president bush ordered the interception and immediate return to haiti of all haitians in boats on the high seas without prescreening them to see if they might be eligible for asylum instead haitians could apply for refug ee status at the us embassy president clinton who during the campaign said haitians would not be turned back without hearing continued the forced repatr iation policy which the supreme court upheld in june 1993 debate over the interdiction policy centered on several issues the most important question was the cause of the haitians flight the george h w bush administration had argued that the majority were fleeing poverty and were therefore ineligible for political asylum refugee dvocates argued that many were likely to face political persecution at home from the militarydominated government and that conducting inadequate or in terviews resulted in retu rning many who might have had legitimate claims to refugee status according to human rights organizations the human rights situation deteriorated significantly following the coup another important question was whether those returned to haiti were facing persecution according to the department of states 1992 human rights report us officials monitored more than 3000 repa triates in 1992 without finding singlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95602crs15 credible claim of mistreatment or retribution against any haitian for having attempted to leave haiti the report also noted th at repatriated haitian boat people do face of course the same harsh conditions and lawlessness facing haitians in general human rights groups maintained that it was extremely dangerous and difficult to investigate claims of persecution and c ontended that ins efforts to interview repatriates were deeply flawed they also argued that it was unsafe to apply for asylum in haiti in march 1993 navy dese rter granted refugee status by the us embassy was arrested by the haitian military as he was escorted by us diplomats to usbound plane after the admin istration proteste d haitian authorities released the man some members of congress and others expressed c oncern that there was perceived element of racism in us refugee policy toward haiti very few haitians seeking asylum were granted it in contrast to the almost automatic granting of permanent residence to cubans due in rge part to the cuban adjustment act of 1966 some critics argued that failure to give haiti the same designation of special humanitarian concern given cuba considering haitis decadeslong record of oppression was racist action in addition refugee advocates argued that the policy violated convention prohibiting all countries from sending back to country persons who have legitimate claims of political persecution as human rights violations grew worse in haiti president aristide apparently became increasingly uncomfortable with the fo rced repatriation policy in early april he called the policy racist and gave the six months notice needed to abrogate the migration agreement effective october 4 1994 the us coast guard continues to stop haitian boats however on the gr ounds of intercepting ships deemed unseaworthy in the months following ar istides return to haiti in october 1994 the number of haitians intercepted at sea was deemed minuscule by the state department clinton administration migration policy reversing his campaign position president clinton continued the bush administrations policy of interdicting and immediately re turning haitians found at sea during that time he increased the number of us officials in haiti in order to speed up the processing of asylum applications there he also s upported oas and efforts to promote political settlement in haiti maintaining that these efforts would help eliminate the reasons for haitians fleeing the country as violence intensified in haiti however so did criticism of president clintons migration policy some members of the us congress were arrested protesting the forced repatriation policy outside the wh ite house and activ ist randall robinson went on hunger strike until the polic was reversed on may 8 1994 the administration announced that it would set up immigration centers on ships anchored near haiti or in third countries so that haitians interdicted at sea could apply for asylum on july 5 the clinton adminis tration shifted its policy again announcing that processing for refugee status woul d longer be conduc ted instead haitian migrants interdicted at sea w ould be taken to the us na val base at guantanamo bay cuba and then sent to other countries in the region providing temporary safe haven the flow of haitian migrant s lessened after the new po licy was announced and
