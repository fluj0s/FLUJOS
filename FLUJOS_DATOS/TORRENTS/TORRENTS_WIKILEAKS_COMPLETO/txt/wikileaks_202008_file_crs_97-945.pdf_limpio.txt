weapons production capability issues summary of findings and choices summary the united states shows every intention of retaining nuclear weapons for the foreseeable future thus committing itself to maintaining their sa fety reliability and performance maintenance requires rd nd production while the former require ment is well understood the latter is not this report provides information on production and associated investment people and technology issues production is done for many reasons problems with existing warheads have historically emerged over time and seem likely to do so in the future warhead maintenance requires modifications life extension programs replacement of defective components disa ssembly and reassembly fo r surveillance and similar activities plants and labs make complementary cont ributions to production it appears that all five nuclear weapon states perform maintenance and that all but the united states produce weapons of new or existing design production as any industrial process requires ongoing investment in planning budgets for the plants doe attaches hi ghest priority to production operations because they are fundamental to its ability to s upport the stockpile this priority though has led doe to defer some long erterm investment in such areas as maintenance facility upgrades infrastructure and equipment such deferral impedes work at the plants at the same time doe is investing in some technology and other programs to aid the plants production depends on people there ar adverse demographic trends among scientists and engineers at the plants trends for skilled trades personnel are potentially more serious neg ligible hiring of new pers onnel and the initial hiring of most current personnel between 1977 and 1981 raise the prospect of mass retirements in decade or so while the plants mission is weapons work nonweapons work helps them retain staff members and maintain and develop their skills the labs and plants are developing vast amounts of wea ponsrelated technolo gies the plants focus is on evolutionary advances in products and processes that of the labs on revolutionary advances this technology has profound impact two examples software is changing how nuclear weapon components are designed engineered and produced with comput er models becoming the medium for conducting and linking these steps and ne w technologies and declining work volume are changing the skill mix needed for pr oduction often requiring trades workers to increase skills new technology holds diffe ring implications for different groups the united states has signed the comprehensive test ban treaty some who would abolish nuclear weapons support the tr eaty and reject all but an interim low level weapons maintenance effo rt others believing that this nation can obtain the confidence it needs in weapons only through nuclear testing would reject the treaty support more effort on weapons maintenance and resume testing there appears to be confluence of interest between many who favor the treaty and many who would increase effort on weapons maintenance as the two are arguably complementaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97945contents introduction 1 background 2 nuclear weapon description 6 the nuclear weapons complex 6 d s cu r r n t po sitio n n sto c k p ile ste w r d sh ip n d

ctbt or continue its moratorium on nuclear testing if the treaty does not enter into force and 2 retain and maintain its nuclear weapons fo r the long term without testing doe is developing its ssm program to maintain weapons without testing it defined the program in july 1995 as follows stockpile stewardship includes activities required to maintain high level of confidence in th safety and reliability of nuclear weapons in the absence of underground nuclear testing and to be prepared to resume nuclear testing if so directed by the president stockpile management activities include dismantlement maintenance evaluation and repair or replacement of weapons and their co mponents in the existing stockpile17 any program to maintain weapons is sure to rest heavily on an extensive program of nuclear weapons science and technology because that is the only way to perform certain essentia l tasks without testing monito ring warheads in the stockpile conducting experiments to inve stigate nuclear weapons physics and supply data for computer models evaluating problems that emerge with warheads over time devel oping computer models to pr edict and help solve problems modifying designs or veloping new components mate rials and processes to solve problems certifying that new or rebuilt weapons will f unction as intended and more most in congress and elsewhere accept this sciencebased approach as necessary if the stockpile is to be maintained without testing though some doubt that any nontestbased method can work the role of production in maintaining the stockpile is fa r less well understood for several reasons doe has emphasized the role of rd in maintaining the stockpile policymakers arguably are more familiar with science than with manu facturing and the practical meaning of production has changed during the cold war the term referred mainly to the ma nufacture of large numbers of warheads of new design now it consists of activitie s that require fa

stockpile quantities for the current year and five planning years along with the departments strategy for maintaining and supporting the stockpile the table of stockpile quantities in the presidential decision directive is called the nuclear weapons stockpile planprocedure dual revalida tion procedure in which cu rrently alamossandia team and livermoresandia team review each weapon type has been established various joint doddoe groups coordinate inputs from the joint chiefs of staff the strategic command the assistant to th secretary of defe nse for nuclear and chemical and biological defense programs the assistant secretary of energy for defense programs the nuclear weapons laborat ories and others the main one is the nuclear weapons council or nwc it is composed of the under secretary of defense for acquisition the vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and senior doe representative most recently the deputy secretary of energy designated by the secretary of energy it is responsible for preparing the annual nuclear weapons stockpile memorandum document for the pr esidents signature that specifies how many warheads of each type shall be in the us stockpile it also among other things develops stockpile options and thei r costs identifies options for scheduling of nuclear weapons production and considers safety issu for existing and proposed weapons34 it can make decisions such as sc heduling tasks for weapon life extension programs within the constraints of th nuclear weapons stockpile memorandum35 much of the councils work is done by its standing and safety committee its main mission is to advise and assist the nwc and to coor dinate and provide preliminary approval for most actions that go to the nwc for final approval the committee is chaired by the assistant to the secretary of defense for nuclear and chemical and biological defense programs its vice chair is the principal deputy assistant secretary of energy for milita ry application other members include representatives of the three services th joint staff the strategic command does deputy assistant secretary for military application and stockpile management at present and the deputy assistant secretary of defense for forces policy there are observers from other dod components and th three labs are tec hnical advisers in addition to the nwc and its standing and safety committee there are other joint but lowerlevel coordinating groups definitions production in this report is taken broa dly to mean any industrialtype activities performed on nuclear weapon from or destined for the stockpile as well as on its components or materials th activities include but are not limited to fabrication of components modification of warheads replacement of components or materials the assembly of components into warheads as part of life extensionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97945crs11 programs dismantlement of warheads for subsequent disposition disassembly of warheads for modification or for detailed examination and nonnuclear testing and subsequent reassembly remanufacture of c opies of warheads to more or less the original specifications and modification of warheads for flight tests the hallmark here is physically changing warhead or component from or destined for the stock pile or changing materials into such warheads or components as distinct from performing rd developing computer m odels or building prototypes production activities would also include making complete warheads for deployment but the united states cannot do this at pr esent for reasons noted on page 8 production capability is taken here to mean the ability to produce one war reserve warhead or component it is distinct from capacity which refers to rate the number of units that can be produced in given time current usage of two terms is imprecise warhead refers to the complete nuclear explosive device inc luding its case arming and firing system and so on delivered by missile or artillery it sometimes includes nuclear gravity bombs as well in current usage weapon means warhead or bomb as in nuclear weapons complex or an aircraft or missile fo r delivering them this report uses weapon in all instances to mean warhead or bom b and uses warhead to mean warhead or bomb except where the context makes clear that the reference is only to missile warhead what are new weapons and w eapons maintena nce and what difference do the terms make definition is possible for two terms that appear throughout this report new weapon and weapons maintenance because the terms are themselves weapons in struggle over the role and future of nuclear weapons the debate over the definitions which masquerades as matter of semantics cloaks this larger struggle opponents of new weapons and advocates of weapons maintenance are at opposite ends of the debate all would view w eapon of brandnew desi gn with new desig nation number w97 b102 as new wea pon all would view remanufacturing component to identical speci fications to replace aged its as weapons maintenance in between spectrum of activities might or might not depending on ones point of view produce new weapon or maintain weapons policy treaties interp retation and critic ism may frown upon new weapons accordingly those who would delegitimize the use of nuclear weapons shrink the stockpile and abolish these weapons as soon as possible here called denuclearizers use new weapon inclus ively in hopes that broadening the list of new weapon activities will narro w the scope of us weapons activities those who see strategic value in the nuclear stockp ile for the foreseeable future and would maintain weapons in ready reliable stat here called maintainers use weapons maintenance inclusively if new wea pons are only weapons of completely new design from top to bottom then modifications life extension programs and so on may proceed because new weapons nd weapons maintenance intersect many of these groups core issues definitions of these terms are pivotal for both groupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97945crs12 36 us department of defense and joint chiefs of staff nuclear posture review briefing slides 1994 slide entitled

some rd and production ac tivities on grounds that they are leading to new weapons despite this requirement ma intainers counter that the same dod statement also requires doe to maintain capability to design fabricate and certify new warheads and to demonstrate capability to refabricate and certify weapon types in enduring stockpile37 two dod officials emphasized that the statement on production of newdesign warheads is not ban on production of such warheads and that dod does not want to foreclose production of them rather dod has military requirement for warheads of totally new design at present so there is need for doe to produce them38 denuclearizers respond there is currently such military requirement pa rtly because policy facto opposes new warhead types on two seemingly contradictory grounds such warheads would provoke criticism that the united states sought to evade the spirit of the ctbt and would probably be unacceptable to dod without testing denuclearizers favor first use of nuclear weapons yet see some new weapons or modified ones able to perform new missions as more usable main tainers believe that if weapons are not usable they can scarcely be credible as deterrents case at issue is the b6111 bomb this project m odified the case of an older b61 version to enable it to penetrate the earth thus increasing the damage it can do to buried structures it replaces the b 53 an older bomb with much higher yield that does not meet current standards on safe ty use control etc denuclearizers see the b6111 as new bomb designed to do new mission39 maintainers extend weapon maintenance to cover stockpile maintenance and see the b6111 as needed to permit retirement of the b53 by retaining in the st ockpile the latter weapons capability even as the b6111s reduced yield makes it more usable40 denuclearizers want to extend the ctbt beyond its basic obligation of conducting nuclear explosions to include what they see as its original purpose stopping weapons development they wa nt to proscribe rd and production activi ties leading to new weapons they claim that advances in technology enable thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97945crs13 41 three statements on this policy follow 1 even if we could ignore the russian nuclear arsenal entirely there are unfortunately range of other potential threats to which nuclear weapons are deterrent one cannot rvey the list of rogue states with potential wmd weapons of mass destruction programs and conclude otherwise walter slocombe under secretary of defense for policy prepared statement in us senate committee on governmental affairs subcommittee on intern ational security proliferation and federal services the future of nuclear weapons hearing 105th congress 1st session february 12 1997 washington us govt print off 1997 p 22 2 according to press article robert bell special assistant to the pres ident and senior director for defense policy national security council said clintons nuclear targeting dire ctive reflects much greater sensitivity to the threats posed by chemical and biological attacks since the previous directive was issued in 1981 but he dded that it only reiterates what senior administration officials already have said bout the issue during the past year namely continuednation to produce new weapons without tes ting subverting the ctbt they could not make this claim if new weapons c overed only warheads of entirely new design it is generally agreed that such warheads require testing because an allnew untested warhead entails too many uncertainties for the labs to certify dod to accept or congress to fund maintainers counter th at the basic ctbt obligation cannot be stretched to mean more than what it says because the denuclearizers interpretation is at odds with the nuclear weapon states intention to maintain their weapons which requires rd and production maintainers see confidence in weapon relia bility as essential to credibility and believe that if weapons are to be maintained in reliable condition changes to their design materials and pr oduction processes are inescapable for example the warhead protection program aims to rede sign warheads for submarinelaunched bal listic missiles to make th em less sensitive to aging certifiable without nuclear testing producible by current or future processes and so on denuclearizers see this effort as design leading to producti on of new weapons maintainers see it as maintenance denuclearizers attack work on new w eapons or even the maintenance of existing ones as contrary to the obligation the united states assumed in signing the nuclear nonproliferation treaty each of the parties to the treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effec tive measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament and on treaty on general and complete disarm ament under strict and effec tive international control article vi if the united states cannot honor its own obligations in this area they ask how can it take the lead in asking ot hers to desist from nuclear proliferation maintainers counter that the nuclear ar ms race has effectiv ely ceased the united states and russia are rapidly reducing thei r nuclear stockpiles and the world is not pursuing complete disarmament seriously if at all they believe that us nuclear forces help deter nuclear prolifer ation on grounds that abolition or even deterioration of these forces would magnify the advantage potential adversaries would gain from possessing few weapons and could lead us allies to hedge against that risk by developing weapons of their own they agree with us policy viewing nuclear weapons as of value in terring possession or use of chemical and biological as well as nuclear weapons41 this form of deterrence requires in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97945crs14 41continued that if any nation uses weapons of mass dest ruction against the united states it may forfeit its

9maintainers view that weapons be cred ible both in terms of readiness which requires maintenance and usability different groups use the terms to their advantage for antinuclear activists condemning new weapon is more fruitful for mobilizing protests gaining media attention and generating pub lic interest than pointing out minor modification similarly nuclear weapons complex managers describe their work as weapons maintenance or stockpile maintenance terms that seem more benign than building new weapon the longer report presents in detail w ith many references the 15 findings that support the main points these findings are summarized next findings on production 1 problems with existing warhea ds have historically emerged over time and seem likely to do so in the future if current warheads were perfectly designed and built and retained their initial phy sical condition indefinitely then the united states would not need to make an effort to maintain them however agerelated changes such as cracks in com ponents and decay or corrosion in materials may impair warhead safety reliability and performance warheads sometimes have design or production flaws that are not di scovered until many year s after deployment or vulnerabilities revealed by improved understanding of potential accidents these problems ultimately can be expected to occur more often because warheads will be deployed far beyond the length of servi ce for which they were designed drop in the number of warhead types in the postcold war stockpile can be expected to increase the fraction of that stockpile affected by problem with one warhead type without production the united states would have to choose between continuing to deploy unsafe unreliable or ine ffective warheads or retiring them 2

plants it assigns top priority to meeting operational needs because production is fundamental to does ability to support the stockpile given funding limits this priority has led doe in formulating budgets for the plants to defer investment in areas as diverse as repair maintenance infrastructure facility upgrades technology capital equipment hi ring and training as investment is delayed the funds needed to bring the plan ts to given level of capability cumulate karen clegg who heads kansas city plant said due to overa ll budget constraints in the department of energy we have not been able to apply this funding provided by congress for modernization to address pressing recapitalization and infrastructure requirements as intended even though the workload and mission at my plant are expanding48 it is unclear if does priorities are changing doe is planning substantial investment for the plan ts for fy1999fy2003 but it projects total expenditure for stockpile management for fy2003 to be slightly less than in fy1998 6 plants have much obsolete equipment obsolete equipment can impede the plants work it may break often and is hard to maintain it often lacks capabilities that new technology offers it impedes recruitment as prospective recruits may not want to work with it it may undercut technical tasks for example kcps materials evaluation boratory has three tensile sters machines bought in 1984 that measure materials and finished pa rts for strength when stretched or com pressed they perform well but the comput er that controls them pdp11 from the mid1980s does not the pdp11 prints paper charts that must be analyzed by hand it requires inhouse maintenance because the manufacturer longer supports it one spare circuit board is left when the pdp11 can longer be maintained the tester will have to be operated manually personal computerbased controller one of which is in use runs complex test routines reduces setup time automates data analysis and can link to

and pose risks to production sche dule and to safety summary of findings on people 8 demographic trends among engi neers and scientists that impede nuclear weapons expertise at labo ratories also occur at plants crs study on lab demographics found trends that are adve rse for maintaining weap ons expertise49 these include an increase in average age few new hires and few or people in some skill areas these trends flow from downsizing if total staff size must be reduced then new hires would compel the dismissal of veteran staff members step that managements prefer to avoid because of staff morale and loss of expertise retention of the few staff w ho are newly hired is difficult junior staff fear that they would be most vulnerable to involuntary layoffs and have the mobility that comes with not having made career commitment to the labs with few new staff and with veteran staff members staying average age increases separations are often done on voluntary basis such as by offering retirement incentives which may open gaps in expertise these trends are also in evidence for engineers and scientists at the plants at kcp fo r example there are few young degreed science profes sionals of the 554 such professionals at the plant as of march 1996 only 73 were hired in the decade from 1986 through 1995 with few new staff there is little opportunity for veteran staff members to pass on details of the work and the organizational culture or fo r new staff to pass on their familiarity with new methods and techniques 9 demographics of key skilled trades personnel if uncorrected may leave plants unable to do weapons work over the long term us policy is to maintain nuclear weapons for the long term so doing requires production agency that can sustain itself for th long term yet hiring of machinists welders and other skilled trades work ers doing direct weapons work here abbreviated stww who ma ke nuclear weapons and their components has been negligible at the plants since the mid1980s stww are all union members and under seniority system many we re hired in 19771984 with downsizing beginning in the mid1980s the least senior staff were laid off but had recall

date of first hire at kansas city plant 72 percent of those on the payroll in october 1996 were first hired in 19771981 in work force made up mostly of experienced workers of similar age workers know the cultu re of the plant are skilled at operating their equipment have security clearances and have acquired the specialized skills required for nuclear weapons work on the other hand with mix of ages more experienced workers can hand off skills and institutional memory to younger workers while the latter can bring in fa miliarity with new tec hnologies and methods with hiring of new workers all but impossi ble and with many workers concentrated in narrow band of age and length of service it is likely that many will retire over short period of time opening gaps in criti cal skills these trends cannot sustain the work of the plants beyond the next decad or so doe though envisions further staff reductions at the plants that seem likely to intensify the patterns just discussed for example crs projects that downsiz ing under specified assumptions could result in 93 percent of kcps stww as of 2003 being first hired between 1977 and 1981 it appears that the plants would bene fit by hiring new staff this might be done through apprenticeships slowing the pace of downsizing and buying out recall rights of laidoff workers 10 nonweapons work can help plants retain staff and develop skills in 1989 the navy requested does par ticipation in making the propulsor for the seawolf submarine this part essen tially complex propelle r is about 20 feet tall and weighs tens of tons y12 was tasked with the job in 1990 after the navy failed to receive an acceptable response to three requests for proposals y12 completed the propulsor prototype in 1993 and as of february 1998 continues to manufacture critical components of it and provides technical support to companies doing most of the followon work y12 believe s that work of this type 1 exercises weapon skills such as development of electronic models tooling design welding and machining 2 helps y12 adjust to workload fluctuations by retaining people whose skills are needed but who would otherwise be let go and 3 reduces costs to does weapons program to maintain staff not involved at all times in wea pons work by charging some overhead to clients as another example sandia and kcp have researched and developed min iature lasers for initiating weapons high explosive laser initiation it is hoped would make weapon less vulnerable to unauthorized use and to detonation by spurious electrical signals kcp recently reached an agreement with an aerospace contractor to develop this technology for igniting fuel in aircraft engines work began in march 1996 and continues into fy1998 kcp points to similar technical requirements for lasers on weapons and on aircraft engines such as operation while cycling be tween extreme heat and cold as such kcp expects the work to help develop weapon skills summary of findings

disposition of w eapons and their components it also develops processes for weapons assembly disassembly and dism antlement these processes must be developed for each warhead type because of differences between warheads for example high explosive might be remove d from one type of warhead by mechanical means from another with pressurized water and from third with solvent the labs also have expertis that supports production 12 laboratories are developing revolutionary technologies in such areas as components materials nd processes for use in weapons examples include chemistry laboratory on microchip that can be placed inside warhead to monitor the warheads condition laser that can make such thin cuts in some weapon components that they can be reassembled and re used rather than remanufactured and laser that fabr icates components by melting powdered material building the components layer by layer hundreds of such projects are underway they may increase reliability and ease of fabrication while reducing waste cost and worker exposure to danger ous materials they are often well suited for the smaller lot size likely in future production on th other hand there is concern that these technologies might introduce uncertainties that would reduce weapon reliability weapon designers an alyze potential changes to weapons very closely before approving them but mech anical electrical chemical or other interactions between new and existing weapon components might have unforeseen results for these reasons dod is uneasy about using some of these technologies 13 software is changing how nuc lear weapon components are signed engineered and produced with computer models becoming the medium for conducting and linking these steps much software is being developed commerc ially the nuclear weapons comp lex uses some of it as is modifies some substantially and designs some itself software packages coalesce into new process in which product m oves as computer

have performed sing process step for years now with lower production rates that approach is unaffordable so workers need training in multiple skills while new technology ma eliminate or downgrade some jobs it creates new ones makes workers more pr oductive opens avenues for advancement and often requires increased skill on balance then contrary to the general perception new technology may well benefit workers 15 new manufacturingrelated t echnology holds differing implica tions for the stockpile laboratories plants antinuclear groups and russia this technology will affect each of these entities and doubtless others differently this section sketches what th is technology might mean for three of them potential benefits and risks for the stockpile new technology should increase reliability by reducing worker error and incr easing ease of fabrication it may lower cost it may also create risks modifi ed components may not behave just like the ones they replace possibly causing weapons to fail wouldbe proliferators might find new technologies using simpler designs easier to exploit electronic networks offer wellplaced agent access to much information stakes for the plants new technologies benefit the plants by reducing cost and waste streams and increasing quality replicability and worker safety yet disconnect between technology used by the plants and that used by the labs and industry could arise the labs have th final say over nucl ear weapons production if the plants cannot embrace new technology they will be decreasingly able to meet lab requirements to work with equipment and software used by labs and industry and to negotiate expertly with external vendors they could become unable tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97945crs22 produce to new standards and use new methods even though replicating old components identically would be extremely hard at best concerns for russia nuclear weapons arguably pl ay larger role for russian than for us defense yet russian weapons are said to be much shorterlived than their us counter parts and russian nuclear weapons labs are in serious trouble russia would have difficulty approachin g the pending advances in technology discussed in findings 11 to 13 because of lack of funds and lessadvanced technology infrastructure russia might f eel that it can maintain warheads without testing by remanufacturing them to existing designs if it interprets the us effort as indicating what must be done to main tain weapons without testing however its confidence in its weapons would decline increasing pressure to resume testing choices the united states has three fundament policy choices on nuclear weapons it could seek worldwide nearterm abo lition of these weapons and enter the ctbt as step in that direction it could rej ect the treaty and maintain weapons through robust program that includes underground nuclear testing or it could enter the treaty and try to maintain weapons for the foreseeab future without testing this section discusses alternative approaches for implementing the latter choice which is current policy it critiques these approaches fro m the perspectives of opponents of nuclear weapons and opponents of the ctbt it c oncludes by discussing the relationship between stockpile stewardship and management ssm and the ctbt approaches to maintaining nu clear weapons under the ctbt various approaches might maintain w eapons without nuclear testing this section presents three they are crafted to illustrate the range and consequences of alternatives they are definitions of ideal types not descriptions of actual plans as noted on page 8 does ssm plan is to have robust laboratory effort while re taining but downsizing the plants of the approaches discussed next ssm is closest to lab dominant omnilab the first approach here called mnilab would close the plants and conduct all rd and production at the labs it is divided into two subapproaches under omnilab small the united states would shrink its stockpile to few hundred warheads and would forswear any surge cap acity whether to respond to foreign threat or to replace quickly one type of wa rhead that had been found defective the labs would maintain this stockpile with mainly existing facilities and staff laboratory staff would be familiar with individual warheads and would maintain them on firstname basis using laboratory rather than industria l processes there would be only little new cons truction to install producti on processes not already in place on small scale at the labs omnilab large in contrast would maintain stockpile of few thousand warheads it would require building many production facilities sized for larger workload than the labs can currently handle hiring and training many new production worker s and using industrial methodshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97945crs23 51 for example llnl developed and demonstrated metalinertgas process for using aluminum to weld beryllium components

between the author and alamos national laboratory staff december 1996 52 jonathan weisman alamos takes step back to its roots science march 8 1996 1356either version of omnilab would help maintain the labs by drawing resources to them maintaining the labs is impor tant because only they can certify weapons and must do so annually ce rtification requires strong science especially without testing moreover if the plants cannot resolve the demographic issues and potential for technology disconnect discussed earlier an omnilab could be the nations only choice it would be easier to establish omnilab small which would use mostly existing lab facilities than omnilab large which would not yet either version would require extensive regulatory approvals nd environmental impact analyses and could face legal challenges and public protests it would take years to implement either version and qualify it for production of st ockpiled weapons everything would be changed from the way things were done at th plants the facilities computer models using new vastly more powerful s upercomputers producti on sites which can affect the product51 production processes and for omnilab large workers even the scientific approach woul d be new it would use pred ictive methods and scientific experiments that lead more to first principles understanding of weapon issues rather than emphasizing nuclear tests nd empirical models that are based on past nuclear test data as result eith er version of omnilab would add great uncertainties that could reduce confidence in us weapons omnilab large or small would arguably place the labs at risk it could divert them from rd their core mission to production mission for which they have little recent experience and which appears to be at odds with their culture according to one report when ta55 alamoss plutonium rd facility was proposed as the future site for pit production at firs t lanl alamos national laboratory director sig hecker blanch ed at the proposal worrying that weapons production role would crowd out research and scare away talented scientists52 omnilab large could become trojan horse if the n eed for capacity suddenly were to increase such as to modify hundreds of warheads of one type to correct newly discovered flaw the labs would have to devote many more resources to expansion of capacity the nation would have choice but the dverse consequences for the labs would multiply omnilab small would avoid this problem because the national decision establishing it would accept sharp limits on capacity move to force that omnilab sma ll could maintain few hundred warheads would hold implications that the othe r approaches do not some involve management of the us stockpile the us strategic force comprises bombers ballistic missilecarrying submarines and landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles the triad with few hundred warheads there would be strong pressurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97945crs24 53 for dod perspective on these points see secretary of defense william j perry letter to senator strom thurmond chairman senate armed services committee march 29 1995to eliminate one or two of these elements to save money bombers and submarines are especially costly to operate and maintain spending vast sums for bomber force carrying say 100 warheads would incur imme nse costs per deployed warhead simi larly there would be strong pressure to reduce the number of warhead types deployed as maintaining each type entails cost maintaining each warhead type requires some unique surve illance and production capabilitie s and fixing problem in one warhead type would likely require dedicated experiments and calculations the foregoing concerns could be dealt with by spending the requisite sums which with fewer warheads involved would be ss than current spending otherwise questions might arise regarding the credibility of the us nuclear force this small stockpile would involve international issu as well the united states would be unlikely to go to fo rce of few hundred warheads unless parallel large reductions in british chinese french and russian forces could be negotiated even so britain china and france could surely not agree to proportional reductions reducing their nuclear forces by 90 to 95 percent would leave them with perhaps few dozen warheads apiece scarcely viable or costeffective force very small nuclear force would also magnify the value of each warhead visavis the us force arguably increasing the incentives for nonnucl ear weapon states to go nuclear or for china or revanchist russia to hold warhead s covertly this in turn would increase the importance of monitoring and might necessitate agreements permitting onsite inspection lab dominant under the second approach lab dominant the labs would have robust rd program while the pl ants would do production at low rate much of the plants capacity would be in co ld storage or dismantled the labs would develop more expertise in technologi supporting production they would have more responsibility in manufacturing technology such as producing some components leading and integrating th weapons complex effort to develop advanced manufacturing technology and ove rseeing weapons surveillance testing at the plants lab dominant would arguably help main tain nearterm confidence in weapons better than omnilab large or small doe and dod claim that their joint involvement in nuclear wea pons is beneficial because this arrangement provides checks balances and complementary perspectives53 livermore and alamos make the same argument regarding two separate design labs by the same token conducting rd at separate organizations from production should provide the same benefit by leaving most production at the plants lab dominant would protect the labs from pitfalls of production more over retaining mo re production capacity some of it in cold standby than under either version of omnilab would let doe meet requirements for large production r uns should they be needed to correct warhead flaws that emerged with little or warning despite the best efforts of stockpile stewardshiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97945crs25 on the other hand this approach w ould undercut production capability at the plants by sacrificing investment to meet the daytoday needs of production it might ultimately provide less total steadystate plus surge capacity than omnilab small if the demographic technology and recap italization problems facing the plants were not addressed and steps were not taken to put in place the requisite capacity at the labs if capability at the plants is in jeopardy the expenditures for r ecapitalization might have to be compressed into few years perhaps making them unaffordable or demographic problems and technology disconnects could worsen to the point where restoring the plants becomes impossi ble as such lab dominant could under mine the confidence of us policymakers in us ability to maintain weapons for the long term lab dominant has potential strategic implications declining confidence in us ability to maintain its weapons for the long term could undermine us confidence in its deterrent or less likely the confidence of potential adversaries in the effectiveness of us weapons it coul d also weaken the us position in strategic arms reduction negotiations russia or china might feel less need to make concessions in this area if either felt that us inab ility to maintain its weapons adequately under lab dominant made ilateral us reduc tions inevitable plantlab partnership the third approach plantl ab partnership is defined as follows the plants would conti nue production and would invest more in infrastructure capital equipment etc co rrecting problems noted in findings 57 technology investment would strengthen th eir ability to conti nue productionrelated development of the sorts noted in finding 11 to address produc tion problems and to adapt new technologies such as in findi ngs 12 and 13 to production plants would continue to reduce floorspace in order to consolidate operations and save money the labs would continue strong stockpile stewardship program labs and plants would have partnership cen tered on technology labs would be more responsive to plant needs such as in developing processes to meet production demands or software to track development and pr oduction efforts the balance between production needs and technological opportunity as drivers of lab rd would shift toward the former at the same time the plants would provide feedback on lab technologies would consu lt on producibility issues and would help industrialize lab technology for commercial use compared to the other approaches pl antlab partnership would provide more capability as well as capacity for mainta ining weapons and would most clearly demonstrate us commitment to do so it would let the plants make the most of technology developed by the labs and w ould encourage the plants to influence development of that technology strength ening technical expertise would help the plants retain their autonomy the shift in labplant relations from one of tension few years ago to one of more cooperati on now should make plantlab partnership more sustainable on the other hand plantlab partnership would require substantial investment its scope could also rais arms control problems many nonnuclear weapon states are pressing for nuclear di sarmament and cite the nuclear nonpro liferation treaty as committing the nuclear weapon states as states party to that treaty to work toward that end nonnuc lear weapon states c ould view plantlab partnership the most robust approach as signaling us disinterest in nuclear

comprehensive test ban treaty washington natural resources fense council august 1997 p 24critiques the three approaches just discussed omnilabs lab dominant and plantlab partnership are consistent with the us policy of 1 mainta ining nuclear weapons and 2 doing so without testing some disa gree with that policy so would reject all three approaches one group would elimin ate all nuclear weapons worldwide as soon as possible and until then would have minimal stewardship program at most another group would resume testing on grounds that that is the only way to maintain weapons this section presents views from these perspectives critique by opponents of nuclear weapons those who oppose nuclear weapons hold that the three approaches by trying to maintain weapons indefinitely evade what they see as th central purpose of the ctbt halt to weapons improve ment as prelude to nucl ear abolition the nuclear w eapon states by maintaining their nuclear monopoly perpet uate discriminatory regime with nuclear haves and havenots this conveys to the worl d the message that nuclear weapons are important that they are an essential trappi ng of great power status that their use is possible and legitimate and that the nuclear weapon states will keep them that message in this view undercut s us nonproliferation effort s us security and the ctbt as paine and mckinzie wrote in 1997 if implemented over the next decade as presently planned the ssm program is poised to seriously er ode important nonproliferation policy objectives as well as undermine political assurances the us government provided other nations in connection w ith the indefinite extension of the npt and the negotiation of comprehe nsive test ban treaty indeed over the long term the ssmp poses threat to the strategic relevance of the ctbt itself54 these observers would have curato rtype weapons maintenance program at most until nuclear weapons we re abolished or program of monitoring and guarding warheads until they are dismantled they view nuclear weapons as robust so see all three approaches as spending far more effo rt and money than is needed even if the united states wants to main tain weapons for some time as 1997 press release by three antinuclear groups stated numerous scientific studi have shown that nuclear testing is not needed to maintain the safety and reliability of the nuclear arsenal said robert tiller director of security programs at physicians for social responsibility our nuclear weapons arsenal can be maintained in the future with the same nonexplosive sts and inspections that have been used in the past does approach to the nuclear stockpile should be drastically revised and re defined into passive curatorship not huge pork barrel program for th weapons labs httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97945crs27 55 military production network peace action and physicians for social responsibility national grassroots groups criticize nuclear weapon stewardship plan call for early ratification of ctb press release october 29 1997 p 12maureen eldredge program dir ector of the military production network denounced the skewed spe nding priorities congress needs to ratify the ctb kill the ssm stockpile stewardship and management program and in its place create truly passive curatorship program for our nuclear arsenal55 adherents of this position fear the ma ny efforts to advance technology as leading to new weapon types and increasing pressure to test both to ensure that changes made to existing weapons will work and to enable certification and production of new ones some view these plans as porkbased st ockpile stewardship and management not jobs to do work but wo rk to save jobs they see some of the concerns by ctbt opponents discussed next as overstated even if russia were to have more warheads than the united states what difference would that make if iraq were to develop nuclear weapons how would 2000 warheads be more of deterrent than 500 even drop in the reliability of us warheads would not be critical in this view deterrence arises not from us confidence that us weapons will work but from lack of confidence by others that us weapons will fail this latter is an easier standard to meet of the various approaches advocates of nuclear disarmament would probably dislike omnilab small the least it would support the smallest st ockpile and have the lowest cost it could readily be ratche ted down to maintain fewer warheads but its less formal procedures limited operating capacity and lack of surge capacity would increase the time and difficulty involved in ramping up production or supporting larger stockpile also if serious def ect emerged in warheads of one type this approach would make it difficult for the united states to replace them in timely way while maintaining other warheads omnilab small might thus encourage the united states to reduce further its re liance on nuclear weapons and to enter negotiations for further reductions on the other hand the great fear of advocates of nuclear disarmament is development of new weapons mission the labs would dominate omnilab large or small would enhance the labs whereas plantlab partnership by strengthening plants as well as labs would place greater emphasis on routine maintenance of weapons two ironies attend this critique r obust ssm program might promote nuclear disarmament by delaying the need to test to resolve weapon problem it may be that ssm works well enough to avoid that need but even if it does not the better ssm does the longer testing might be voided us technical ability to conduct nuclear test might diminish over time under the ctbt or test halt as happened for atmospheric testing in the 1958 61 nuclear test moratorium and in the years after the nuclear test ban treaty of 1963 us politi cal will to test might also decline over time as happened with atmos pheric testing after the 1963 tr eaty and as appears to be happening with underground testing following the current moratorium that began in september 1992 the longer that ssm can delay the need to test then the less politically likely and technically capable the united states would be to test even tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97945crs28 56 center for security policy warning to the nuclear labs d ont count on stockpile stewardship to maintain either overhead or

questionable weapons or make whatever fixes could be made without testing second while disarmament advocates belie ve small us effort would suffice to maintain nuclear weapons it does not follow th at wouldbe proliferators could readily develop such weapons especially without tection and response true these nations would not need to approach the comp lexity of us wea pons yet this report suggests that even much simpler weapons would require an elaborate production complex planning building and operatin g it would involve many steps nuclear testing would be but one of these steps and an unnecessary one for simple weapons discovery of any of these steps could rev eal the existence of clandestine weapons program accomplishing such program would therefore be exceedingly difficult costly and timeconsuming though not as the iraqi case shows impossible critique by opponents of the ctbt opponents of the ctbt agree with past and current us policy to maintain nuclear weapons indefinitely and argue that confidence in weapons must be high to ma intain effective deterrence as the only way proven to maintain weapons they w ould conduct an ongoing program of nuclear weapons rd design testing and produc tion though sized to meet postcold war needs as gaffney states responsib and effective st ockpile stewardship program requires an ongoing progra m of lowyield underground testing at least until such time as the various hightech f acilities and technology envisioned under the present ssp are fully validated56 they see nuclear weapons as complicated and note that they deteriorate over time any changes to weapon design materials or production processes or even trying to rebuild warheads to original specifications would they believe inevitably introdu ce changes the armada of weapons related technologies rge and small being developed at the plants and labs hold the potential in this view to magnify these problems these changes may cumulate over time to affect weapon performance drastically moreover without testing the united states could not introduce new weapon ty pes that might be needed to counter advances in weapons or defensive measur by other nations and might be unable to introduce some new safety features57 us confidence in its deterrent would thus erode encouraging wouldbe nuclear st ates to develop nuclear weapons and compelling us allies to develop their ow n nuclear weapons to compensate for lack of confidence in those of the united states this they believe is recipe for nuclear proliferation and for undermining us secur ity in this view only testing can assure confidence as the 1996 repub lican platform stated to cope with the proliferation of weapons of mass dest ruction the united states will have to deter the threat or use of weapons of mass destruction by rogue states this in turn will require the continuing maintenance and development of nuclear w eapons and their periodic testing the

is inconsistent with american security interests58 as omnilabs lab dominant and plantlab partnership all assume that the united states can maintain its nuclear stockpile without sting ctbt opponents would view all three approaches as doomed to failure ctbt opponents would find particular problems with omnilab small because they feel that the force of several hundred warheads that that approach would support would place us security at great risk while the united states could spend the funds needed to maintain triad and mu ltiple warhead types for each triad element ctbt opponents fear that cost pressures woul d lead to cutbacks with severe adverse strategic effects eliminating one or two triad elements would simplify an attack on the force and increase us vulnerability having each triad element carry only one type of warhead instead of two or three as at present would in their opinion make the force fragile serious defect emerging in warhead type would eliminate the entire triad element that carries that warhead another vulnerability would be to hidden weapons or covert w eapon development programs if russia were to hide several thousand warheads nd retained missiles to ca rry them it would suddenly have much larger force than that of th united states onsite inspection in this view would have little prospect of finding such weapons in any nation let alone the worlds largest yet us agreement to such inspections would permit intrusions by other nations still another vulnerability would be that russia and china would have much greater production capacity than woul d the united states under omnilab small so that even an overt decision to break out of an agreement mandating small forces would leave the united states at disadvantage in sum ctbt opponents fear that the small force associated with omnilab small would increase in vulnerability and decrease in credibility over time sharply eroding its deterrent value critique by those who would mainta in nuclear weapons under the ctbt those who would retain nuclear wea pons under the ctbt would likely choose among omnilabs lab dominant plantlab partnership or similar approaches rather than rejecting all of them they would see cost as an issue in the choice omnilab small would probably be the leas t costly approach for the long term if the united states were to have st ockpile of few hundred warheads the labs could maintain the stockpile using mainly existing staff and equipment the operating savings from closing the plants would in this approach probably far outweigh the combined cost s of smallscale

chives and records administration office of the federal register weekly compilation of presidential documents march 24 1997 389omnilab large would arguably be the mo st costly approach because of the large investment needed indeed doe study that considered six major weapon production activities found that except for plutonium component production it would be less costly to do the work at the plants even for stockpile of thousand warheads59 that figure is well below the 2000 to 2500 accountable strategic warheads that the united states and russia listed in the march 1997 helsinki summit stat ement as an objective for start iii60 more recently russia has suggested that the two sides reduce further to perhaps 1500 such warheads in start iii the reason is that establishing production on an industrial scale at the bs would entail high costs requiring the design and construction of new facilities buying pr oduction equipment hiring and training new workers and qualifying the production processes moreover the cost of installing and qualifying new equipment at the labs for surge capacity would likely exceed that of maintaining existing equipment in cold standby at the plants for the sa purpose any decision to close the plants and move production to the labs would therefore need to weigh the cost of establishing new production capability and capacity at the labs against the cost of maintaining the plants lab dominant is likely the cheapest for the short term for stockpile of currently foreseeable size because it defe rs investment yet for precisely that reason it is arguably the least stable for the long term as its shortcomings became manifest lab dominant would likely lead to either form of omnilab or to plantlab partnership lab domin ant may thus be seen as default approach the result of an unwillingness to move production to the labs or to upgrade the plants cost however would not be the only issu or even perhaps the most important one the choice among omnilabs lab do minant and plantlab partnership is basically choice of means and ends plan tlab partnership is endsdriven if the united states wants to retain capacity to maintain stockpile of several thousand weapons and surge capacity it needs the pl ants maintaining the plants requires addressing the three issues that are the core of this report demographics techno logy and recapitalization current demographic trends at the plants will not enable the maintenance of capability over the long term the data presented later in this report see finding 9 show this for kcp discussions indicate that the situation is similar at other plants as well the problem must be solved in the face of downsizing and for crafts personnel the seniority system if this problem cannot

surge capacity and implement omnilab small according to doe if the us were to support stockpile of only few hundred weapons small production capability collocated with its weapons research and development capability would probably be sufficient61 lab dominant seeks the ends of plantlab partnership without the requisite means there may be reasons for so doing the stockpile level is in flux pending russian ratification of start ii start iii negotiations that would follow start ii ratification and possible future agreements certainly the stockpile trend has been downward delaying commitment to plantlab partnership or to omnilab large would avoid spending money th at could be wasted if the united states were to move to very small stockpile moreover funds may simply be unavailable for plantlab partnership even as it is clear that the stockpile will be larger for the foreseeable future than that supportable by omnila b small yet lab dominant has severe problems as noted on page 24 if they cannot be resolved the united states might be forced by default to omnilab large the need to institute that plan quickly would magnify its high costs risks to the labs and stockpile uncertainties given the costs and implications of the three approaches then those who would maintain weapons under the ctbt might favor making an explicit decision among these or other approaches as decision by default is likely to produce poorer results at higher cost lab dominant is in effect decision by default result of an unwillingness either to spend on facilities for maintaining the current stockpile or to shrink the stockpile to level that can be maintained at lower cost lab dominant in turn could lead to omnilab large as nother default decision it would be the only choice available if the plants were to become unsustainable the decision on approach will likely determine us ability to maintain its weapons for the long term it is too important to be made by double defaulthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97945crs32 62 us white house office of the press secretary fact sheet comprehensive test ban treaty safeguards august 11 1995 1 pconclusion ssm and ctbt if the united states chooses to enter ctbt as prelude to abolishing nuclear weapons or to resume nucl ear testing in order to ma intain weapons implementing either choice is conceptually simple implementing decision to enter the treaty and maintain nuclear weapons while avoiding default appro ach to maintenance is more complicated the ctbt might be vehicle for assuring production capability needed to maintain weapons as noted on page 3 president clinton has set forth six safeguardsfor maintaining us security under the ctbt62 safeguards and b make the treaty vehicle for assuring wea pons rd at the same time placing pro duction on stable footing seems crucial for obtaining the ctbt as result it may be possible to link the treaty and production each side in the ctbt debate has pl aced itself in somewhat difficult position ctbt opponents are certainly correct to point out that the united states can maintain its weapons more confidently with testing than without yet it seems unlikely that the united states would conduc t nuclear tests other than for stockpile emergency the exception that president clinton spelled out indeed it is uncertain if the united states would conduct test even then because of concerns over in ternational protests ending the ctbt and advertising the ex istence of major us weapon problem if the senate were to reject the ctbt and the united states did not conduct tests other than for stockpile emergencies so might wonder why the treaty was rejec ted if the united states tested several decades of nuclear testing history suggest that domestic and internati onal firestorm of protes t would surround each test the perceived link between the ctbt nd nuclear abolition places the treatys advocates in an awkward position as well neither congress nor the administration has shown serious interest in nuclear bolition indeed both have acted in tained manner to retain nd maintain us nuclear weapons even under the ctbt the treatys ratification prospects would dim if the senate saw the treaty as leading to abolition yet obstacles to production as described in this report undercut us ability to maintain weapons if these need s continue they coul d raise questions about the us commitment to maintaining weapons and about whether the longterm result of the ctbt would be abolition neither concern would help ctbt prospects moreover as production is needed to maintain weapons production difficu lties could make more likely stockpile emergency of the sort that could lead the united states to resume nuclear testing linking the ctbt and stockpile management might avoid some difficulties just noted to do so however would appear to require substan tial added stockpile management funds such funding commitme nt would likely have to be on long term scale because the treaty itself is of indefinite dura tion funds would be spent on investment at the production agencies i ncluding sandia and alamos in their production roles as well as the plants in areas noted earlier these funds would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97945crs33 needed even if production were to move to the labs the plants might spend say tenth of their added funds to buy technol ogy meeting their specifications from the labs plantdirected rd would make for closer labplant relationships by strengthening the technology link between the two and would increase the amount of technology the labs generated in response to the demands of production the six current safeguards deal with the labs intelligence and test resumption they do not deal with production or acknowle dge that it is indispensable for main taining nuclear weapons for the long term and that it requires ongoing investment in people infrastructure equipment and t echnology possible way to address this concern would be to provide that the unit ed states shall make adequate funds for investment and operations available for production activ ities at nuclear weapon pro duction facilities this provision would refer to producti on activities instead of production to clarify that the concern is not only fabricating complete warheads which is what most people think of as production but also manufacture of components life extension programs repairs modification of warheads for flight tests and so on it could refer to production fac ilities rather than plants because it might be in effect long time while added i nvestment would help the plants survive one cannot predict whether production woul d be done at the labs or plants many years from now given uncertainties on future arms cont rol agreements stockpile size weapons complex demographics and the impact of new technologies such provision if linked to the ctbt could come into effect with that treaty nd maintain production on the same timescale as the treaty or until the world moved to nuclear disarmament ssm and the ctbt then are complement ary strong program of rd and production counters though cannot eliminat the argument against the treaty that the united states will be unable to maintain its nuclear weapons indefinitely without testing unless the nuclear wea pons complex is maintained on an ongoing basis though its capability will diminish that would undermine confidence in weapons over time prospect that could lead the senate to reject the ctbt and the united states to resume testing as an inadequate program of rd and production could lead to defeat of the ctbt and as strong program would weaken the case against the treaty advocates of strong program for weapons maintenance and advocates of the ctbt share
