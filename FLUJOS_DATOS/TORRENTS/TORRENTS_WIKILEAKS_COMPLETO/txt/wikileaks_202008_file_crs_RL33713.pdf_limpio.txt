care provi ders different amounts based on variation in the quality of their services as determined through their achievement on quality performance measures proponents of these payforperformance systems in health care assert that such programs could help improve the quality of care while also helping to control the rate of growth in health care costs payforperformance systems have been implemented for some managed care plans that cover medicaid beneficiaries and recently for medicare physician payments payforperformance system is remuneration arrang ement in which portion of the payments is based on performance assesse d against defined measure typically there is another component of the remuneration that is indepe ndent of the amount at risk while most of the current discussions about payforperformance in the health care industry address qualitybased measures perfo rmance objectives and metrics could target any of number of variables including profitability volume or customer or patient satisfaction the elements common to all payforperformance programs are 1 set of targets or objectives that define what will be evaluated 2 measures and performance standards for establishing the target criteria and 3 rewards typically financial incentives that are at risk including the amount and the thod for allocating the payments among those who meet or exceed the reward threshold for payforperformance program to be successful there needs to be agreement and buyin among those being evaluated that the objectives are fair and the measures appropriate that performance is accurately measured and that the incentives make the effort worthwhile possible shortcomings and unintended consequences of payfor performance program include having inappropr iate measures and objectives competing or uncoordinated efforts insu fficient or inappropriate in centives and placing excessive focus on the reward there are few rigorous objective evaluations of the effect of payforperformance programs initial studies suggest that payforperformance programs can change performance on quality measures that are us ed for the basis of bonus payments but assertions that payforperformance programs are costsaving in the long run are largely unsubstantiated most of the payforperformance legislation that congress has considered recently has centered on the medicare pr ogram although medicaid and private insurers have also garnered some attention number of pay forperformance demons tration projects have been authorized and congress issued direc tive to the secretary of health and human services to develop valuebased purchas ing program for hospital payment by 2009 provision in hr 6111 the tax relief and h ealth care act of 2006 creates voluntary payforperformance

diffe rent amounts based on va riation in the quality of their services as determined through their achievement on quality performance measures proponents of these payforperfo rmance systems in health care assert that current payment systems are typically neutral with regard to differences in quality and that payforperformance programs could help improve the quality of care while they also help to control the rate of growth in health care costs additionally payfor performance has been touted as mechanism that can accel erate the rate of adoption of health information technology and elect ronic medical records and promote the delivery of more preventive services payforperformance systems have been implemented for some managed care plans that cover medicaid beneficiaries and proposals for establishing payforperforman ce systems for medicar services continue to come before congress this report examines the factors that need to be considered when evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of payforperformance system in health care the report first discusses the conceptual f oundation for payforperformance systems and then addresses their strengths potential shortcomings and unint ended consequences following discussion of the potential for payforperformance systems to control the growth in health care costs the report examines the track record of payfor performance programs in health care keeping an emphasis on experiences in the private sector and in public demonstration projects th report then summarizes the payforperformance proposals c ontained in bills that have been introduced before congress and examines potential legislation likely to come before the congress in the coming yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33713crs2 1 although often used interchangeably payforperformance can also be considered one dimension of broader set of concepts colle ctively known as valuebased purchasing proponents of valuebased purchasing emphasize the focus of each decision maker such as an insurer employer or patient on assessing differences in perceived value whether it be in efficiency quality cost or some othe r measure when choosing among options the value assessment can be specific to each cision maker and proponents of the concept prefer the positive connotation of maximizing value typically emphasizing quality when making health care purchasing decisions valuebased purchasing approaches emphasize the collection and analysis of data on quality the dissemination of quality information to providers and beneficiaries and the selectiv rewarding of identified highquality achievers through contracts partnerships or incentives see for example the testimony of robert berenson md before the subcommittee on health of the house committee on ways and means september 29 2005 critics of payforperformance approaches object to the explicit assessment of health care providers against specified standard and to linking provider reimbursement to these measures even though many of the activities are similar to those used for valuebased purchasing the version of s 1932 originally passed by the senate in 2005 included provisions for blishing value based purchasing under medicare with details that reflect ed payforperformance structure 2 for example some corporate officers may have part of their compensation tied to the value of company stock or some other measure of performance 3 see for example the testimony of karen ignagni president and ceo americas health insurance plans before the house committee on education and the workforce

remuneration arrangement in which portion of the payments is based on performance assessed against defined measure typically there is another component of th remuneration that is independent of the amount at risk the terms merit and bonus pay are also used to describe similar systems1 while most of the current discussi ons about payforperformance in the health care industry address qualitybased measures perform ance objectives and metrics could target any of number of variables including profitability volume or customer or patie nt satisfaction payforperformance systems are not new the code of hammurabi c 1750 bc the set of statutes from ancient mesopotamia that ranks among the oldest collections of extant laws in history clearly established payment system that rewarded practitioners differentially based on the quality of the outcome of their services more recently payforperfo rmance systems for executive compensation have become more common in many industries2 health insurance company representatives have testified that payforperformance efforts have been implemented in the private market since the late 1990s and that payforperformance programs are growing in number and

based on quality in seminal 1999 report to err is human building safer health care system the iom called for initiatives to reward quality in the 2001 report crossing the quality chasm new health system for the 21st century the iom called for an increase in payments to providers of high quality care4 this was followed in 2006 by the report performance measurement accelerating improvement mandated as part of the medicare modernization act pl 108173 which recommends th creation of national system for performan ce measurement and reporting to be financed annually through funds appropriated from the medicare trust funds one recommendation urges purchasers and insurers to redesign payments to encourage providers to make positive changes to their care processes in its most recent report rewarding provider performance aligning incentives in medicare the iom came to two conclusions regarding payforperformance as payment st rategy for medicare 1 using payment incentives to reward quality and quality improvement can serve as powerful stimulus to drive institutional and provider behavior toward better quality but 2 payforperformance incentives alone would be insufficien t without certain operating conditions such as the use of electronic health records public reporting beneficiary incentives and education of boards of directors5 these iom reports have been influential in bringing attention to the need for quality improvement in health care and calling for variable payments based on quality medpac for many years medicare payment advisory commission medpac has recommended paying providers different rates based on differences in quality in its march 2004 report medpac recomme nded that congress establish quality incentive payment policy for all medicare advantage plans and establish quality incentive payment policy for physicians and facilities providing outpatient dialysis services6 medpac added hospitals home hea lth agencies and physicians to its

unded by setting aside 1 or 2 of budgeted payments9 also of note is an open letter published in 2003 from health care industry leaders who recommend that payment for performan ce should become top national priority and that medicare payments should lead in this effort the signatories represented many research academic and insurance groups and included veral former center for medicare and medicaid serv ices cms administrators the group noted that it was not suggesting that such an initiativ be dominated by government but that major initiative by medicare to pay for performance can be expected to stimulate similar efforts by private payers10 theory and conceptual foundation payforperformance systems can be structured in many ways incentives bonuses and especially performance cr iteria can be based on any number of dimensions however the elements common to all payforperformance programs are 1 set of targets or objectives that define what will be evaluated 2 measures and performance standards for establishing the ta rget criteria and 3 rewards typically financial incentives that are at ris k including the amount and the method for allocating the payments among those who meet or exceed the reward threshold the relationship between value and price has long engaged economists who share agreement on the precise relationship however when considering an economic commodity such as good or service the price which is actual and observable typically increases systematically but not proportionately with the value which is latent and unobservable11 economic theory holds that individual decision makers compare their implicit assessment of value against the explicit price to make optimal purchasing decisions in most markets th is comparison works reasonably well with knowledgeable buyers having sufficient in formation about competing products and services to keep overall prices in line with aggregate valuations of the goods or serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33713crs5 12 donabedian developed the quality measurement model targeting structure process and outcome measures that has become widely acce pted and used as the basis for much of the work addressing quality and outcomes for further details see donabedian explorations in quality assessment and monitoring vol 1 the definition of quality and approaches to its assessment ann arbor health administration press 1980 13 quality adjusted life year qaly is construct developed to adjust for differences in the quality or value of year of life because of morbidities year in perfect health would have value of 10 qaly while the value of year in ill health would be discounted to some fraction less than one depending on the conditionin health care this relationship betw een value and price has been tenuous or nonexistent because buyers and payers are not typically the patients who receive the care the asymmetry of information on both th part of the providers with the medical expertise and the buyers with knowledge of personal or group health status has meant that neither the buyer nor seller has transparent access to information in addition the presence of insurers as thir dparty payers has removed much of the incentive for price consciousness payments to health care providers histor ically have not been determined in classical free market through the interac tion of supply and dema nd and consequently most insurers have not made any distincti ons in payments to providers who exhibit differences in quality reimbursements have been tied to other dimensions of care for instance efficiency or low cost pay forperformance programs are an attempt to bring this relationship between prices and value as reflected in quality care into closer balance in theory payforperformance programs in health care would be less compelling if atrisk buyers were fully informed about quality differences objectives and targets the objectives and targets specified in payforperformance system are the explicitly identified priorities and goals against which progress and achievement are to be measured while most current di scussions about payfo rperformance address quality improvement and qualitybased measures these are only one possible dimension the objectives could address any number of goals including costs of care quantity of services delivered or some combination including quality there are four types of performance meas ures typically used in measuring the quality of health care activity clinical out come measures process measures structural measures and patient satisfaction measures12 methods of defini ng and collecting data to address these different objectives vary in complexity and difficulty clinical outcomes are the preferred standard but are rarely possible to collect in health care accurately assessing the c onsequences of particular treatment upon the eventual outcome may require long time for instance the ultimate outcome for patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes or hy pertension might be the number of additional years of life adjusted for quality following treatment13 process measures often address the proper delivery of health care services and practice patterns eg the use of diagnostic screening for those who present with set of symptoms or the dispensing of medicati ons such as betablockers to patients withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33713crs6 14 for example an index of 20 articles on vari ations in clinical practice patterns can be found at httpcontenthealthaffairsor gwebexclusivesindexdtlyear2004 15 for more discussion of health information technology and quality see crs report rl32858 health information technology pr omoting electronic connectivity in healthcare

health care are not associated with the technical quality of their care annals of internal medicine may 2 2006 144966572heart attacks process measures are easier to gather but are not necessarily consistent with clinical outcomes research on the evidence base for clinical practices is ongoing but much of the variation in care is likely to remain unexplained for the foreseeable future14 quite often process meas ures tend to focus on underu of services and may thus be costincreasing in the short run structural measures that have been used in health care payforperformance programs include for example addressing whether organizations have adopted health information technology hit that allows ectronic medical record s to be created and sent some of the medicare demonstration projects include incentives to promote the use of hit through payforperformance programs15 finally patient satisfaction measures are sometimes used in payforperformance programs but can be contr oversial proponents point out that patient satisfaction measures are relatively easy to collect and some research suggests that patient satisfaction is positively linked to patient compliance and better clinical outcomes these measures often reflect the value that patients place in the service or consumption dimension of health care and physician communication is the factor most strongly associated with high patient satisfaction score16 however critics question the usefulness of pa tient satisfaction measures for example one study of elderly patients found rela tionship between patient sa tisfaction and the technical quality of the care17 partly as consequence of this difference in perspectives patient satisfaction measures are typically given less weight usually less than 20 when they are used at all measures and performance standards ideally performance is evaluated using metrics that capture and assess the behavior that has been determined to be causally related to the objectives the performance reward standards are the benc hmarks or thresholds established to determine which of the elig ible bonus recipients actually qualify for extra payments standards can be either absolute or relative with different implications for what behavior is being rewarded ab solute thresholds such as re quiring that 95 of patients brought to hospital following an acute myocardial infarction receive aspirin within an hour or that 100 of pneumonia patient s are counseled about smoking cessationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33713crs7 would reward actual levels of achievement one advantage of having specific targeted objectives is that there is uncertainty on the part of those being evaluated about whether they have met the standard whereas relative ranking is not revealed until later time however absolute thresholds may offer less of an incentive for those already above the criteria who may not see any motivation to improve beyond their current practice or for those far below the criteria who may feel that any effort to improve may be futile absolute standards may not allow for flexibility when trends outside the control of health care providers shift the experience for large portion of the population such as when insurers substa ntially change their coverage policies or when epidemics strike relative standards or rankings focus on the position of each provider when compared with peers typically relative rankings can be used to reward improvement such as when provider moves from the third quartile into the second but high achievers have little oppor tunity to improve their alr eady favorable relative portion if incentives are successful in altering provi der behavior and pr actice patterns the distribution of providers along the quality measure is likely to compress as the spread contracts differences in ranking and quantiles may represent little practical significance for instance if the difference between being in the top decile or the second becomes the difference between score of 985 or 99 and relative rankings and quantiles may not be useful distinction many existing payforperformance systems in health care incorporate both types of standards applying both types of standards offers the possibility of both rewarding high achievers and stimula ting improvement by lowerra nked providers for example an assessment prior to the implementation of payforperformance program may produce distribution across providers from wh ich baseline can be established this baseline perhaps the cutoff point that defines the bottom quantile might then be made the absolute criteria that all providers must meet over defined period providers would then be eligible for bonuses if th ey improved their relative ranking eg moved from the bottom half of the distribution to the top half or if they exceeded minimum or qualifying threshold incentives and bonus payments the size and source of the incentives and bonus payments may have the most significant role in determining how much of change in behavior eventually results laudable objectives accurately measured nd fairly evaluated may produce very little or change if the payoff is insignificant on the other hand di sproportionately large incentives can lead to substantial changes in behavior even if the objective is misguided or misaligned with the incentives in addition whether the payments at risk are perceived as potential gain or potential loss may affect the likelihood of be havior change the incentive pool can be funded either by infusing new funds or by redistributing existing funds adding new money can allow for the status quo to be th worstcase scenario but the consequence in the short run will be more expensive total compensation package with other redistribution of existing payments such dditional funds would simply be potential gain and there would be less resistance to such change on the part of providers however if the bonus payments were funde d by withholding fraction of existinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33713crs8 payments then the zerosum situation w ould create winners and losers and there would be greater potential for objections to the implementation of such system from those being evaluated competitive and nonco mpetitive rewards differences in the structure of payforperformance programs can lead to rewards that are earned either competitively or noncompetitively with di fferent implications for budgets and for those being evaluated two dimensions are critical 1 whether the performance criteria are absolute or relative and 2 whether the bonus pool c ontains fixed or an openended uncapped amount of funds varying these two dimensions creates four possible scenarios see table 1 table 1 payforperformance program characteristics and effects on the competitiveness of the reward bonus pool fixed openendedperformance standardsabsolutecertainty about qualification uncertainty about the amountcertainty about qualification certainty about the pre determined amount relativeuncertainty about qualification certainty about the amountuncertainty about qualification certainty about the pre determined amount source crs absolute performance standards combined with bonus pools that are not capped lead to noncompetitive bonus awards participants w ill be fully informed bout whether they have reached the bonus thre shold as well as the amount of the bonus assuming that the reward is clearly identified in advance participants only need to know how they performed against the qualifying threshold and do not need to know how others performed to determine whethe r they qualify for the reward if the amount of the reward is previously determined partic ipants will also have knowledge about how much they might gain should they ach ieve the standard this is the least competitive type of payforperformance program exemplified by the quality and outcomes framework in place in the united kingdom see below and typically requires additional monies to fund the bonus pool if the bonus pool is fixed but the perform ance standards are absolute then the award becomes competitive the number of providers who meet the performance standard and qualify for the extra payments could determine the size of the bonuses when the amount of money provided for incentives is fixed the bonus amount for each provider decreases as the number of providers who qualify increases forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33713crs9 instance if the bonuses are funded by fr actional withholding nd everyone qualifies then the best provider can hope for is to recover the full amount before the contribution to the incentive pool as the number of providers who qualify for the incentive payments falls the amount of bonus per provider increases because the pool is divided among fewer recipients if the amount of the bonus pool is not ca pped but the qualifying standard is relative measure then the rewards are also competitive again assuming the reward is clearly agreed to in advance partic ipants would know how much is at stake but would not know whether they qualify to receive the bonus until their performance is assessed against their peers for instance payforperformance program may reward only the top 10 but will give those who qualify predetermined bonus participants would then balance the potential gain ag ainst their likelihood of achieving top 10 status the premier hospital demonstration uses this reward structure see below finally if the amount of the bonus pool is capped and the qualif ying standard is relative the rewards are also competitive participants will not know whether they qualified for the bonus until their relative standing is known but may know how much the bonus will be if only predetermined percentage of peers will receive bonuses from fixed pool or alternatively if the reward is predetermined fixed amount the relationship between the number of qualifying recipients and the amount of the bonus creates tradeoff between larg er incentive in response to bigger bonus payment and the proportion of the pool who achieve the standard and are therefore eligible for the extra payments from po licy standpoint if the objectives are truly desirable eg accurate measures that tr uly improve the quality of patient care then the more who meet stringent standard the better however because the size of each payment decreases as more recipients qualify the incentive effect becomes more diluted with wider success if there is distribution along the performance scale then one parameter available to balance this effect is to set the qualifying standard at level high enough so that not everyone meets the threshold but low enough so that it is potentially achievable for enough of the popul ation targeted to encourage widespread effort the payforperformance program pr oposed as part of s 1932 in the 109th congress most resembled this structure see below the bill would have required all the payments withheld to create the bonus pool to be distributed as awards but allowed for an uncertain number of recipients one advantage of payforperformance fra mework is that it can be incorporated into all types of existing provider payment schemes from feeforservice to capitation to salary this flexibility has helped th popularity of payforperformance programs as payers do not have to completely undo th eir existing payment structure to add pay forperformance component in essence payforperforman ce system functions as secondary source of payment that operates in conjunction with th main remuneration arrangement if new monies are introdu ced to the payment system to fund the bonus payments then the original payment system remains intact if the funds for bonus payments are created by withholding some portion of the primary payment system then this can either be done prospectively as in the case of prepaid capitation or salaried arrangements or retrospectivel through adjustments with feeforservice after total service quantitie s and payments are known httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33713crs10 18 see for example cannon mf payforp erformance is

maker directly responsible for changes in th standard being measured accountability without responsibility is in appropriate and pot entially counterpr oductive similarly unmerited rewards are inefficient and inequitable identifying and attributing cause and effect with regard to improvements in health can be difficult or even impossible health improvements may result from multitude of factors in addition to health care furthermore health care interventions are often collaborative efforts that may not be attribut able to single individual or health care provider therefore determining the marginal contribution of each team member can be difficult and may engender unnecessary nd undesirable conflic ts of interest in practice payforperformance programs vary substantially in whom they hold accountable and reward indi vidual physicians physician groups hospitals managed care plans and even patients have been the subject of performance measures evaluation and reward because it is possibl for more than one payforperformance program to be in effect at the same time it is conceivable that some patients and providers might earn bonuses from health plan that in turn might be evaluated under payforperformance program this wide ranging experience in payfo rperformance program design has not yet produced evidence nor even consensus on the most effective structure for health care payforperformance programs recently in itiated payforperformance programs take on many forms as discussed in later sec tion some argue that managed care plans are best suited to payforperformance programs because their wide if not comprehensive range of health care services most clos ely match their respons ibilities for the overall health care for its enrolled beneficiaries18 until more payforperformance evaluation studies are completed that produce eviden ce identifying characteristics of the most effective and efficient programs the variation in payforperformance designs is likely to continue possible shortcomings and unintended consequences while payforperformance offers the potential for improving quality and efficiency the success of such programs depends critically on the design and implementation the complex interactions between incen tives rewards and other market factors can produce perverse in centives and counterproductive results if measures and objectives are not appropriate ly established or ar poorly constructed the following discussion identifies number of considerations that will determine the effectiveness of payforperformance systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33713crs11 19 cannon mf op cit 20 statement by lisa m latts md mba msph vice president programs in clinical excellence wellpoint inc during the 4th annual quality and payforperformance conference boston ma aug 68 2006inappropriate measures and objectives appropriately matche d objectives and incentives expressed through the chosen measures metrics and standards for achievement are critical to the success of any payforperformance system if incentives for performance are not well aligned with the objectives resources will be inappropriately diverted providers may lose faith in program that doesnt accurately capture their honest efforts undermining the credibility of the program and the confid ence of those being evaluated with this understanding the iom has recommended th at congress create national quality coordination board nqcb and that this boa rd in collaboration with federal agencies and privatesector stakeholde rs formulate and promptly pursue research agenda to support the development of national system for performance measurement and reporting this agenda would include development implement ation and evaluation of new measures to address current gaps in performance measurement applied research focused on underl ying methodological issues such as risk adjustment sample size weighting and models of shared accountability design and testing of reporting formats for consumer usability and valuation of the performance m easurement and reporting system competing or uncoordinated efforts the overlap between health care providers and insurers is complex with most providers accepting patients who are covered by myriad of insurers if payfor performance systems differ across insurers providers will be striving to satisfy multiple performance standards simultaneously and the effects may be diluted while some of the performance measures may be common particularly around clinical areas for which the evidence base is convincing nd there is consensus there may be areas where different measures can develop some proponents ve argued that competition in this area will be beneficial because th insurance companies will be stimulated to innovate and consumer s either employers selectin g among insurance companies or employees selecting among plans will make decisions based in part on which pay forperformance program is most successful however it may be measured19 competition across performance standards might also lead to initiatives that addressissues other than quality these approach may not fully acknowledge the potential for inefficiency brought about through n ear redundancy or even conflicting objectives in contrast representative from large insurance company has stated that the company does not wish to develop its own payforperformance system and is waiting for consensus to develop on set of the mo st appropriate measur and standards that it can then adopt 20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33713crs12 related concern is that any pay forperformance system proposed and implemented by medicare as the market leader would crowd out other innovations as the largest payer and market leader th at sets trends ofte n followed by private insurers medicares payforperformance activities will be closely watched and possibly copied insufficient or inappropriate incentives the incentives under payfo rperformance system must be both appropriate to modify behavior toward the desired objec tive and sufficient to induce the effect mismatched activities and targets and bonuses that dont elicit the desired results will lead to inefficiencies as with most incentives there is ra nge of possible responses including change in behavior those for whom th costs of achieving the bonus threshold exceed the potential gains may not exhi bit any behavioral changes and become frustrated at the other extreme bonus pa yments to those who already meet the standard may not produce any changes in behavior either but will reward them for standards they already have reached or exceeded in this case the justification would be to provide incentive for those providers to continue to maintain high level of care the design of incentives is most criti cal for the group that would change its behavior towards the desired outcome if incentives were sufficient the difference between the costs of meeting the threshold and the potential gains to be realized will be different for different providers under different circ umstances consequently the policy implications will vary depending on the population the activity targeted and the size of the potential bonus the appropriate size of the ideal in centive will vary depending on what group and which objectives are being targeted wh ile medpac has suggested that 1 or 2 of total payments be withheld to fund the bonus pool this figure may reflect very different incentives across providers for ex ample physician in solo practice who has annual gross reve nues of 250000 half of which comes from medicare would face potential bonus payment of 2500 while hospital with nnual gross revenues of 300 million 60 of which is medicare related will have over 36 million at risk under the payforperformance system in th case of the physician the amount may not come close to the costs of meeting th payforperformance criteria considering the cost of acquiring the necessary information systems hardware and software that may be needed in addition to the hiring and or training required of the staff on the other hand the hospital not only has much of the fixed costs of compliance in place including automated systems and clerical st aff but the amount of the payment at risk would almost certainly make the effort worthwhile similarly some have argued that payforperformance is best suited for ma naged care companies who not only would have significant amounts at stake but would stand to recoup the benefits of any potential cost savings because of the vertically integrated nature of the carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33713crs13 21 trude s au m and christianson j health plan payforperformance

will increase the caution is that you get what you measure and non targeted areas may suffer as result some other positive efforts that may be more difficult to measure are not fully underst ood or simply not targeted could end up being neglected or underappreciated payforperformance and cost control payforperformance systems are not inherent vehicles for cost containment advocates of payforperformance believe that successful payforperformance programs will lead to improvements in quality and provider efficiency which in turn will lower cost21 however this assertion is not necessarily true nor is there substantial evidence to support this position one review of the existing research finds that there are only nine randomized controlled trials of the effectiveness of payfor performance systems and many of the studies are limited to single indicator or aspect of care22 while randomized controlled trial may be the gold standard for isolating and identifying the true eff ectiveness of an intervention such experiments are rarely possible in social policy contexts pay forperformance systems could potentially be costsaving but also may be costincreasing and to examine how this might occur requires more systematic analysis of the mechanisms for change considered simply quality improvement involves doing the wrong things less often andor doing the right things more frequently in practice quality can improve by reducing or eliminating overuse or misuse while increasing underuse the difficulty comes in translating these gene rally innocuous concepts into identifiable actions and activities in health care to the extent that quality improvement measures in payforperformance systems incorporate measures of underuse then the shortte rm consequence of quality improvement would be higher cost of car whether the longterm costs would be lower as result of this shortterm increase would depend on the ability of the care to offset potentially more expensive care late r on examples might include the increased administration of vaccines or the early detection of treatable cancers if the quality improvement is achieved by eliminating overuse or misuse the potential for cost savings is more direct not only would th direct costs of the inappropriate care be avoided but the negative consequences that lead to complications and additional care such as nosocomial infec tions would be preventedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33713crs14 23 institute of medicine rewarding provider performance aligning incentives in medicare national academy press washington dc 2006in practice the current state of medi cal knowledge management practices and policy environment is insufficient for the identification of what the appropriate level of care is in most clinical situations there is movement towards more evidence based medicine but the state of the knowle dge base is still in its early stages23 the existing examples of payforperformance in health care and their evaluations reflect some of the shortcomings of the abse nce of true experimental design and the limitations that call for reservations in generalizing the findings even if payfor performance produces the successes claimed in the sample population the differences between the sample and non sample populations mean that study findings cannot be simply inflated and extrapolated to repr esent population results for instance it would not be reasonable to assume that the results obtained in the subsample of hospitals that participated in the premier demonstrati on would be reproducible in the remaining premier hospitals that did not participate in the dem onstration let alone all non premier hospitals similarly measures selected for the demonstration project and other current payforperform ance efforts are likely to include the lowhanging fruit in the orchard of possible measures and further successes are likely to become more difficult to achieve the design of payforperformance programs can also affect the potential for cost savings the incentive fund for bonus payments can be created by adding more money to existing payments or by withholding fraction of payments while larger bonus payments may create more of an incentive they also create an additional hurdle to achieving overall cost savings if new mone is used the payforperformance program would need to generate prog ram savings that equal or exceed the new bonus payments for these and other reasons most of the claims of costcontrol based on extrapolations of current pa yforperformance expe riences are difficult to quantify and may be overstated while payforperformance systems that emphasize quality objectives and measures have the potentia l for improving health and health care delivery the degree of absolute and relative improvement possible in disparate settings and the costeffectiveness of the efforts remains unknown httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33713crs15 24 institute of medicine

evaluations of the effect of the programs initial studies suggest that payforperformance programs can change performance on quality measures that are used for the basis of bonus payments but despite

been cited as evidence that payforperformance or more accurately in this case payforreporting works well and that incentive payments do not need to be very substantial in order to achieve significant results29 more realistic assessment of this result might be that hospitals would have been imprudent to leave money on the table since the quality measures are widely used and already reported for
