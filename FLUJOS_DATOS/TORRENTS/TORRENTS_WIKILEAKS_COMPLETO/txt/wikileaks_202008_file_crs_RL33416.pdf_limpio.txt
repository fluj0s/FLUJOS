the state has reserved the authority to arbitrarily determine which protest activities are acceptable it has not developed adequate institutions that protect human ri ghts cede political power to social groups ensure judicial independence and resolve social conflict many small demonstrations have been tolerated but marching organizing and talking to reporters have brought harassment and

legal system protecting farmers land raising rural incomes increasing social spending on health care and education and abolishing the national tax on farmers however these policies will likely be resisted by local officials whose power remains unchecked and who are desperate to attr act investment and prone to corruption25 the prc government at the national and local levels has applied carrot

study of popular protests in chinain the past several years demonstra tions have become larger and better organized sometimes involving several workplaces or villages with successful protests providing lessons for succeeding ones42 linkingup has become more common with the aid of the internet email bulletin board forums blogs instant messaging cell phones text messaging and video recording technology several protest movements in guangdong in the past year were notable for the help that came from new breed of political activist in china the protests in taishi for example attracted an experienced rural activist dissident intellectual and civil rights attorney gao zhisheng some democracy activists conscious of the good public image that beijing hopes to project in the run up to the 2008 olympics reportedly are attempting to spark greater protest activity43 following the shooting incident in dongzhou group of prominent political dissidents and critics submitted an open letter on the internet condemning the gove rnments use of vi olence and calling for democratic reforms44 the regional and local press has been fairly aggressive in reporting on the more sensational protest events often by the time the government clamps down on such news word of thes events has already spread another troubling development for the chinese government is the eruption of public demonstrations in areas of heavy fo reign investment and well developed communications and transporta tion links to the outside comparisons with other social movements unlike other social movements in the postmao era the recent social unrest lacks political goals and organizational strength although its potential to help undermine the power of the prc government may be growing it is not movement led by urban intellectuals focused on national politics such as the democracy wall movement of 1979 the student protes ts of 1986 the tiananmen democracy movement of 1989 and china democracy party of 199798 nor does it possess national chain of command as did the fal gong demonstrati ons of 1999 rather social unrest of the early 21st century primarily reflects local economic grievances is both urban and rural nd remains largely unorganized at the national level mass protests in china are not new political observers have described social unrest among farmers and workers since the early 1990s45 however recent demonstrations have been broader in scope larger in average size greater in frequency and more brash than those of decade ago furthermore todays social unrest has helped to bring bout fundamental policy deba in the communist party regarding the pace of economic reforms httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33416crs14 46 xiaobo lu taxation protests and instability asia program special

protest movement in china workers and peasants in china lack organizational linkages not only to each other but also to other social groups that ve led protest movements in the past such as students and intellectuals46 first many analysts argue that social activities and organizations in china tend to be cellular and calized rather than horizontal or involving counterparts else where for example workers generally have attempted to resolve their grievances within their own factories and appeal to enterprise managers rather than to workers in other factories this identification with the enterprise is reinforced by common living areas and dialect and the lack of broader forms of collective identity or solidarity such as trade union or church47 similarly rural protests despite their numbers have remained largely isolated andscattered with narrow econo mic demands directed at cal officials and not the communist regime second according to ma ny analysts educated and middle class chinese have largely benefitted from the ri sing economy have not been affected by the demonstrations and have shown li ttle inclination to champion the poor however mass demonstrations have grown in size and s ophistication in recent years patience with the central government in righting local government abuses has been wearing thin and small but potent cadre of activists and intellectuals has persisted in helping aggrieved groups 48 political ramifications growing disparities of income official corruption and the lack of democratic institutions are likely to continue to fuel social unrest both the central and local governments have been successful at defusi ng many conflicts nd generally avoiding major incidents such as the one in dong zhou the prc government is likely to be able to contain protests in the medium term through policies that mix accommodation and violence and that promote economic grow th most analysts do not expect current social unrest to evolve into national po litical movement unless other social groups particularly the new middle class intellectuals and students join the fray key dilemma for the chinese communist leadership is how to promote economic growth in order to maintain legitimacy particularly among the growing middle class and professional intellectual and business elites while also redistributing wealth and providing economic opportunities to the poor according to some analysts the need to address social unrest may discourage the prc government from adopting foreign policies that would jeopardize economic and diplomatic

dream bbc news online january 17 2006wen jiabao have stated that they are preoccupied with the problem of rural unrest49 other analysts speculate that the prc government may incite nationalist fervor as distraction from social issues or even to make foreigners the target of popular frustrations some prc officials suggest that the level of social unrest in china has been exaggerated by the western media an agriculture minister stated if there are 30000 villages having problems that accounts for only 1 of the total people have to look at this from national perspec tive and against backdrop of phenomenal social and economic changes taking place50 one analysis deduced that on the basis of the estimated frequency of police casualties 1 for every 35 protests violent outcome with fierce confrontation is not the rule51 some scholars argue that the most important factors in deter mining the political impact of social unrest in china are not the size and frequency of prot ests but the leadership and relationships to other social groups52 most prc leaders appear to agree nonetheless on the need to respond to social unrest before it b ecomes worse and threatens their hold on power statements by president hu jintao and premier wen jiabao have signaled retrenchment from the breathtaking capitalist reforms promoted by former president jiang zemin in an effort to redistribute national wealth to poor er regions and rural areas this leftward tilt may not only fit the ideological inclinations of hu and wen but also provide way of addressing so of the causes of social unrest without adopting political reforms53 impact on foreign investment so far social unrest reportedly has not discouraged foreig n investment overall which continues to grow and remain insulated from most protest incidents while risk assessments for china have improved or remained stable in the past two years54 nonetheless most analyses of risk factors in china make prominent note of socialunrest and its potential threat to the count rys social economic and political stability and its relations with the united states some analysts assert that despite lower costs some foreign investors in china may
