response to this challenge president bush made social security reform the key focus of his 2005 domestic social policy agenda on february 2 2005 the president laid out specifications for system of voluntary individual accounts to be phasedin as part of reformed social security system administration officials concede that the individual accounts themselves do not alleviate the solvency problem the individual account proposal would likely make the solvency problem worse over the next 75 years the president stated that these accounts are just one piece of comprehensive social security reform package and that additional measures will be needed to achieve longterm solvency under the presidents 2005 individual account proposal individuals born prior to 1950 would have experienced change in their social security benefits individuals born in 1950 and later would have had the option to participate in social security individual accounts ias workers who chose to participate in ias would not have been permitted to optout of the ia system workers would have been allowed to divert up to 4 of their payroll taxes to ias subject to dollar limit that increased over time but on average people would have had to earn at least 33 per year after inflation to break even this would have occurred because in addition to administrative costs their traditional benefits would have been reduced or offset by the amount of their contributions plus 3 year in interest the proposal did not include minimum benefit guarantee to ensure that participants would receive total benefit at least equal to the poverty threshold analyzing the presidents 2005 ia proposal using assumptions on investment returns and administrative costs provided by the social security administration crs found that the total of the reduced social security benefit plus the annuity that would have been available using the actual ia balance would have exceeded social security currentlaw promised benefits if the account earned the 46 annual real rate of return projected by the social security actuaries however if the account earned the 27 riskadjusted annual real rate of return projected by the actuaries workers would have faced slight reduction in overall social security income relative to current law younger workers and those with higher lifetime earnings would have benefitted the most from ias younger workers would have been able to contribute to their ia throughout their careers and would have had higher contributions as result of continued wage growth higher earners would have benefitted from being able to accrue larger account balances as the dollar cap on contributions increased this report is based on the presidents 2005 ia proposal the version portrayed in his fy2007 budget submission is not significantly different from his 2005 proposal the main substantive difference is that the average interest that worker would need to earn to break even would be reduced to 27 from 3 thus if the account earned the 27 riskadjusted annual rate of return the worker would experience reduction in overall social security income relative to current law contents introduction 1 the presidents 2005

the oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi program commonly referred to as social security is facing longterm financial deficit in 2041 the social security trust funds will be depleted and tax revenues will be sufficient to cover approximately 74 of benefits promised at that time given this challenge president bush made social security reform the key focus of his 2005 domestic social policy agenda on february 2 2005 the president issued document strengthening social security for the 21st century which laid out the specifications for system of voluntary individual accounts funded out of the current payroll tax to be phasedin as part of reformed social security system administration officials concede that the individual accounts themselves do not alleviate the solvency problem2 these accounts would likely worsen the solvency problem over the next 75 years the intent of these accounts was 1 to offset at least portion of the anticipated benefit reductions or tax increases that will be necessary to achieve solvency 2 to make the social security system better deal for younger workers who are most likely to be affected by these changes and 3 to provide benefit that each worker would individually own that the government could not take away the president stated that these accounts are just one piece of comprehensive social security reform package and that additional measures will be needed to achieve longterm solvency3 the president later espoused the idea of progressive price indexing as one option for achieving solvency by indexing future benefits of 1 the presidents fy2007 budget submission included an updated version of his individual account proposal this version outlined in social security administration actuarial memorandum dated feb 6 2006 included three specific changes 1 the proposal would become effective in 2010 instead of 2009 2 the initial contribution cap would be 1100 instead of 1000 and 3 the offset to the workers traditional benefit would be based on the amount of their contributions plus 27 in interest instead of 3 of these three changes only the reduction of the offset rate alters the conclusions presented in this report based on analysis of the 2005 proposal under the 2005 proposal if the account earned the 27 riskadjusted annual real rate of return projected by the actuaries workers would have faced slight reduction in overall social security income relative to current law in the january 2006 version of the ia proposal if the account earned the 27 riskadjusted annual rate of return the worker would experience reduction in overall social security income relative to current law please note that the numbers presented in the remainder of this report have not been updated to reflect this change 2 white house background press briefing on social security feb 2 2005 3 president george w bush state of the union address feb 2 2005 crs2 highwage workers to inflation while wage indexing future benefits of lowwage workers however specific details of how this proposal would be implemented were released thus this report focuses solely on the individual account component of the presidents 2005 social security reform proposal4 the presidents 2005 social security individual account proposal individual account contributions under the presidents proposal individuals born prior to 1950 would have experienced change in their social security benefits individuals born in 1950 and later would have had the option to participate in social security individual accounts ias workers born in years 1950 through 1965 could have first participated in 2009 workers born in years 1966 through 1978 could have first participated in 2010 workers born in years 1979 and later could have first participated in 2011 those who chose to participate would have been able to divert up to 4 of their social security covered wages into an individual account5 the actual maximum dollar amount of contributions would have be gradually increased such that low earners would be able to immediately contribute full 4 of earnings to their ia while higher earners would initially have their contributions capped in the first year of account availability 2009 the cap on contributions would have been 1000 according to the social security actuaries this cap would increase by 100 each year and then be increased by the growth in the national average wage6 for example in 2010 the contribution limit would be equal to 1100 increased by the growth in average wages between 2007 and 2008 or 1145 the actuarial memorandum only covers the years through 2015 and the contribution limit rises using this method each year until then although it is not specified in the actuarial memorandum the february 2 document implies that this dollar contribution limit would continue to rise after 2015 but that contributions would never exceed 4 of covered wages individuals who do not choose to participate in the ia system would continue to draw benefits from the traditional social security system however these benefits are likely to be reduced to achieve longterm solvency individuals who choose to participate in the ia system would not be permitted to discontinue their participation would be subject to benefit reductions based on their participation in the ia and would also be subject to benefit reductions to achieve longterm solvency 4 for additional information on price indexing please see crs report rl32900 indexing social security benefits the effects of price and wage indexes 5 in 2005 social security covered wages are capped at 90000 this cap is indexed annually to increases in the national average wage 6 social security administration memorandum to charles p blahous special assistant to the president for economic policy national economic council from stephen c goss chief actuary preliminary estimated financial effects of proposal to phase in personal accounts information feb 3 2005 crs3 account administration and investment individual account contributions would be collected and records maintained by central administrator private investment managers would be chosen through competitive bidding process to manage pooled account contributions the central administrator would be responsible for addressing participant questions and issuing periodic account statements the social security administrations actuaries estimate that the ongoing administrative costs for centralized system with limited choice of fund investment would be roughly 03 percentage points or 30 basis points7 individuals who optin to the ia system would choose from few broadbased investment funds government bond fund an investmentgrade corporate bond index fund smallcap stock index fund largecap stock index fund and an international stock index fund8 in addition workers could choose government bond fund with guaranteed rate of return above inflation workers could also select lifecycle portfolio that would automatically adjust the level of risk and return of the investments by gradually reducing the portion of the portfolio invested in stocks and increasing the proportion invested in bonds as the worker aged in an attempt to avoid sudden losses closer to retirement this portfolio would be the default choice for workers reaching age 47 although the worker could optout if the worker and his or her spouse signed waiver stating that they are aware of the risks workers would be able to adjust their allocations among these funds annually lifecycle portfolios reduce the probability of sudden loss of capital due to decline in equity values but they do not eliminate this risk furthermore with the switch to heavier investment in bonds rather than stocks comes reduced expected rate of return in the account balance the rate of return one earns closer to retirement has greater effect on the overall account balance than the rate of return earned at the start of working career because that interest rate is applied to every dollar held in the account at that point in time not just the account few years into ones career shifting the asset allocation to favor bonds does reduce the downside risk but it also limits the upside gains9 7 some have argued that this assumption may understate the true administrative costs of such system the actuaries did not provide an estimate of the costs associated with annuitization 8 an index fund is fund composed of securities intended to replicate the movement of specific securities index eg the dow jones standard poors 500 etc index funds are considered to be passive investments since the portfolio manager does not have to decide among various securities for investment rather the manager knows the securities that make up the index and their relative importance to the overall index and seeks to match it because the management of the investment is less active the expenses and transaction costs are low the advantage of index funds is that since most funds do not beat the index anyway the investor has greater chance of at least matching industry averages the limitation of the index fund is that it must purchase all of the securities in the index even if the market indicates that particular security in the index is going to lose value taken from p 501 how the us securities industry works by hal mcintyre 9 robert j shiller of yale university recently conducted computer simulation using continued crs4 in the scenario described in the presidents proposal the lifecycle portfolio would specify an asset allocation shift based on workers planned year of retirement thus all workers retiring in given year have the same portfolio of stocks and bonds the primary appeal of these targeted retirement date lifecycle portfolios is the minimal involvement required by the investor once the individual joins the fund the assets are on autopilot and the individual does not need to decide when or how to adjust the portfolio however this one size fits all approach may not be ideal for those who have investments outside the social security ia system as it could undermine the intended overall asset allocation for that workers age for example worker who already has great deal invested in bonds in 401k plan may not want the automatic shift towards bonds specified by lifecycle portfolio because it could place too great portion of his or her assets in fixed income securities this approach may also not be ideal for those with different tolerance for risk for example the asset allocation specified for someone at age 35 might be 80 in stock and 20 in bonds however some individuals may be risk averse and prefer portfolio with 70 stock and 30 bonds offset to social security defined benefit based on hypothetical individual account if worker chooses to participate in an ia in exchange for the reduction in contributions to the defined benefit social security system he or she would accept future social security benefit reduction the benefit reduction would apply to the social security retirement spousal or aged widower benefit that would otherwise be paid to him or her10 this future benefit reduction is equal to the contributions made to the workers individual account plus 3 per year in interest for each actual account that worker contributes to and receives upon retirement there is also hypothetical shadow account that exists only as an accounting mechanism the shadow account records all of the contributions made to the actual account and grows them at fixed annual real rate of return the rate one would earn after adjusting for inflation of 3 essentially equal to what the social security administration actuaries project these contributions would have earned had they continued to be paid into the social security system and invested in treasury bonds in the trust funds11 thus the 30 offset is intended to reflect the portion of the social security benefit the worker chooses to forgo and replace with individual 9 continued financial data going back to 1871 he found that people enrolled in lifecycle accounts would have lost money 32 of the time under the presidents ia proposal because the rate of return earned is less than the 3 real rate of return required to break even in the proposal for additional information please see robert j shillers study the lifecycle personal accounts proposal for social security an evaluation yale icf working paper 0506 apr 2005 available at httppapersssrncomsol3paperscfmabstract_id703221 10 according to the social security actuarial memorandum disability benefits would not be reduced 11 unlike the actual individual account which is reduced on an annual basis by 03 of assets and results in an expected net 46 annual rate of return or riskadjusted 27 rate of return the shadow account is not reduced for any administrative fees see the methodology section for additional detail crs5 account proceeds by diverting portion of his or her payroll tax away from the social security system table 1 provides an example of how this would work in this example mary works and contributes to her individual account for 10 years between 2021 and 2031 each year mary contributes an amount equal to 4 of her social security covered wages to her individual account for example she earns 15000 in 2021 and therefore contributes 600 to her ia where it is assumed to grow at 46 annual real rate of return and results in an end of year account balance of 622 when she makes her 600 contribution to her actual ia the shadow ia reflects this same contribution amount but grows it at fixed 30 annual real rate of return so that at the end of the first year her shadow ia records balance of 617 this same process continues every year until she retires in 2031 at that point her actual ia balance is 15648 and her shadow ia balance is 14327 upon retirement the account balance of this hypothetical shadow account is converted into hypothetical cpiindexed monthly annuity12 this hypothetical annuity would be used to reduce or offset the social security defined benefit table 1 marys actual and shadow individual accounts actual account actual shadow shadow account annual balance account account balance fixed year wage assuming 46 contributions contributions 30 real rate of nominal real rate of nominal nominal return return

table 2 based on marys 10year work history mary could expect to receive social security defined benefit equal to about 654 per month in 2031 marys shadow account would produce cpiindexed annuity of 82 per month this shadow annuity is used to reduce or offset marys 12 an annuity is an insurance instrument that provides stream of periodic payments in return for an up front payment called the premium in this case the premium would be the individuals account balance at retirement crs6 social security benefit leaving her with social security defined benefit of 572 assuming that mary chooses to annuitize her entire actual ia balance marys actual ia would produce cpiindexed annuity of 89 per month the annuity from the actual ia plus her reduced social security defined benefit would provide mary combined social security income of 661 table 2 how marys shadow account offsets her social security defined benefit and how her actual account contributes to her social security income in 2031 marys currentlaw social security defined monthly benefit 654 minus shadow account monthly annuity based on fixed 30 annual 82 real rate of return equals remaining social security defined monthly benefit 572 plus actual account monthly annuity assuming 46 annual real rate of 89 return equals combined social security monthly income 661 source created by crs note example assumes current law provisions remain in place through 2031 and that mary chooses to annuitize her entire ia balance individual account distributions workers would not be permitted to have access to their ia balances prior to retirement upon retirement the receipt of aged widower benefits or conversion from disabled worker to retirement benefits the ia accumulation would be available to the beneficiary individuals may be required to purchase an annuity or take in phased withdrawals portion of the ia balance the portion required to be annuitized or taken in phased withdrawals would be equal to the dollar amount needed to provide the worker with total monthly benefit equal to at least 100 of the federal poverty threshold when combined with the reduced social security defined benefit for example looking back at table 2 marys reduced social security defined benefit would be equal to 572 in 2005 dollars in 2031 the year of marys retirement the monthly poverty level is projected to be equal to 766 in 2005 dollars thus mary would be required to annuitize or take in phased withdrawals whatever portion of her ia is needed to provide monthly stream of income equal to 194 766 572 the annuity purchased or phased withdrawals taken would be required to be cpiindexed so that the annual amounts increase with inflation and thus retain purchasing power if after the purchase of this annuity or estimation of phased withdrawals the worker still has balance in his or her ia the remainder may be withdrawn as lumpsum or left as an inheritance there would be minimum crs7 benefit guarantee to ensure that participants would receive total benefit at least equal to the poverty threshold13 under the system of phased withdrawals also referred to as programmed withdrawals or selfannuitization the workers account balance is divided in such way as to allow the worker to withdraw an equal amount each month indexed to inflation until the retiree dies or until the ia funds are depleted this amount is calculated taking into account projected future inflation interest rates and life expectancy it has not yet been specified who will take the role of calculating the size of these withdrawals the advantage of phased withdrawals as opposed to an annuity is that worker who does not expect to live to projected life expectancy could withdraw whatever portion of their ia assets are needed to stay above poverty and upon death the remaining balance would be available to pass along as an inheritance14 when worker purchases cpiindexed annuity risks of higher than expected inflation lower than expected interest rates and of living longer than an individuals projected life expectancy are borne by the insurance company when worker opts to take phased withdrawals these risks are borne by the worker thus if inflation grows faster than originally expected the amount of money that the worker must withdraw to remain above poverty would increase leading the worker to deplete his or her ia assets faster than planned under phased withdrawals the worker retains the responsibility for investing the individual account assets in such way as to ensure rate of return that would maintain an account balance sufficient to provide the appropriate level of withdrawals until the expected date of death if the worker fails to invest in such way as to ensure the rate of return needed to maintain an account balance until they die then the withdrawal amounts would eventually exceed the balance remaining in the ia leading the worker to have insufficient resources to remain above poverty under phased withdrawal system the worker also faces the risk that they will live beyond the date of life expectancy that was used to calculate the phased withdrawal amounts the date of life expectancy is by definition the average remaining number of years prior to death thus on average about 50 of those opting for phased withdrawals will die prior to running out of ia funds and 50 will live longer than expected and run out of ia funds in this case the worker would have received larger withdrawal amounts than could be sustained with the ia balance at retirement and the worker would risk running out of funds prior to death phased withdrawals do not guarantee that those with ia balances projected to be sufficient at retirement when the monthly phased withdrawal amount is calculated will avoid falling into poverty 13 the plan does not specify whether the poverty threshold to be used is for the single worker for all individuals who are expected to receive benefits off of the workers record or all household members 14 not all individual accounts are likely to have large enough balances to provide monthly withdrawal amount that when combined with the reduced social security defined benefit is able to provide combined social security income equal to 100 of the federal poverty threshold whether provided in the form of an annuity or as phased withdrawal the currentlaw social security program also does not guarantee benefit amount equal to 100 of the federal poverty threshold crs8 if worker decides not to use inflationindexed phased withdrawals of portion of his or her ia to maintain above poverty level retirement income he or she would be required to purchase cpiindexed annuity to achieve this goal although the presidents plan requires the purchase of cpiindexed annuities there is currently very limited market for these annuities in the united states although the treasury has issued treasury inflation protection securities tips since 1997 the demand for inflationindexed annuities remains small possibly because many workers feel that they already have some form of inflation protection from currentlaw social security benefits if however these types of annuities were to be mandatory and accompanied by the required reduction in social security benefits for ia participants the experience in the united kingdom indicates that it is likely that such market would develop15 analysis of the presidents 2005 ia proposal although the presidents ia proposal would worsen social security solvency within the next 75 years in the longrun the shadow accounts and the resulting offsets in social security defined benefits would reduce benefit costs to the current law program because of the shortrun costs and barring other benefit reductions or tax increases the ia proposal is likely to increase publicly held debt and increase the unified budget deficit under the presidents ia proposal younger workers and higher earners who can contribute to the ia for longer periods of time or contribute larger amounts to the ia would have larger ia balances and annuities than those who contribute over fewer years or contribute fewer dollars as result of the larger ia balances younger workers and higher earners would have lower social security defined benefit whether worker does better under the individual account proposal depends on whether he or she is able to obtain higher annual rate of return net of administrative expenses than the 30 real rate of return used to calculate the shadow account although these individual accounts are likely to make the solvency problem worse the president has not yet specified how this additional shortfall will be financed it could be financed through 1 increased government borrowing to be paid off eventually through general revenues 2 increased payroll taxes or other tax increases or 3 additional benefit reductions crs has provided estimates of combined social security income under two scenarios one where it is assumed that trust fund revenues are found and the trust fund can provide scheduled current law social security benefits and one where it is assumed that trust fund revenues are not found and the currentlaw benefit is reduced to payable level based on estimated currentlaw revenues however because the social security administration actuaries were not provided with the plan specifications needed to produce 75year analysis of how the presidents ia proposal would affect solvency the size of the annual benefit reductions that would be required to maintain trust fund solvency under payable baseline is not known therefore the results below do not take into 15 brown jeffrey olivia mitchell and james poterba the role of real annuities and indexed bonds in an individual accounts retirement program national bureau of economic research working paper 7005 mar 1999 crs9 account the benefit reductions on top of those required under currentlaw and under the shadow account offset that would be necessary under the presidents ia proposal to achieve solvency thus this analysis tends to overstate the combined social security income that would be available under the ia proposal compared to currentlaw payable baseline however the total social security income possible for scaled averagewage worker using the expected 46 annual real rate of return would be 31 higher than currentlaw payable benefits for younger cohorts16 thus if the additional benefit reductions required to achieve solvency under the ia plan reduce benefits by less than 31 scaled averagewage workers under the ia plan would still come out ahead one important limitation of using these assumed constant annual interest rates is that historical rates of return have not followed such pattern interest rate fluctuations over time and where these fluctuations occur in workers career can have large effect on the estimated account balances of workers under an ia system effect on social security solvency administration officials acknowledge that the proposed individual accounts alone do not improve the social security solvency problem in the shortrun these individual accounts are likely to make the solvency problem worse the presidents plan permits individuals to contribute up to 4 percentage points up to dollar contribution limit of the current 124 payroll tax into individual accounts thus diverting current revenues away form the traditional social security system by itself this step would worsen the social security solvency problem because these dollars are taken from the social security surpluses and therefore the trust funds dont accrue the same balances that they otherwise would have and they also earn less interest on these reduced balances not including the lost interest earnings the cost to the trust funds between 2005 and 2015 would be approximately 541 billion in constant 2004 dollars17 by the end of 2015 the ia proposal would increase publiclyheld debt by 587 billion in 2004 dollars the second piece of the presidents ia proposal the reduction in social security benefits based on the shadow account has the effect of offsetting the cost of the ia proposal and potentially improving the solvency problem in the long run however because this reduction only takes place upon workers retirement but the contributions to the ia begin almost immediately and continue up to the workers year of retirement the savings from the benefit offset takes many years to counter the loss of revenue to the trust funds from the ia itself between 2005 and 2015 these offsets reduce social security benefits by only 3 billion constant 2004 dollars the social security actuaries estimate that the year in which social security costs exceed social security tax revenue would be 2012 under the presidents proposal instead of 2017 under current law 16 for details on scaled wage workers please refer to the methodology section 17 social security administration memorandum to charles p blahous special assistant to the president for economic policy national economic council from stephen c goss chief actuary preliminary estimated financial effects of proposal to phase in personal accounts information feb 3 2005 crs10 if as indicated in the actuarial memorandum disability recipients are not subject to the shadow account offset presumably because disabled workers would not have access to their accounts until their disability benefits convert to aged retirement benefits at the full retirement age then the trust funds would be made worse off because they would still have the burden of paying full social security benefit amounts to disability recipients who are by definition under the retirement age even though these individuals may have participated in the ia system thereby reducing the revenues available to pay these benefits the actuarial memorandum implies that disabled individuals would be subject to the offset upon conversion from disability benefits to retirement benefits at the full retirement age reducing the cost of their benefit payments from that point on the actual effect of the presidents proposal on solvency is dependent upon the number of individuals who participate in the system of individual accounts and upon their level of earnings the social security actuaries assume that approximately two thirds of all eligible workers will optin to the account system the actuaries do not attempt to predict what types of workers eg high wage low wage etc would participate in the ia system but instead rely on estimates of the aggregate dollar amounts that would likely be diverted from current payroll taxes the larger the number of individuals who participate in the accounts the greater the dollar amount diverted away from the current social security system and the greater the upfront negative impact on social security solvency of course the greater the number of individuals who choose to participate in the ia system the greater the eventual reduction in benefits promised to these individuals under the current social security system and the greater the potential longterm enhancement to social security solvency the social security actuaries who estimate the effect of social security reform proposals on solvency were unable to produce the standard 75year estimate of the effect of the presidents proposal because they were only given specifications through 2015 however based on similar individual account structure introduced by senator lindsey graham as part of larger reform proposal in the 108th congress s 1878 and analyzed by the social security actuaries it seems likely that over 75 year period the presidents individual account proposal would not pay for itself through benefit offsets nor reduce the existing solvency problem18 in present value terms senator grahams individual account proposal alone would have added 27 trillion in constant 2004 dollars to the 40 trillion currentlaw social security shortfall19 18 the default option under sen grahams plan was an individual account funded by carveout equal to 4 of the current payroll tax with contributions capped at 1300 in 2006 and increased with the percent increase in the national average wage thereafter the benefit offset was calculated using account contributions grown at real annual interest rate of 27 19 the congressional research service crs calculation based on social security administration memorandum from chris chaplain and alice h wade to stephen c goss on the estimated oasdi financial effects of social security solvency and modernization act of 2003 introduced by senator lindsey graham information nov 18 2003 continued crs11 some individual account proposals such as that introduced by representative shaw hr750 in the 109th congress use the actual individual account to provide revenue to the social security trust fund to pay social security benefits the individual is still responsible for investing the ia assets but instead of reducing the social security benefit based on contributions to the ia the actual ia is handed over to the government for use in paying for the individuals social security benefits the social security benefit payments are fixed but the rate of return earned by each individual worker on his or her account and thus the account balance is subject to fluctuation thus the trust fund is subject to the risk that the individual accounts will not be invested in way that produces sufficient revenue to pay for an individuals lifetime benefits alternatively the presidents proposal provides the trust funds with guaranteed source of revenue in the form of reduced benefit costs which is equal to the individuals ia contributions grown at real annual 3 interest rate therefore the trust funds are not subject to any investment risk with the lower traditional social security benefits the presidents proposal also lowers the impact on the trust funds from the costs of unexpected increases in inflation or longevity individuals are responsible for purchasing an annuity in which case these risks are shifted to the insurance company that sold the annuity or making phased withdrawals in which case these risks are borne by the individual effect on the unified budget the unified budget the combined on and offbudget could be affected by this proposal in two ways first if the government relies on general revenues to reimburse social security for the loss of revenue due to the diversion of funds for the ia the treasury would need to either increase tax revenues reduce other government spending or increase government debt according to the office of management and budget the presidents ia proposal will require transition financing of 664 billion over the next 10 years or 754 billion including interest if additional debt is issued to cover these costs20 second as figure 1 below illustrates diverting social security revenues into individual accounts reduces the social security surplus thereby reducing the offbudget surplus social security surplus dollars are not held by the social security trust funds rather according to law surplus receipts are credited to the social security trust funds in the form of specialissue non marketable treasury bonds the actual surplus dollars are held by the us treasury where they become part of the general revenue pool and can be used

2013 2014 2015 year source congressional research service crs calculations based on the 2004 social security trustees report table vif9 and the feb 3 2005 social security actuarial memorandum to charles blahous table 1b2 note the 2004 social security trustees report is used because this was the basis for the estimates provided in the social security memorandum to charles blahous effect on combined social security income based on the assumptions and methodology described below crs finds that the total of the reduced social security defined benefit plus the annuity that would be available using the actual ia balance would exceed social security currentlaw promised benefits if the account earns the 46 annual real rate of return projected by the social security actuaries however if the account earns the 27 risk adjusted annual real rate of return projected by the actuaries workers would face crs13 slight reduction in overall social security income relative to current law22 younger workers and those with higher lifetime earnings would benefit the most from ias younger workers would be able to contribute to their ia throughout their careers and would have higher contributions as result of continued wage growth higher earners would benefit from being able to accrue larger account balances as the dollar limit on contributions increases over time until it reaches the full 4 of covered wages how an individual worker would fare under the ia proposal would depend entirely upon how the actual rate of return earned by the workers ia compared to the fixed benefit offset rate of 3 the worker would bear all of the investment risk if workers actual account attained an annual real rate of return greater than 3 the balance of the actual account would be higher than that of the shadow account thus while the social security benefit would be reduced by the annuity based on the shadow account an annuity from the actual account would be larger and would more than offset the reduction to the defined benefit therefore the combined actual individual account annuity plus the social security benefit reduced by the shadow account would be larger than what the worker is scheduled to receive under current law on the other hand if workers actual account attained an annual real rate of interest lower than 3 the balance of the actual account would be lower than that of the shadow account thus while the social security benefit would be reduced by the annuity based on the shadow account an annuity from the actual account would be smaller and would not offset the reduction to the workers social security benefit therefore the combined actual ia annuity plus the social security benefit reduced by the shadow account would be smaller than what the worker is promised to receive under current law because the hypothetical account rate of return 30 is not reduced by administrative fees while the actual riskadjusted rate of return is reduced by administrative fees to 27 the hypothetical account balance will exceed that of the riskadjusted actual account in every case where the worker invests exclusively in government bonds as way to optout of the ia system according to the actuarial memorandum disability beneficiaries would not be subject to the offset and would not have access to their ia until conversion from disability benefits to aged retirement benefits at the full retirement age the memorandum also indicates that the offset applies to all aged retirement benefits if disability recipients were subject to the offset upon conversion then these workers would experience sudden change in the composition of their benefit from one of guaranteed benefit to one that is partially guaranteed and partially dependent on the proceeds from the ia 22 the higher rate of return one expects to earn from investing in stocks is due to the higher risk such an investment carries the difference between the rate of return on stocks and the rate of return on government bonds is known as the risk premium the amount of compensation the market demands for taking on the additional risk of investing in stocks relative to the lower risk of investing in government bonds in this case because stocks are assumed to earn real rate of return of 65 while government bonds are assumed to earn real rate of return of 3 the risk premium is 35 percentage points thus the risk adjusted rate of return used in this analysis represents the stock rate of return adjusted downward by this risk premium this rate of return omits any expected return over that of government bonds crs14 limitations of this analysis according to the 2004 trustees report the source of the assumptions used for this analysis under current law social security will be unable to fully pay promised benefits after 204223 estimates of combined social security income are provided under two scenarios one where it is assumed that trust fund revenues are found and the trust fund can provide scheduled current law social security benefits and one where it is assumed that trust fund revenues are not found and the currentlaw benefit is reduced to payable level based on estimated currentlaw revenues in the scheduled benefits scenario the benefit estimates for both the currentlaw benefit and the social security benefit under the presidents ia assume the use of yet unidentified sources of revenue comparison of the payable baseline to the scheduled baseline shows to what degree the current law scheduled benefits are overstated compared to currentlaw revenue sources because the individual accounts would actually make the social security solvency problem worse in the short run to achieve solvency without revenue increases the presidents proposal would require larger benefit reductions than those that would be required to achieve solvency under current law unless the entire transition cost were financed through increased debt or higher taxes however because the social security administration actuaries were not provided with the plan specifications needed to produce 75year analysis of how the presidents ia proposal would affect solvency the size of the annual benefit reductions that would be required to maintain trust fund solvency is not known thus serious limitation of the payable analysis is that it overstates the value of the total social security income available under the ia plan because it fails to take into account the additional solvencydriven reductions on top of the shadow account offset to the social security defined benefit that forms the base of social security combined income figure 2 shows that the total social security income possible for scaled averagewage worker using the assumed 46 annual real rate of return would be 31 higher than currentlaw payable benefits for younger cohorts thus if the additional benefit reductions required to achieve solvency under the ia plan reduce benefits by less than 31 scaled averagewage workers who achieve the expected 46 annual rate of return under the ia plan would still come out ahead however if the ultimate benefit reductions are greater than 31 workers would have higher benefits under currentlaw figure 2 also shows that the total social security income possible for scaled averagewage worker using the riskadjusted 27 annual real rate of return would be about 4 lower than currentlaw payable benefits for younger cohorts thus any additional benefit reductions required to achieve solvency under the ia plan would make these scaled averagewage workers worse off than under currentlaw 23 the 2005 social security trustees report indicates that the year of exhaustion of the oasdi trust funds in 2041 to maintain consistency with the underlying assumptions used in this analysis crs has continued using 2042 as the date of exhaustion for the payable baseline estimates crs15 figure 2 percent difference between currentlaw payable social security

shortfall due to the ias will be financed it would require at least the same solvencydriven reductions that would be required under donothing scenario where only those benefits that can be paid with incoming tax revenues would be paid in this analysis these estimates are presented as payable benefits according to the 2004 trustees report the source of the assumptions used for this analysis under current law social security will be unable to fully pay promised benefits after 204224 at that time payroll tax revenues and revenues from the income taxation of social security benefits are projected to be sufficient to pay approximately 74 of scheduled benefits and gradually declining percentage thereafter thus under current law benefit reduction of approximately 26 would be required in 2042 with gradually increasing reductions thereafter in the examples presented below only the worker age 21 today would have any change in social security benefits under the payable baseline as this workers year of retirement 2051 occurs after the trust funds have been depleted and annual social security revenues are sufficient to pay only 74 of promised 24 the 2005 social security trustees report indicates that the year of exhaustion of the oasdi trust funds in 2041 to maintain consistency with the underlying assumptions used in the social security actuarial analysis of the presidents ia proposal crs has continued using 2042 as the date of exhaustion for the payable baseline estimates crs16 benefits thus under the payable baseline the 21yearolds social security promised benefits are reduced by 26 for series of hypothetical workers that vary by age and earnings history the following section provides estimates of the workers actual and shadow individual account balances currentlaw promised social security benefits benefit offsets based on the shadow account annuities reduced promised social security benefits the total reduced social securityia benefit relative to the social security benefit promised under current law the total reduced social securityia benefit relative to the social security benefit payable under current law required annuitization or phased withdrawal levels with reduced social security promised benefits maximum amounts available at retirement as lumpsum or inheritance amounts with reduced social security promised benefits once the required annuitization or phased withdrawals have been deducted required annuitization or phased withdrawal levels with reduced social security payable benefits and maximum amounts available at retirement as lumpsum or inheritance amounts with reduced social security payable benefits once the required annuitization or phased withdrawals have been deducted because account balances and benefit reductions will differ by age and lifetime earnings estimates for hypothetical low average and highwage earners born in various years ie of various birth cohorts are provided analysis by birth cohort assuming 46 annual real rate of return younger birth cohorts participating in the ia system would receive larger total social security income composed of the reduced social security benefit plus the ia annuity compared with older cohorts of similar earnings levels eg scaled low wage worker figure 3 shows combined social security income for scaled averagewage workers of different birth cohorts crs17 figure 3 total social security income for scaled averagewage worker by birth cohort source congressional research service estimates younger workers will have higher individual account balances than will older workers of similar earnings levels as is evident from table 3 those workers who as result of their age are able to contribute to their ia throughout their careers have much larger account balances upon retirement than do those who contribute at the same earnings level but over fewer years for example upon retirement the expected individual account balance of the average worker age 41 today is only 27 of that of the average worker age 21 today based on the assumptions used in this analysis the increased account balance for younger generations is due to three variables 1 the rise in real wages for individuals of similar earnings levels and thus real contributions to the accounts 2 the higher value of interest accumulated due to these higher wages and 3 the increasing number of years of contributions to the accounts and the effect of more years of interest up to the point where each future cohort would have contributed to the ia for each of their 44 work years the 1990 birth cohort first under the assumptions used by the social security actuaries each future generation will earn real wages ie an increase in earnings that is greater than the increase in inflation larger than those of the generation before it25 thus the real contributions to the ia of each future generation will also be larger than those of the current generation second these larger real contributions create larger real account base for investment even with the same annual real rate of return applied 25 the social security actuaries assume longterm average real wage growth of 39 per year crs18 eg 46 to the ia between different generations the dollar value of the interest is higher with the higher real account base third the 41yearold worker participates in the account for only 22 years 20092030 whereas the 21yearold participates for 40 years 20112050 the younger workers greater of number of years participating in the ia leads both to greater aggregate contributions and greater interest earnings as result of the increased years of investment of those contributions because younger workers will have both larger actual accounts as well as larger shadow accounts younger workers face larger offset to their social security promised benefits relative to older workers table 4 illustrates that depending on age the shadow account annuity reduces social security promised benefits by between 17 and 41 for the scaled averagewage worker the effect of the benefit offset in reducing the social security benefit is larger for younger cohorts whose social security benefits could be reduced to achieve long term solvency table 5 provides the same information as for table 4 but for baseline of currentlaw social security payable benefits instead of promised benefits only the worker age 21 today would have any change in social security benefits under the payable baseline as this workers year of retirement 2051 occurs after the trust funds have been depleted and annual social security revenues are sufficient to pay only 74 of promised benefits thus under the payable baseline social security promised benefits are reduced by 26 because the social security benefit is lower under the payable baseline but the shadow account offset remains the same the percent reduction in social security benefits is larger than under the promised baseline thus in the longrun workers would receive an increasingly smaller portion of their social security defined benefit younger workers would experience the largest percent increase in total social security income if 46 annual real rate of return is achieved table 6 demonstrates that the total of the reduced social security benefit plus the annuity that would be available using the actual ia balance would exceed social security current law promised benefits if the account earns the expected 46 annual real rate of return depending on age the percent increase in combined social security income is estimated to be between 3 and 18 for the scaled averagewage worker the percent increase in the total benefit amount is larger for younger workers who contribute to the ia for their entire careers and thus have more years for the difference in interest rates between the hypothetical account and the actual account to work in their favor if on the other hand the account is only able to achieve 27 annual real rate of return the annual real annual rate of 30 minus 03 administrative costs then the total of the reduced social security benefit plus the annuity would be less than that promised under currentlaw the advantages for younger workers would be removed under this riskadjusted interest rate as there is percentage point difference to be utilized to enhance the longer ia participants account balance younger workers would experience an even larger percent increase in combined social security income when compared to what would be possible under current law payable scenario table 7 provides the same information as table 6 but for benefits payable baseline again the only worker that would be affected by the crs19 payable baseline is the worker age 21 today because the currentlaw payable benefit would be lower than the currentlaw promised benefit the same dollar amount from the ia annuity assuming 46 annual real rate of return would lead to larger percent increase in combined social security income for this worker analysis by earnings level assuming 46 annual real rate of return higherwage workers would experience greater percent increase in combined social security income than lowerwage workers figure 4 below demonstrates the levels of currentlaw promised benefits the combined social security income assuming an annual real rate of return of 46 and the combined social security income assuming an

promised social security benefit total social security income assuming riskadjusted 27 annual real rate of return reduced social security promised benefit and ia annuity source congressional research service estimates note compares benefit amounts assuming funding is located to pay social security promised benefits ia participants with higher earnings over their lifetime will have larger account balances when they retire than those of lower earners those with higher wages are able to contribute larger dollar amounts to their ias leading to larger account balances for example in table 3 the scaled lowwage earner age 41 today has only 44 of the account balance of the scaled highwage earner age 41 today even though these workers contribute to the ia over the same number of years and even though the highwage earner is subject to the contribution cap for 15 years out of the crs20 22 spent participating in the ia 4 of the highwage workers salary is larger than 4 of the lowwage workers salary the disparity in account balances between individuals with different earnings levels increases over time as the cap on ia contributions rises to the point where the hypothetical highwage worker could contribute full 4 of wages to the ia by the time worker age 21 today retires the account balance of lowwage worker equals only 34 of that of highwage worker of the same age because of their larger account accumulations higher earners would face larger percent reduction in their social security scheduled benefits as result of the benefit offset table 4 illustrates that depending on earnings level the shadow account annuity reduces social security promised benefits by between 31 and 43 for worker age 21 today low earners face smaller percent reductions to their social security promised benefits than do higher earners because the underlying social security benefit structure is progressive ie it replaces larger percentage of wages of lowwage workers compared to highwage workers thus flat percentage of each workers wages 4 grown at flat percentage rate each year 3 to arrive at the shadow offset still maintains the progressive benefit structure by allowing lowwage workers to keep larger percentage of their social security benefit eg 69 for the age 21yearold than highwage workers eg 57 for the age 21yearold higher earners scaled high and scaled average wage workers would experience the largest percent increase in total social security income if 46 annual real rate of return is achieved table 6 demonstrates that the total of the reduced social security benefit plus the annuity that would be available using the actual ia balance would exceed social security currentlaw promised benefits if the account earns the expected 46 annual real rate of return depending on earnings level the percent increase in combined social security income is estimated to be between 13 and 18 for worker age 21 today under the 46 rate of return scenario the percent benefit increase would be larger for scaled highwage workers than for scaled low wage workers this difference would occur because the 4 of earnings that high earners would be able to contribute to their ias has larger dollar value and would be able to take advantage of the 16 percentage point difference between the 46 rate of return on the ia and the 30 rate of return used to calculate the ia benefit offset if on the other hand the account is only able to achieve 27 annual real rate of return the annual real annual rate of 30 minus 03 administrative costs then the total of the reduced social security benefit plus the annuity would be less than that promised under currentlaw the advantages for higher earners would be removed under this riskadjusted interest rate as there is percentage point difference to be utilized to enhance the higher earners account balance as table 8 illustrates the reduced social security promised benefit is still large enough compared to the monthly aged poverty thresholds to allow each hypothetical worker the option of withdrawing the entire ia balance as lumpsum at retirement rather than being required to purchase an annuity or take programmed withdrawals or passing it on as an inheritance if however additional benefit reductions are eventually introduced as part of comprehensive social security proposal some portion of the ia balance would probably need to be annuitized or taken as phased withdrawal in order to achieve combined monthly stream of income equal to the crs21 federal poverty threshold this outcome is best demonstrated in table 9 which takes into account the effect of reduction in promised benefits for the 21 year old to provide only those benefits payable at retirement in this case the lowwage and averagewage workers payable benefits fall below the poverty threshold after being reduced by the shadow account annuity as result this worker would be required to annuitize or take in programmed withdrawals enough of the individual account to guarantee combined social security income equal to 100 of the federal poverty threshold once this portion of the individual account has been annuitized or set aside for programmed withdrawals the worker would have the option to take the remainder of the account balance as lump sum or pass it along as inheritance the highwage 21yearold worker would not be required to annuitize or set aside for programmed withdrawals any portion of his or her account balance because even the 26 reduction in social security benefits under the payable baseline leaves this worker with large enough social security benefit to remain above the federal poverty threshold thus if benefit reductions are the primary method of achieving longterm solvency lower and averagewage workers would be less able to increase family wealth under the presidents ia plan than would highwage workers methodology all individual account estimates are based on the proposal specifications outlined above to estimate the account balances of the actual and hypothetical shadow accounts for those retiring many years in the future crs assumes that the ia contribution limit continues to increase over the full work history of each worker according to the method outlined in the actuarial memorandum if further details emerge that alter this contribution rate these estimates would need to be recalculated accordingly crs estimates the account balances for the actual ia which the worker will receive in full using both the expected annual real rate of return specified by the social security actuaries 49 as well as the lowyield or riskadjusted annual real rate of return specified by the actuaries 30 both reduced by the estimated administrative fee of 30 basis points per year thus the annual real rate of return net of administrative costs is 46 and 27 respectively the hypothetical account balance is estimated using the 30 rate of return specified in the proposal this account balance is used to calculate the offset to the social security defined benefit because the hypothetical account rate of return is not reduced by administrative fees whereas the actual riskadjusted rate of return is reduced by administrative fees the hypothetical account balance will exceed that of the risk adjusted actual account in every case to calculate the cpiindexed annuity for both the actual and hypothetical shadow accounts annuity factors provided by the social security administration were used one important limitation of using these assumed constant annual interest rates is that historical rates of return have not followed such pattern interest rate fluctuations over time and where these fluctuations occur in workers career can have large effect on the estimated account balances of workers under an ia system for example negative rate of return in the years prior to an individuals retirement can significantly reduce the value of the assets in the ia similarly the rate of return prevalent at the time of retirement can alter the monthly annuity payment that crs22 worker would receive based on the same dollar amount in the individual account the higher the interest rate assumed when calculating the annuity amount the greater the assumed earnings on the assets used to fund the annuity and the larger the annuity payment to the worker for example based on crs analysis at an interest rate of 60 68yearold person who purchased level singlelife annuity for 200000 would receive income from the annuity of 1852 per month at an interest rate of 40 the same sum of money would buy level singlelife annuity worth 1584 per month difference of 268 in monthly income some have argued that the establishment of individual accounts as well as the tax increases benefit reductions or government borrowing needed to achieve solvency may affect the macroeconomy and thus affect the interest rates that individuals could expect to obtain on their ias these estimates do not incorporate any such potential macroeconomic feedbacks the effect of the proposal is estimated both on workers who would contribute to the ia for their entire career as well as those whose careers would be split between the currentlaw system and the ia system to estimate the effect of the ia proposal on worker age 21 today crs assumes that the worker is born in 1984 begins work at age 21 in 2005 and retires at the full retirement age of 67 in 2051 as result this worker spends 40 years of his or her 46 year work history contributing to the ias and reflects what the system could provide to worker once the plan is fully phasedin to estimate the effect of the ia proposal on worker age 31 today crs assumes that the worker is born in 1974 begins work at age 21 in 1995 and retires at the full retirement age of 67 in 2041 as result although this worker also has career of 46 years only 30 of them are spent contributing to the ia finally to estimate the effect of the ia proposal on worker age 41 today crs assumes that the worker is born in 1964 begins work at age 21 in 1985 and retires at the full retirement age of 67 in 2031 thus this worker also has career of 46 years but only 22 of them are spent contributing to the ia account balance estimates for scaled lowwage workers scaledaverage wage workers and scaled highwage workers as defined by the social security office of the chief actuary are provided26 it is assumed that these workers follow typical lifetime earnings patterns that would produce social security benefit equivalent to that of workers with career earnings of either 1 lowwage 45 of wage equal to social securitys average wage series 2 an average wagea wage equal to social securitys average wage series or 3 high wage 160 of wage equal to social securitys average wage series for example based on projections in the 2004 social security trustees report worker retiring in 2005 would have had career average earnings of 15776 for scaled low earner career average earnings of 35057 for scaled average earner and career average earnings of 26 social security administration office of the actuary internal rates of return under the oasdi program for hypothetical workers actuarial note 144 june 2001 the pattern in these scaled earnings histories shows relatively low earnings at the beginning of the career fairly rapid growth through the middle of the career and gradual tapering off of earnings at the end of the career crs23 56091 for scaled high earner27 these scenarios are for illustration only and are not meant to fully represent every possible scenario that actual workers may experience for example by relying on stylized workers gaps in employment are assumed if present these gaps would reduce both the social security benefit and the ia balance of these workers however because under system of individual accounts the earlier contributions are made the more interest they accrue the timing of gaps in employment has greater effect on individual account balances than they would on the traditional social security benefit level although the plan does not require annuitization but allows individuals to take programmed withdrawals from their ias crs has followed the social security administrations practice of assuming universal annuitization as it is not clear which type of worker might opt for programmed withdrawals because hypothetical workers with spouses or other dependents are used the annuity levels calculated for both the actual and hypothetical accounts are based on the purchase of unisex cpiindexed singlelife annuity assuming an inflation rate of 28 per year and nominal interest rate of 5884 per year furthermore the poverty level estimates for the year of retirement are also based on singleperson household the aged poverty level in 2004 was 9060 this level was indexed to the year of retirement using the cpi unless otherwise specified all assumptions are based on the 2004 social security trustees report unless otherwise specified all dollar amounts are presented in real 2005 dollars 27 career average earnings levels are defined for retired workers as the highest 35 years of earnings indexed for growth in average wages to the year prior to benefit entitlement this concept is similar to that of the aime except that career average earnings for these scaled workers are indexed to the year prior to entitlement instead of two years prior to eligibility and earnings are averaged on an annual rather than monthly basis thus the indexing year for the 2005 retiree is 2004 and the 2004 average wage

security can only pay the portion of promised benefits equal to what can be paid annually out of revenues generated by payroll taxes and the income taxation of social security benefits as result of the lower social security benefit the effect of the reduction from the shadow annuity is to reduce the social security benefit to the level where it falls below the poverty threshold for the scaled lowearner forcing this worker to annuitize portion of his or her actual individual account balance to reach poverty threshold these results do not take into account the additional benefit reductions on top of those due to the benefit offset and reductions to achieve solvency under current law that would be necessary under the individual account plan in order to achieve solvency under payable baseline if additional benefit reductions were required under the individual account scenario workers would be required to annuitize larger portion of their individual accounts to reach the poverty threshold thus these results tend to overstate the benefit levels that would be payable under the presidents ia proposal please refer to accompanying memorandum for detailed description of methodology
