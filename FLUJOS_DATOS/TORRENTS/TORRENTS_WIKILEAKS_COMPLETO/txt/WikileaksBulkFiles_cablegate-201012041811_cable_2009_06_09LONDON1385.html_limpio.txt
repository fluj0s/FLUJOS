classified by political counselor richard mills reasons 14 bd 1 c summary during june 11 discussion with poloff commonwealth political director amitav banerji offered electoral commission capacitybuilding as an area where the usg and commonwealth could be strategic partners said commonwealth ministerial action group cmag would soon discuss and likely recommend full suspension of fiji noted concern about the human rights situation in sri lanka and indicated the commonwealth is keeping watchful eye on nigeria because of the constitutional crisis that could ensue if president yaradua dies while noting that it was not actively being dicussed banerji acknowledged that succession of the head of the commonwealth would have to be dealt with when queen elizabeth passes as there is rule stipulating that the british monarch is the head and procedure for selecting new head end summary usg engagement 2 c commonwealth secretariat director of political affairs amitav banerji reiterated to poloff commonwealth syg kamalesh sharmas desire for strategic engagement with the usg on june 11 noting the important role of electoral commissions in conducting credible elections banerji said sharma hopes to create network of electoral commissions across the commonwealth whereby newer commissions in fragile democracies could receive guidance and support from commissions in more established democracies he offered this initiative as an example of where the usg and commonwealth have mutual interests and where the usg could use the commonweaths technical electoral commission capacitybuilding capability and independent baggage free status to promote democracy abroad fiji 3 c noting that the commonwealth had past the deadline set at the may cmag meeting to reconsider full suspension of fiji reftel banerji said he was very frustrated that cmag had not yet met to discuss fiji especially as the commonwealths credibility could be damaged by not taking decision as indicated at the last meeting he said cmag had not met purely for scheduling reasons and that the secretariat hopes to hold the meeting by the end of the month though he was not confident it would be possible he thought cmag would move for full suspension of fiji intimating there had been difficult discussions at the previous cmag meeting on fiji with new zealand pushing hard for full suspension and malaysia wanting to ensure that fiji did not withdraw from the commonwealth to preempt full suspension zimbabwe sri lanka 4 c banerji said that the human rights situation in sri lanka during and after the recent military offensive had been raised informally and off the record by the uk during the last cmag meeting forcing difficult conversation with the sri lankan foreign minister as sri lanka is currently member of cmag banerji said the commonwealth continues to watch the situation in sri lanka and noted that sri lankas offer to host the next commonwealth heads of government meeting chogm had been turned down over concerns about lending international credibility to the governments actions nigeria 5 c the commonwealth is also keeping watchful eye on nigeria banerji noted as it is punching well below its weight and president yaraduas sudden death has the potential to prompt constitutional crisis the commonwealth would like to see nigeria more active in the region and in the commonwealth across the board banerji noted that yaradua did not make single intervention at the last chogm contrasting sharply with former president obsanjo london 00001385 002 of 002 who had been active in commonwealth affairs succession of the head of the commonwealth 6 c banerji acknowledged that succession of the head of the commonwealth would have to be dealt with when queen elizabeth passes as there is rule stipulating that the british monarch is the head and procedure for selecting new head he acknowledged that heirapparent to the british crown prince charles does not command the same respect as the queen and said the commonwealth was trying quietly to get him more involved in commonwealth affairs banerji noted marlborough house the commonwealth secretariats current location was royal property owned and funded by the british royal family and mused that may be factor in the discussions he noted that succession was not actively being discussion within the commonwealth visit
