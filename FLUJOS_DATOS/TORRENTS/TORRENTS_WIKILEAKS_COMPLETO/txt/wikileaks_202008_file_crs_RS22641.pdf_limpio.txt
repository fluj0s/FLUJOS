tation of property had also been imposed as war tax in 1917 but was also repealed as of january 1 1922 neither of these taxes had an effect on aviation however because there was commercial air service during this periodas war measure in late 19421 efforts to repeal these two transportation taxes in the late 1940s failed because of resistance from treasury and budget officials who argued that the revenue was needed to balance the budget nd retire the nations war debt the korean war also was an element in the delay in reducing what were seen by many at the time as war taxes eventually the tax on transpor tation of persons was reduced to 10 in 1954 and eliminated in 1962 in its place 5 ta x on transportation of persons by air was levied this was the first excise tax levied solely on aviation although this was tax on aviation users the revenues we re not dedicated to aviati on purposes the revenues were deposited in the treasurys general fund th 3 tax on transporta tion of
