warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30449debt and development in poor countries rethinking policy responses summary the poorest countries face enormous challenges to development with economic issues still presenting some of the greatest obstacles high on the current public policy agenda including in the us congress is financing increased debt relief for the poorest countries indebtedness is not new issue in the 1980s latin american middle income countries became severely indebted to private banks causing financial crisis with prolonged economic and social consequences today the heavily indebted poor countries hipcs mostly located in subsaharan africa face worse economic prospects and relatively large debt burdens to official creditors for most developing countries debt is marginal issue and not the primary obstacle to growth and development for the hipc countries however debt may be drag on economi c growth and so debt forgiveness may afford an opportunity to boost the development process total hipc country external debt amounts to 206 billion and current hipc proposals anticipate total debt reduction costs for all creditors in 1999 net present value terms to be 282 billion not large amounts by developed country or global standards but as yet mostly unfunded decision on financing hipc debt relief falls to congress if debt reduction is desired experience argues that it be comprehensi ve and timely but probably not unconditional which could be counterproductive if it is replacement for or diminishes incentives to effect broader economic political and social reform for debt relief to support growth and development it is arguably best used if supported by wellmanaged longterm investment strategy that ensures clearly productive public and private use of debt this point speaks to the larger issue of addressing the need for improved social political and economic institutions to encourage political participation and entrepreneurial activity that will help create an environment conducive for attracting foreign and domestic capital investment for their part developed countries and international financial institutions might consider how best to support developing country attempts to reform and adapt to changing international economic trends solutions that prolong debt relief may delay development this has led to recent changes to the hipc initiative intended to quicken and deepen debt reduction also foreign aid can be helpful at the margin and may be used to help with immediate social needs but cannot finance all longterm development needs other policy support such as removing trade barriers to developing country goods would strongly complement debt relief diminishing poverty in poor countries has become major new emphasis of the hipc debt reduction initiative yet debt relief is guarantee of success debt does not necessarily cause poverty so more than debt reduction many be needed also because financial resources are largely fungible within government budgets debt relief cannot assure that social program spending will be given priority in summary given the myriad factors that must work together for development to take place the benefit of debt relief may be limited unless it becomes part of broader program for social political and economic changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30449contents determinants of growth and development 1

present the greatest challenges and to help achieve these goals developed countries are contemplating more debt reduction for the poorest countries the current policy discussion centers on whether to increase financing for the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative 2 the 106th congress will consider president clintons request for 847 million in appropriations for hipc debt reduction for fiscal years 20002003 heavy indebtedness is not new development issue latin america in the 1980s experienced severe debt crisis with prolonged economic and social consequences today the prospects for heavily indebted subsaharan africa are even worse the policy focus has shifted however from entertaining options for safeguarding the solvency of us banks the latin american case to finding solutions to poverty and underdevelopment the africanhipc case nonetheless amidst these differences are common lessons that can be applied in understanding how debt relief can make differen ce to poor countries this report discusses how debt fits into the broader development picture including defining the circumstances that lead to heavy indebtedne ss drawing specific lessons from the latin american and african cases and the implications of earlier debt policy for current initiatives determinants of growth and development countries commonly use foreign debt to finance growth and development in fact the united states has relied on debt throughout much of its history why then is debt considered major obstacle to growth in some parts of the world the distinction appears to be that the poorest developing countries are experiencing debt hangover which is to say that they are so deeply indebted relative to their economic performance that without relief debt repayment and development cannot take place if this reasoning is correct then it is important to understand why debthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30449crs2 3 this theme is presented in rodrik dani the new global economy and developing

rules and institutions that encourage political participation and economic enterprise the benefits and perils of globalization openness to trade and capital markets so hotly debated at present may be

significant declines in productivity from 1984945 productivity growth is essential for standards of living to rise it is related to capital investment through technology transfer among other factors that accompanies use of more sophisticated equipment and machinery africas poor productivity growth suggests that many factors are at work limiting the quantity and quality of investment6 given this poor economic performance and poor policy responses see african section below it is not surprising that two basic development indicators in table 1 life expectancy and infant mortality are also significantly worse for africa than other developing regions among these variables the debt issue is most directly related to the role of capital investment this is still considered one of the most important single factors linked to longterm economic growth particularly for poor countries which are by definition capital constrained7 poor countries tend to have very low saving rates and are generally considered poor candidates for foreign capital investment africas saving rate has been onethird that of asia over the past decade pointing to potentially strong role for foreign investment8 for this reason many studies argue that developing countries need to pursue policies leading to greater opening of their economies to global capital and goods markets if barriers inhibit capital goods imports those used to manufacture other goods the cost of capital or investment rises and technology transfer is impeded diminishing growth potential it is in the context of paying for these needed imports that developing countries often adopt trade reform to increase exports to the extent that they run trade deficits they must borrow abroad using foreign financial capital to underwrite their investment strategy indeed good case for assuming debt rests on its use by developing country to import capital goods9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30449crs4 9 continued in rodrik the new global economy

as reasonable population growth rates various studies have pointed to extreme cases of institutional failures faced by some countries such as indiscriminate violence war terrorism poor financial regulatory institutions and government mismanagement or corruption regional security issues are critical factor for example in many subsaharan african countries one lesson that emerges is that overall social economic and political systems that do poor job of reconciling competing interests frequently end up with policies benefitting only the few leading to fractionalized societies that deter the development process10 development and external debt countries with low domestic saving rates have little choice but to try to close their savinginvestment gap by tapping into foreign financial resources foreigners for their part lend and invest capital abroad including developing countries when the prospect for above average return compensates for the additional risk theoretically this arrangement should be mutually beneficial given the relative scarcity of capital in developing countries foreign investment should be productive generating comparatively high rates of return and economic development should be enhanced with the additional resources the global financial markets should ideally serve to link the supply and demand for capital around the world helping to define opportunities and costs of these investments11 yet the poorest countries africa have been unable to attract private capital particularly since the 1980s debt crisis because of their low rates of productivity and return to capital stemming from lack of social political and economic infrastructure or what some have characterized as their capitalhostile environmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30449crs5 developing country debt profile debt originates from private or public sources large moneycenter banks are one source private creditors and extend credit based on riskadjusted return public debt sources include national governments bilateral creditors and international financial institutions such as the international monetary fund imf the world bank or regional development banks multilateral creditors not all potential lenders choose to operate in poor countries private creditors have large quantities of investable capital but because they are driven by the profit motive they approach the poorest highrisk countries with caution as calculated from data in table 2 the hipc countries represented only 6 of total longterm private sector lending to all developing countries in 1970 and this ratio fell to 2 by 1998 suggesting that private lenders have never invested heavily in the poorest countries and actually have decreased their relative lending commitment over the past three decades table 2 developing country debt by creditor 19701998 longterm debt in billions all developing country debt creditor 1970 1980 1990 1998 p private 289

global development finance 1999 analysis and summary tables pp 189 205 and 218 p preliminary other evidence suggests that patterns of privatesector lending to developing countries are highly stratified by income level for example private sector debt as percentage of debt to all developing countries was 47 in 1970 60 in 1980 49 in 1990 and 57 in 1998 significant portion over three decades the debt picture for severely indebted middleincome developing countries also includes healthy portion of privatesector participation ranging from 68 of total debt in 1970 to 63 in 1997 1998 data unavailablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30449crs6 12 in general borrowers ability to repay is the critical lending factor as opposed to say loan collateralization or credit history this is true for the local bank making car loan and the international bank lending to sovereign nation that is why even severely indebted middle income countries are better positioned to borrow than solvent lowincome countries in fact in 1997 private debt accounted for 6369 of total debt for middleincome countries whether moderately or severely indebted whereas it amounted to only 23 for lowincome countries not classified as significantly indebtedcompare now the debt profile of the heavily indebted poor developing countries in 1970 private debt was only 31 of their total debt less than half that of the severely indebted middleincome countries on percentage basis by 1998 this picture had deteriorated even more so private creditors reduced their relative position in poor countries by half to 15 of total debt even as the dollar value of their total debt ballooned from 59 billion in 1970 to 1685 billion in 1998 interestingly bilateral debt to the poor countries such as export credit export import bank or direct loans fell slightly to 50 of total debt and multilateral debt nearly tripled to 35 of the total in effect as the private creditors retreated from the poorest countries multilateral institutions picked up the slack12 to great extent the data indicate that private lenders were reacting to the weak economic fundamentals of poor countries which suggested that they would have severe difficulty servicing their debt table 3 gives one indication of this concern at the close of 1998 total hipc debt long and shortterm stood at 2057 billion this amounts to only 8 of total developing country debt but the burden of this debt is plainly evident when it is compared to hipc economic performance table 3 developing country debt and debt ratios 19701998 total public and private debt in

1980 to 335 in 1990 and 373 in 1998 for latin america it grew from 348 in 1980 to 447 in 1990 reflecting the debt crisis period falling back to 369 in 1998 in africa debt ballooned from 241 of gnp in 1980 to 647 in 1990 rising even further to 683 by 1998 for the hipc group the numbers are even worse debt to gnp increased from 440 in 1980 to 1328 in 1990 improving slightly to 1215 in 1998 by this measure hipc indebtedness is three times the average for all developing countries although relatively small in dollar terms another key ratio of debt burden is total debt to exports exports are means for paying external debt so to the extent that the ratio of debt to exports rises falls it suggests that any debt problem is becoming increasingly harder easier to manage for all developing countries this ratio increased from 853 in 1980 to 1462 in 1998 suggesting that the burden of debt was growing for latin america the ratio again reflects the 1980s debt crisis growing from 2019 in 1980 to 2561 in 1990 and then retreating to 2025 in 1998 in the extreme case of the hipc countries an increase in this ratio from 1744 in 1980 to 5032 in 1990 suggests substantially worsening debt management problem among the poorest countries and although the ratio improved to 3863 in 1998 in part due to debt relief efforts it remains very high as it does for subsaharan africa at 2321 in summary two points can be highlighted in the current developing country debt problem first hipc countries are heavily indebted relative to their ability to pay because of very weak economic performance second despite heavy indebtedness they need large net inflows of private capital if they are to develop which is unlikely given their existing debt load expanded debt relief is seen as one answer to this catch22 predicament but there is disagreement on how to proceed comparing the 1990s hipc debt problem with the 1980s latin american debt crisis can provide valuable lessons for the policy debate debt problems in latin america and africa although sovereign debt is normal part of any countrys financial position when it becomes excessive it can expose if not trigger serious economic problems this was the case of mexicos dramatic default in 1982 which ushered in latin americas debt crisis and subsequent decade of economic stagnation what made this crisis from the perspective of the developed world particularly the united states was the fact that much of the debt was owed to large us moneycenter banks failure to keep developing country debt repayments current would mean huge writeoffs and in the minds of many risked the collapse of these banks if not the international financial system although the african case differs in some respects the policy dilemmas that latin america faced are still

interest payments this allowed the net transfer of financial resources to remain substantially positive when the crisis hit in 1982 bank lending dried up but interest obligations did not as net capital inflows dropped suddenly capital flight and net interest payments remained high high debt burden the net transfer of financial resources went from positive 113 billion in 1981 to negative 187

importance of these different causes there is little disagreement that to varying degrees domestic policy decisions bank lending strategies and external economic conditions collided to spark the crisis debtor country policies brisk economic growth in most latin american countries during the 1970s allowed certain amount of complacency to creep into the policymaking processes which were crafted

indebtedness in the 1980s with some deficits pushing to 1520 of gdp given loose credit conditio ns in the global financial markets countries could meet competing domestic needs by overspending and borrowing abroad at lower interest rates than at home leading to large current account deficits to great extent politics dictated borrowing strategy because stability could be bought over the short term by spending on variety of programs without raising taxes countries saved and invested less but consumed more in public outlays through foreign borrowing debt management exacerbated the debt buildup as the amount of debt grew it was serviced by additional borrowing so many countries failed to meet even minimal interest payments with domestic resources combined with using debt for consumpti on rather than investment the effect was to compound the debt service problem quickly as one economist wrote since accumulation of external debt was growing at faster pace than the accumulation of productive investment debt crisis was just question of time13 to make matters worse many national governments assumed responsibility for private corporate debt after the crisis hit this socalled socialization of debt added much to some countrys overall indebtedness policy that has been highly criticized by many debt experts14 exchange rate policy and capital flight also contributed to the debt buildup the use of fixed nominal exchange rates to control inflation led to real adjusted for inflation currency appreciation without some downward adjustment to the exchange rate exports became more expensive relative to imports driving up the trade and current account deficits as speculation grew that exchange rates were overvalued capital flight ensued in effect as the private sector in the developing countries began to protect its capital from an expected depreciation by investing abroad us bank accounts bonds stocks real estate the public sector covered the capital loss by borrowing abroad capital flight amounted to tens of billions of dollars for many latin american countries causing foreign reserves to dry up at an alarming rate and becoming leading

rates earlier correcting large fiscal deficits and limiting capital flows for example south korea succeeded with just such fiscal reform when debt became problem in 1981 and colombia avoided large fiscal imbalance and so stands as an important exceptio n to latin american debt rescheduling in the 1980s commercial bank lending policies although debtor countries were responsible for much of their initial indebtedness international banks also played role in the crisis credit policy was clearly an issue banks weigh various risk factors when allocating loans and conditions for lending to developing countries usually reflect the additional risk by requiring stricter terms such as premium on the interest rate shorter maturity or linking debt to shortterm interest rates or foreign currency historically banks have done well lending to developing countries including accounting for losses from default which have occurred repeatedly over the past two centuries the risk premiums reflect an expectation that at some point not all loans will be repaid in full in the case of the latin american debt crisis however creditors appeared to act imprudently loose credit standards beginning in the 1970s many argue ignored history and common sense given that the stock of outstanding debt soon eclipsed all previous levels since the 1930s when defaults also soared during the great depression16 collectively bank lending to developing countries amounted to nearly 300 of their capital base with much of it occurring right before the debt crisis as one study points out bank lending to the major debtors in the time period immediately prior to mexicos default 198081 doubled with much of it financing capital flight even as the crisis unfurled17 despite history to the contrary banks assumed that countries would not default zero sovereign risk and so lent to governments without adequate concern for the economic feasibility of projects18 developing country loans were also highly profitable right up until the crisis hit it was not until after the crisis emerged that banks withdrew funds in delayed response to risk global liquidity was another key issue with the surge in oil prices in 197374 oil exporting countries pumped massive amounts of dollars into the international economy through liquid investments in the united states and other industrial economies these large

debt and aid were used increasingly to finance basic fuel import needs the 198182 global recession and concurrent rise in interest rates had similarly compounding effects on africas debt as they did in latin america leading to over 100 debt rescheduling cases in the mid1980s30 africas many problems have led to slow economic growth and an inability to service even relatively small amounts of foreign debt for example at one extreme east asia was able to sidestep the debt crisis in part because of annual gdp growth rates that averaged 75 in the 1980s and 94 in the 1990s by contrast africa could muster growth economic growth of only 18 and 20 respectively over the same time periods closer look at these figures reveals significant discrepancy among countries the top nine grew at an average annual rate of 31 over the past three decades whereas the bottom nine contracted by 2031 overall however african economies have lagged badly even by developing country standards almost guaranteeing that at some point debt would become serious problem32 the poorest african countries that qualify as part of the hipc group find themselves in the very difficult position of not being

lindauer why not africa pp 916 and 20changes in economic policy to correct part of the answer may lie with debt relief proposals particularly if accompanied with policy reform because these countries appear incapable of growing out of their debt in summary latin america and africa can point to some similar trends that have caused serious debt problems africa differs however in having specific problems particular to many countries in the region that have compounded their debt burden these include having much poorer initial conditions highly fractionalized societies weaker links to the international economic community and political systems and institutions that are extremely elitist if not corrupt collectively these characteristics contribute to highly risky and otherwise unappealing investment environment retrospective on debt policy despite the need for broad social and political change investment in physical capital is still among the most important factors for economic development33 domestically hipc countries must find way to save and invest more in themselves externally they require large amounts of foreign financing beyond that available in the form of aid part of the solution may be greater use of hipc debt relief but there is considerable debate over how to proceed this is not unusual controversy and divisiveness are central themes in the history of debt relief policy whereas discussions on reducing the actual debt obligations of poor countries is now commonplace it has been long difficult journey from the time debt relief was considered precedentsetting option to becoming accepted policy when the 1980s debt crisis erupted debt reduction was not possibility policy options focused on finding ways to keep debtor countries current in their obligations without reducing their debt load in time this changed but it was arduous process private debt rescheduling and concerted lending the first stab at debt relief policy in the 1980s was known as concerted lending in which commercial banks were collectively encouraged or forced to reschedule debt extending loan agreements and incorporating lapsed interest payments individual banks were reluctant to sign on and the imf was unwilling to extend credit without firm private sector commitment nonetheless the prevailing viewpoint was that all interests would be served best by preventing massive default so the imf took the lead role in coordinating response with clear obligations for all three parties the private banks would reschedule loans and provide new financing the

behind this strategy proved faulty however because it rested on the dubious assumption that most debtor countries faced problem of liquidity rather than insolvency and that in time they would be able to grow out of their debt35 in hindsight it is clear that this did not happen in fact developing country debt actually worsened because the dollar value of new bank lending was less than the repayments debtor countries made to the banks this strategy bought time for the commercial banks to build up loan loss reserves but could not reduce total debt36 as discussions moved toward the possibility of debt forgiveness the united states reacted negatively to proposals to cancel any debt obligations the policy was formalized as the baker plan named for the former us treasury secretary unveiled in 1985 in which the world bank and commercial lenders continued to lend to indebted countries with the lead role ideally left to the bankers but ultimately assumed by official lenders the baker plan which may be viewed as little more than an extension of the private sector concerted lending approach proved shortlived and succeeded only in lengthening debt maturities and transferring debt from commercial to official lenders it too failed to alleviate overall indebtedness marketbased debt relief at about the same time that the baker plan surfaced market solutions emerged in the private sector in which various types of debt conversio n mechanisms were crafted on casebycase basis in strategy dubbed the menu approach one common option the debtequity swap allowed debt to be

forced the secondary market value of developing country debt to plummet which caused one debt expert to opine that without the low secondary market prices the marketoriented debt conversion of the brady plan would have been impossible38 the united states came around to supporting commercial debt reduction strategy in early 1989 following change in administration continued prodding from various interest groups and growing sense that the debt problem longer could cause major financial collapse the new approach dubbed the brady plan for then us secretary of the treasury nicholas brady promoted some level of debt andor debt service reduction including debt buybacks combined with repackaging of remaining bank loans into various types of bonds that could then be traded on the securities markets in most cases brady deals included coordinated lending from multilateral institutions and requisite policy reforms by debtor governments this new strategy was essentially voluntary cooperative process that targeted each deal to the particular needs of the debtor country and the lender given that banks had provisioned against loan losses and that the new bonds were collateralized and transferable they had two strong incentives to join in even if it meant taking writeoff first they could strengthen their balance sheets by replacing basically worthless loans with higher grade bond debt second they could exit from any remaining developing country debt obligation by trading the bonds in the secondary market39 the debt crisis begun in 1982 eventually subsided in the mid1990s in part because of brady debt relief which helped restore confidence in debtor country finances sufficient for capital to return40 policy reforms very much reaction to the debt crisis were equally important providing environments more conducive to private investment while also directly reducing the debt burden financial sector reform for example was critical for encouraging capital to return

decision consequently africa did not face the sudden withdrawal of capital that sparked the latin american crisis nonetheless official bilateral creditors developed countries eventually had to face the prospect of debt relief for the african nations which was done through an informal group of creditor countries known as the paris club42 until 1988 it too avoided debt reduction relying on debt

approach official creditor debt resched uling under the paris club reduced poor country cash flow obligations but worsened overall indebtedness43 also like the private sector experience paris club countries soon determined that debt relief would have to move beyond rescheduli ng to forgiveness if poor countries were ever to reduce the debt burden to sustainable levels at the 1988 g7 summit in

reschedulin g all debt at belowmarket rates or 3 rescheduling at market rates but with an extended grace payment period most countries chose not to give the most relief under option one and so although the socalled toronto terms offered the first round of true debt relief from paris club countries its impact was limited44 it soon became evident that the initial level of paris club debt relief was not going to significantly alleviate debt burdens and so it was expanded the terms were enhanced in 1991 for example allowing for lengthened maturities while the present value debt

present value of their debt and their debt service payments particularly in dealing with interest arrears the significant reduction in debt burden for hipc countries is evident in the decline in the average paid debt service ratio of over 30 in 1986 to 17 in 1997 importantly debt forgiveness combined with aid and other official transfers has allowed for positive flow of resources to continue into these countries avoiding the large negative outflow that occurred in latin america during the mid1980s nonetheless debt has remained nagging issue in some cases suggesting need for greater relief46 the hipc initiative multilateral institutions were brought into the debt relief mix with the hipc initiative which was adopted by the world bank and imf in september 1996 much as private banks and the paris club initially hesitated to forgive debt in the 1980s multilateral lenders also have been reluctant to reduce debt until alternatives appeared exhausted waiting nearly decade longer than other international lenders with the hipc initiative multilateral debt relief builds on existing efforts by the paris club to reduce claims on those poor countries struggling with unsustainable debt levels multilateral debt forgiveness is financed from the imf world bank regional development banks and developed countries47 as initially conceived country qualifies for hipc debt relief by demonstrating through lengthy and complicated process that it 1 is eligible only for concessional assistance from the imf and world bank 2 has an unsustainable debt burden even after traditional debt relief

the entry point of the process the first stage begins which relies essentially on existing standard debt relief mechanisms naples terms for bilateral debt relief coupled with adopting structural reform programs see above after three years the debtor country arrives at the decision point where its debt situation is reevaluated countries either have reduced debt to sustainable level and exit the program or graduate to stage two at stage two they are eligible for enhanced relief from the paris club of up to 90 of nonconcessional debt on present value basis nonparis club countries and

hipc debt reduction for fiscal years 20002003 this includes total of 210 million for additional us bilateral debt forgiveness and 600 million to finance multilateral debt reduction if greater emphasis on debt relief is desired to help poor countries develop it should be pursued with the experiences of the past clearly in mind key point to consider is that most developing countries are not overly indebted and international debt markets can support their development goals for the hipc countries however debt may be drag on economic growth and so debt forgiveness may afford an opportunity to boost the development process the hipc enhanced framework which has increased the potential speed and quantity of debt relief reflects broad perspective that more has to be done to help the poorest countries improve their chances for development efforts have so far stopped short of embracing unconditional debt relief which experience suggests may be counterproductive because it does not have the supporting leverage to encourage broader economic political and social reform one oftrepeated lesson of the debt relief history is that if the goal of debt reduction is to support growth and development it must become part of longterm investment strategy other broadly suggested components of such strategy include increasing domestic saving rates avoiding large fiscal deficits and reengaging the global private capital markets encouraging foreign direct investment and technology transfer while minimizing the risk of major financial imbalances avoiding large sudden movements of shortterm capital this argues for incorporating debt relief into broader reform package with many players and policies having mutually supportive roles debt relief management on the creditor side experience suggests that debt reduction be comprehensive or sufficiently large and involving all major creditors rescheduling or postponing assistance appears to compound the problem by delaying growth and development this point became evident with the pitfalls of the private sector concerted lending schemes including the baker plan and the wellintentioned paris club concessional refinancing schemes recent changes to the hipc initiative reflect this viewpoint question that remains for some is whether these recent changes go far enough in helping poor countries overcome and prevent the recurrence of unsustainable debt on the debtor side good country debt management policies support relief by helping direct new financial resources to producti ve purposes in both the public and private sectors which will promote development and reduce the possibility of relapsing into heavy indebtedness debt relief and poverty reduction this goal is receiving increased attention particularly under the hipc initiative yet debt relief is guarantee that poverty or social conditions will improve first debt does not cause poverty so more than debt relief is needed to reduce it second because financial resources are largely fungible within government budgets debt relief is guarantee that social program spending will grow many countries have competing demands for financial resources somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30449crs23 52 nontariff barriers to trade antidumping and countervailing duties are major concern for developing countries and many experts believe it is counterproductive to pursue debt relief while blocking the exports of developing countrieswith powerful constituencies such as the military therefore social spending will only grow with debt relief to the extent that specific policy goals are adopted and enforced third increased social spending will not necessarily improve social conditions social programs need to be targeted well crafted and ably administered hipc country reforms developing countries themselves have responsibility for enacting policy and institutional reform to help create an environment conducive to investment and growth the 1980s reforms in latin america were critical components of renewed growth and were product of domestic commitments spurred by necessity and assisted by the brady debt restructuring program by contrast in many african countries where civil stability and reform are lacking the failure to develop is equally evident good policies also help country survive when the external environment becomes adverse falling terms of trade rising interest rates global recession arguing for policy reform as condition of debt forgiveness private sector participation hipc countries are in need of private capital just as private capital flows were major factor improving the debt situation in latin america so too must they be in africa without private investment the debt relief efforts of the multilateral organizations will be too small relative to the financial needs of the poorest countries history has shown that private lenders often fail to respond to individual debtor histories so many countries are punished because they are grouped with other developing countries even though they may have markedly different credit histories the private sector will need encouragement to return to the poorest countries but will likely hesitate unless conditions and reforms create more conducive investment climate developed country response if the hipcs are to succeed developed countries and international financial institutions will need to cooperate and support them as they attempt to reform and adapt to changing international economic trends solutions that prolong excessive indebtedness delay develop ment as the latin american debt crisis clearly demonstrated this point supports the decision to adopt the enhanced framework of the hipc initiative additionally foreign aid has proven helpful at the margin and may best be used to pursue immediate social needs but is not adequate to affect longterm development and is not substitute for debt forgiveness to the extent that foreign aid means more debt it could also compound the problem nor will debt reduction provide the needed impetus to grow if developed countries pursue policies that inhibit imports from developing countries if developing economies are to grow they will need the widest possible access to foreign markets52 greater assistance finally call has gone out for much larger transfer of resources from the developed to the developing world

likely controversial public policy issue for the developed world53 heavy indebtedness of the poorest countries is serious problem but only one that they face in the context of broader economic and social development reducing hipc debt burdens can be most effective if it is thought of as part of an opportunity for structural change in countries that may lead them back to the growth path the hipc countries are different than other developing nations in this respect the benefit of debt reduction may be limited however because it is not capable of overcoming many of the other obstacles to development that need to be addressed directly without broader change and generous response by developed countries the benefits of debt forgiveness may well prove shortlived or simply inadequate
