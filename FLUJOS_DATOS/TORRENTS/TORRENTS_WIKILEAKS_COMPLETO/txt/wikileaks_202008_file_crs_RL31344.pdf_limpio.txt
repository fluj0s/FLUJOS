of current law that would be affected or modified by the bills the cwa and sdwa provisions that these two bills would amend are principally the portions of those laws that authorize federal financial assistance to state revolving loan funds srfs for purposes of building and upgrading wastewater treatment and drinking water treatment facilities in compliance with the laws congress established the cwa srf program in 1987 and the sdwa srf program in 1996 under both federal capitalization gran ts are provided as seed money for stateadministered loans which communities repay to the state providing source of capital for future investments both laws contain provisions that specify requirements for states to establish srfs and requirements that apply to the srfs operation such as plans and reporting both define categories of projects eligible for assistance who may receive assistan ce and types of assistance activities key intention of both bills is to exte nd srf authorizations s 1961 authorizes 35 billion total for fy20032007 20 billion for the cwa srf 15 billion for the sdwa srf while hr 3930 also author izes 20 billion for the cwa srf for the same time period in additi on both would conform the two laws in several respects for example the sdwa currently allows states to offer longer loan repayment periods and additional subsidization to disadvantaged commun ities and both bills would add parallel provisions to the cwa the bills are not identical however in some cases they take different approaches to an issue such as how to re vise the formula for statebystate

comparison of s 1961 and hr 3930 introduction this report provides sidebyside comparison of two major bills in the 107th congress concerning water infrastructure pr oject financing it compares provisions of s 1961 the water investment act of 2002 which would amend both the clean water act cwa and safe drinking wa ter act sdwa and hr 3930 the water quality financing act of 2002 which would amend only the cw it also describes relevant provisions of current law that would be affected or modified by the bills the cwa and sdwa provisions that by these two bills would amend are principally the portions of those laws that authorize federal financial assistance to state revolving loan funds srfs for purposes of building and upgrading wastewater treatment and drinking water treatment facilities in compliance with those laws respectively under both programs federal capitalization grants are provided as seed money for stateadministered loans recipients repay loans to the state enabling the state to build up source of capital for future investments congress established the cwa srf program in 1987 pl 1004 replacing what previously had been cwa program of grants to municipalities before 1996 the sdwa had not authorized federal assistance for drinking water treatment facilities but in that year congress established the sdwa sr f program pl 104182 modeling it after the cwa program while also refining it to reflect early implementation of pl 100 4 for background information see crs report rl31116 water infrastructure funding review and analysis of current issues key intention of both bills is to extend and increase srf authorizations in the case of the cwa program authoriza tions under the 1987 law expired at the end of fy1994 but congress has continued to appropriate monies for capitalization grants each year since then the sdwa srf program is authorized through fy2003 s 1961 authorizes 35 billion total for the two srf programs for fy2003 2007 20 billion for the cwa srf 15 billion for the sdwa srf while hr 3930 also authorizes 20 billion for the cwa srf for the same time period in addition both s 1961 and hr 3930 would conf orm aspects of the programs in the two laws for example the sdwa currently allows states to offer longer loan repayment periods and additional subs idization on loans to disadvantaged communities and both bills would add parallel provisions to the cwa the bills are not identical however in some cases they take different approaches to an issue such as how to re vise the formula for statebystate allotment of

3930 also included two prov isions to modify portions of federal tax law that affect wastewater and drinking wate r infrastructure financing one provision would modify the internal revenue code to reclassify bonds for projects furnishing water and sewer projects as exempt from annual state ca ps on private activity bonds the other would modify the code to exempt earnings on bonds collateralized with assistance from cwa srf or sdwa srf from requirements to reba to the government arbitrage profits on unspent bond proceeds these tax provisions were included in hr 3930 as ordered reported by the transportation and infrastructure committee on march 20 the bill was subsequently referred to the ways and means committee for consideration of matters within its jurisdiction that committee ordered the bill reported on april 17 with an amendment which removed the tax provisions 2 congress also has considered water infrastruct ure legislation that focuses specifically on security issues for discussion of this gislation see for example crs report rl31294 safeguarding the nations drinking water epa and congressional actions private utilities to receive cwa srf assistan ce the senate bill would require states to work with wastewater utilities to attain technical managerial and financial capability the sdwa currently has s imilar provision both bills would permit states to make longer term srf loans to economically disadvantaged communities hr 3930 would permit such loans to be made for up to 30 years while s 1961 generally extends clean water and drinki ng water srf loans from 20 years to up to 30 years and would permit loans to econo mically disadvantaged communities under both programs to be made for up to 40 years the house bill addresses several issues not included in the senate measure it w ould for example extend requirements for 11 cwa reports to congress and reauthoriz the acts state management assistance grant program in section 1061 house and senate committees
