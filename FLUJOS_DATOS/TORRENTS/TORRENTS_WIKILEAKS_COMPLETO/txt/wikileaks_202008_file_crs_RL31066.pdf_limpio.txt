deficiency syndrome is serious medical condition that predisposes patients towards opportunistic infections tumors dementia and death human immunodeficiency virus hiv is the viral agent associated with aids hivaids remains leading cause of death in the united states exposure rates in some other parts of the world such as subsaharan africa substantially exceed those in the united states the global hivaids pandemic has had severe impact upon many states within the developing world and future social and economic consequences could be devastating recently introduced antiretroviral drugs have reduced the number of deaths caused by hivaids these medicines can keep hiv from replicating and causing further damage to the immune system although the cost of an annual supply of different hivaids drugs varies the prices of these drugs are beyond the ability of most residents of the developing world to pay because some hivaids drugs are subject to patent protection others may not manufacture these drugs without the permission of the patent owner international disagreement has arisen regarding patents on hivai ds drugs until recently many nations did not allow patents to issue on pharmace uticals however one component of the world trade organization agreements the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights the trips agreement requires member states to grant pharmaceutical patents demand for increased availability of hivaids drugs has led to perceived conflicts with this trips agreement obligation although patent disputes concerning brazil and south africa have recently been resolved fundamental conflict persists between the goals of providing broad access to hivaids drugs on one hand and maintaining an environment conducive to pharmaceutical research and development on the other legislation has been introduced in the 107th congress relating to the availability of drugs for treating hivaids these and other options for dealing with this issue are discussed other options include providing the us trade representative with policy guidance that balances trips agreement compliance with the availability of hivaids drugs encouraging the differential pricing of hiva ids drugs in the developed and developing world promoting marketbased solutions such as global settlement between entrepreneurial pharmaceutical companies and nations

the trips agreement issues and options introduction pharmaceuticals remain an important industry both for the economy of the united states and for the health of its citizens with the united states serving as the worlds largest market for pharmaceutical sales the us pharmaceutical industry is among the nations most profitable1 us manufacturers have consistently maintained positive international trade balance and are responsible for nearly half of the major pharmaceutical products marketed worldwide excluding public sanitation improvements the most significant advances in medicine were fueled by the discovery of innovative drugs2 ongoing advances in biotechnology genetics information technology and other fields suggest that the pharmaceutical industry will continue progress towards the discovery and development of new pharmaceuticals drug discovery and development is costly and timeconsuming undertaking3 one widely quoted report found that on average this process consumes 12 to 15 years and costs 500 million per new drug brought to market4 most new drugs can be copied quickly and cheaply however given technical environment where products are difficult to develop but easy to copy the pharmaceutical industry has been described as particularly dependent upon the patent system5 by providing proprietary rights in innovative pharmaceutical compounds patents protect research based drug companies from direct competition for limited period of time patents may allow pharmaceutical companies to appropriate the benefits of their research and development efforts thereby stimulating them to engage in such efforts in the first place one study concluded that 65 of new drugs would not have been commercially introduced in the absence of patent protection6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31066crs2 6continued feb 1986 175 7agreement on trader elated aspects of intellectual property rights apr 15 1994 marrakesh agreement establishing the world trade

states not all countries traditionally allowed pharmaceutical patents some commentators believe that lack of effective patent protection abroad has cost us firms billions of dollars per year in lost revenue the advent of the socalled trips agreement the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights of the world trade organization wto7 was expected to increase the availability of patent protection for pharmaceuticals abroad8 under the trips agreement all wto members agreed to amend their paten t laws to allow patents to issue on pharmaceuticals wto members also agreed to restrict their use of compulsory licenses procedure through which government obliges patentees to allow others to practice the patented invention the efforts of some foreign countries to counter the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids have brought controversy to the intersection of the patent system and the pharmaceutical industry certain drugs developed and patented by us companies have dramatically changed the length and quality of life of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus hiv some developing countries have sought access to these drugs at low cost authorities have called for the importation of generic versions of brandname hivaids drugs for example while others have encouraged local production of generic drugs whether the patent owner agrees to such measures or not many commentators regard the fulfillment of these requests as moral imperative9 the unprecedented devastation worked by the hivaids pandemic threatens to undermine the governments economy and social fabric of many states within the developing world efforts to curb the aids pandemic could amount to security imperative as well in view of the economic difficulties and political instability that could otherwise result in africa and potentially other parts of the developing world10 some observers are of the view however that initiatives that weak or circumvent patent rights may limit the ability of researchbased pharmaceutical companies to obtain returns sufficient to refund their investments and allow further investment in drug development including hivaids resear ch as

application merits the award of patent13 in deciding whether to approve patent application uspto examiner will consider whether the submitted application fully discloses and distinctly claims the invention14 the examiner will also determine whether the invention itself fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute to be patentable an invention must be useful novel and nonobvious the requirement of usefulness or utility is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides tangible benefit15 to be judged novel the invention must not be fully anticipated by prior

ordinary skills of competent artisan at the time the invention was made17 if the uspto allows the patent to issue the patent proprietor obtains the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the patented invention18 patent title therefore provides inventors with limited periods of exclusivity in which they may practice their inventions or license others to do so the grant of patent permits the inventor to receive return on the expenditure of resources leading to the discovery often by charging higher price than would prevail in competitive market the term of patent protection is set at 20 years from the date the application is filed19 the issuance of patent also places the technical information disclosed in the patent instrument within the public domain during the term of the patent comp etitors are stimulated to invent around the patented invention to provide for parallel technical developments or meet similar market needs once the patent expires others are free to practice the invention without compensation to the inventor significantly us patents provide their owners with rights only within the united states20 if inventors desire intellectual property protection in another country they must specifically procure patent in that jurisdiction usually this effort requires submitting patent application before foreign patent office as practical matter multinational corporations often obtain set of different national patents for each of their significant inventions patents on pharmaceuticals inventors of pharmaceutical compounds have obtained us patents for many years such inventors faced difficulties when they sought patent protection abroad however the patent laws of many other nations did not allow patents to issue on pharmaceutical inventions21 as result although researchbased pharmaceutical companies could obtain patents in the united states and some other countries their drugs could be freely copied elsewhere with the advent of the world trade organization in 1995 patents on pharmaceuticals became more widely available one component of the wto agreement is the socalled trips agreement or agreement on traderelatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31066crs5 22see trips agreement supra note 6 23trips agreement supra note 6 at art 26 24see trips agreement supra note 6 at art 70aspects of intellectual property rights22 under article 27 of the trips agreement wto members agreed to allow patents to issue on inventions in all fields of technology23 one consequence of this requirement is that many wto member states will begin to allow patents to issue on pharmaceuticals the trips agreement allows some exceptions to its basic requirement that patents issue in all fields of technology one of these exceptions provided in article 272 may be pertinent to the patenting of pharmaceuticals that provision states members may exclude from patentability inventions the prevention within their territo ry of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect ordre public or morality including to protect human animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment provided that such exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by their law wto members did not have to comply with article 27 of the trips agreement immediately for wto members other than developing and least developed countries the compliance date for all requirements of the trips agreement was set to january 1 1996 for signatory states designated as developing countries the trips agreeme nt set the general compliance date as january 1 2000 however there is one exception to this general date if on january 1 2000 developing country did not extend patent protection to all areas of technology within the meaning of article 27 that developing country may delay implementation of these provisions for an additional five years the practical effect of this additional transition period was that developing countries need not allow patents on pharmaceuticals until january 1 2005 the trips agreement also allows signatory state designated as least developed country to delay implementing the trips agreement until january 1 2010 showing of hardship may qualify leastdeveloped countries for further delays and other concessions the trips agreement does not oblige its signatories to protect subject matter that fell into the public domain prior to the time its obligations became effective24 for example many hivaids drugs were developed and marketed prior to the advent of the trips agreement such drugs may not be subject to patent protection in those jurisdictions that did not grant patents on pharmaceuticals prior to the trips agreement in effect the trips agreement apparently requires its signatories to provide patent protections for any hivaids drugs developed after 1995 and into the future as with other obligations imposed by the trips agreement these commitments are subject to enforcement through the wto dispute settlement body dsb if one wto member state believes that another member state is in violation of the tripshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31066crs6 25giust john noncompliance with trips by developed and developing countries is trips working 8 indiana international and comparative law review 1997 69agreement the member states may enter into consultation through the dsb if the member states cannot resolve their dispute the dsb will convene panel to hear and resolve the dispute panel decisions are subject to review by the dsb appellate body the wto agreement calls for compensatory trade measures in circumstances where the dsb finds wto member state to be in violation of the trips agreement yet that member state does not amend its laws pipeline protection although the trips agreement allows developing countries to delay implementing their patent law obligations it requires that they immediately establish socalled pipeline protection for pharmaceuticals some sources refer to pipeline protection as the mailbox rule25 under this requirement countries that do not allow pharmaceutical patents to issue must nonetheless accept patent applications these patent applications will essentially be held at the national patent office until it comes time for the patent application to be considered pipeline protection is valuable because it allows inventors to establish date of priority of invention although many years might pass between the applications filing date and the date on which it would be examined the inventiveness of the claimed invention must be judged as of its filing date pipeline protection allows inventors to maintain their priority of invention in the face of subsequent technical advances exclusive marketing rights the trips agreement also mandates that wto member states award an exclusive marketing right emr to pharmaceutical innovators in specified circumstances the holder of an emr concerning particular product is designated as the only entity authorized to distribute that product within the member state the award of emrs provides innovators with transitional patentlike market exclusivity in member states that do not yet offer patent protection for pharmaceuticals in order for an enter prise to obtain an emr in one wto member state that enterprise must obtain both patent and marketing approval on that pharmaceutical in another wto member state that enterprise must also take two additional steps within the jurisdiction in which an emr is sought first the enterprise must obtain marketing approval for the pharmaceutical second that enterprise must file patent application claiming that pharmaceutical upon completing these two steps the enterprise may obtain an emr with maximum duration of five years the emr will expire prior to the expiration of five years if either the marketed product is patented or the local patent office

the tide of cheaper drugs irish times 20 april 2001 14limitations on patent protection for pharmaceuticals some nations have restricted the scope of exclusive rights provided by their patent laws two such restrictions compulsory licenses and parallel importation are particularly pertinent to pharm aceutical patents compulsory license allows competitor of the patent owner to use the patented invention without the patent owners permission26 the term parallel importation refers to the practice of acquiring drugs in one country and without the authorization of the patent holder importing them into another country27 these topics are reviewed in turn below although compulsory licenses have played only minor role in the united states patent system28 many foreign patent statutes include such provisions29 these statutes typically require an interested party formally to reque st the compulsory license from the foreign government competent authorities then decide whether to grant the license as well as the terms of any granted license grounds for granting compulsory license include the abusive exercise of patent rights lack of domestic manufacture of the patented product commercialization of the patented good that does not satisfy the needs of the local market and national emergencies30 while some accounts suggest that formal compulsory licensing proceedings are commenced only infrequently the mere existence of compulsory licensing statute may do much to encourage bargaining between foreign patentee and domestic industry on terms favorable to local manufacturers31 the trips agreement places some limits upon the ability of wto member states to award compulsory licenses for the use of anothers patented invention among the most detailed provisions of the trips agreement article 31 imposes in part the following restrictions upon the issuance of compulsory licenses each application for compulsory license must be considered on its individual meritshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31066crs8 32ford sarah m compulsory licensing provisions under the trips agreement balancing pills and patents 15 american university international law review 2000 941

drugs houston chronicle 13 june 2001 26 34a ruling issued by the appellate body of the wto dsb would likely provide the most conclusive interpretation of the compulsory licensing provisions of the trips agreement the judgments of national courts andor officials of wto member states might also provide persuasive authority as to the scope of these provisions see chua adrian tl precedent and principles of wto panel jurisprudence 16 berkeley international law journal 1998 171the proposed user must have made efforts to obtain authorization from the patent owner on reasonable commercial terms and conditions and that such efforts have not been successful within reasonable period of time however this requirement may be waived in the case of national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency any such use shall be authorized predominantly for the supply of the domestic market of the member authorizing such use the compulsory license must be revocable if and when its motivating circumstances cease to exist and are unlikely to recur the patent owner must be paid adequate remuneration in the circumstances of each case taking into account the economic value of the authorization the legal validity of any decision relating to the authoriz ation of such use shall be subject to judicial or other independent review the conditions for compulsory licensing within the trips agreement involve number of ambiguities32 such terms as national emergency or circumstance of extreme urgency are not further defined33 it is not clear what exactly is meant by the requirement that compulsory license be granted primarily for the supply of the domestic market nor is there any clear definition of what level of adequate remune ration to the patent holder suffices the precise application of these limitations to medications for treating aids will not be fully understood until competent tribunal is called upon to interpret them an event that has yet to occur34 despite these ambiguities the possibility of grant of compulsory license may place meaningful limits upon the exercise of pharmaceutical patents under many foreign patent statutes compulsory licenses may be invoked on such grounds as the public order and the ready availability of the patented product in the domestic market if such compulsory licenses were issued in keeping with the procedural requirements of the article 31 then they would likely be deemed compatible with the trips agreement parallel importation presents another limitation upon the exercise of patent rights on pharmaceuticals as result of varying economic conditions and governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31066crs9 35for example 1997 study conducted by dr larry d sasich for the nongovernmental organization public citizen found that the

provide incentives for parallel importers to buy pharmaceuticals in countries where they are sold more cheaply and resell them in countries where they are sold at higher price36 parallel imports are genuine products in the sense that they originate from the brand name pharmac eutical company however the parallel importer acts independently of the brand name company typically selling at lower price than the patentee or its licensee in the country of importation as result the practice of parallel importation has been referred to as the gray market37 parallel importation has yet to play significant role in the us pharmaceutical market although the 106th congress passed law allowing the parallel importation of drugs from overseas into the united states the clinton administration refused to implement the law according to the clinton administration not only could the public be exposed to additional risks but the cost of implementing the legislation would outweigh its benefits38 however considerable grey market exists in consumer goods subject to trademark rights within the united states39 in some other countries parallel importation has played greater role in providing lower cost goods imported from other nations across number of market sectors40 commentators disagree over the effect of parallel importation upon the availability of pharmaceutic als in poor and developing

supplied to treatment programs in the developing world other commentators argue that if drugs are effectively available everywhere at the lowest price sold anywhere then pharmaceutical companies will sell drugs only in markets where they can command high price42 where pharmaceutical is protected by patent in the country of importation legal issues may arise with respect to parallel importation opponents of the grey market contend that parallel importers viola local rights when they sell patented drugs without the permission of the patent holder parallel importers assert that patentees should not be allowed to use intellectual property rights to enforce private product distribution arrangements to do so according to parallel importers would be to prevent the free movement of legitimate goods in the international marketplace countries have differed in their judgments on whether parallel importation violates domestic patent rights for example the japanese supreme court decided in 1997 that the importation of patented product does not violate japanese patent rights43 although the legal situation in the united states is not entirely clear most observers believe that court would decide that parallel importati on constitutes infringement of us patent44 because wto member countries could not agree on the appropriate legal standard for parallel importation article 6 of the trips agreement express ly states that it does not govern this issue as result wto signatories are free to develop their own intellectual property laws either approving or disallowing parallel importation pharmaceuticals for curbing hivaids patents issues have arisen with respect to pharmaceuticals for treating acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids aids has been described as the most dramatic pervasive and tragic pandemic in recent history45 hiv is associated with aids serious condition in which the bodys defenses against some illnesses are broken down infected individuals are

states47 the total number of reported deaths from aids in the united states is 43879548 hivaids exposure rates in some other parts of the world such as subsaharan africa are significantly higher than in the united states an estimated 34 million people living in subsaharan africa have been infected with hivaids of those infected approximately 115 million have died49 the hivaids crisis is one of extreme severity in many developing countries by 2010 it is projected that more than 44 million children in 34 developing countries will have lost at least one parent to the disease50 aids is devastating the education sector in many countries killing teachers and leading to school dropouts who must care for ill parents the gross domestic product of some subsaharan african countries could drop by 20 over more in the next decade life expectancy is also dipping in many countries with high rates of hiv infection in botswana for example life expectancy is just 39 years and is expected to drop to 29 years by 2010 according to the us census bureau the high rate of hivaids infection observed in many developing countries holds the potential to intensify poverty and destabilize economies governments and social infrastructures51 in the united states the number of deaths due to aids began to decrease in 1998 the principal reason for the decrease was the introduction of new drugs for treating hiv antiretroviral drugs in particular have had an impact52 these medicines can keep hiv from replicating making copies of itself and causing further damage to the immune system individuals infected with hivaids currently use several sorts of antiretroviral medications the first available antihiv agents were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nrtis this class of therapies includes lamivudine 3tc stavudine d4t and zidovudine azt these agents work by preventing hiv viral replication in infected cells second class consists of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors

include amprenavir crixivan and invirase under current standards the use of single one of these medications is disfavored such therapy is believed to have low efficacy and high resistance rates53 the favored approach employs three antiretroviral medications in combination for example doctor might prescribe the use of two nrtis along with one pi or one nnrti plus two nrtis this drug cocktail technique is often referred to as highly active antiretroviral therapy or haart it is believed to be highly effective maximizing hiv eradication while minimizing the development of resistance to aids drugs dean barry r bloom of the harvard school of public health observed that these drug combinations have reduced aids deaths by 73 54 some experts believe that providing haart to large numbers of people in the developing world will require major health infrastructure improvements effective haart requires supp ly channels that can make the drugs constantly available and regular monitoring of patients both to deal with side effects and to adjust medications if drug resistance emerges many fear that if the drugs are taken irregularly resistant strains will emerge that could cause untreatable infections worldwide infrastructure improvements are likely to come slowly however and the numbers receiving the drugs are expected to remain small at least initially55 the high costs of antiretroviral drugs have also concerned many observers for example paulo teixeira the director of brazils national health program stated that the prices of these drugs are beyond the realm of this world56 patients in developed coun tries reportedly pay 10000 to 15000 annually for these medicines57 still hiv drug therapy is cost effective in extending lives in comparison with treatments for other serious diseases one recent study showed for example that coronary artery bypass surgery and dialysis cost 113000 and 50000 per lifeyear saved respectively58 in response to complaints over high drug prices as well as other statements of concern drug manufacturers have agreed to lower prices for example on march 7 2001 merck co offered to sell both crixivan protease inhibitor and stocrin

distribution program government facilities manufacture seven antihivaids medications including antiretroviral combination therapies and distribute them to hivaids patients free of charge61 many of these medicines are the subject of patent protection in other countries however because brazil did not allow patents to issue on pharmaceuticals prior to its accession to the trips agreement these drugs are not subject to brazilian patent rights many observers believe the brazilian program to be highly successful and should serve as model for other nations62 brazil has been identified as the

offering to pay for 90 percent of the cost of drugs for the developing world at the expense of future profits and research events in brazil and south africa underscore the policy tradeoffs inherent in meeting two fundamental public health goals ensuring broad access to existing pharmaceuticals yet maintaining research and development pipeline that encourages the introduction of new drugs in

issues for the researchbased pharmaceutical industry current disputes concerning patents on hivaidsrelated medications raise issues concerning public image public health research funding and intellectual property for the researchbased pharmaceutical industry some observers believe that current controversies over hivaids drugs have cast drug companies in negative light80 other commentators have stated that patent rights place the profits of the pharmaceutical industry over the health of individuals another reason for this negative impression according to the wall street journal is that the hivaids crisis has caused pharmaceutical companies to lower prices signif icantly on drugs sold in the developing world81 some critics believe that these price cuts have revealed what they see as overly high profit levels on innovative pharmaceuticals as well as significant levels of executive compensation advertising expenditures and marketing outlays82 supporters of the pharmaceutical industry have responded to these concerns by citing the need of entrepreneurial drug companies to obtain returns on investment and satisfy investors the pharmaceutical industry further maintains that its profit levels are needed to support costly and timeconsuming research and development efforts if drugs are less profitable to research develop and market industry representatives explain future research and development efforts could be diminished some observers believe that patents have never served as significant barrier between pharmaceuticals and hivaids patients patents on many hivaids drugs have not been sought in many developing countries research has not revealed single patent infringement case filed against health care provider of hivaids drugs anywhere in the developing world even public health activist james love director of the consumer project on technology has observed that the patent situation in lot of these african countries is really hard to nail down83 events in

questioned the link betw een hiv and aids for example and government drug program is in place to assist most south african aids sufferers86 the hivaids crisis has nonetheless placed critical accounts of the patent law into the popular press some observers believe that adverse public opinion could impact the shape of the trips agreement itself the incoming wto director general panichadpki supachai reportedly has made reform of the trips agreement top priority87 some believe that this effort could result in changes to the ground rules of the international patent system before that system has the opportunity to become firmly rooted it might also lead to broader acceptance of parallel importation as well as easing the conditions under which wto member could issue compulsory license pharmaceutical industry actions that decrease foreign drug prices could lead to diminished sales or lower prices in the united states price disparities may encourage individuals to import into the united states lowcost drugs purchased abroad the availability of lowercost drugs abroad may also strength efforts to obtain drugs more cheaply in the united states for example some states are considering measures to control the costs of medicines including the creation of large drug purchasing pools the increased bargaining power of such pools may result in discounts for pharmaceutical purchases88 such efforts could result in noticeable shortterm gains for consumers some observers anticipate however that these trends hold the potential to inflict significant financial losses for researchbased pharmaceutical companies89 one mechanism for absorbing these revenue losses would be to increase the price of other products in particular the price of patented drugs that are not subject to price controls or compulsory licenses some commentators believe that this possibility would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31066crs19 politically unpalatable in markets where such conditions exist including the united states hivaids patients in the united states may object to paying more for the same medication than their counterparts in other countries second technique that pharmaceutical companies could employ is to reduce expenditures including adver tising marketing and research and development budgets companies might elect to engage in activities with lower associated risk such as the production of generic drugs smaller research and development budgets may lead to the decreased development of new pharmaceuticals there has also been significant increase in mergers of enterprises within the pharmaceutical industry these mergers have been inspired by desire to reduce costs and to concentrate research and development efforts upon socal led blockbuster drugs this outcome too could lead to an overall reduction in drug development if competition in innovation is reduced and the incentive to invest substantially in research and development declines the conflict between encouraging innovative efforts on one hand and disseminating the fruits of these labors on the other has frequently pitted innovators and the user community against one another but while the debate between drug develope rs and pharmaceutical users is familiar one experience has provided paucity of rigorous analytical methods for investigating their competing claims the relationshi p between innovation and patent rights remains poorly understood current economic and policy tools do not allow us to calibrate the patent system precisely in order to produce an optimal level of investment in innovation as congress monitors these issues the debate will likely focus on how best to achieve balance between contemporary public health needs and traditional engine of innovation legislative issues and options legislation addressing some of these issues has been introduced in the 107th congress to some the tremendous contributions of the us researchbased pharmaceutical industry to the global pharmacopeia suggest that modifications to the patent law should be approached with caution for others the unprecedented impact of the hivaids pandemic as well as the nascent status of the patent law throughout much of the developing world demand relaxation of trips agreement obligations should congress review these issues legislative options that could contribute to the availability of inexpensive drugs for treating hivaids in the developing world yet sustain an environment conducive to pharmaceutical research and development domestically are explored below codify executive order 13155 one option may be to confirm legislatively an executive order concerning the international intellectual property issues with respect to hivaids drugs events

or the most common opportunistic infections that accompany hivaids in any foreign country undergoing an hivaidsrelated public health crisis if the laws or policies of that country1 promote access to

brazilian compulsory license clause the effect of executive order 13155 has been rather modest that executive order limits the actions of the united states and in particular the discretion of the us trade representative to the extent that foreign patent law complies with the trips agreement however many developing nations and public health nongovernmental organizatio ns wish to launch hivaids

application of any provision of any other international agreement relating to intellectual property rights that would prohibit or otherwise restrict those countries from establishing or implementing any law or policy that promotes access to hivaids pharmaceuticals or medical technologies to their populations one difference between s 463 and hr 933 is that the house bill would require the united states to forgive certain violations of the trips agreement in contrast s 463 supports foreign patent laws and policies regarding hivaids treatments only to the extent that they comply with the trips agreement consequence of this distinction is that hr 933 would effectively limit the actions the united states could commence before the wto dispute settlement body because intellectual property based

an april 2001 conference jointly sponsored by the wto and world health organization some observers announced their views that differential pricing would best balance the needs of aids patients and the researchbased pharmaceutical industry92 differential pricing potentially allows companies that make patented drugs to recover most of the costs of research and development in richer markets and at the same time sell or license production at lower prices in developing countries 93 ellen t hoen legal advisor for the international organization médeci ns sans frontières has raised objections to

the invention secrecy act 119 military law review 1988 201in addition to these fundamental objections several practical difficulties attend the proposed differential pricing system experience teaches that generic drugs sold in one part of the world may readily find their way into another in particular domestic laws that support parallel importation encourage the availability of grey market goods such arbitrage could cut into those markets that are supposed to provide the profits that support research and development some observers are concerned that this proposal might also require poor patients in the developed world to subsidize rich patients in the developing world95 for some persons another pragmatic concern with differential pricing regime is that low drug prices in one country may spread to other countries96 authorities in canada italy the netherlands and other nations regulate local prices in part based on international comparisons if these comparisons involved developing countries then there is possibility of substantially diminished drug prices in the developed world as well of course some pharmaceutical consumers and other individuals would likely view this effect as positive development if congress believes differential pricing to be an appropriate policy it could take steps to encourage this regime these might include discouraging parallel importation by clarifying us patent law on this point and encouraging other nations to take similar steps more effective border controls could be established in order to control the importation of drugs designated for the developing world and discouraging regulation based upon foreign pharmaceutical prices market segmentation congress could also consider the recent proposal of economist jean lanjouw of yale university ms lanjouw has suggested that drug companies ought to elect whether to procure and enforce patents in either the developed or developing world97 this scheme takes advantage of current patent laws that require drug companies that perform research activities in the united states to seek socalled foreign filing license from the uspto prior to seeking foreign patent rights98 the foreign filing licensing regime has traditionally allowed appropriate authorities to determine whether the invention contains information that implicates national security or other interests prior to its exportation99 ms lanjouws proposal would expand the function of foreign filing license in exchange for the grant of foreign filing license the us government wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31066crs23 100phillips supra note 95require pharmaceutical companies to elect whether to obtain patent rights in either the developed or developing world ms lanjouw hypothesizes that company with new malari drug might elect to enforce patent rights in the developing world because that is where most cases of malaria arise but company with new hivai ds drug would likely prefer to elect the developed world ms lanjouw explains since that is where sales of such drug would prove most profitable if the foreign filing licensee violated its agreement the licensees us patent would be rendered unenforceable100 some practical implementation issues arise with respect to ms lanjouws proposal the developing world also has yet to establish track record of pharmaceutical patent enforceme nt as result there may be few takers of ms lanjouws option to relinquish patent rights in the developed world such trend would effectively encourage drug companies to produce medicines for diseases suffered by residents of the developed world offering few prospects for individuals who suffer from diseases common only in the developing world if the united states were the only nation to pursue the lanjouw proposal domestic entrepreneurs would also appear to suffer disadvantage not shared by foreign competitors absent this policy others would be free to both acquire and enforce patents everywhere this initiative could at an extreme cause relocation of research and development activities outside the united states as result such strategy if deemed useful might be more appropriate for international agreement than unilateral action global settlement another policy option would be encouragement of global negotiated settlement among the relevant actors congress might encourage global negotiated settlement between pertinen t entrepreneurial pharmaceutical companies and those countries seeking increased access to hivaids pharmaceuticals such settlement could allow these actors including the united states to avoid proceedings before the wto dispute settlement body it also holds the potential to reduce the transaction costs associated with individual dispute settlement and diminish disparities of drug pricing and availability among different developing countries humanitarian aid african heads of state meeting in abuja nigeria on april 2627 2001 declared

pharmaceutical companies in order to conduct hivaids research and distribute the results of this research to the developing world number of existing measures already appear to contribute to this goal

programs or supplementing them with additional incentives for private enterprise to engage in research and development concluding observations central challenge raised by the impact of hivaids is the treatment of hivaids victims with advanced medications the hivaids crisis may also challenge the ability of the patent law to provide an environment conducive to the development of new drugs achieving balance between the needs of the research based pharmaceutical industry and those of hivaids patients entails careful weighing of moral legal economic and public health considerations humanitarian aid encouragement of differential pricing and more precise specification or relaxation of trips agreement standards are among the options that congress could consider in responding to the hivaids pandemic
