closely to define the right postcopenhagen climate negotiating group and process and agreed to hold dvc prior to the february 11 european council froman and gucht committed to share ideas to improve

froman expressed us support for the new eu lisbon treaty structure the officials explained that the eu will need time to adjust to the new format but should emerge with better more streamlined

commission deputy secretary general brussels 00000183 002 of 007 4 c froman and the ambassador ended with roundtable including member state permanent representation coreper ii ambassadors from austria hans dietmar schwiesgut belgium jean ruyt denmark poul skytte christoffersen france philippe etienne italy fernando nelli feroci poland jan tombinski sweden christian danielsson and the uk kim darroch 5 c discussions centered around six themes the need to improve useu bilateral coordination on range of transnational issues including climate doha and financial reform to avoid repeating what froman termed disappointments8 of 2009 and to meet the rising challenge of surprisingly united basic countries china india brazil and south africa close coordination on climate to build upon the fledgling copenhagen accord better coordination on g20 and financial supervisory and regulatory reform issues our joint commitment to reach doha development agenda agreement the need to improve the transatlantic economic council tec and use it to secure concrete achievements that boost growth and create jobs and improving useu crisis response and development cooperation in the wake of the haiti earthquake improving useu cooperation to meet the basic8 challenge 6 c dnsa froman made two major points to his interlocutors on bilateral relations first he stressed 2009 was transition year for both the us administration and eu institutions with both facing enormous challenges despite our mutual good intentions in relaunching useu relations froman said and great improvement in tone we continued to talk past each other on some issues he cited copenhagen as an example where both sides misread each others negotiating bottom lines and stressed that eu leaders oneupsmanship8 model of outdoing each other to push euwide policy did notnot work in dealing with the us administration 7 c second froman told the eu officials it is remarkable how closely coordinated the basic8 group of countries china india brazil and south africa have become in international fora taking turns to impede useu initiatives and playing the us and eu off against each other basic countries have widely differing interests he said but have subordinated these to their common shortterm goals to block some western initiatives the us and eu need to learn from this coordination froman said and work much more closely and effectively together ourselves to better handle third country obstructionism and avoid future trainwrecks on climate doha or financial regulatory reform 8 c ambassador kennard underscored that this is significant moment for useu relations there is important alignment between our interests he said with president obama as committed multilateralist in the white house we must feel urgency to work together to deliver real benefits that will boost growth and create jobs the ambassador stressed given that we have limited window of opportunity before political referendum occurs on these efforts 9 c the eu officials welcomed fromans and the ambassadors calls for closer cooperation director general for external relations vale almeida emphasized that the commission transition and lisbon treaty implementation while seeming to add to the complexity of eu institutions for example with greater power for european parliament will produce streamlined eu that is an indispensible us partner commission president barroso is committed to closer relations vale almeida said highlighting his shift of tec leadership to the trade commissioner as positive step vale almeida asked for us understanding in the eu attaching political importance to annual useu summits and other processes8 these processes are the way the eu produces results he declared he acknowledged the us desire for concrete outcomes but stressed that symbolism is important to eu institutions brussels 00000183 003 of 007 10 c council president van rompuy chief of staff van daele elaborated on the theme that the lisbon changes in adding permanent eu council president and foreign policy high representative will strengthen the eus capacity to be an effective us partner froman responded that the us welcomes the lisbon changes and wants to help van rompuy in his new position van daele welcomed this saying he understood us policy constraints on climate and financial regulation given capitol hill dynamics we must work together on economic reform and must look forward together he added there is good from wagging fingers8 the us and eu must focus more on getting china more invested in global cooperation he concluded to make the chinese realize they cant have their cake and eat it too8 11 c member state permanent representation ambassadors appreciated the good will of froman and the administration to work for better relations with europe uk ambassador darroch stressed that president obamas engagement with europe the president has made six trips to europe since his inauguration froman noted is welcome and that european leaders havent sufficiently responded yet8 the ambassadors were skeptical that lisbon would bring rapid benefits they noted that eu institutions will require an adjustment period to the new structure implying delay in fully effective eu under the new treaty polish ambassador tombinski expected big institutional fight8 but thought eventually lisbon may speed up eu operations french ambassador etienne said the challenge will be to use these new capabilities effectively so the eu can act coherently with its major partners ambassadors danielsson of sweden and christofferson of denmark agreed that the lesson of our mutual misunderstanding in copenhagen should be ensuring better communication to avoid recurrence in other fora climate change building upon the copenhagen accord 12 c climate commissionerdesignate hedegaard thanked froman for president obamas efforts in copenhagen she asked about us legislative efforts on climate and us political dynamics around midterm congressional elections and how they might impact us international cooperation moving toward cop16 in cancun mexico froman responded that the us overriding international goal to work on implementing the copenhagen accord as well as on the other tracks will not change we will still work toward domestic legislation as well froman said he thought midterm dynamics would not strongly impact our work going into cancun 13 c froman and hedegaard reviewed copenhagen outcomes froman said that while nobody considered the agreement complete it is good step forward hedegaard said copenhagen left some disappointed in the process but stressed that we cant give up the accord contains lot of good points she said that should not be wasted she hoped that the us noted the eu was muting its criticism of the us to be constructive 14 c both officials agreed we must focus now on operational steps to implement the copenhagen accord froman said the us will work in the next few weeks on getting countries to sign up for associate themselves with8 the accord and to inscribe their targets the us would be happy he suggested with the seven emerging market countries in the major economies forum mef saying others would then follow we also need to work on financing he added 15 c froman emphasized that we need to determine the right process and grouping of countries to go forward this could be the greenland group of 28 countries from copenhagen mef members or countries signing the accord he speculated the us is not wedded to particular grouping he said but there seems to be broad consensus that relying on the two unfccc working groups is insufficient hedegaard agreed suggesting that an informal mef grouping might be effective it would be critical that this have legitimacy she said brussels 00000183 004 of 007 the greenland group is an option she said but others might resent this designation 16 c it is vital to get g77 agreement to whatever grouping we use hedegaard continued both agreed it will be important to talk to incoming g77 chair yemen with froman adding it will also be important to be in close touch with mexico as cop16 chair in fact froman added we need all major groups the eu mef basic g77 the island countries to agree to negotiating mechanism hedegaard responded that we will need to work around unhelpful countries such as venezuela or bolivia froman agreed that we will need to neutralize coopt or marginalize these and others such as nicaragua cuba ecuador hedegaard noted the irony that the eu is big donor to these countries while cuba for example is actively discouraging others from signing on to the accord 17 c both agreed that we need processes for coordination and avoiding recriminations hedegaard said the eu will use the february 11 informal european council meeting to reflect on how to be more focused and effective on climate froman noted he will do likewise for the us in meetings with climate special envoy todd stern and other administration officials he suggested that he and hedegaard speak before the council meeting to coordinate she agreed to videoconference february 10 the day after the new commission is expected to be formally approved by the european parliament 18 c froman and hedegaard then discussed specific goals for the bonn and cancun meetings hedegaard said we must have universal acknowledgment that the world cannot afford8 failure to reach binding agreement froman thought that we should try for progress by cancun on mrv monitoring reporting and verification the adaptation framework technologies and some resolution of process both agreed that we should also get countries to inscribe 2020 targets 19 c froman and hedegaard also discussed their respective domestic policy developments noting the complex issue of carbon border taxes this is an issue of great concern to china froman noted hedegaard noted the eus struggle with how to manage inclusion of aviation and maritime sectors in the eus emissions trading scheme both agreed it is vital to show economic benefits and potential job creation from bilateral cooperation on climate and clean energy technologies to build public support for our efforts hedegaard committed to provide to froman eu studies showing such impacts 20 c froman summarized his climate points for the member state ambassadors while some postcopenhagen soul searching is warranted he said we need to focus on avoiding damaging replay of our division there in the runup to cancun we need to work to make the copenhagen accord real getting all countries that matter to associate themselves with the agreement and inscribing their targets we need early useu agreement on the right group and process to take discussions forward and need progress on financing technical points and transparency and verification all are important he concluded g20reform of financial supervision and regulation 21 c froman heard at length from internal markets commissionerdesignate barnier and several lunch participants on the importance of coordination in the g20 and elsewhere on reform of financial supervision and regulation froman stressed with all that the us wants to work closely with the eu on all g20 issues particularly on agreeing to common principles the g20 is an important framework for this cooperation he said and it is vital that we deliver results on g20 commitments not just for their own sake but to build the credibility of the g20 framework froman said he wants to ensure the g20 is effective brussels 00000183 005 of 007 22 c director general for economic and financial affairs buti agreed that the ascendency of the g20 has raised our need for bilateral coordination he lauded the new macroeconomic and financial dialogue with treasury launched just days ago noting we have agreed to hold this to coordinate views before major events buti said 2009 was fantastic year8 for the g20 and noted we are delivering on many of the major commitments including ifi reform resources and quotas the framework for balanced growth agreed in pittsburgh and sharing plans for withdrawal of stimulus when appropriate froman responded that major mediumterm challenge should then be more structural reform buti agreed vale almeida said the g20 is improving and streamlining as it develops which is positive he pointed to buti and others at the lunch as those who can deliver on eu commitments and cooperation in the g20 23 c barnier told froman he wants to work closely and in confidence with the us he wants to move as much as possible in step with the us he stressed barniers first noneu trip will be to the us he added possibly for the april g20imf spring meetings froman responded that treasury had the primary role on financial services issues but that he looked forward to staying in touch before president obamas recent announcements on banking reform barnier noted there had been doubts in the eu on us willingness to fulfill g20 commitments there have been doubts about us willingness to implement basel ii bank capital rules but said this is important to ensure level playing field froman again emphasized us willingness to work with europe on these issues 24 c barnier said he was impressed by president obamas announcements on bank size and scope he noted eu reaction has varied with the uk against the dutch in favor and the french supportive of the direction8 david wright director for dg internal market said the announcements were significant and structural change from what had been under discussion in the international community he emphasized that the eu normally does not regulate via caps on particular business lines but through competition policy vale almeida in the lunch also questioned whether the announcements were offmark8 from the g20 froman responded that these proposals were consistent with what had been raised previously noted that we were not alone in showing leadership on these issues but returned to the us commitment to cooperate toward agreement on basic principles and avoid damaging regulatory arbitrage 25 c barnier said his roadmap is the g20 roadmap8 and he seeks relevant proportionate regulation in europe that leaves market or player unregulated he said his immediate priorities include resolving councilparliament differences over eu financial supervisory architecture otc derivatives and cooperation here with the us corporate governance and improving crisis prevention and management tools working toward doha deal 26 c froman emphasized to commissioner gucht and other eu officials the us commitment to try to complete an ambitious doha development agenda agreement but said that public spats over negotiations were damaging we should work to prevent this going forward froman described our doha position and our bilateral engagement with india brazil china and others to produce market access he emphasized the vital importance of this market access to our stakeholders and the congress froman said that the current offer is not acceptable to us agriculture nama or services stakeholders gucht responded that it is important to close the doha round and that blaming others does not get us there the question is how to manage the process with appropriate ambition he said that the eu can live with the result on the table but if other things come onto the table we will need new equilibrium8 gucht said he hoped that the us bilateral efforts would not interfere with the ability to nail down existing tariffs comment this probably brussels 00000183 006 of 007 refers to proposed bound tariff reductions in recent dda texts which reduce maximum permitted bound tariffs but do not reduce currently applied tariffs significantly end comment 27 c gucht added that he faces similar challenge because the spanish presidency is pushing for bilateral ftas with latin america and he wants to ensure such efforts do not interfere with the dda froman responded that eliminating water8 between bound and actual tariffs is insufficient that there has to be additional market access froman emphasized the importance of the us and eu sending consistent message on this issue to third countries even though he recognized that our positions though similar are not identical he encouraged open dialogue and transparency with the eu froman said he did not want there to be misunderstanding among our trading partners similar to what happened in copenhagen that the us would ultimately agree to what is on the table making the transatlantic economic council deliver 28 c froman emphasized to all of his interlocutors the administrations interest in making the tec deliver real results we are open to all ideas he said we can reform restructure or even eliminate the tec based on what we identify together as the best way to secure concrete achievements the ambassador added that the bottom line should be generating growth and creating jobs which could help us prioritize issues for the tec agenda 29 c gucht welcomed fromans interest in the tec he viewed the tec as very important particularly in the context of the rising chinese economy and significant trade deficits of both the us and eu with china gucht noted that as useu tariffs have fallen nontariff barriers ntbs are the logical next challenge gucht chief of staff vanheukelen stressed that useu economic links are hard to overestimate8 with colossal8 bilateral fdi gucht highlighted recent study showing that if we could remove one half of existing bilateral ntbs the eu and us would get many billions of dollars in welfare gains gdp increases by 2016 or greater than doha seatter of dg external relations pointed to the 1214 million jobs dependent on transatlantic trade stressing that steps to expand these jobs could be an important nearterm tec achievement vanheukelen said that to date the tec has not been seen as extremely effective but it is important that it do better 30 c both the eu and us need more growth gucht said in the face of such challenges as rising social security and health care costs gucht recognized however that there are political problems with addressing some ntbs he agreed it is important that the next tec meeting produces concrete results and should not be simple getacquainted session therefore he added we must prepare carefully out of the spotlight he said spain is pushing for tec before its presidency ends june 30 but noted it is unclear if this would provide adequate preparation time he said lowprofile planning meeting might be more appropriate in the near term he added he is preparing paper on tec goals to send to the us in the next few weeks and hoped the us could do the same gucht said he hopes to visit washington in late february to discuss key tec and trade issues with froman and others note his staff clarified that the trip will likely be in early march end note 31 c both agreed that possible tec topics could include doha climate chinathird country issues and financial regulation froman agreed that there should be artificial deadlines8 for the tec and that the important thing is to ensure the next meeting produces significant results to justify the presence of highranking officials and respond to stakeholders we are flexible on timing and can take five to nine months to achieve concrete results he underscored froman committed to producing us paper to discuss with the eu brussels 00000183 007 of 007 improving crisis response and development coordination after haiti 32 sbu commissioner gucht offered froman his views on the situation in haiti where gucht visited the previous week in his capacity as current development commissioner he said that what had happened was disaster guessing that at least 2500008 were killed with 20 percent8 of portauprince destroyed he thought the haiti situation manageable however with time and money needed for recovery the southeast asian tsunami had been much worse he noted lot of assistance food stocks were already in haiti when the earthquake hit he said and water and food distribution was ok roads were mostly unaffected he added the biggest nearterm problem gucht explained will be for 250000 homeless when the rainy season begins in six weeks the goh and donors need to rapidly build camps he said to avoid pandemics once rains start overall in guchts view life in haiti is picking up8 again and despite media reports security problems are not serious 33 sbu morrison of ashtons cabinet noted our great8 bilateral cooperation on haiti and stressed that the eu is committed longterm to rebuilding the haitian economy and state high representative ashton seeks greater development cooperation with the us he said seatter of dg external relations said that the challenges we have faced and met in haiti coordination underscore our need to work on our crisis response and overall development coordination this is an area where we can achieve strong results this year seatter added 34 u this cable has been cleared by deputy national security advisor michael froman murray end cable text zenaida x toledo 07302008 040414 pm from dbinbox trans
