million each year until 2035 for services provided below cost to nonprofit organizations at congressional direction in the 1990s but not paid for at the time for the past 13 years the postal service appropriation has consisted of that amount plus an estimate of the amount needed to pay for mail for the blind and overseas voters for the current year in its fy2007 budget the administra tion proposed an appropriation of 799 million including 607 million for revenue fo rgone in fy2007 and reconciliation adjustment for underestima ted mail volume in fy2004 of 192 million the postal service which submits its own request as an independent entity estimated that the fy2007 amount needed for the blind and overseas voting would be 801 million or 194 million more than omb requested nd asked congress to appropriate that amount both proposals would have s upplemented the fy2007 amount with 192 million reconciliation adjustment reflecting that actual use of the subsidy in fy2004 was underestimated by that amount the post services request also included reconciliation adjustment of 244 million reflecting the amount by which actual expenditures for fy2005 exceeded the am ount appropriated that year thus the postal services request for fy2007 was 1527 million including 801 million for fy2007 revenue forgone 436 million as rec onciliation adjustment for two years and 29
