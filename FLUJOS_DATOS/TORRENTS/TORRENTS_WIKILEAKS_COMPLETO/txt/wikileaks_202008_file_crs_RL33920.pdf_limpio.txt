generation air transportation system financing re form act of 2007 hr 1356s 1076 introduced by request which recommends new system for financing aviation system costs through direct user fees and increased fuel taxes the faa proposal would also allow airports to increase passenger facility charges pfc and includes initiatives to simplify the apportionment of airport grants the proposal also seeks to better integrate development of the next generation air transportation system ngats into ongoing planning and acqui sition activities and would allow airport and private investment in certain aviation f acilities and services the faa proposal would authorize funding for research on aviation noise air emissions and water quality impacts and seeks to modify the essential air service program eas the aviation investment and moderniz ation act of 2007 s 1300 srept 110 144 proposes fouryear authorization with modest overall budget increases and larger increases specifically for facilitie s and equipment fe modernization s 1300 proposes 25 surcharge for certain flig hts and retention of existing taxes and fees as an alternative to the faas us er fee proposal s 1300 would establish

higher spending authorizations for fe compared to s 1300 while the bill does not propose any direct userfee mechanisms it would allow airports to increase pfcs the bill does however propose modest increases to existing aviation fuel taxes the overall legislation also seeks to increase accountability and coordination of ngats planning and implementation an amendment agreed to would create binding arbitration process to resolve labor negotiations impasses and would apply this process to settle the current impasse between the faa and air traffic controllers the bill also addresses many safety related and environmen tal issues this report will be updated as neededhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920contents introduction 1 overview of the faa proposal 2 overview of s 1300 and s 2345 3

referred to by bill number or as the faa proposal1 entitled the next generation air transportation system fi nancing reform act of 2007 proposes new system for financing aviation system operations and capita l improvements that includes various feeforservice charges user fees directed primarily at commercial system users and excise taxes primarily fuel taxes for general aviation system users the faa proposal also includes veral modifications to airport revenues including increases in the maximum passenger facility charges pfcs that airports can impose on passengers and initiatives intended to modify and simplify the apportionment of grants to airports the faa proposal also recommends seve ral management nd organizational reforms most notably the proposed estab lishment of an air transportation system advisory board and the authority to create commission similar to the militarys base realignment and closure bra c commissions to make independent recommendations regarding the realignmen t and consolidation of various faa facilities and services the proposal so includes proposed statutory language intended to better integrate the work of the joint planning and development office jpdo on the next generation air transportation system ngats design and implementation into the faas ongoing planning and acquisition activities also the proposal includes language to increase the flexibility in delivering various air traffic services and capabilities to system users by allowing airports and private entities to play more direct role in acquiring deploying and maintaining facilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs3 and services to augment the faas ai r traffic communications navigation and surveillance capabilities with regard to addressing system nd airport capacity and safety the faa proposal seeks statutory authority to contro l congestion at certain airports through marketbased mechanisms such as slot auctions and peakperiod pricing the proposal would direct the department of transportation dot to study the appropriateness of marketbased system at new yorks laguardia airport lga and if deemed appropriate would permit th airport operator to implement market based approach to controlling congestion the faa proposal also seeks to establish pilot program to evaluate marketbased mechanisms to relieve congestion at up to 15 other airports with regard to addressing the envi ronmental impacts of aviation the faa proposal includes language that seeks to pr ovide funding for research into technology or processes that would reduce noise air emissions and water quality impacts provide grants for programs or projects intended to mitigate or minimize regulated environmental impacts and provide grants or specify regulatory procedures to assist airports in complying with environmen tal requirements the faa proposal also recommends establishing consortium for fostering innovation to develop cleaner quieter and more efficient nextgeneration aircraft further the faa proposal seeks to limit the scope of the air tour management program designed to mitigate noise and other adverse impacts from air tours ove r national park units to those parks where air tour impacts have been identified as concern or could become more substantial issue the faa proposal also includes language that would significantly modify the existing essential air service program eas that subsidizes air carrier service to small and isolated communities primarily by setting more stringent criteria for program eligibility and restricting further expansion of the program overview of s 1300 and s 2345 on may 3 2007 senator rockefeller intr oduced the aviation investment and modernization act of 2007 s 1300 on may 16 2007 the senate committee on commerce science

thr ough fy2011 s 1300 as amended offers an alternative to the faaproposed user fee structure proposing to create separate treasury fund called the air traffic mode rnization fund that would be financed through the collection of 25 surcharges im posed on certain flights for air traffic control costs the surcharge would be pr incipally collected from airlines and high performance business jet operators as all pistonengine powered aircraft would be exempt from paying the surcharge the b ill language specifies that more than 400 million toward the faas fac ility and equipment fe acc ount is to be derivedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs4 from these surcharges each year from fy2009 through fy2011 the bill gives the faa specific authority to co llect these surcharges nd impose sanctions upon those who dont pay but leaves it up to the f aa to devise collection system the surcharge would be in addition to the ex isting tax and fee system although proposals to modify that tax and fee structure may be considered by the nate through separate legislation considered by the senate committee on finance or possible floor action to further support the modernization of air traffic facilities and services s 1300 authorizes the department of transporta tion to issue obligations such as bonds totaling up to 5 billion these instruments would be repaid with interest through revenues

management and organizational reform the bill includes an alternate to the faaproposed board by creating smaller sevenmember air traffic control modernization oversight board that would have greater oversight authority over faas planning budgeting and implementation of facilities and equipm ent modernization the proposed board would have approval author ity over large scale acquisition programs those of 100 million or greater and woul d be responsible for pproving the faas capital improvement program opera tional evolution plan fac ilities and equipment budget and key leadership positions in the ai r traffic organization ato and joint planning and devel opment office jpdo s 1300 proposes 100 million annual increas to the airport improvement program aip through fy2011 but does not include any increases to the maximum passenger facility charge p fc that can be levied by airports the bill does however propose pilot program at up to si x airports allowing airports to collect pfcs directly from passengers without any statutory ceiling on the amount that could be charged the bill includes other technical modifications to the aip program primarily aimed at increasing the eligibility of smaller passenger service airports to qualify as primary airports and extend th 95 federal share of airport project funding for smallersized airports s 1300 includes several provi sions addressing custom er service for passenger airlines these provisions endeavor to pr ovide assurances of adequate food water and restroom facilities when flights are substantially delayed these provisions would also require airlines to provide consumer rights information and airline customer service policies on their internet websites and would require airlines to publish cu stomer service and flight delay history information s 1300 would also expand dots consumer complaint investigations subject to the availability of appropriations with regard to systems planning for ne xt generation air traffic technologies s 1300 w ould require all agencies involved in the ngats initiative to establish implementation offices and enter into multiagency agreemen ts outlining their respective responsibilities and budgetary commitments to supporting ngats like the faa proposal s 1300 would make the jpdo director voting member of the faas joint resources council jrc and the atos executive council the bill would extend the authorization of 50 million annually to jpdo through fy2011 however unlike the faa proposal s 1300 would not establish braclikehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs5 commission to examine faa facility and services consolidation and realignment rather under s 1300 the air traffic contro l modernization oversight board would be tasked with reviewing the faas r ecommendations for realignment and proposing alternative recommendations but gives the board specific power to influence the actions related to faa realignment in the manner proposed in the faa bill with regard to the faas personnel management system s 1300 includes provision that would involve the federal services impasses panel fsip in cases where the faa and bargaining units cannot reach an agreement during collective bargaining the provision would allow the fs ip to order binding arbitration in such cases and outlines specific process fo r conducting such binding arbitration proceedings s 1300 includes numerous provisions rela ted to system capacity and safety including provisions designed to improve runway safety expedite progress on rulemaking to improve airlin er fuel tank safety and re duce flammability risk conduct research and improve regulations pertaining to pilot fatigue flight time and rest requirements implement several ntsb reco mmendations pertaining to the safety of helicopter emergency medical service h ems operations addr ess unmanned flight operations in the national airspace system nas and examine ways to improve capacity and safety by improving wake turbulence prediction detection and avoidance the bill also seeks to expand the number of flights operating to and from washington reagan national airport with regard to environment and energy issues s 1300 includes several of the faaproposed provisions regarding resear ch and mitigation grants additionally the bill seeks to establish research grant program and center of excellence to examine the development of synthetic jet fuel from clean coal sources the bill also includes provision that would prohib it all aircraft under 75000 pounds maximum weight that do not conform to stage 3 noi standards five years after enactment heavier aircraft would be required to conform to stage 3 noise standards by december 31 1999 s 1300 also seeks ch anges to the air tour management program that include allowing modificati ons to interim opera ting authority without further environmental review allowing transfers of ope rating authority to conduct commercial air tours over national parks establis hing an annual reporting requirement for commercial ai r tour operators and authorizing fee collections from air tour operators tied to the cost of ca rrying out the air tour management program s 1300 also proposes changes to the essential air service program eas including requirement that dot allow ea s airlines to code share with other carriers extension of the existing statutory highway milage criteria for eas eligibility through fy2011 the creation of financial incentives for improvements to eas service and program to aid the conve rsion of former eas airports to general aviation status the bill would allow additional overflight fee collections in excess of the 50 million level identified in the f aa proposal to be put toward the eas program under s 1300 the additional amount authorized in addition to the 50 million base would rise from 77 million to 83 million on november 13 2007 the senate co mmittee on finance reported s 2345 the american

project ed pfc revenue increases derived from the fee increase hr 2881 would allow for pfcs to increase up to 7 per passenger and would raise the pfc cap on round tr ip ticket from 18 to 28 the bill also calls for study to assess the impact of proposing different pfc rates for connecting passengers versus origin and destination passengers hr 2881 would set state apportionments for aip at 10 of total apportioned amounts with 300 million minimum provide d total aip funding remains above 3 billion apportionments for nonprimary airports would remain at 150000 or one fifth of the estimated five year development costs the bill also would raise the required air carrier approval for airport privatization amounts from 65 to 75 and airports participating in the privatization pilot program would not be eligible for aip funds like the faa proposal and s 1300 hr 2881 would exempt proceeds from the sale of privatized airport to public authority from aip assurances that require all airport revenue be expended for capital and operating costs hr 2881 includes several provisions re garding passenger airline service including requirement that dot review and adjust denied boarding compensation regulations every two years the bill would establish additional carrier monthly reporting requirements to provi dot with data on diverted flights and flights cancelled after leaving the gate hr 2881 would also require contingency plans for providing food safe drinking water restrooms cabin ventilation and medical care to passengers during excessive ground delays to be deve loped and submitted to dot airports would also be required to devise plans for sharing facilities and making gates available for such situations nd would require dot to set up consumer complaints hotline the bill would also require airlines to inform passengers at the time of ticket purchase of the names of any insecticides it intends to use while passengers are on board the bill requires dot to establish an advisory committee for airline passenger consumer protection the bill also directs the dot inspector general to conduct an audit of air carrier flight dela ys and cancellations and requires gao assessment comparing passenger rights in the united states to those in the european union with regard to next generation mode rnization initiatives hr 2881 like the faa proposal and s 1300 would increase th stature of the jpdo director and would require each jpdo supporting agency to designate senior official and establish an office to oversee agency efforts supporting the ngats planning and development initiatives the bill would also require multiagency integrated work plan describing annual obj ectives milestones and lineation of responsibility among federal agencies and to tie these plans to the budgetary process hr 2881 would also require gao to review the prog ress and challenges associated with air traffic modernization initiatives under ngats the bill also authorizes additional appropriations specifically designated for airspace redesign initiatives to enhance aviation system capacity and reduce delays hr 2881 proposes to establish an f aa working group on facility and service consolidation consisting of the faa adminis trator and representatives from sectorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs8 of the aviation industry as well as labor representatives representing faa field employees the working groups functions however would largely be advisory in capacity and it could not by itself prev ent any faa consolidation actions from moving forward an amendment agreed to and incorporated into housepassed hr 2881 would require that faa regional office consolidation be included in the scope of the working groups oversight and woul d require that the working group include representation for regi onal office employees hr 2881 would create publicprivate pa rtnership including university with expertise in air traffic management to rve as an airportbased test facility for ngats technologies the bill would also establish nextgen research and development center of exce llence to provide educationa l technical and analytical assistance regarding ngats technologies the bill would also require the faa to establish process for including affected employees such as air traffic controllers and airways system specialists in th ngats process and other modernization initiatives with regard to faa personnel management the house committee on transportation and infrastructure adopted an amendment offered by representative costello that like s 1300 would require bi nding arbitration to resolve impasses in contract negotiations hr 2881 however would invalidate faa contract actions taken after july 10 2005 thus appearing to have the effect of undoing the faa contract with air traffic controllers dopted june 5 2006 and subjecting the prior impasse with controllers to the terms of the binding arbitration provision pending the outcome of the binding arbitration th provision would allow affected employees to receive back pay of any additional sa lary increase that may be included in the negotiated settleme nt and it authorizes 20 million for this purpose hr 2881 includes language requiring gao study of faa technical training of system specialists that service air traffic and navigation infrastructure and study by the national academy of sciences on f aa inspector staffing levels and workload as well as air traffic controller staffing the bill authorizes increased funding for increasing inspectors safety technicians and operational support staffing hr 2881 also calls for an faa study of front line ma nager staffing require ments for air traffic control facilities and would establish university center of excellence for aviation employment the bill also seeks to creat 12member task force to conduct study assessing the conditions of faa air traffic control facilities and recommend steps for rehabilitation remediation nd programmatic changes to prevent unsafe building conditions hr 2881 provides for 10 additional be yond perimeter slots from washington reagan national airport dca but would re duce within perimeter slots by an equal amount the bill does not specifically addre ss slot issues at new yorks laguardia airport where statutory slot controls re cently expired nor at any other congested airports besides dca however the bill includes general provision that would allow the faa to hold meetings among air carriers to voluntarily negotiate schedule reductions at any airport experiencing arrival and departure rates exceeding maximum hourly rates that is likely to have significant adverse effect on regional or national level if air carriers were unwilling to voluntarily agree to schedule reductions then the provision would aut horize the faa administrator to take appropriate action to reduce arrivals and departures to reflect available airporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs9 capacity also an amendment agreed to by the house would require gao to assess the use of marketbased st rategies for reducing airsp ace congestion such as peak period pricing slots or quotas and compar the effects of such initiatives to the improvements in congestion attainable through airs pace redesign initiatives hr 2881 contains language similar to s 1300 requiring the faa to report on its progress to install systems to mitigate runway incursions hr 2881 would authorize dedicated funds for runway incursion reduction programs and runway status lights additionally hr 2881 woul d require the faa to develop strategic runway safety plan hr 2881 includes nguage identical to s 1300 calling on the faa to finalize rulemaking regarding fuel tank flammability reduction on large transport aircraft hr 2881 like s 130 0 also directs the national academy of sciences to carry out study of pilot fatigue and requires the faa to implement recommendations of an faa study on flight attendant fatigue the bill would also require the faa to rewrite current flight and duty time regulations for air carrier commuter airline and charter p ilots to count flight time accumulated conducting non revenue flight assignments for the operator toward pilot flight and duty time totals the bill would also require the faa to establish occupational safety and health standards for flight attendant s and would require flight attendants as well as gate agents to receive specific training in serving alc ohol recognizing intoxicated individuals and handlin g disruptive passengers with regard to airline maintenance hr 2881 includes provision that would restrict the use of noncertified mainte nance providers allowing only airline employees or employees of faacertified repa ir stations to carry out substantial and routine maintenance and complete required inspections of aircraft used in airline service air carriers would also be requi red to provide complete lists of their non certificated maintenance providers whos activities would be restricted to non routine nonsubstantial main tenance and repair work unde r this provision the bill also adopts an amendment agreed to by the house that would extend the requirement for drug and alcohol testing programs to safetycritical positions at foreign repair stations working on air carri er aircraft or components with regard to unmanned aircraft hr 2881 would require the faa to develop comprehensive plan to safely integrate commercial unmanned aircraft in the national airspace system as soon as possi ble but not later than the end of fy2012 it also calls for expediting authoriza tion of publicuse unm anned aircraft and implementing interim regulations to allow certain commercial unmanned aircraft to have access to airspace prior to completion of the comprehensive plan hr 2881 also would authorize f unding for wake vortex mitigation technologies including advisory system s the bill identifies specific funding amounts totaling more than 45 million over the four year reauthorization period for wake turbulencerelated re search and development an amendment agreed to by the house w ould also require the faa to study the feasability of creating publiclysearchable internet database of acceptable height and distance from aviation sites for the installation of wind turbines

experts have argued for hr 2881 includes provision similar to that in the faa proposal to establish consortium to develop continuous low energy emissions and noise cleen engine and airframe technology the bill includes proposed sense of congress language asserting that the european ions proposed emissions trading scheme is inconsistent with international civil aviation authority icao practices of establishing consensusba sed international standard s and recommended practices and urges the european union and others to work cooperatively through icao to develop consensual approach to addr essing aircraft greenhouse gas emissions2 the bill also calls for research to promote development of alterative jet fuels and calls for the jpdo to establish environm ental standards for nextgen technologies like the faa proposal and s 1300 the hr 2881 also includes provision to fund environmental mitigation grants under propos ed pilot program unique to hr 2881 is provision for pilot program for aircraft departure queue management to decrease fuel consumption nd emissions and provision requiring the faa and the epa to examine how engine noise and missions standards development could be better integrated across the two agencies similar to s 1300 hr 2881 includes provision that would prohibit operations of nonstage 3 compliant jets under 75000 pounds after 2012 an amendment agreed to by the house also adds language stating that it is the sense of the house of repres entatives that the port authority of new york and new jersey should conduct noise compatibility planning studies referred to as part 150 studies at john f kenne dy international airport and laguardia airport in new york and newark liberty and teterboro airports in new jersey additionally the bill would increase fundi ng for the airport cooperative research program acrp to examine airport environmental issues and calls for an interagency study on the effects of aviation on climate change the bill would also require the faa to study the use of leadfr ee fuels for piston aircraft with regard to the air tour management program and curtailing aircraft noise in national parks the modifications proposed in hr 2881 are similar to the faa proposal initiatives to streamline and expedite agency actions hr 2881 reserves 50 million in overflight fees for funding the essential air service eas program and increases the authorization for additional eas funds to 83 million the bill encourages financial incentives and longterm contracts for eas but would eliminate the local particip ation program created by vision 100 the bill would also create an office of rural aviation within dot to monitor and improve air service to small communities the bill also includes language allowing state and local governments to restore an airports eas eligibility status by offering proposals developed in coopera tion with the air carrier to reduce subsidies to below statutory per passenger maximums and allows dot to increase negotiated eas subsidies to adjust for any significant increases in air carrier fuel costs the bill also seeks to clarify the statutory definitions related to the actual control of the operations of us airlines that are owned in part by foreign entities the house committee on transportation and infrastructure has also agreed to an amendment offered by representative oberstar to limit expre ss carrier employees covered under the railway labor act rla to those performing certain aviationrelated functionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs11 3 ian swanson ups works to hobble its rival fedex the

historically split among four principal accounts operations and maintenance om the airport improvement program aip or grants in aid for airports facilities and equipment fe and research engineering and development red however beginning in fy2008 the faa proposes restructuring of these accounts largely to separate operational activities carried out by the air traffic organization ato from faas regulatory functions in the faas accoun ting structure s 1300 however proposes to reauthorize the four existing faa accounts therefore the bills are not directly comparable with regard to funding author izations the faa also proposes new user fee funding mechanisms under which much of the revenue to be used for air traffic services and regulatory functions would be determined through feesetting activities carried out by the faa administrator ra ther than through tr aditional congressional funding authorizations this further co mplicates any effort to make comparisons among the bills with regard to funding levels funding mechanisms and levels identified in the bills are generally described below and more detailed treatment of the faaproposed revenue system is provided later in the section titled proposed tax and fee structure faa proposal funding authorization levels in the faa proposal cannot be compared to historical funding in the faas four acc ounts om aip fe and red this is because the faa has proposed to restru cture these accounts and also because the faa proposes to establish user fee collection authority under which the faa administrator would set fees that would be deposited into sepa rate treasury accounts as offsetting collections the proposed new accounts under the faa plan include the air traffic organization ato account nd the safety and operations account these would replace the current om and fe accounts but there is not oneto one relationship between the current accounts and the proposed accounts specifically some om and fe functi ons would map into the safety and operations account while others would map into the air traffic organization account one goal of this new accounting st ructure is to fully separate the faa regulatory responsibi lities from its operational functions on the books as has been done organizationally with the creation of the air traffic organization ato under the faa plan the proposed safety and operations and ato accounts would be funded primarily th rough user fee collections while red would continue to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs12 funded thr ough combination of airport and airway trust fund aatf and general fund contributions the aip progra m would continue to be funded by the aatf table 1 shows the faa proposed funding authorizations coming out of the existing airport and airways trust fund aatf and the proposed limits or caps on general fund contributions over the propos ed threeyear authorization period because the proposed fee collection authority would not fully take effect until fy2009 larger contributions from the aat f would be required in fy2008 during the transition to the user fee based system for fy2009 and fy2010 the proposal assumes that these user fees would cover large part but not all of the faas costs for the ato and safety and operations accounts the aip program account would continue to receive its re venue from the aatf and the faas red account would still rely primarily on the aatf for its revenue source with additional funding coming from the general fund contributi on maximum general fund contributions would remain flat at around 25 billion under the faa proposal this level of general fund contribution is particularly troubling to critics of the faa proposal because it is lower than contribution levels from recent years which have already been declining also because the pr oposed maximum genera l fund contribution is flat across the proposed threeyear author ization period it will comprise smaller percentage contribution to the faas total budget if costs continue to rise these increased costs would be covered instead by user fees under the faa proposal however because the faa proposal would give the faa administrator fee setting authority the anticipated revenue generate d from fee collections is not discussed in the bill or supporting documentation provi ded by the faa this proposal is discussed in further detail

appropriated amounts for om already slightly exceed authorized amounts situation largely attr ibuted to unanticipated increases in laborhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs13 costs within the faa beyond fy2008 increases to the om account are more modest averaging slightly above 3 annual rate which tracks closely with inflation and employment cost inde x projections for the broader economy under s 1300 the authorized levels for the airport improvement program aip would continue the trend of 100 million annual increases through fy2011 perhaps the most notable increase in s 1300 would be for the facilities and equipment fe account while this acc ount would only see about 37 increase in authorized funding levels in fy 2008 compared to fy2007 appropriations the authorization would then be increased by slightly more than 13 for fy2009 this would be the largest percentage increas on an annual basis for this account and would be followed by more modest percentage increases to fe of slightly more than 5 for fy2010 followed by larger increase of almost 8 for fy2011 this schedule likely reflects the senate committees views on the needed spending schedule to keep the acquisition of next generation technologies to modernize the national airspace system on track to meet stated objectives of fully implementing the next generation or nextgen air traffic system by 2025 s 1300 also proposes substantial increas to faa research engineering and development red authorized funding levels starting in fy2009 authorized funding for red would increase by 36 in fy2009 compared to both the fy2008 request and the proposed fy2008 authorized amount in the bill under s 1300 this would be followed by essentially flat funding of about 190 million annually for red through fy2011 like the proposed increase to the fe account authorized levels this proposed increase to red likely reflects the senate committees views on the increased funding for research nd development needed to support progress on nextgen development efforts hr 2881 hr 2881 would provide funding for the faas om account and the aip program at the same levels specified in s 1300 with regard to the fe account however hr 2881 proposes to set higher f unding levels than specified in s 1300 hr 2881 proposes an increase of almost 25 in fy2008 authorizations for fe spending compared to fy2007 appropriate d amounts this would be followed by smaller annual increases from fy2009 through fy2011 the house committee on science and tec hnology which has jurisdiction over the faas research functions and component s has proposed substantial increases to available funding for the faas red account specifically hr 2881 would triple the available funding for red activities in fy2008 compared to fy2007 appropriated

reauthorization act pl 108176 by bart elias john w fischer and robert s kirk and federal aviation administration budget in brief fiscal year 2008 note beginning in fy2008 the administration has proposed to restructure its accounts creating new safety and operations account and an air traffic organization account and abandoning the om and fe accounts without detailed analysis these newly proposed acco unts are not comparable to authorization and funding levels under the historic account structure administration requests for aip and red reflect amounts requested in the administrations fy2008 budget however the faa proposal does nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs15 contain specific authorization requests for these accounts for red the authorization specifies amounts that may be appropriated from the aviation trust fund in addition to any general fund amounts set by future year appropriations these amounts are designated with preceding plus sign in this table to indicate that this activity may receive additional general fund contributions above these proposed authorization levels for fy2008 the administration requested an authorization of 123 million in addition to general fund contributions for red however the appropriations request of 140 million presented in the presidents budget is re flected in the table this table provides overall funding levels for the four main faa accounts as specified in the respective bills it does not however include miscellaneous additional specifically designated appropriations included in separate provisions of the bills faa finance over the last reauthorization period th ere has been considerable discussion about the long term health of the exis ting trust fund based faa financing system the faa and others believe the existing system will have difficulty providing the funding that the agency will need in the years ahead and that new funding system more closely tied to aviation industry ac tivity should be adopted other aviation interests especially those representing the ga portion of the industry believe the existing funding system is adequate at leas t for the next reauthorization cycle as congress considers reauthorization it w ill likely need to weigh these opposing viewpoints for detailed examination of the existing aviation finance system and the proposed changes to this system see crs report rl33913 aviation finance federal aviation administration faa reauthorization and related issues by john w fischer faa proposal the next generation air transportation system financing reform act of 2007 hr 1356s 1076 proposes the most signif icant change in faa aviation finance since the federal program was created by the 1970 act the faa proposal provides for three year authorization period fy2008 fy2010 during which the faa would transition from its existing trust f undgeneral fund based financing system to system based on new direct fees and exis ting excise taxes as well as general fund monies although the trust fund would be continued its overall ro in funding the agency is significantly reduced the proposal uses mix of direct fees referred to as user fees by the faa and throughout this section excise taxe s and general funds to pay for the faas ato related activitie s the proposal funds the faas safety activities primarily from genera l funds but also allows th faa to collect user fees related to its registration and certification activities for this purpose excise taxes would be used to support the continue d aviation trus t fund which is dedicated primarily toward funding aip but also supports part of red and essential air service eas programs the faa proposal does not set new user f ee rates for ato services rather it enunciates framework for how fees can be set and creates an air transportation system advisory board board to assist the faa administrator in establishing appropriate fee levels and mechanisms ultimately however the administrator would be the sole decision maker on fee setting issues httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs16 4 wolfe kathryn faas funding proposal doesnt fly with entire aviation industry lawmakers cq today transportation and infrastructure february 16 2007 5 httpwwwairlinesorgnewsreleases2007statement_121407htmpftrue 6 it would appear that the board with wide industry representation is supposed to be part of the consultation process although this is unstated in the bill 7 the airline industry and groups such as th air cargo industry have traditionally opposed weightbased tax structuresthe proposal adopts new financial structure for the faa that would correspond to the new program funding regime to facilitate this structure it would create two new accounts in the treasury to receive the newly im posed user fees allows for the establishment of reserve fund and allows the faa to issue bonds to speedup fe equipment acquisition agency funding would still be subject to annual congressiona l appropriations the faa proposal is controversial nd several aviation in terest groups came out against it almost as soon as it was introduced4 the proposal however has supporters especially the air transport association ata which views it as positive step forward5 congressional hearings on hr 1356s 1076 which embodies the faa proposal have been he ld in both the house and the senate proposed tax and fee structure as mentioned above the principal feature of the faa proposal is the creation of direct user fee system to pay for the majority of the agencys costs associated with its ato activities the faa proposal however does not recommend specifi c user fee structure instead it lists the criteria that must be considered in setting fee levels and leaves it to the board and ultimately the faa administrator to actually set the fees the proposal requires that the administrator consult with affected par ties prior to establishing fee structure but gives the affected parties further role in the process6 ato user fees specific ato user fees can be set for enroute oceanic and terminal area flight activity enroute and oceanic fees can be based on distance traveled or any other method that is cons istent with the trea ties and international agreements to which the united states is party since much of the rest of the world uses aircraft weight and the distance flown as part of its fee setting process it would appear that similar fee setting regime could be implemented here7 overflight fees for aircraft transiting u s airspace would be eliminated and these flights would be subject to the enroute and oceanic fee system fee setting for terminal area activities could be somewhat more complicated because the proposal would allow for fees to be differentiated at various locations and at different times of the day factors that could be included in the terminal fee structure can include airc raft takeoffslandings t airports with over 100000 passenger boardings per year aircraft we ight operations at large hub airport 1 of total us enplanements time of day or day of week at congested large hubs and different fees for daytime and nighttime operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs17 user fees would be imposed on ll commercial users of ato services irrespective of aircraft type for the purposes of determining which tax certain aircraft might pay the applicability of irs regulations would delineate between commercial and noncomme rcial users although ga aircra ft operate outside of the ato user fee system most of the time they would be subject to terminalrelated fees at congested large hub airports the faa proposal would require that fees be set in relation to the costs incurred for providing ato services in setting th fees mentioned above the faa would be prohibited from using flight altitude as fee settin g factor under the pr oposal it could offer incentives by way of reduced f ees for the purchase nd use of equipment that enhances an aircrafts safe and efficient operation in the air traffic system in addition it could seek sufficient user fee revenues to establish reserve fund to be available if system revenues fail to reach projected levels the ato would also receive funding from excise taxes the proposal suggests that 70centpergallon fuel tax be im posed on all ga users kerojet or aviation gasoline of this 564 cents per gallon is dedicated to ato activities and 136 cents is reserved for the aviation trust fund thes fees are to be indexed to inflation beginning in 2009 and can be modified by the administrator in future years the faa believes that it is longer necessary to differentiate the tax rate for turbine avgas and piston aviation gasoline aircra ft users because of the much higher fuel use rates of turbine aircraft safety and operations user fees safety and nonato operations activities would be pr imarily funded by treasury ge neral funds in addition however the faa is to impose registration fees for specified services at rates detailed in the proposed legislation by wa of example aircra ft registration would be subject to 130 fee and issuing an airman medical certif icate would cost 42 many of the activities listed here were previously provided at nominal fee levels fees are also to be imposed for faa certification activities specific fees for activities such as certification of large foreign repair station or maintenance technical school are not enumer ated in the legislation rather the administrator is to set fees at levels that correspond to the costs imposed on the faa for providing the certification service in question trust fund excise taxes the largest source of revenues for the trust fund would come from 136centpergallon tax on ll aircraft irrespective of fuel type these taxes are to be adjusted for infla tion and can also be adjusted up or down if the faa cost allocation process so dictates the other principal source of funding for the trust fund is by continuation of the international arrivalsdepartu re fee which is set at 639 per event this tax can also be adjusted for inflation ndor cost allocation reasons although the faa proposal is based prima rily on direct user fees there is transition period during which the trust fund would continue to provide some funding for ato and all other faa activities albeit at diminishing level httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs18 air transportation system advisory board board the faa proposal would creates 13 member board charged with advising the administrator on user fee and other issues at his or her reques t the boards membership would include the administrator department of defense representative three members representing the public interest an airport member three airline members representing different size air carriers cargo airline member ga member business aviation member and representative of the aviation manufacturing industry appointment of ll members is made by the secretary of transportation in addition the proposal would prescribe the board members terms and provides guidance on its administrative functioning the board can advise the administrator on wide range of faa programs and activities at the outset however it would appear that the boards principal duty is to help with the creation of the new user fee system according to provisions of the faa proposal prior to establishing or modifying fees the adminis trator shall consult with and seek the recommendations of the type and level of such fees procedure is established whereby the ad ministrator who has ultimate fee setting responsibility can disagree with the board s recommendations and establish fees by publishing the reasons for disagr eement in the federal register it would be up to the administrator to determine how and how much they might wish to use the boards expertise there is nothing in the legislation as proposed that automatically gives the board any power to exercise its advisory role especially in public forum this is becau the boards actions would not be subject to the public meeting and other administrative provisions of title 5 usc further it is not clear that the board would have access to information about cost allocation and other subjects except to the extent that the administrator wishes to make this material available to the board budget and structural provisions as suggested by the new tax and fee proposal the faa w ould be reorganized from budgetary perspective ato assessed user fees are to be deposited into newly created treasury ato account similarly registration and certification fees are to be deposited in newly created treasury safety and operati ons account the trust fund however remains intact the new user fees would require new collection system to insure that they are deposited in the appropriate account the administrator would be charged with developing this system perhaps with the help of the board the faa proposal would give the administrator some enforcement powers to assist in the collection effort long term faa spending would still require nnual appropriation by congress the relationship between the faa and congressional appropriations committees would apparently be unchanged from budgetar standpoint however it appears that the offsetting collections process created by the proposal would remove faa spending from the discretionary part of the budget at least one outside source has suggested that the new funding arrangement could r afoul of the newly created payasyougohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs19 8 transportation weekly administration faa bill likely violates house payasyougo budget rule february 28 2007 p 13rules adopted by the house of representatives8 in short it is unclear at this point how the new funding arrangement proposed here would play out as part of the congressional budget and ppropriations process congressional finance committees house ways and means and senate finance could lose their existing jurisdiction over some aspects of the faa tax and fee setting these committees would likely retain their jurisdiction over the excise taxes to be deposited in th aviation trust fund but coul d have role or oversight over the newly established user fees authorizing committees normally have jurisdiction over offsetting collection programs of the type that would be created for the ato and for safety and operations as proposed however all feesetting powers would reside with the administrator meaning that specific oversight role for the authorizing committees is not fined in the legislation bonding authority the secretary of transportation would have the ability to issue treasury bonds to facilitate ra pid implementation of the ngats program up to 5 billion could be issued at interest rates established by the treasury to finance the bonding the secret ary could increase user fees by an amount needed to repay the bonds with interest these add itional revenues would not go into the new treasury accounts mentioned earlie r but would flow directly to the treasury full repayment would be requi red by the end of fy2017 the concept of using bonds to speed up the acquisition of fe capital items has been discussed for years the dedicated revenue stream to the ato account would make bonding possible as part of the faa s program for the first time it has been argued that having this authority would allow the faa to better program its acquisition requirements over an extended period of time as opposed to the potential uncertainty of the annual ppropriations process in addition access to additional funds should give the agency the ability to pursue number of technology and equipment upgrades at the sa time the main argument against bonding is that the interest payments make it more expensive way to pay for infrastructure than direct appropriations would be agency funding the faa proposal provides overall authorization levels for the fy2008 fy2 010 period of nearly 28 billion this number however cannot be meaningfully compared to prev ious legislation because it excludes much of the funding required by the prospectiv ely userfee funded ato and safety and operations activities these activities would now be linke d to actual system costs which cannot be determined th is far in advance to the extent that the authorized levels can be compared they suggest sign ificant cut in aip and eas funding s 1300 s 1300 as reported by the senate co mmittee on commerce largely ignores the bush administration proposal and maintains the existing funding structure for the faa with couple of important caveats first the commerce co mmittee lackshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs20 9 the bill defines flight as takeoff and landing by an aircraftjurisdiction over taxes and fees which are in the domain of the senate committee on finance this being the case commerce committeereported bill does not include tax and fee provisions though as will be discussed subsequently it does include significant revenue raising element in addition the committee has proposed an oversight board and provided for bonding au thority in each instance s 1300 differs from provisions in the faa proposal on september 21 2007 the senate committee on finance ordered an original bill to be reported that makes some changes to the existing aviation tax and fee structure the finance committee proposal declines to adopt user fee system for av iation system finance it is expected that the differing views of the two committees will be reconcile d before or during floor consideration of s 1300 in the weeks ahead modernization surcharge the most contentious element of s 1300 is proposal to levy 25 surcharge on flights9 operating in the national airspace system the surcharge is designed to pay for significant portion of faa costs associated with the ngats modernization program revenues collected by the surcharge are to be treated as offsetting collections for congressional budgetary purposes and are to be deposited in new treasury created air traffic modernization fund as an offsetting collection the surcharge is unde r the jurisdiction of the authorizing committee in this case senate commerce spending of these funds is subject to authorization and to subs equent annual appropriation although the bill provides for broad indus try collection of the surcharge it exempts large segment of annual flight activity from the fee the major exemptions are for all piston powered ai rcraft and for all turboprop and turbojet aircraft operating outside of controlled airs pace other exemptions are provided for certain intrastate flights alaska and hawaii where neither terminal radar approach control tracon or other faa atc facility is involved in servicing the flight other exemptions apply to military and pub lic aircraft us and foreign air ambulance aircraft agricultu ral aircraft and canadat ocanada flights the surcharge is to be payable to the administrator of the faa the administrator is also charged with implementing the surcharge collection process limited guidance is provided in the bill as to how the collection process might work leaving it largely to the administrator and treasury to establish workable process the bill provides for penalties fo r nonpayment of the surcharge as reported the provision would provi portion of th annual fe budget beginning in fy2009 at level of 412 milli on funding for the subsequent two years of the authorization period is provided at 423 million and 436 million respectively related provision in the bill requires that all aircraft filing flight plans with the faa including those exempt from the surcha rge include information as to whether or not the flight is being operated for commercial purposes for compensation or for hire collecting this information is apparently directed toward filling what manyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs21 10 senate committee approves faa reauthorization transportation weekly legislative services group vol 8 issue 22 may 23 2007 p 6 11 according to the faa there were over 18 milli on total flights in the us in 2005 if each of these flights were to be taxed which would not be the case since large segment of these flights would be exempted from the surcharge 450 million might be raised in addition to paying for the modernization fund contribution to fe the surcharge would also be used to pay for up to 5 billion in bonds plus interest issued in accordance with another provision of the billindustry observers see as large gap in ex isting industry data i determining what portion of ga flights is for commercia l rather than personal purposes surcharge issues the surcharge is viewed by the ga community as user fee and is opposed for the same reasons th at ga opposes the user fee portions of the administration proposal ie ga believes that it creates marginal demands on the atc system and that its contribution to funding the faa is best handled by the already existing fuel tax system convers ely the airline industry generally supports the surcharge proposal and views it as positive move toward getting all system users and especially corporate aviation to pay for their fair share of atc system costs within the senate commerce committee support for the surcharge proposal was closely split an attempt to strike the surcharge from the reported version of the bill failed on vote of 12 to 11 senator ted st evens having voted initially to abstain on the amendment later changed his vote in order to provide majority for moving the surcharge provision for futu re consideration on the floor10 in addition to the philosophical questions about the desirability of user fees the question can also be raised about whether 25 surcharge would be sufficient in and of itself to provide the amount of designat ed modernization funding authorized in s 1300 the answer based on simple analysis of industry data is that this might not be the case11 as result supplemental revenue s for the modernization fund may be considered by the senate committee on finance there has already been an open discussion in industry circles about the need to consider possible fuel tax andor other fee increases in order to m eet both modernization needs and additional funding needs for other faa activities leveraged financing for next generation air traffic control system bonding authority s 1300 like the faa proposal would provide the faa with up to 5 billion in bonding authority to facilitate expedited spending for ngatsrelated capital projects other administrative aspects of the bonding proposal differ however fo r example funds would be

control modernization oversight board oversight board the oversight board that would be created by this bill unlike the board proposed by the administrati on has real power and some might argue some unusual powers as well s 1300 creates seven mber oversight board appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate membership consists of the administrator of the faa representative of dod repr esentative of the pub lic interest the chief executive officer ceo of an airport the ceo of an airline representative from one of the faas labor organizations and representative of the ga segment of the industry the oversight board is assigned number of functions some advisory in nature and some that give the oversight boar d approval authority over faa actions as stated in the bill these functions are as follows review and advise on faa m odernization budget and cost accounting activities review the faa strategic pla n provide recommendations on non safety elements and advice on safety elements review atc efficiency and ma ke recommendations based on its performance approve all capital expenditures of over 100 million related to the atc system modernization approve the faas fe budget prior to its submission to omb approve the cip prior to its submission to congress annually approve the operati onal evolution plan oep approve the administrators c hoice of chief operating officer coo for the air traffic organization ato approve the selection of the head of the joint planningdevelopment office jpdo the bill requires that oversight board members have certain types of expertise in aviation and organizational subject areas they also must not have pecuniary or financial interest defined by the provisi on and not be member of group that lobbies on aviationrelated gislation from an administrative perspective the bill allows the oversight board to choose its own chairman and vice chairman makes simple majority of members quorum nd allows majority vote of members present to be sufficient for oversight bo ard action also oversight board members are exempt from personal liability laws as concerns their official activities discussion the proposed makeup of the ov ersight board and its role in the ngats implementation process are likely to raise several questi ons during further congressional consideration of this reauthorization proposal one very notable provision here is that the bill gives equal status visavis oversight board activity to the faa administrator and to the repr esentative of faas labor unions this arrangement certainly raises questions bout executive branch authority given the proposed structure of the oversight bo ard given its ability to choose its own chairman it is not out of the realm of possibility that the faa labor representativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs23 could have certain powers that are normally associated with the executive branch especially as regards budget issues another unusual provision is the require ment that the administrator seek oversight board approval before submitting the fe portion of the annual faa budget to omb this provision can be view ed as an extra step that could potentially slow down the annual agency budget approval process hence the oversight board signoff is likely to require certain accommodations in terms of deadlines etc questions can be raised about the sirabilitylikelihood of certain of the conditions to be met by potential oversight board members for example it seems unlikely that the ceo of an airline would not have disqualifyi ng financial interest in hisher airline the same type of question could certainly be raised for the airport ceo member and potentially for the ga member further the member representing the public interest is to have fiduc iary responsibility to represent the public although how this charge is defined is not detailed in the proposed legislation the bill allows the administrator to withhold certain information and documents from the oversight board if they reveal proprietary or commercial information the members of the over sight board having gone through the congressional confirma tion process would normally be viewed as officers of the united states in the same manner as othe r faa employees certain faa and other designated federal employees routinely deal with this type of information in the normal performance of their duties it therefore seems unusual that such an exclusion of information especially if it provided substantive information relevant to capital improvement proj ects could be denied to the oversight board s 2345 on november 13 2007 the senate co mmittee on finance reported an original bill s 2345 the american infrastructure investment and impr ovement act of 2007 incorporating the committees recommendations for what is likely to be the revenue title of the senate faa reau thorization bill its propos makes some changes to elements of the existing tax and fee structure but does not create new user fees as can be seen in table 3 the committee has increased the general aviation jet fuel tax increased the international departurearrival tax and created new tax system for particular segment of the aviation industr fractionally owned aircraft at the moment passengers on fr actionally owned aircraft are treated by the tax code in the same manner as airline passengers subject to the airline ticket tax the segment fee and international departurearrival tax the committee bill would instead treat this industry segment as if it we re part of the general av iation industry for the purposes of the aviation jet fuel tax but would so impose flat fee departure tax on the aircraft rather than on the passenger all of the additional revenues collected by the changes in taxation would be deposited in newly created account within the treasury and reserved fo r ngats related activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs24 table 3 proposed aviation tax and fee

reauthorization bill or consider them separatelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs25 12 national journals congress daily am senate standoff prompts move to extend aviation taxes september 26 2007 discussion there is difference of opinion as to the need for surcharge between members of the finance committ ee and the commerce committee that will need to be resolved before work on the faa reauthorization bill is completed in the senate the two bills can be viewed as competing proposals on how additional financing of the faa should be accomp lished the leadership of commerces aviation subcommittee strongly favors the surcharge approach to increasing faa modernization financing and is opposed to the idea of stripping this provision out of the final bill which is the position favored by several members of the finance committee12 in effect the finance committee has largely taken the ga industry position against user fees the full senate therefore will decide the ultimate fate of the surcharge proposal hr 2881 like the senate commerce and finance committees the house bill rejects the bush administrations financing proposal outright hr 2881 as reported by the house increases the general aviation ga soline tax to 241 centspergallon and the general aviation jet fuel tax to 359 centspergallon table 3 the existing 43cent pergallon tax on commercial jet fuel is unchanged by the bill as are all other existing aviation taxes and fees the bill also reserves the increased revenue to be collected by the fuel tax increases for funding of ngatsrelated programs the bill also includes provision calling for the adjustment of existing overflight fees flights that do not take ff or land in the us these fees are currently used primarily to fund portion of the eas program the faa is to adjust these fees by expedited rulemaking to insure that the fees are reasonably related to the cost of providing air traffic services for overflights the bill however specifically excludes altitude as factor that can be used in the adjustment of the overflight fees registration certification and related fees the bill includes fees for aircraft registration airman certificat and other types of faa provided documentation at the same vels proposed by the administration it also provides that these fees may be adjusted over time if the faas cost accounting system indicates that the cost of providing these services to the aviation sector are higherlower than the fee levels established in the bill the house bill does not however follow the lead of the administration bill and impose new fee structure for faas new large aircraft certification programs and for other activities such as certification of foreig n repair stations discussion unlike the faa proposal and s 1300 hr 2881 is notable primarily for what it does not do the h ouse ultimately decided not to recommend major tax and fee changes to the existing aviation finance system the modest increases in fuel taxes suggested by the b ill indicates that majority of the house members believe that the existing tax system needs only minor tweaking in order to support more robust faa spending in the ears ahead this view is largely sharedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs26 by the ga industry but not by other sector s of the industry especially the airlines and airports airport financing the airport improvement program aip provides federal grants for airport development and planning aip funding is usually limited to capital improvements related to aircraft operati ons commercial revenue producing portions of airports and airport terminals are improvements that are generally not eligible for aip funding aip money cannot usually be used fo r airport operational expenses or bond repayments aip funds are distributed eith er as formula grants or as discretionary grants small airports are much more dependent on aip grants than large and medium hub airports the larger airports can more easily generate revenue from user fees and have historically had the fina ncial wherewithal to successfully access the bond market for background and legislative history of federal aid to airports including description of the aip program as well as an overall discussion of aip issues see crs report rl33891 airport improvement program issues for congress by robert s kirk the passenger facility charge pfc pr ogram provides source of nonfederal funds intended to complement aip spending the pfc is local tax imposed with federal approval by an ai rport on each boarding passenger pfc funds can be used for broader range of projects than aip gr ants and are more likely to be used for ground side projects pfcs can also be used for bond repayments the aip and pfc programs are the s ources of funds for airport capital development that have the most federal involvement other sources are bonds state and local grants and airport revenue the faa proposal hr 1356 s 1076 would make major changes in both the aip and pfc programs in effect the pr oposal would reduce the size and scope of the aip program while increasing the role of pfcs in airport finance the proposal would broaden allowable cost s under both programs the distribution of aip grants would undergo major changes and the local matching share for aip grants would be changed for some airports s 1300 as reported retains the basic ai p program size structure and funding distribution it would increase the prog rams overall yearove ryear authorization level by 100 million for each of the four ears covered by the bill s 1300 does not raise the pfc cap consequently under s 1300 the significance of the aip and pfc programs relative to each others role in airport finance would remain roughly the same as it is under current law hr 2881 also retains the basic aip program size structure and funding distribution as does s 1300 it would in crease the programs overall yearoveryear authorization level by 100 million for each of the four fiscal years covered by the bill unlike s 1300 however hr 2881 would raise the pfc cap to 7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs27 13 see faa next generation air transportation sy stem financing reform act of 2007 sectionbysection analysis 37consequently the bill would raise the significance of the role of the pfc relative to that of aip within the context of airport finance neither s 1300 as reported nor hr 2881 as passed restructure the aip or pfc programs substantially but they do ma ke significant number of what may be seen as perfecting changes aip funding the authorization for fy2007 the final year of funding under vision 100 was 37 billion the amount actually made availa ble through the appropriations process ie the obligation limitation under p l 1105 for aip was 3515 billion faa proposal the funding levels for aip under the faa proposal reflect reduction of aips role in airport fi nance the proposal recommends 275 billion for fy2008 29 billion for fy2009 and 305 billion for fy2010 the faas sectionbysection analysis suggests that the recommended increase in the pfc ceiling and the elimination of the aip entitlements for large and medium airports discussed later in this report reduces the need for aip funding in recent years the george w bush administration annua l budget proposals have consistently recommended reduced spending on aip only to have it just as consistently restored to near its authorized level by congress some observers in the transportation community have suggested that cutting the popular aip program is also way of keeping down the annual totals set forth in the faas reauthorization proposal given that the administrations financing proposal for the airport and airway trust fund would support aip spending directly through aviation fuel taxes the lower spending for aip meant that the adminis tration could propose smaller increase in their aviation fuel tax proposal than they would have had to if they had supported continuing the funding of aip at the hi gher current fy2007 authorized level of 37 billion13 over time the link of the aip spending level to the fuel tax could make it difficult to increase the programs funding b ecause this could require raising the fuel taxes that support the program also should aip be authorized at the current authorization level or high er it could change the implications of the programmatic changes in aip proposed by the administration should they be enacted s 1300 s 1300 recommends an increasing authorization for aip over the life of the bill as follows 38 billion for fy2008 39 billion for fy2009 40 billion for fy2010 and 41 billion for fy2011 the 100 million per year growth in the program extends the pattern of funding grow th in vision 100 over the fouryear life of the bills authorization this would provi an aggregate additional authorization of 1 billion for aip ie compared to freezing the aip authorization for fy2008 fy2011 at the 37 billion level authorized for fy2007 the final year of vision 100 hr 2881 hr 2881 as passed would provide the same amounts as recommended in s 1300 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs28 formula funding entitlements the faa proposal would make number of changes in the distribution of aip funds that airports are entitled hen ce the term entitlements to based on administrative formulas s 1300 would ma ke few changes to the aip entitlements elimination of the 32 billion aip program level trigger under current law the form ula apporti onments also referred to as entitlements fund two levels of entitlements lower entitlement level when the overall aip funding is below 32 billion and higher level when the program is funded at 32 billion or more faa proposal basically the faa proposal eliminates the lower entitlement level in favor of the higher formula di stribution levels and higher minimum and maximums the general avia tion apportionment is treated somewhat differently see below the proposal would also eliminate the 32 billion trigger itself the trigger mechanism was designed in part to enc ourage funding of aip above the 32 billion level since the faa proposes funding aip below the 32 billion level not making this change would in effect cut most pr imary airports entitleme nt funding in half and would reduce general aviation entitlements also during the life of the trigger aip funding has always been bove 32 billion making the lower titlement formulas existence moot point since fy2001 s 1300 s 1300 does not include provision to eliminate the 32 billion trigger given that the bills recommende d authorization levels would be from 600 to 900 million above the trigger some woul d argue that the trigger would continue to be moot issue on the other nd the increasing gap between the recommended authorizations and the trigger provides more room for possible aip reductions during the appropriations pr ocess ie reductions that would not trigger the distribution of entitlements based on the lower belowtrigger formula levels hr 2881 as is true with s 1300 hr 2881 does not include general provision to eliminate the 32 billion trigger primary airport entitlements faa proposal the faa proposal would phase out the formula funding that is provided for large and medium hub airports under current law by fy2010 to provide transition period for these airpor ts their formula funding is continued at 50 of the calculated level for fy2008 nd fy2009 the faas sectionbysection analysis of the faa proposal notes that th is reduction is more than offset by the increase in the pfc ceiling discussed later in this report in addition large and medium airports that impose pfcs above the 450 level are to forego or turnback 100 of their aip entitlement funding during fy2008fy2009 in fy2010 large and medium hub airports would receive entitlement funds and therefore the turnbacks would end s 1300 s 1300 does not include provisions altering the primary airport formulashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs29 hr 2881 hr 2881 also does not include provisions altering the primary airport formulas unlike s 1300 the bill does however include provision related to the reduction of apportionments at large hub airports that charge pfcs above the 450 level these airports would have their formula apportionments entitlements reduced by 100 of the projected pfc revenue s for the fiscal year but not more than 100 of the amount that othe rwise would be apportioned virtual primary airports special rule enacted after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks allowed some airports referred to as virtual primary airports whose annual passenger boardings fell be low the required minimu m passenger levels needed to maintain their primary airport status to continue receiving their annual primary airport entitlements generally 1 million vs the ga entitlement which is generally 150000 earlier the fy2006 transportationtreas ury appropriations act pl 109115 extended the virtual pr imary airport eligibility through fy2006 but at reduced entitlement of 500000 the ex planatory language in the conference report expressed the appropria tions conferees intent that fy2006 be the last year for virtual primary airport entitlements paying the higher entitlements to the virtual primary airports reduces the amount of f unding remaining availa ble for discretionary spending after all the entitlement requirements are satisfied faa proposal the faa proposal would repeal the special rule the faas sectionbysection analysis argues that seven years after the attack it is unlikely that these airports currently 44 will again attain primary airport status s 1300 s 1300 would authorize the special rule for fy2008fy2011 in effect extending the virtual primary categor with some modifications the virtual primary determination would be made based on the airports having an average annual passenger boardings for calendar years 20042006 below 10000 but passenger boardings that were 10000 or above in calendar year 2003 s 1300 also includes provisions that coul d in effect also include new group of virtual primary airports the bill does this by amending the provision in 49 usc 47114c1 that deals with using the previ ous years apportionm ent level to retain primary airport status s 1300 would drop the provision that limits the determination of eligibility to airports where passenger boardings fell below 10000 boardings to airports had temporary but signifi cant interruption of service due to an employment action natural di saster or other event unr elated to demand for air transportation at the affected airport and allow it for essential air service airports whose passenger boardings fall below 9700 commercial service airports that can meet the 10000 boardings by counting nonsch eduled service or single carrier airports that suffer from 4 decline in scheduled flights due to severe weather conditions the bill also includes re lated provision that for fy2009fy2011 would allow dot to use the last year that an airports passenger boardings exceeded 10000 to determine its primary status for these years the bill also includes provision that appears to be written for an unnamed airport that is served by large certificated carrier that began scheduled service at the airport in may 2006 and ceased scheduled service at the airport in october 2006 u nder the bill this airport would retain its primary airport entitlementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs30 as of this writing crs has been unable to determine the number of airports that would be eligible under s 1300 for virtua l primary entitlements however the difference for an airport between prima ry and ga entitlement funding is usually 850000 so the provisions could have si gnificant impact on entitlement spending as well as the amount left over for disc retionary grants once all the required entitlement distributions are satisfied hr 2881 hr 2881 includes provisions regarding virtual primary airports puerto rico minimum guarantee the house bill provides minimum entitlement for puerto rico which guarantees that puerto rico shall receive at least 15 of the total amounts

the state appor tionment and the general aviation apportionment some times referred to as the nonprima ry entitlement under current law 20 of aip funds are to be apportioned for both components faa

fewer than 10 ai rcraft would not be eligible for nonprimary entitlement but c ould still qualify for state apportionment funds and could compete for discretionary grants and these grants would retain

funding distribution the setaside based on 8 of apportioned funds would have provided less than the 35 discre tionary fund setaside s 1300 s 1300 would provide for flat 300 million annual discretionary setaside for aip noise program costs it would however also make water quality mitigation projects eligib under the setasidehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs33 hr 2881 hr 2881s provision is the same as s 1300 small airport fund faa proposal the faa proposal would eliminate the small airport fund the revenues supporting the fund are deri ved from the forgone entitlement funding from medium and large hub airports that th ey forego in return for permission to impose pfcs since the faa is proposing to phase out the ent itlements for these airports the f unding source for the sm all airport fund would longer exist in fy2010 small airport fund monies are us ed in manner similar to discretionary funds instead the faa proposal would taside 20 of discretionary funds for small hub nonhub nonprimary commerc ial service reliever or general aviation airports the setaside is to compensa for the loss of the small airport fund s 1300 s 1300 does not include similar provision the small airport fund would continue hr 2881 hr 2881 does not include similar provision military airport program map and reliever airport setasides faa proposal both of these setasides would be eliminated the special aip eligibilities for map would continue s 1300 s 1300 includes proposal similar to the faa proposals adds whether or not grant to the airport woul d be critical to the safety of commercial military or general aviation in transocean ic flights to map program selection considerations hr 2881 hr 2881 retains the map progra m and reliever set asides as they are under current

aeronautical fueling systems airplane wash racks major rehabilitation of hangar owned by sponsor or other aeronautical support facilities clearly aip eligible for nonprimary airports the construction of mobile refueler parking within fuel farm at non primary airport w ould be made eligible on condition that it meets the epas requirements regarding oil spill prevention control and countermeasures under 40 cfr 1128 up to 10 million in aip grants could be made to make grants for commercial space infrastructure development the cost of environmental review of airport proposed environmentally beneficial aircraft flight procedures would be aip eligible relocation of airpor towned facilities that must be moved because of design standa rds beyond the sponsors control would be eligible for aip funding the required passe nger aircraft size required to meet the eligibility requirements for purchasing firefighting and rescue equipment would be reduced from aircraft designed for more th an 20 passenger seats to aircraft designed for more than nine passenger seats the proposal also includes languagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs34 consolidating the definition of terminal development in addition general aviation airport is defined as pub lic airport that does not have scheduled service or has scheduled service with fewer than 2500 passenger boardings each year s 1300 s 1300 includes language identical to the faa proposal on eligibility of the cost of environmental review fo r environmentallybeneficial ie mostly noiserelated aircraft flight procedures and also for the relocation of airportowned facilities it does not include most of the other faa pr oposed changes including provisions similar to the faa proposals regarding revenue producing aeronautical support facilities and doe s not include language for commercial space infrastructure development grants hr 2881 hr 2881 makes number of finitional and other changes that would impact aip project eligibility the bill includes the faa proposed provisions regarding eligibility of revenue pr oducing aeronautical support facilities at nonprimary airports and the lowering of the passenger aircraft size required to meet the eligibility requirements for purchasing firefighting and rescue equipment terminal development is re defined to include developm ent of an airport passenger terminal building including gates and access roads and walkways servicing exclusively airport traffic that leads directly to or from the airport passenger terminal building it also includes the faas pr oposal regarding the construction of mobile refueler parking and the clarifying definiti ons of general aviati on airport and terminal development as does s 1300 hr 2881 includes the faa proposed language regarding the relocation of airportow ned facilities unde r hr 2881 repaying borrowed money for terminal developmen t under 49 usc 47119a is clarified as an airport development nd made eligible under certain circumstances projects to provide air conditioning heating or electric power from terminal facilities to parked aircraft to reduce energy use and harmful emissions would be eligible airport planning would be redefined to include dev eloping an environmental management system the cost of vironmental review of airportproposed environmentallybeneficial aircraft flight procedures would also be aip eligible aip grant assurances faa proposal the faa proposal makes two changes to aip grant assurances under 49 usc 47107 the proposal allows for the use of aip entitlement funds to replace or move facility at an airpor t if the cause of the need was bey ond the owners control for example new design standard that could make the facility safety hazard the second proposed change deals with th disposition of profits made from the sale of land that was originally acquired for noise compatibility purpose but is longer needed for noise compatibility current law requires that the federal share of the proceeds proportional to the federal sh are of the original land acquisition cost be deposited in the trust fund the proposed change would allow the proceeds to be reinvested in another project for in preferential order 1 an approved noise compatibility project at the airport 2 an environmentally related project at the airport 3 another elig ible aip project at the airport 4 transfer to another airport for noise compatibility project or 5 payment to the trust fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs35 14 faa sectionbysection analysis 910s 1300 s 1300 includes the same two gran t assurance proposals as described above hr 2881 hr 2881 includes language s imilar to the two grant assurance proposals in the faa proposal and s 1300 federal share under current law the fede ral government share for aip projects is as follows 75 for large and medium hub air ports 80 for noise compatibility projects 95 for other airports and not more than 95 for airport projects in states participating in the state block grant program 70 for projects funded from the discretionary fund at airports receiving exemptions under 49 us c section 47134 the pilot program for private ownership of airports vision 100 included sunset cl ause that returns the federal share of the projects eligible for 95 share to 90 after fy 2007 the increase in share to 95 was established to provide relief to operators of small airports after the 911 terrorist attacks faa proposal the faa proposal would make number of changes in the federallocal matching shar requirements the proposal would change current law to add the phrase may not exceed to all federal share percentages under current law some airports project shares were fixed percentage shares faa argues that this change would allow it to leverage aip f unds more efficiently and provide support for broader number and type of projects14 some small airport advocates may be concerned that this provision could allow f aa to routinely offer discretionary grants at less than the maximum allowable federal share on some projects the faa proposal would also lower the maximum fede ral share for runway taxiway and apron ramp projects at large and medium hub airports from 75 to 50 other aip eligible projects at these airports would retain their 75 maximum federal share special rule is proposed for airports r ecently reclassified medium hub because of increased passenger enplanements that allows them to retain their eligibility for up to 90 federal share for two years th faa proposal would allow the 911 related increase 95 federal share for aip grants to small airports to lapse the federal maximum share at these airports would be 90 as mentioned earlier general aviation airports that have lost thei r nonprimary minimum entitlements because they have fewer than 10 based ai rcraft approximately 800 air ports would be allowed an up to 95 federal share on their discre tionary or state apportionment grants s 1300 s 1300 would set the federal shar for airports smaller than medium hub and state block grant program stat at 95 for fy2008fy2011 in effect extending the post911 federal share increase for the life of the bill it also provideshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs36 special rule for small hub airports that because of passenger growth are becoming medium hub airports which would drop thei r federal share to 75 these airports have for two years federal share not to exceed 95 of allowable project costs hr 2881 as would be the case in the faa proposal and s 1300 hr 2881 would provide special rule to allow airports recently classified as medium hub which would drop their federal share to 75 to retain their eligibility for an up to 90 federal share for two year transition period hr 2881 also includes special rule for economically depressed communities the rule would maintain the 95 federal share for projects at airports that are receiving subsidized rvice under the essential air service eas program that meet one or more of the criteria established in 42 usc 3161a as determined by the secretary of commerce 42 usc 3161a sets forth three criteria for eligibility 1 the area has per capita income of 80 percent or less of the national average 2 the area has an unemployment rate that is for the most recent 24month period for which data are available at least 1 percent greater than the national average unemployment rate and 3 the area is an area that the secretary of commerce determines has experienced or is about to experi ence special need arising from actual or threatened severe unemployment or economic adjustment resulting from severe shor tterm or longterm changes in economic cond itions given the variety of eligibility criteria nd the rural location of eas airports it is likely that many eas airports could reta in their 95 federal share under hr 2881 noneas airports smaller th an medium hub would reve rt to 90 federal share under the bill passenger facility charges pfcs project eligibility faa proposal the faa proposes to make eligible any capital cost that an airport could pay for with ai rport revenue eligib the proposal would specifically make fixedguideway ground accessrelated projects including rail mass transit projects whether publically or privately owned eligible for pfc funding the faa proposal would also ease the current so calle d limitations on the use of pfcs ie the requirement that the pr oject would preserve or enhance capacity safety or security reduce noise or provide an opportunity for enhanced competition among carriers at the airport it also eliminat the limitation that in regard to surface transportation or terminal projects for an airport to impose pfc above the 3 level for this purpose that the airport has made adequate provision for financing the airside needs of the airport these transit pr ojects would require dot approval however airlines may object to this broadening of pfc eligibility the faa proposal also includes change in the language of the written assurance on the use of revenues which would appear to allow for use of aip and pfc grants on facilities that are directly and substantially related to the ai r transportation of pa ssengers or property but are not owned or operated by the sponsoring airport as is now required s 1300 s 1300 does not include the faa language broadening pfc project eligibility to virtually any capital cost that an airport could pay for with airporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs37 revenue it also does not broaden the definition of intermodal ground access project which whether publically or priv ately owned or als not for exclusive airport use under the faa proposal would ve been eligible for pfc funding s 1300 also does not change the language of th assurance on the use of revenue as the faa proposed pfcs could be used for planning or redeve lopment activities of property acquired for noise compatibility purposes s 1300 does however include langua ge similar to the faa proposal that would make major changes to section 40117 d which sets cer tain limitations on approving applications the bill would restrict the limitations to intermodal ground access projects thereby freeing pfc applications for other types of projects from the limitations the bill then also eliminates some of the current law limitations that would otherwise still apply to ground access projects among the limitations eliminated for all pfc applications are finding by the secretary of dot that the project will preserve or enhance capacity safety or security of the national air transportation system reduce noise from an airport or provide an opportunity for enhanced competition between or among air carriers and foreign air carriers in addition the bill would eliminate the preconditi on that for an airport to impose fee above the 3 level the secretary must find that the airport has made adequate provision for financing the airside needs of the airport including runways taxiways aprons and aircraft gates hr 2881 the bill does not include the changes proposed in the faa proposal or s 1300 hr 2881 does how ever include pfc eligibility provisions that are in neither the faa proposal nor s 1300 one provision would make eligible projects to construct secure bicycle storage facilities for use by passengers at the airport and that are in compliance with appli cable security standards one year after enactment faa is to submit report on progress made by airports to install bicycle parking another provision would make noise mitigation for certain schools in angeles eligible for pfc funding in addition hr 2881 proposes pilot pr ogram that would make available pfc funds for eligible intermodal ground access pr ojects at 5 airports the projects do not have to be on property owned or controlle d by the sponsoring airport the pfc project cost share would be limited to the projected ratio of airport bound passengers to the total number of passeng ers using the ground access facility increasing the pfc cap faa proposal the faa proposal would increase the maximum charge to 6 per passenger boarding any charge over 450 would require medium and large hub airports to forego 100 of their aip titlement funding air ports participating in the pilot program for the transfer of navigational equipment to airport control would be able to adopt 7 pfc s 1300 the bill does not increase the pfc cap see pilot program discussion below hr 2881 the bill would allow for pfcs above the existing 450 cap at the 5 6 and 7 levels as is true under curre nt law only two pfcs could be chargedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs38 for any oneway trip for roundtrip max imum of 28 the current maximum is 18 as mentioned earlier large hub airports imposing pfc above the 450 level would forego from their aip formula entitlements an amount equal to their projected pfc revenues but not more than 100 of the titlement funding that otherwise would have been apportioned hr 2881 includes provision requiring study of the impacts on airports of accommodating connecting passengers the study is to include recommendation as to whether different levels of pfcs should be imposed on connecting passengers versus origin and destinati on passengers some have ar gued that the pfc structure favors large hub airports pf c revenues because the costs to an airport of connecting passenger is less than at airports that are primarily originating airports passenger facility charge pilot program faa proposal the proposal includes provision similar to s 1300 s 1300 would establish pilot program at up to six airports that would allow them to collect pfc with statutory ceiling on the fee the fee however must be collected by the airport from the passenger under current law the pfcs are collected for the airports by the airlines during the ticketing process hr 2881 the bill includes similar program proposal competition plans faa proposal the faa proposes changing the requirement that aip or pfc grant may be approved for large or medium hub airport unl ess the airport has submitted written competition plan to the faa the faa proposal would eliminate the requirement that the competition plans include information on patterns of air service and comparative airfare levels s 1300 there is provision similar to the faa proposal in s 1300 hr 2881 the bill extends the competition plan requirement pfc grant streamlining faa proposal the proposal includes an extensive provision to streamline the pfc review and approval process instead of seeking approval on projectby project basis for existing projects an airport would be required to submit to air carriers at the airport the faa and ma ke available to the public an annual pfc status report that sets forth the air ports pfc revenues spending pfc funded projects the next years pr ojected revenues and descri ption of the consultation and public notice process once the status report is submitted further action is required and implementation c ould continue for new projects the airport would have to provide for notice and comment period for carriers operating at the airport and public notice and comment period befo re they file their pfc status report once the report is filed the airport could be gin collecting the new pfc stakeholders could however file objections and if the faa agrees with the objection the faahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs39 may terminate the airports authority to collect pfc revenues for the project the proposal also provides that dot may inves tigate whether pfc charge is excessive or whether pfc revenue is being diverted to nonallowable uses s 1300 the bills streamlining language cl osely mirrors the faa bill the bill also includes revenue diversion language hr 2881 the bill does not include language similar to the faa proposal or s 1300 other airportrelated provisions privatization the faa proposal would make changes to the airport privatization pilot program the number of airports that could participate would be increased from 5 to 15 and there would be restrictions by airport category the existing program allows for only one large airport to participate and chicago midway airport has reserved that authority since the program was enacted in 1996 section 149 of the federal aviation reauthorization act of 1996 pl 104264 only one airport has been privatized stewart international airport new york the faa and others supportive of the pilot program have argued that the curre nt program gives airlines effective veto power over privatization tran sactions current law requi res that the airport sponsor may only recover from the sale or lease the amount that may be approved by at least 65 of the air carriers serving the airport and by air carriers that account for 65 of the total landed weight at the airpor t for the year the faa proposal would eliminate these requirements and only require that the airport show the faa that they had consulted with for primary airports each air carrier and foreign air carrier serving the airport and for nonprimary air ports consulted with at least 65 percent of the owners of aircra ft based at the airport the proposal eliminates the airline approva l requirement of airport fee increases that exceed inflation and eliminates the pr ovision that requires that the percentage general aviation fee increases not be larger than the percentage increases for air carriers also eliminated would be the existing prohibition on the abrogation of labor agreement in consequence of the sale or lease of an airport under the program finally the private operator could set fees to recover all capital and operating costs except for the sale or lease price wh ich would require ai r carrier approval s 1300 the bill does not include similar provision hr 2881 the bill would raise the required air carrier approval percentages from 65 to 75 airports participating in the pilot program would not be eligible for aip funds sale of private airport to public sponsor faa proposal although written in general rms this provision appears to facilitate the return of stew art international airport to public ownership the port authority of new york and new jersey plan s to purchase the remainder of the leasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs40 at stewart essentially the proposed pr ovision would exempt the proceeds ie profit from the sale of privatized airport to public authority from the aip assurance that requires that all airport revenue be expended fo r capital and operating costs at the airport the exemption re quires that the sale be approved by the secretary of dot funding under title 49 is provided for the public sponsors acquisition and the amount of the remain ing unamortized portion of the original grant amortized over 20year period is repa id to the secretary by the private owner for deposit in the trust fund for airport acquisitions s 1300 includes language identical to the faa proposal hr 2881 includes language similar to the faa proposal however the funds are to be treated as recovery of prior year obligations airport development rights pilot program faa proposal the faa proposal would allow this vision 100 initiated program to expire at the end of fy2007 the pilot program allows for the purchase of privately owned public use airports velopment rights as means of keeping the airport open and operating faa argues that the program has not been success and suggests better strategy would be to find public sponsor to purchase the airport rather than just the developmen t rights some gene ral aviation supporters may still be supportive of the pilot program s 1300 the bill does not include sunset provision for the airport development rights pilot program hr 2881 the bill includes sunset provision that would end the airport development rights pilot program on september 30 2007 adsb support pilot program faa proposal this faaproposed program would allow for aip stateinsular area formula entitle ment funds at 90 federa l share to be used for airport purchase of automatic dependent surveillancebroadcast adsb equipment the ground stations where th is equipment would be installed are not airport specific most aip projects are required to be within airport boundaries adsb is part of faas air traffic modernization system the use of aip funds would supplement other faa funding sources for adsb ground station deployment the faa argues that state s regions and airports would benefit because the program would provide adsb coverage to areas that would not be reached under the faas direct procuremen t project sponsorship would be limited to states metropolitan planning organiza tions mpos or consortiums of two or more airports not more than 10 airports could apply in the past the use of aip funds for air traffic equipment has met resistance by some program supporters usually on the grounds that air traffic cont rol capital costs are not within the aips original programmatic intent and should be paid for elsewhere in the faa budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs41 s 1300 the bill includes language identical to the faa proposal hr 2881 the bill does not include the faa proposal airline passenger rights issues recent incidents where passeng ers were held in aircraft for eight or more hours awaiting take off as well as reports of deterioration of ontime arrival performance by airlines have led to increasing interest in airline passenger consumer issues currently most passenger rights are set forth in the airlines contract of carriage language the contract of carriage is the legal contract between the airline and the ticket holder which scribes the rights and respons ibilities of both the air carrier and the passenger passengers may take legal action in federal courts based on these contracts historically th department of transportati ons dot role in consumer protection is limited the existing law does provide procedures and compensation rules for bumping and lost or damage d baggage however the main power dot has to protect consumers is the departments power to ta ke action against air carriers for

the tr ust funds revenues this led beginning in 1976 to the enactment of series of legislative mechanisms designed to assure that federal capital spe nding for us airports and airways ie aip and fe would be funded at their fu lly authorized levels for detailed discussion of the history and impact of th various spending guarantee mechanisms see crs report rl33654 aviation spending guarantee mechanisms by robert s kirk the current mechanism dates back to 2000 and includes two spending guarantees one makes it outoforder in the house or senate to consider legislation that fails to use all aviation trust fund receipts and interest annually the second makes it outoforder to consider any b ill that provided any funding for red or om if the bill fails to fully fund aip and f at their fully authorized levels the current guarantees will lapse at the end of fy2007 if action is taken to extend themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs44 faa proposal the faa proposal includes provisions regarding the spending guarantees s 1300 s 1300 would extend the current spending guarantees through fy2011 hr 2881 hr 2881 would amend the airport and airw ay trust fund guarantee that requires that the total amounts made available from the trust fund be qual to the level of receipts plus interest for the year under hr 2881 for each year fy2008fy2009 the amounts made available w ould equal 95 of the estima ted level of receipts plus interest on the fund for each respective fiscal year for fy2010 and fy2011 the guaranteed level would be 95 for each respective year plus the difference between the actual receipts and total amounts made available for obligation from two years before ie fy2008 and fy2009 respectively the bill would retain the pointof order enforcement mechanisms this change would have number of po ssible implications first the change could lessen the demands on trust fund revenues for the first two years of the reauthorization allowing modest accumulation in the unexpended balance of the trust fund during these years second it would reduce the likelihood that overly optimistic revenue projections c ould lead to spending at rates that exceed the actual revenues accruing to the trust fund as has happened in recen t years at least in the first two years of the bill finally by limiting trust fund spending the change could in the minds of some increase the like lihood that the general fund contribution percentage for the faa budget c ould be set at higher level faa management and organizational issues management and organizati onal reform at the faa has been central focus of both legislative and administration initiatives over the past several years major provisions of the faa proposal and s 1300 addressing management and organizational issues include measures designed to achieve be tter integration of ngats planning and implementation into the faas ongoing planning and acquisition activities measures to establish mechanism for considering possiblerealignment and consolidation of various faa facilities and services and provisions to increase the flexibility in the design andimplementation of ngats by allowi ng airports and private entities to play more direct role in ac quiring deploying and maintaining facilities and services to augment the faas air traffic communications navigation and surveillance capabilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs45 these issues and the related legisla tive proposals under consideration in the current faa reauthorization debate ar discussed in further detail below planning and oversight of next generation air transportation system development central issue permeating the current reauthorization debate is the adequacy of management and organizati onal processes to facilitate developm ent of the ngats the ngats is being developed to addre ss systemwide capacity needs and is scheduled to be completed prior to 2025 provision in vision 100 created the multiagency joint planning and development office jpdo and charged it with the task of defining developing and implementing the ngats plan over the past three years the jpdo has collaborated with governmental and industry partners to draft concept fo r ngats development some critics have argued that the pace of this effort has been too slow while others have voiced concern that the scope of the jpdo concept encompassing curbsidetocurbside movement of airline passenger s rather than just block to block handling of all aircraft types within the national airsp ace system may be inappropriate still others have raised concerns over the orga nizational and manageme nt structure of the jpdo specifically regarding the jpdo potential lack of influence over management and budgetary processes of participating agencies while these agencies are ultimately charged with the task of carrying out the engineering work to build the ngats as well as the operational responsib ilities to run and main tain the national airspace system and its many components including but not limited to air traffic control services and airport security functions the link between their respective budgets and the ngats program is not clearly defined various options to address these concer ns that have been identified include establishing lead systems integration lsi entity to oversee the engineering of the ngats systems and possibly establishing specific reporting requirements perhaps through the budget and appropriations pr ocess in which the various agencies involve d could identify how budgetary elemen ts would support ngats development and how crossagency efforts woul d be coordinate d and aligned faa proposal addressing the overarching objective of facilitating implementation of the ngats gineering effort the faa pr oposal includes language designed to give the jpdo great er input into faa systems development and operational decision maki ng by making the jpdo director voting member of the faas joint resources council as well as the air traffic organizations atos executive council the faa proposal so includes language that would more closely integrate the jpdos plans nd progress on the ngats with the faas ongoing modernization and capacity enhancement initiatives specifically the faa proposal would require an nnual operational evolution partnership oep plan to be developed to provide tails of how the faa is implementing next generation concepts and would also include in the faas annual report to congress details on how each of the jpdo participating ag encies respective budgets will support ngats developmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs46 s 1300 s 1300 also addresses fac ilitation of ngats development but proposes instead to establish implementa tion offices within the various federal agencies involved in the ngats program the bill language specifically directs the faa the department of defense the national aer onautics and space administration nasa the department of commerce the department of homeland security and any other federal agency aske d by the department of transportation to assist with ngats development to each tablish an implementation office each implementation office or system planning ffice spo as they are referred to in the title of the provision would be charged with the task of overseeing agency implementation activities re lated to ngats and would serve as liaison and coordinator between the agency or depa rtment it represents and other federal departments and agencies involved in th ngats effort each spo would also be responsible for managing all ngatsrela ted programs includi ng management of budgetary and staff resources s 1300 further requires that each partic ipating federal depa

commitments nd staff resources committed to the ngats project this memorandum as we ll as department and agency budget requests are to be revised as needed to reflect any changes in responsibilities and commitments of the agencies involved like the faa proposal s 1300 would blish the jpdo director as voting member of the faas joint resources c ouncil and the air traffic organizations atos executive council s 1300 also includes language amending current requirements for an ngats integrated plan requiring that multiagency implementation plan including schedule of regulatory activities rulemakings be developed and updated on an annual basis the bill w ould extend authorization of 50 million annually for the jpdo through 2011 hr 2881 hr 2881 includes sense of c ongress language recognizing that modernizing the air transportation system is national priority to address this need to prioritize investment in the next ge neration air transportation system ngats the bill includes several provisions designed to improve the management and implementation of this effort like the faa proposal and s 1300 hr 2881 would establish the jpdo director as voting member of the faa s joint resources council the bill would give the jpdo director the title associate administrator for the next generation air transportation system position that would report directly to the faa administrator to the extent possible the jpdo director would be required to oversee development of the integrated ngats plan ensuring that each federal agency involved has requested sufficient f unds in the annual budget process to carry out its responsibilities under the plan the jpdo director would also be responsible for making sure that the developmen t and implementation of ngats stays on schedule and identify and justify in the presidents budget submission any inconsistencies between the ngats plan and the budget request httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs47 similar to s 1300 hr 2881 would also require each component agency involved in the ngats initiative to designat senior official responsible for carrying out ngatsrelated activities of th agency serving as liaison for the agency in matters involving ngats support and ensuring that the agency meets its obligations set forth in memoranda of understanding regarding ngats development and support the bill further requires that the jpdo work with the omb to develop process for identifying projects tied to the ngats program acr oss all affiliated federal agencies and consider the ngats as crossagency unified program further hr 2881 would require multi agency integrated work plan for ngats including an outline of activities required to achieve the endstate architecture defined in the programs concept of operations conops yearbyyear details of accomplishments activities res earch requirements rulemakings policy decisions and other milestones an outlin of annual objectives and responsible agencies an estimate of yearbyyear funding requirements for each development stage and clear explanati on of how each step in the development of ngats will lead to the following step and the implications of not successfully completing step in the time period described in the integrated work plan the bill would also require the faa to issue the operational evolution partnership detailing how the agency is implementing ngats on an annual basi s as well as annual reports to the congressional oversight committees detailing progress made in carrying out the multiagency integrated ngats work plan also under hr 2881 the ngats senior policy committee would be required to meet twi ce each year and prepare an annual report to coincide w ith the presidents budget re quest detailing progress made on the multiagency integrated ngats work plan and any changes to that plan detailing the impact of those changes hr 2881 would also requi re gao to review the pr ogress and challenges of transforming the national airspace system to ngats and review ongoing air traffic modernization projects and progress on ngats component systems including route automation modernization eram standard terminal automation replacement systemcommon automated radar terminal systems starscarts traffic flow manage ment modernization tfmm system wide information management swim and adsb the bill would also task the national research council with performing review of the enterprise architecture for the ngats examining technical activ ities program ris k and opportunities to mitigate risk based on experiences with other complex softwareintensive systems the bill would also require the faa in consultation with other agencies such as nasa to initiate research program on methods to improve and streamline the process of certifying new technologies fo r introduction into the national airspace system the bill also authorizes dditional appropriations totaling 568 million over the four year authorization period sp ecifically for airspace redesign initiatives to enhance aviation system capacity and reduce delayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs48 realignment and consolidation of faa facilities and operations faa proposal the faa proposal includes language giving the faa authority to establish commission to be known as the realignment and consolidation of aviation facilities and services commi ssion that would be tasked with making independent recommendations to the president regarding the realignment and consolidation of faa facilities and services the commission would be comprised of five members appointed by the secretary of transportation to serve threeyear terms with one servin g as memberelected chairperson of the commission in order to conduct its wor k the commission would be permitted to hire experts and consultants on either temporary or intermittent basis subject to dot approval the proposal outlines process for ev aluating and impleme nting recommended faa facility and service c onsolidation in manner designed to minimize political influence on the process much like the military brac process which it is closely modeled after the overall objective would be to identify and implement recommended realignment and consolidation activities that would help reduce faa capital operating maintenance and administrative costs without adversely impacting system safety the faa proposal includes details of th process and timeline for carrying out systemwide review and imp lementation of realignment and consolidation of faa facilities and services first within six months after establishing the commission the commission would be required to publish its final criteria for making recommendations regarding realignment nd consolidation thereafter the faa would be required to publish list of recommendations to the commission for realignment and consolidation the co mmission would subsequently review the faas recommendations and consider pub lic comments on these recommendations based on this review the commission w ould then make its own independent recommendations and justify these recommenda tions in report to the president if the president concurs with the co mmissions recommendations the president would transmit the recommendations along with presidential certification of approval to congress if on the other nd the president disapproves the president would be required to transmit to the commission and to congress the reasons for disapproval the commission may then address the presiden ts report and make revised recommendations if the president still disapproves the entire process would then be terminated if the president pproves of all of the revised recommendations the president would then forward them along with indication of presidential approval to congress congress in turn would have the opportunity to review the recommendations and would have 60 days to disapprove of the plan through passage of joint resolution if congress doe s not disapprove then the faa would be statutorily required to carry out the realignment and consolidation activities detailed in the presidentially approved commission plan the faa would be required to initiate implementation of the approved actions within two years and would be required to complete the realignment and consolidation activities within six years httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs49 while the proposed process closely follo ws the military brac process which has generally been regarded as successful approach to realignment and consolidation of military bases and units the prospect of implementing such process to assess faa facilities and services may be regarded as controversial during the reauthorization debate pa rticularly in local regions that may stand to lose faa facilities and jobs as an outcome of the pr ocess consideration of the process in legislation may also be oppos ed by labor organizations representing faa employees although nothing in current statute gene rally prohibits the faa from engaging in organizational consolidation and realignment as evidenced by the faas recent consolidation of its regi onal service areas in 2006 s 1300 s 1300 does not include the admin istration proposal to establish braclike commission and process to examine faa facility realignment and consolidation rather the bill proposes an alternative process for realigning faa services and facilities under s 1300 w ithin nine months of enactment the administrator would be required to establish final criteria for the realignment of services and facilities to assist in the transition to next generation operations and to reduce costs after providing an oppor tunity for public comments on proposed criteria after the final realignment criteria are published the faa would be required to identify those services and facilities recommended for realignment including justification for these recommendations and the anticipated costs and savings for each recommended realignmen t action the air traffic control modernization oversight board would then have the opportunity to study the faas recommendations for realignment and pr ovide an opportunity for public comment on the recommendations based on its revi ew of the faas recommendations and related public comments the board would then be required to make independent recommendations of its own and report these recommendations to the president and to the congressional oversight committees having jurisdiction over the faa in this report the board would be required to ex plain and justify any recommendations that differ from those recommendations offered by the faa s 1300 does not discuss what would happen next nor does it requi re any specific further action once the recommendations of the board are received by the president and congress unlike the administrations proposal which would limit the ability to take action on any recommendation unless it wa s supported by the proposed commission and would require the faa to implement approved recommenda tions within two years s 1300 does not limit the faas ability to take action on its own recommendations nor does it require the faa to implement any recommendation so in contrast to the commission propos ed under the faa proposal which would play direct role in the realignment pr ocess the boards role under s 1300 would only be advisory in nature while the bill does not require the faa to implement any specific actions regarding its proposals fo r realignment or consolidation planned consolidations of terminal radar approach control tracon facilities in southern california houston tx and memphis tn would be put on hold until the above described process is comp leted and the board completes its recommendations hr 2881 in contrast to the faa proposal and s 1300 that seek more formal entities and processes for reviewing f aa consolidation initiatives hr 2881 proposes to blish an faa working group similar to an advisory group to develop criteria and make recommendations for realignment of services and facilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs50 members of the ninemember workin g group would consist of the faa administrator two airline representativ two airport representatives two representatives from the general aviation community and two labor organization representatives representing faa regional ffice or field employees an amendment agreed to and incorporated into the housepassed version of the bill would require that faa regional office consolidation be included in the scope of the working groups oversight that provision also s tipulates that the working group members from labor unions representing faa empl oyees may be selected from unions representing employees working at either field facilities or regional offices the faa would be required to form th working group within nine months of enactment and once established the work ing group would have six months to develop criteria and recomme ndations for realignment and present those findings to the appropriate congressiona l oversight committees the working groups report is to include justifications for each recommendation to consolidate or realign specific facilities and services including associated costs and savings estimates in addition to providing the report to the congressional committees the report would be published in the federal register allowing 45 days for public comments and written objections to the recommendations contained in the report sixty days after the close of the pub lic comment period the faa administrator would be required to submit sec ond report to the congressional oversight committees detailing the administrators recommendations for consolidation and realignment along with copies of any public comments and objections received the statute would bar the administrator from implementing any consolidation or realignment of facilities or services until th is report is submitted however once the report is submitted this does not otherwise limit the administrators authority to initiate proposed actions or requi re that these actions be s ubject to any further review partnerships for next generation technology deployment one option under consideration is to allow private sector investment in communications navigation surveillance nd other services provided within the context of the national airspace system for example under such provisions telecommunications providers may opt to ploy technologies to augment incockpit air traffic surveillance capabilities and datalink weather and other flightrelated information to airborne aircraft under such scheme these providers may be able to offer certain feeforservice capabilities to aircraft to augment core set of required aircraft communica tion navigation and surveilla nce capabilities another option being considered is to allow for airport ownership nd control of certain communications navigation and surveillance equipment that has been historically acquired deployed and ma intained by the faa faa proposal in the faa proposal the admin istration has offered language addressing these various proposals sp ecifically language in the faa proposal would permit nongovernment entities to provide communications navigation surveillance or other services to the extent that such arrangements would improve safety and efficiency reduce regulatory burdens on system users encourage competition make these services available to the largest feasible number of users and take into consideration the unique role served by general aviation further ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs51 provision of the bill proposes that pilot pr ogram be established at up to ten large or medium hub airports under which the faa w ould transfer without cost ownership of terminal area navigation equipment to the airport the partic ipating airport would in turn be responsible for operation and maintenance of the equipment under this pilot program airports woul d be required to agree that they would maintain the equipment according to faa standards allow the faa to conduct periodic inspections and upgrade facilities and equipment when they become obsolete airports would be permitted to recoup costs associated with operating and maintaining such equipment through pfcs and pilot program airports would be authorized to impose pfc of up to 7 1 greater than the proposed pfc maximum level another proposed pilot program outlined in the faa proposal would be established to promote airport acquisiti on and deployment of automated dependent surveillance broadcast adsb ground st ations to supplement the faas own acquisition of these facilities see adsb support pilot program above under the pilot program airports would be eligible to receive aip grant money to fund the acquisition and installation of adsb ground equipment even though it is acknowledged that such equipment is not airportspecific th faa envisions ads b technology through which aircraft could transmit their precise position direction of flight and speed to ground sta tions and other aircraft as potential replacement for radar as the primary means for air traffic surveillance and control the faa also views adsb as possible safety system for improving pilot situation awareness of air traffic thereby mitigating the risk of midair collisions particularly among general aviation aircraft while such provisions may expand faas options and flexibility with regard to deploying and maintaining next generati on air traffic equipment these approaches may raise operational issues regarding ow nership and operational control of these facilities which are anticipated to be networked and highly integrated into the ngats these provisions may also raise liability issues regarding cases of equipment failures and fa ilures to perform to t echnical specifications s 1300 s 1300 includes the language from the administration proposal regarding the pilot program for airport takeover of certain navigation facilities the adsb support pilot program and the provision allowing nongovernment providers to provide communications navigation surv eillance or other rvices to airspace users in addition to these provisions s 1300 requires that within 90 days of enactment the faa submit report to its congressional oversight committees detailing progress on impleme nting adsb ground stations and plans and schedules for disseminating advanced operational procedures usin g adsb and adsb airto air applications additionally s 1300 would require the f aa to issue guidelines and regulations regarding requirements for adsb avionics equipage including schedule indicating when certain types of aircraft would be required to install such equipment the expected costs to operators and the expected uses and benefits operators will derive from these avionics the faa would be required to issue this guidance and rulemaking within one year of enactmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs52 s 1300 would also impose requirement designed to accelerate the faas operational certification and disseminati on of improved instrument approach capabilities using advanced precision navigation capabilities using satellitebased navigation technologies the bill specifies that the faa should set target of adding 200 additional precision approach proc edures known as required navigation performance or rnp procedures each fis cal year through fy2012 the provision further specifies that the fa should set goal of 25 of the target number or at least 50 procedures per year meeting the cr iteria for use in low visibility conditions the provision would also allow the faa to authorize third parties to design flight check and implement rnp procedures hr 2881 hr 2881 authorizes the creati on of publicprivate partnership that includes university component with si gnificant aviation expertise in air traffic management simulation mete orology and engineering and aviation business to serve as an airportbased testing site for existing ngats technologies the provision stipulates that the testing site should serve mix of both commercial and general aviation traffic also provisi on of the socalled managers amendment agreed to by the house and incorporated into hr 2881 would establish nextgen research and development center of exce llence the center would be responsible for leveraging the faas centers of exce llence program program that relies on several university c onsortia to address ongoing f aa research and

educational technical and an alytical assistance to the faa and other agencies involved in ngat s development such as nasa and the dod to aid in the research nd development of ngats technologies hr 2881 also includes language that would require the faa to establish process for including certain faa employees selected by their respective collective bargaining units that are likely to be impacted by the ngats development and other modernization initiatives in the planning development and deployment of atc modernization projects this may include air traffic controllers and airway system specialists that maintain atc infrastructure who have expressed concern that they have not been adequately included in the planning nd conceptualization of ngats and in the development of other modernization initiatives these employees would serve in collaborative advisory capacity and in addition to regular compensation and benefits would receive travel and per diem expenses in accordance with faa travel policies while serving in this capacity hr 2881 would also require the faa to prepare report on the program and schedule for integrating adsb into the national airspace system the report is to include detailed information on protections and contingenc ies that would be included in any faa contracts to cover the event of contractors default bankruptcy acquisition or other event that may jeopa rdize the uninterrupted delivery of adsb services the provision furt her specifies that any faa contract for adsb services contain contingencies requiring faa admin istrator approval of

system s 1300 section 313 appears to respond to the events involving natca and pass in 2006 the section would amend 49 usc 40122a2 to allow for the involvement of fsip if the administrator and

enforcement actions would have to be broug ht in the us district court for the district of columbia in addition section 601b would invalid ate any changes that were implemented by the faa administrator on and after july 10 2005 without the agreement of the exclusive bargaining representative the parties would be gove rned by their last mutual agreement until new contract wa s adopted thus section 601b would appear to have the effect of undoing the new contract that was imposed on june 5 2006 faa technical training and staffing with an aging workforce and an increasing percentage

inspectors within 18 months of enactment that is to be developed through consultati on with representatives of aviation safety inspectors and other interested parties the faa has had similar staffing model for air traffic controllers for some time however this model has been the subject of considerable scrutiny and cr iticism over the past few years in response to the faas strategy for handling

staffing needs in carrying out the study the national academy of sciences would be required to cons ult with faa labor groups the faa administrator and cami and consider human factors traffic activity and available technology and equipment in developing recommendations and cost and schedule estimates for the faa to develop an objective staffing standard the faa has maintained controller staffing standard for several years and has revised this standard in recent years to address pending controller rnover although the existing staffing standard has been criticized by faa labor organizations and by some members of congress hr 2881 would also require the faa to assess the adequacy of training programs for air traffic cont rollers and also study options for training graduates from collegiate training initiative cti programs and assess alternatives to training newly hired controllers from ch programs through the current training provided at the mike monr oney aeronautical center in oklahoma city ok hr 2881 also contains provision that would require the faa to carry out study of the front line manager staffing requirements in air traffic control facilities the study would address

as overarching issues behind much of the reform sought in the proposed faa reauthor ization however in terms of requested statutory changes specifically addressing system capacity and safety issues major provisions offered in the faas proposal ve focused on obtaining the authority to implement marketbased approaches to controlling congestion at selected high density airports specifically the faa propos seeks statutory authority to control congestion at certain airports through marketbased mechanisms such as slot auctions and peakperiod pricing the proposal would direct dot to study the appropriateness of marketb ased scheme at new yorks laguardia airport lga and if deemed appropriate would permit th airport operator the port authority of new york and new jersey to implement marketbased approach to controlling congestion the faa proposal also seeks to establish pilot program to evaluate marketbased mechanisms to relieve cong estion at up to 15 other airports s 1300 does not contain any provisions addressing this issue but does seek to increase the number of flights to and from washington reagan national airport which are tightly controlled through statutorily defined

medical service operations age limits for airline pilots unmanned aircraft operations and wake turbulence prediction detection and avoidance controlling congestion at new yorks laguardia airport statutory provision that set specific capacity controls in the form of slots at laguardia airport lga expired on january 1 2007 statutory slot controls at other airports had previously expired leaving

tank safety the safety of fuel tanks on transport category aircraft has been central safety concern for over ten years following the 1996 crash of twa flight 800 off the coast of long island ny recent technology adva nces in fuel inerting systems have led to the development of small lightweight fuel inerting pumps that extract oxygen from the air in fuel tanks replacing it with nitrogenrich mixture that greatly reduces flammability potentia lly mitigating future accidents like the twa flight 800 tragedy in may 2002 the faa announced an innovative lightweight prototype fuel inerting system33 this system unlike earlier versions used by the military weighs significantly less uses moving parts is more reliable and could be retrofitted into airplanes curre ntly in service at fraction of the industryestimated cost34 boeing is now shipping new aircraft from its factories with these systems already installed the faa has proposed an approach that w ould require passenger airlines to take such steps to reduce fuel tank flammability in their aircraft fleets over the next eight years the faa issued proposed rulema king in november 2005 to require that operators of large transport category airplanes used in passenger airline service take steps to reduce fuel tank flammability such as installing fuel inerting systems the proposed rule does not specifically require the fuel tank inerting systems discussed above for all passenger air liners but leaves the door open for alternative means of compliance the proposal seeks to set flammability exposure criterion for centerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs63 fuel tanks the proposed rule however does not require fuel tank flammab ility reduction for wing tanks as it only establishe s requirements for an aircrafts main fuel tank and would exempt allcargo aircraft the rule would require that retrofitting of the fleet be phasedin between 2009 and 2014 faa proposal the faa proposal does not in clude any legislative language addressing the issue of fuel tank safety s 1300 s 1300 specifies that later than december 31 2007 the faa is to issue final rule regarding the reduction of fuel tank flammability

tank safety pilot fatigue reducing accidents caused by fatigue acr oss all modes of transportation by establishing working hour limits for tr ansportation operato rs based on fatigue research circadian rhythms and sleep and rest requirements has been longstanding priority of the ntsb while existing federal regulations include flight time and rest requirements for flight crews that vary depending on the type of commercial flight operation being conducted thes regulations have often been criticized as not adequately reflecting scientific knowledge regarding human fatigue alertness and sleep needs in airline operations pilot organizations through collective bargaining have been able to negotiate schedules th at provide longer rest periods than the minimum required under faa regulations however there is still concern that airline pilots rest periods do not adequa tely account for the time associated with transportation to and from the airport and circadian disruption associated with crossing time zones over the course of trip however concern over pilot fatigue tends to be even greater for other commerc ial operators besides the airlines where there are less stringent regulatory requirements for flight time and rest requirements and fatigue issues are not typically addressed in pilot contracts to the extent that they are covered in contracts between major airlines and their pilots faa proposal the faa proposal does not include any specific language regarding the issue of pilot fatigue s 1300 s 1300 includes provision that would task the national academy of sciences with conducting study of p ilot fatigue the faa would be required to consider the studys findings and recomme ndations in rulemaking regarding flight time limitations and crew rest requirements however the provision does not specifically require the faa to propose an specific changes to existing flight time and crew rest regulations the provision does however require that the

accidents in this growing industry the national transpor tation safety board ntsb and other aviation safety experts are advocating the mandatory use of formal flight dispatch procedures and risk manage ment practices among helic opter air ambulance operators as well as mandatory installation of terrain warning systems on hems aircraft the ntsb also found that many air ambulance accidents occur when patients are not on board such as route to an accident s cene present regulations allow air ambulances to operate under less string ent set of rules with rega rds to weather minimums and pilot duty times when not carrying patients however the ntsb believes that air ambulance flights should operate under more stringent commerc ial operating rules at all times that medical pe rsonnel are carried on board35 faa proposal the faa proposal does not include any specific language addressing the safety of hems operations s 1300 s 1300 would require within 18 m onths of enactment that all hems operations comply with part 135 commerc ial flight operating regulations whenever medical crew is on board regardless of wh ether or not patient is on board the bill would also require the faa to

further background see crs report rl32960 age restrictions for airline pilots revisiting the faas age 60 rule by bart eliasairline pilot age restrictions since 1960 airlines have been prohibite d from using pilots age 60 and older on revenue passenger flights36 for most pilots this has translated into mandatory or forced retirement at age 60 the age60 ru as it is known in the industry has been controversial since its incepti on but has nonetheless withstood numerous reviews and legal challenges while it has been long acknowledged that the designation of age 60 as maximum in itself is arbitrary the predicate of the rule rooted in concerns over safety associated with gradual decline in mental faculties and gradual increased risk of incapacitation with advancing age has been generally accepted recent changes however have prompted action to modify this longstanding rule in the late 1990s the european join t aviation authority jaa adopted rule allowing airline pilots flying multicrew aircraft to continue to serve up until age 65 provided that one of the pilots in the coc kpit on any given flight is younger than age 60 while not all european union member countries adopted this rule it nonetheless provided the impetus for international chan ge in november 2006 the international civil aviation organization icao adopted the european model as an international standard the age60 rule in the united states is nonetheless still considered an acceptable international practice because by limiting airline operations to pilots younger than 60 the united states maintains what is regarded as more conservative alternative from the standpoint of safety nonetheless the faa took recent action to review the age 60 rule in recognition of these changes in icao standards in september 2006 the faa organized an industry working group to examine whether the united states should alternativ ely adopt the new inte rnational standard while the working group did not reach consensus on this principal task the faa administrator announced that the faa w ould move forward with rulemaking to adopt the international standard allowing airline pilots to continue flying until age 65 based in part on the work of the committee the fair treatment for experienced pilots act pl 110135 in december 2007 congress acted on and the pr esident signed into law standalone legislation raising the maximum age for airline pilots to 65 immediately nullifying the longstanding age60 rule since december 11 2007 the date of enactment of the fair treatment for experienced pilo ts act pl 110135 pilots have been permitted to continue flying in airline service up to age 65 to maintain consistency with international standards the law specifies that one pilot in the cockpit must be under the age of 60 on international flig hts the law also requires periodic evaluations known in the industry as line checks to be conducted every six months to assess pilots over the age of 60 the law is not retroactive in the sense that it explicitly excludes the use of its provisions as basis for pilots that had reached the age of 60 prior to enactment to return to their former airline jobs the law however does not preclude pilots that had left th eir pilot jobs upon reaching age 60 from being hired as an air carrier pilot although the law excludes such pilots from regaininghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs66 any seniority status or long evity benefits based upon their prior airline service the law requires the gao to monitor and report on any impacts of this action on airline safety two years after enactment the passage of this legislation largely makes moot provisions in s 1300 and hr 2881 discusse d below that are similarly intended to increase the maximum age of air carrier pilots to 65 faa proposal while the faa has announced that it intends to change the regulations governing maximum age for airline pilots it intends to do this through the regulatory process and s not requested any legisla tive language in its proposed bill related to this issue s 1300 s 1300 includes provision that mimics the new international standard and would allow pilo ts to operate multicrew airc raft up to age 65 with the proviso that one of the required pilots be younger than age 60 on any given flight if adopted this provision would nullify the existing age 60 rule on the date of enactment the provision however prohibits any pilot who reached age 60 prior to the effective date of enactment from using this change as the basis for seniority claim for employment with an air carrier in other words the provision would prohibit pilots that had already reached age 60 prior to enactment but are younger than 65 from claiming any specific right or seniority privilege to return to the pilot position they previously held this howev er would not prohibit pilots between the age of 60 and 65 from being rehired by thei r former airline or gaining employment with another air carrier s 1300 would task gao with studying and reporting on whether this proposed change in the maximum airline pilot age has any impact on aviation safety after its implementation gaos report of its fi ndings would be due to the congressional oversight committees within two years of the date that the pr oposed change in maximum airline pilot age becomes effective hr 2881 hr 2881 contains provision that would have the same effect as the provision in s 1300 allowing pilots to fly in airline operations up to age 65 provided one pilot in the flight deck cr ew is under ag 60 but in cludes additional mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating pilots over 60 like s 1300 hr 2881 includes language stipulating that this provision is not retroactive unless the individual over age 60 on the date of enactment is employed as required flight deck crew member or is newly hired after ag 60 without any service credit or benefits given for prior employment with the airline hr 2881 explicitly states that pilots over age 60 shall not be subject to different medical standards unless the secretary of transportation determines that additional standards are needed to ensure an adequate level of flight safety the provision would however set in statute that first class medical certificates needed to conduct airline operations that are issu ed to pilots age 60 and older will expire after six months currently by regulation all first class medical certificates expire after six months and cannot be used for meeting the medical standards to fly as an airline pilot

that civilianuse uavs will rapidly transition to operational status and users will seek permission to fly uavs in all airspace throughout the united states in ll weather conditions the faa and other federal agencies face wide variety of complex issues related to integrating unmanned aircraft into the national airspace system nas including reliable technologies for detecting sensing and avoiding other aircraft radio frequency spectrum needs for unmanned aircraft opera tions technologies and procedures for systems safety and traini ng and certification require ments for unmanned aircraft operators on february 13 2007 the faa issued notice of policy on unmanned aircraft operations in the national airspace system that policy states that person may operate uas in the national airspace system without specific authority37 for military unmanned aircraft and unmanned aircraft operated by federal state or local governments the mechanism for such authority from the faa is through application for and receipt of certificate of waiver or authorization coa the faa has issued more than 50 such authorizations over the past two years mostly to the department of defense but also to other federal agencies such as customs and border protection cbp and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa for nongovernmental entities seek ing authorization to operate unmanned aircraft in the national airspace system special airworthiness certificate must be obtained from the faa the faa has indicated that at present it is only issuing experimental airworthiness certificates fo r unmanned aircraft by being designated as experimental these vehicles are restri cted to sparsely populated areas and away from routes used by manned aircraft as of february 2007 the faa had issued five such certificates to civilian organizations for unmanned aircraft research and development marketing and training however the faa is concerned that other civilian users have been operating commercial uavs under guidelines issued in the early 1980s that were intended to apply only to hobbyists or recreational user s of model aircraft those guidelines instruct such users to maintain altitude s lower than 400 feet above the ground select sites away from populated and noisesensitive areas give right of way to fullscalehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33920crs68 aircraft and advise airport operators and air traffic facilities if operating within three miles of an airport the faa statement of policy clarifies that these general guidelines alone are not sufficient for co mmercial operators of unmanned aircraft regardless of the size of such aircraft the faa did however indicate that it has undertaken safety review to deter mine whether certain small slowmoving unmanned aircraft could be safely operated under similar set of guidelines without requiring special airworthiness certificate at present all such aircraft except those flown by aircraft model hobbyists must obt ain special airwor thiness certificate as means of faa approval fo r uav flight operations faa proposal the faa proposal does not include any specific language addressing the issue of integrating

safety impli cations of variety of air carrier maintenance practices have been raised by some aviation safe ty experts and some members of congress two ove rarching concerns that have been identified are the safety of maintenance work outsourced to th irdparty repair stati ons especially repair stations located outside the united states and the use of noncertificated maintenance providers for routine and exte nsive repair work and faa oversight of these noncertificated maintenance providers faa proposal the faa proposal does not include any provisions specifically addressing air carrier maintenance practices s 1300 s 1300 does not include any provi sions specifically addressing air carrier maintenance practices hr 2881 with regard to airline mainte nance hr 2881 includes provision

complete required inspections of aircraft used in airline service air carriers woul d also be required to provide complete lists of their noncertificated maintenance provi ders whose activities would be restricted to nonroutine nonsubstantial maintenan ce and repair work under this provision the bill also adopts an amendment agreed to by the house that would extend the requirement for drug and alcohol testing programs to safetycritical positions at foreign repair stations working on air carrier aircraft or components drug testing programs are already required for safetyc ritical maintenance personnel working for airlines and repair stations servicing air carrier aircraft within the united states and this extension to foreign repair stations agreed to by the house was widely regarded as closing gap that could have potentia l safety implications implementation and oversight of such requirement however may be complicated by specific privacy laws and rights in foreign countries that may limit the faas authority to impose drug and alcohol testing programs at fac ilities located in other c ountries that are comparable to existing programs in the united states occupational safety and

implementing the air tour act57 the report concluded that the delay has limited the ability of tour operators to make major business decisions gao identified four areas to improve implementation including amendment of the air tour act to give the agencies discretion in determining which park units may need atmps faa proposal the faa proposal included several suggested changes affecting commercial air t ours over park units codified in 49 usc 40128 that seek to expedite and streamline agency actions in part due to the difficulty in completing atmps one change would allow that in lieu of an atmp the nps director and faa administrator hereafter in this section the administrator could enter into voluntary agreement with commercial air tour operator that would govern commercial air tours over park unit an agreement would address protection of park resources and visitor use of parks in the contex t of aviation safety it would be prepared with public review and consultation nd implemented without further administrative or environmental process the nps and faa heads could rescind voluntary agreement if it did not ad equately protect park resources visitor experiences or aviation safety second change would exempt park units with 50 or fewer annual air tour flights from th development of an atmp or voluntary agreement and other requireme nts covering air tour operations over park units however the nps director could disallow an exemption for any park unit for which an atmp or voluntary agreement would be necessary to protect park resources and values or park visitor use and enjoymen t these provisions on voluntary agreements and exemptions could be opposed as lesseni ng public participation in the decision making process and weakening environmen tal analysis of agency decisions other provisions in the faa proposal c ould provide more interim operating authority because interim conditions have prevailed for longer than had been anticipated one change would allow the agencies to modify interim operating authority for instance to allow more tours and another would allow new entrant air tour operators provided that certain conditions were met eg faa agreement of adverse impact on aviation sa fety these decisions could be made without further environmental process and thus also could raise objections as reducing environmental analysis of agency actions still another provision in the faa proposal would establish reportin g requirement for commercial air tour operators with regard to the number of air tours over park units and other data requested by the faa and nps s 1300 the senate committee on commerce science and transportation amended s 1300 to include section on commercial air tours over national parks the bill seeks to

secretary of the in terior hereafter in this section the secretary to waive the requirements regarding the development of an atmp and other requirements for park units with 100 or fewer annual air t our flights without further administrative or environmental process unless the secretary determines that an atmp is needed to protect park resour ces and values the secretary also could waive the requirements if an air tour operator enters into voluntary agreement with park unit to manage air tours over the park the purpose of the agreement would be to protect park resources and visito r experiences without compromising aviation safety it would require the approval of the secretary and the administrator an agreement could be rescinded by the secret ary if it does not ade quately protect park resources or visitor experiences and by the administrator if it adversely affects aviation safety or management of the national airspace system several provisions of the bill pertain to operating authority for instance one provision would allow the agencies to m odify interim operating authority without further environmental process provided certain conditions are met another provision would allow an air tour operato r that obtains operating authority for commercial air tours to transfer that authority to another air tour operator within 180 days of enactment the faa is to i ssue regulations allowing transfers of operating authority this provision may be directed at recent faa opinion that interim operating authority is not transferable on the grounds that transferability is not consistent with the provisions and overa ll goals of the air tour act interim operating authority was not in tended to be valuable ri ght to be bought and sold but temporary solution to allow continua tion of tours pending development of an atmp according to the faa58 further s 1300 would establish an annual reporting requirement for commercial air tour operators to include the number of air tours over the park any relevant characteristics of tours such as routes and altitudes and other information requested by the administrator and the secretary the administrator is to rescind the operating authority of any tour operator that fails to file report within certain time period the inspector general of the depar tment of transportati on is to audit the reports periodically the secretary would be authorized to assess fee on commercial air tour operators and is to consider the cost of developing atmps in setting the fee the administrator is to revoke the operating aut hority of tour operator that does not pay the fee within certain time period fees ve been charged at three park units with air tours based on criteria in exis ting law in may 2006 gao concluded that expanding the fee to other park units coul d generate additional revenue for the park service but would require legislative change and should be evaluated in the context of

cooperating authority the bill would authorize 10 million to the secretary for the deve lopment of atmps hr 2881 hr 2881 is quite similar but not identical to the faa proposal airline industry issues wide array of aviation industry issues are being considered in the context of faa reauthorization modifications to th essential air service eas program that provides subsidy incentives to airlines for servicing small rural or otherwise isolated communities are contentious as the faa propos seeks to set more stringent criteria for participation whereas s 1300 and hr 2881 seek increased funding and other program enhancements also hr 2881 s eeks to clarify foreign ownership issues related to operational control of us flag airlines central issue for potentially expanding open skies arrangements

employees engaged in airline operations placing other employ ees under the terms of the national labor relations act nlra these issues are further discussed below the essential air service program the faa proposal includes language th at would significantly modify the existing essential air service program eas dotmanaged program that subsidizes air carrier service to small and isolated communities primarily by setting more stringent criteria for program eligibility and restricting further expansion of the program some modifications to the eas program are also likely to be considered by the house and the senate the eas program provides subsidies to air carriers for providing service between selected small communities and hub airports the prog ram was originally established in 1978 as part of airline dere gulation to ensure minimum level of air service to smaller communities that mig ht otherwise lose service because of economic factors as part of its annual budget recommenda tions over the last few years the bush administration has suggested limiting ea s funding to 50 million and requiring local costsharing as condition for co mmunitys continued participation in

suggesting that the incentives themselves may need to be reconsidered if they are to be effective vision 100 also included somewhat controve rsial provision that created trial program that would have required community financial partic ipation as condition for continued access to eas funding in some instances each annual appropriations bill since passage of vision 100 however has prevented the use of any appropriated funds to implement the costsharing trial program faa proposal the faa produced bill includes provisions to substantially modify the eas program primarily by setting more stringent criteria for program eligibility and restricting further expansion of the program specifically the faa proposal would limit participation to only those airports that were r eceiving eas subsidy on the date of enactment of reauthor ization legislation at present additional airports may enter into the eas program provided they previously had scheduled air carrier service as specified in statute61 the faa also proposes to eliminate from participation any airports located less than 70 highway miles from large or medium hub airport further the faa proposal would eliminate from the eas program any airports that are less than 210 miles from th nearest medium or large hub whose per passenger subsidy exceeds 200 the pr oposal also includes language intended to simplify the process involved in terminating air carrier service to an easeligible community the provisions in the faa proposal to modify the eas program may be particularly controversial because the program has historically been viewed favorably by congress particularly among members representing rural states and districts however from practical standpoint the pr ogram may be difficult to justify given that perpassenger subsidies are quite high for service to certain locations receiving service and airlines often have diffi culty filling seats on many eas routes therefore while provisions in the faa propos to restrict expansion of the program may be particularly controversial other options to increase eas program flexibility and alternatives to traditional basic eas service may be considered during congressional debate s 1300 s 1300 modifies the eas program primarily at the margin largely ignoring the administrations proposals mo st importantly the bill increases annual funding for the program it does this by continuing to link eas funding to overflight fee collections but instead of limiting funding from this source to 50 million annually it makes any additiona l fee collections available for the program as well in addition the bill raises the annual author ization of ppropriated fund portion of the eas funding scheme from 77 million to 83 million there are several additional eas provisions in the bill these include requirement that dot allow code sharing by eas participant airlines requirement that final order establishing mileage adjustment eligibility be extended until the

appropriations to 83 million the bill however does not reserve overflight fee collections in excess of 50 million for eas but instead splits eligibility between eas and the small community air service program hr 2881 like s 1300 encourages the use of financia l incentives and long term contracts as part of the eas program airline ownership existing law specifically limits nonus ow nership of united states certificated airlines62 these provisions are viewed by ma ny as exclusionary preventing all but limited foreign investment in the us domestic airline industry and absolutely preventing any real nonus control over an airlines business decisions these laws are seen by proponents of the industrys in ternationalization as major barriers to fully open international aviation market recent initiative by the bush administration to lift some of the existing ownership and control restrictions through the regulatory process was opposed by congress and ultimately abandoned by the administration recently concluded ope n skies agreement with the european union eu suggests that the discussion bout airline ownership and control issues could be reopened at some later date hr 2881
