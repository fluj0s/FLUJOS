division january 6 2005 abstract dynamic revenue estimating taking into account macroeconomic feedback eﬀects from the economy was initiated in the 108th congress with the ﬁrst analysis of the feedback eﬀect provided during consideration of the 2003 tax cut the eﬀects varied in magnitude and direction depending on the model used and have not yet been incorporated into oﬃcial estimates to do so would be diﬃcult given the lack of consen about model and behavioral speciﬁcations at present any analysis is provided to supplement oﬃcial estimateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs220201 joint committee

any analysis is provided to supplement official estimates this report will not be updated longstanding issue of estimating the ffect of tax cuts on economic output and incorporating these macroeconomic feedback effects into future revenue estimates became more prominent in the 108th congress for some years the joint committee on taxation jct had studied the issue1 and had moved toward developing economic models for dynamic revenue estimating official jct estimates incorporate microeconomic behavioral responses but keep aggregate output fixed when organizing for the 108th congress house rule requiring ch macroeconomic analysis to be provided for any tax bill consider ed in the house was adopted the first instance of the application of the house rule was during consideration of the 2003 tax cut hr 2 the jobs and gr owth tax relief rec onciliation act of 2003 although the joint tax committee provided an analysis2 significant range of resultshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22020crs2

that the direction as well as the magnitude of re sults is sensitive to number of economic assumptions issu have also been raised about the appropriateness of including macroeconomic feedback effects for revenue bills but not for spending bills the congressional budget office cbo had earlier in 2003 provided range of macroeconomic effects for the presiden ts fy2004 budget package which included spending as well as tax changes3 the revenue effects with feedbacks were not incorporated in the official scoring of the bill and the senate does not have requirement for macroeconomic analysis similar analysis was prepared for the fy2005 budget proposal4 states had also experimented with dy namic revenue estimatin g although only handful have develope d dynamic models california appears to be the only state that frequently performs dynamic analysis5 the underlying policy problems are several first to what extent should the feedback effects of revenues be used to assess the desirability of alternative tax revisions and what sort of feedback effects should be considered feedback effects of tax cut can include those arising from the short run economic stimulus where increased income results in offsetting revenue gains the effects of deficit finance which crowd out private investment and magnify the revenue costs and the supply side ffects primarily labor supply effects which could be positive or negative some have argued that demand side effects are not appropriate for inclusion is there sufficient evidence and sufficient consensus on the magnitude and direction of these effects economists have disagreements sometimes pr onounced about the appropriate models to use in providing macr oeconomic feedback effects thus far the approach of the joint tax committee and the congressional budget office has been to use range of different mode ls economic research has also produced significant range of empirical estimates for both demand indu ced stimulus effects on output and supply side effects some models produce resu lts that are heavily dependent on other unspecified policy decisions either legislativ or actions of the federal reserve board the range of models and results can produce estimates that vary not only in the magnitudes but the direction of feedback effects the cbo study of the presidents fy2004 budget package for example reported wide range of

of effects incl uded which of the four types of models were used and the behavioral responses the range of results in the cbo study would be even larger if further sensitivity analysis for s upply response were undertaken in particular such sensitivity analysis would probably cause larger additional costs rather than revenue offsets from feedback effects does the macroeconomic analysis of tax cuts but not of spending increases create more favorable environment for tax cuts than spending increases to stimulate the economy spending increases have similar or even larger effects in stimulating the economy in the short run does an estimate of revenue effects alone without considering related costs such as increased interest costs arising from increased debt cause difficulties in understanding the budgetary effect s of tax changes finally should feedback effects be incorporated into fficial scoring of costs of legislation there are also number of institutiona l and political considerations there is disagreement about the desirability of offi cially produced dyna mic revenue estimates supporters argue that such information is n eeded to evaluate tax legislation and is an important means of differentiating among diffe rent tax proposals critics fear that these estimates might eventually become part of official scores they are also concerned that political pressure by the majority party could be brought on preparing these estimates some critics are also concerned that the anal ysis will create bias in favor of tax cuts rather than spending or favor tax cuts fo r wealthy individuals some conservatives are also concerned that the practice will spread to spending programs and encourage too much spending6
