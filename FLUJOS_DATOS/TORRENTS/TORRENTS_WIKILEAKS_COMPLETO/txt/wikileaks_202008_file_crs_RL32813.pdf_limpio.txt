march 14 2005 aaron m flynn legislative attorney american law divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32813hardrock mining state regulation summary various state and federal laws play important roles in the regulation of mining activities mining for hardrock miner als on federal public lands is governed primarily by the general ning act of 1872 the gene ral mining act authorizes prospector to locate and claim an area believed to contain valuable mineral deposit subject to the payment of certain fees the general mining act does not however require payment of productionrelated royalty as is required for federal oil gas and other minerals governed by more recently enacted laws critics of the general mining act suggest that the lack of royalty payment serves as an unnecessary subsidization of the mining industry while proponent s of the current system suggest that it encourages investment in the domestic mining industry legislation has been introduced in previ ous congresses that would have required royalty payments but such provisions have not been enacted into law many states have enacted laws governing mineral rights and mineral development on stateowned nds of these laws those applicable to hardrock minerals on stateowned lands vary considerably unlike the comparable federal law however many states now provide for st ateowned hardrock mineral leases and authorize royalty and rental payment collection in addition to financial issues environm ental regulation of hardrock mining also varies significantly under federal and stat law significantly the federal surface mining control and reclamation act which requires certa in environmental remediation activities w ith respect to surface coal mining on federal and nonfederal lands is not applicable to hardrock min erals legislative proposals to address concerns related to hardrock mining environmental impacts and abandoned mine reclamation have been introduced in pa st congresses eg hr 2141 and hr 504 in the 108th congress but none have been acted into law in addition to federal regulation states are authorized to imple ment surface mining reclamation laws and many have chosen to regulate hardrock mining operations in addition to surface coal mining these laws vary from state to state but most apply equally to federal state and private lands this report provides survey of stat laws governing these abovementioned aspects of hardrock mining it is not m eant to serve as comprehensive description of each states regulatory program but instead provides an overview of the regulation of several specific activities associated with hardrock mineral development focusing on 1 state imposed royalty rates and rental charges for hardrock minerals on state lands and 2 reclamation and bonding re

in previous congresses to reform the general mining act in variety of ways including provi sions for royalty payments although such legislation has been enacted into law9 most states also have st atutes governing exploration and mining on state lands with laws ranging from singleparagraph authorizations to detailed regulation applying different standards to different minerals and land classifications this makes it difficult to describe common model for state mining regulation many states like the federal system outlined above provide separate re gulatory regimes for hardrock minerals and oil gas and coal unlike current federal law however many states now charge royalty fees associ ated with hardrock mineral production in addition to land use rental fees in some instances royalty and rental rates are specified by statute and in others such terminations are left to state administrative agencies state and federal law also regulate certain aspects of the environmental impacts caused by mining activities often regardle ss of whether such activities take place on federal state or private lands at the federal level multiple environmental laws will generally impact mineral development including the national environmental policy act10 the clean air act11 the federal water pollution control act clean water act12 the safe drinking water act13 the toxic substance
