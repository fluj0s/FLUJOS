industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31568plants patents and seed innovation in the agricultural industry summary agricultural research and seed distribution systems within the united states have become increasingly privatized pr ivate plant breeders have turned to the intellectual property system on the grounds that research and development expenses should be recovered intell ectual property laws allow i nnovators to appropriate the benefits of their inventions by excludi ng others from reproducing and selling the protected subject matter in recent years plant breeders have pursued intellectual property rights through three different statutes the patent act of 1952 allows inventors to obtain utility patents which pertain genera lly to technological products and processes the plant patent act of 1930 add itionally provides for plant patent s awarded for distinct and new varieties of plants that have been asexually reproduced finally the plant variety protection act pvp of 1970 provides for the issuance of plant variety protection certificates for new distinct uniform and stable plant varieties that have been sexually reproduced due to the overlap among these three statutes some legal uncertainty existed as to whether plant breeders could obtain multiple concurrent intellectual property rights in its 2001 decision in jem ag supply inc v pioneer hibred international inc the us supreme court confir med that an innovative plant may be awarded utility patent even though it may also be subject to protection under one of the plantspecific statutes response to the jem v pioneer decision has been mixed some observers believe that by enacting more specific gislation for plant innovation the intent of congress was to foreclose utility patent protection for such inventions in addition some commentators have asserted that the possibility of utility patents for seed bearing plants effectively eliminates certain pvpa provisions that favor farmers and scientific researchers others have been more favorably disposed towards this overlap between intellectual property regimes observing that the rights and responsibilities presented under the three statutes differ should congress have an intere st in legislating in this area variety of options are available if the availability of utility patents for plants is deemed sound then action need be taken alternatively if legislative activity is deemed prudent congress could impose new restrictions upon the subject matter eligible for utility patents introduce infringement exemptions within the utility patent statute or encourage the agricultural industry to velop guidelines on permissible uses of patented plant innovationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31568contents seed innovation in

nutritionally enhanced or generate increased yields are among the many examples of recent agricultural inventions1 an increasing number of these improvements derive from private investme nt in research and development as compared to governmentsponsored programs2 whether the research and development employs conven tional breeding methods or the latest biotechnologies agricultural research and development can be costly and timeconsuming3 firms that expend such resources upon ag ricultural research and development ordinarily seek to appropr iate the benefits of thei r innovation the problem of reaping the rewards of innovation is especi ally acute for plants many engineered plants are selfreplicating living entities that are distributed in large quantities they therefore present an easy target for copyists4 innovators have therefore turned to intellectual property for protection at pres ent at least three intellectual property regimes are available for plants utility patents

implications of the decision for intellectual property rights generally seed innovation in the united states in the early united states seed i nnovation was performed exclusively by individual farmers11 these farmers employed trad itional methods of screening and saving seeds that resulted in plants with superior properties selection for features such as faster growth larger seeds or sweeter fruits dramatically changed many domesticated plant species compared to their wild relatives12 intrafarm trade in seeds resulted in the selection of set of plants deemed suitable for largescale agricultural production13 in the early nineteenth century the us government began to assist farmers in obtaining more plant varieties secretary of the treasury william h crawford requested in 1819 that amba ssadors and military officers retrieve seed from around the world and supply that seed within the united states14 in 1839 commissionerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31568crs3 14continued

office by 1855 the patent office distributed on an annual basis one million pack ages of seeds to us farmers free of charge16 two laws enacted in 1862 increased the involvement of the federal government in seed innovation and distribution first congress established the us department of agriculture usda17 this legislation required the usda to collect new and valuable seeds and plants to propagate such as may be worthy of propagation and to distribute them among agriculturalists18 second the federal land grant act of 1862 established state agricultural colleges19 after the civil war the development and testing of new varietie s of domestic crop species wa s conducted by the land grant colleges in conjunction with the usda the resulting seeds were gratuitously distributed to us farmers20 as the nineteenth century progressed private seed companies emerged that began to supplant the government as th principal source of seed innovation and distribution21 although the reasons for this tr ansition are complex commentators have pointed to the increasing scientif ic understanding of plant biology as one contributing cause advanced plant br eeding techniques involved increasingly sophisticated equipment and scien tific expertise beyond the capabil ities of most farmers22 in addition in the words of secr etary of agriculture james wilson the usda seed distribution

and through the world war ii era 25 as the industry grew so did the number of techniques available to develop new seeds and plant varieties26 through hybridization27 breeders were able to obtain progeny that are genetically stable and tend to be more productive than either of the parents the science of cytogenics the branch of genetics that studies cellular co mponents concerned with heredity has allowed breeders to cross plants of distantly related species28 wild grass may provide diseaseresistant genes to new wheat variety for example breeders have also employed tissue culture techniques through which cells tissues and whole plants are grown under sterile conditions tissue culture techni ques allow scientists to reproduce varieties of ma ny crops from single cell29 additionally various laboratory techniques have provided opportunities for inducing mutations which serve as the basis for new crop varieties30 today wellknown method for developing new plants is biotechnology the techniques of biotechnology allow for th transfer of genes between species31 the result has been genetically modified or transgenic crops such crops may feature beneficial traits including resistance to herbicides insects viruses or bacteria or enhanced consumer characteristics such as longer shelflife or higher nutrient content critics of this technology have also emerge d however citing among other concerns potential detrimental effects to human and animal health and the environment32 until relatively recently the seed industry was characterized by small independent and often familyowned firms33 this industry structure began to change rapidly in the 1970s mergers and buyout s often from companies with interests in chemicals food processing or other fiel ds led to consolidation within

united states36 through the university system agricultu ral experimental st ations and other programs state and federal g overnments continue to play role in seed innovation private firms now serve as the primary source of innovation in the modern seed industry however37 such firms rationally seek to obtain return on their investment in research and development in the case of plant research and development appropriating the benefits of innovation can be pa rticularly challenging38 many plants are selfreplicating living entitie s that are often distributed in large quantities39 detection of copying can also prove difficult for biological entities experience suggests that misappropriated plan ts may simply be sold under different name in the plant trade than the name under which it was originally marketed40 in order to recover the expenses asso ciated with research and development private plant breeders have turned to the intellectual property system intellectual property laws allow innovators to appropriate the benef its of their inventions by excluding others from reproducing and sellin g the protected subject matter this exclusive position may allow the patent proprietor to charge supracompetitive price for limited period of time as result the patentee may be in position to recover the expenses associated with innovation and earn profit41 in recent years plant breeders have pursued intellect ual property rights through th ree different statutes the patent act of 1952 the plant patent act of 1930 and the pl ant variety protection act of 1970 this report reviews these

arise automatically inventors must prepare and submit applications to the uspto if they wish to obtain utility patent protection43 uspto officials known as examiners then ssess whether the application merits the award of utility patent44 in deciding whether to approve utility patent application uspto examiner will consider whether the submitted application fully discloses and distinctly claims the invention45 the examiner will also determine whether the invention itself fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent act of 1952 to be patentable an invention must be useful novel and nonobvious the requirement of usefulness or utility is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides tangible benefit46 to be judged novel the i nvention must not be fully anticipated by prior patent publication or other knowledge within the public domain47 nonobvious invention must not have been readily within the gr asp of person of ordinary skill in the technical field in which the invention arises judged at the time the invention was made48 if the uspto allows the utility patent to issue the proprietor obtains the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the patented invention49 these rights are not selfenforcing patentee bears responsibility for monitoring its competitors to determine whether they are using the patented invention or not pa tent proprietors who wish to compel others to observe their intellectual property rights must usually commence litigation in the federal courts the maximum term of

plants via utility patents section 101 of the patent act of 1952 s tipulates that process machine manufacture or composition of matter may be the subject of utility patent51 the statute neither expressly includes nor exclude s plants or any othe r biological subject matter nonetheless certain doctrines developed by the courts traditionally led to difficulties in procuring utility patents on plants in particular the requirements that plant inventors provide complete written descriptions of their inventions along with the product of nature doctrine were seen as posing obstacles52 under the patent act of 1952 each utility patent is required to disclose the protected invention so that skilled individuals can readily practice it53 f r mechanical electrical or chemical technologies diagrams or textual illustrations may fully convey the workings of the patented machine compound or circuit this technique may be less effec tive for plants because drawing or written description is often not enough an actua l sample of plant is needed in order to reproduce it the product of nature doctrine arises from judicial precedent stating that naturally occurring substances discovere d in the wild may not be patented54 suppose for example that metallurgist unearths mineral that was not previously known to exist longstanding case law tablishes that utility patent cannot claim the mineral itself however significant ar tificial changes to product of nature may render it patentable55 to continue the hypothetical suppose that the metallurgist discovers that certain compounds within th mineral have valuable heatresistant properties she then deve lops purified form of these compounds utility patent may be awarded claiming the isolated compounds the distinction between products of natu re and artificial i nventions may seem clear at first glance difficulties have arisen however with respect to organisms that have been modified through biotechnolog or more traditional techniques even though living invention was extensivel altered from its natural state through human intervention some have viewed the organism as product of nature outside the patent system for many years the written

specialized statutes the plant patent act in 193056 and the plant variety protection act of 197057 to provide intellectual propert rights for plants however two developments subsequent to those statutes confirmed the availability of utility patents for plants first the uspto has provided another mechanism for plantrelated inventions to fulfill the written description requirement inventors are allowed to deposit plant samples in national public depository nd refer to this deposit in their patent applications58 the uspto has stipulated that in order to meet the pertinent legal requirements the selected depository must be under an obligation to maintain the plant in permanent collection and to s upply samples to anyone seeking them once the patent issues59 second legal developments at the us supreme court rendered the product of nature doctrine of less signif icance to artificially modified organisms in 1980 the courts decision in diamond v chakrabarty held that genetically engineered microorganism could be patented60 in that case the supreme court reviewed uspto decision rejecting patent application claiming an artificially generated bacterium the uspto had earlier ruled that living things could not be subject to protection under the utility patent statute the supreme court reversed the uspto decision the court reasoned that the utility patent statute was drafted in broad terms including manufacture and composition of matter that encompassed the artificial bacterium for which patent was sought61 the court further rejected the argument that because genetic technology was unknown at the time the 1952 patent act was enacted congress could not have intended that artificial organisms be the subject of utility patents the court instead concluded that congress used broad language to define the scope of patentable subject matter precisely becau technological dvances often produce unforeseeable inventions62 following diamond v chakrabarty the uspto concluded that plants and plant parts could also be subject to utility pa tent protection in 1985 the uspto board of patent appeals and interfe rences held that plants s hould be considered

townsendpurcell plant patent act in 193065 congress addressed both of these concerns the plant patent act expre ssly stated that the work of plant breeders could be the subject of new form of in tellectual property right the plant patent plant patents were further subject to relaxed written description requirement the written description of plant patents need only be as complete as is reasonably possible66 plant patents may issue for distinct and new varieties of plants that have been asexually reproduced asexua l reproduction results in plant that is genetically identical to its parent typical asex ual reproduction techni ques include grafting budding the use of cuttings layering and other methods plants that are produced through seeds which involves sexual reproduction are excluded also excluded from the plant patent act are tuberpr opagated plants or plants found in an uncultivated state67 the acquisition and enforcement of plant patents is accomplished in manner very similar to utility patents plant patents are issued by the uspto provided that the novelty and nonobviousness re quirements are met applicants must submit an application featuring color drawings that disclose all the distinctive characteristics of the plant capable of visual representa tion if approved plant patent enjoys term of 20 years from the date of filing68 plant patents are infringed if another entity asexually reproduces the plant or uses lls or imports into the united states the plant so reproduced the uspto has i ssued approximately 13000 plant patents since 1930 including 584

variety protection certificates third intellectual property possibility for plants is the plant variety protection act or pvpa70 the pvpa provides for the issuance of plant variety protection certificates that act similarly to utility and plant patents plant variety protection certificates exclusively pertain to sexually reproduced plants however including most seedbearing plants fungi and bacter ia are ineligible for certification the plant must be clearly distinguishable fro m known varieties and stable in that its distinctive characteristics must breed true with reasonable degree of reliability71 key distinction between the plant pate nt and plant variety protection regimes is the manner in which the inventor has reproduced the protected plant asexual reproduction which results in plant geneti cally identical to its parent forms the basis of plant pa tent protection72 certification under th pvpa instead depends upon sexual reproduction which results in distinct plant that combines the characteristics of its parents73 an example illustrates this distinction suppose that invent or johnny peachpit cultivates unique orange tree growing in his orchard the tree bears seedless oranges of excellent color and taste peachpits nurturing of the tree is by itself insufficient to support plant patent and b ecause the tree does not reproduce sexually it is ineligible for pvpa certificate but if peachpit is able to reproduce the tree asexually through the use of budwood or other techniques then he would be able to pursue plant patent protection suppose further that peachpit experiments with soybeans eventually arriving at variety that grows well in cooler climates because soybeans reproduce sexu ally peachpit may be able to obtain plant variety certificate under the pvpa unlike utility and plant patents which are issued by the uspto plant variety protection certificates are administered by the usda74 to be entitled to certificate the plant must be new distinct uniform and stable75 although written description requirement exists in the pvpa applicants must submit 2500 seeds to the usda76 the pvpa does not impos nonobviousness

offering it for sale or reproducing it importing or exporting it or using it in producing as distinguished from developing hybrid or different variety therefrom79 an important difference between the utility and plant patents on the one hand and plant variety protection certificates on the other is the availability of two infringement exemptions under the pvpa the pvpa includes an exemption that broadly states that the use and reproducti on of protected vari ety for plant breeding or other bona fide research shall not constitute an infringement80 in addition the pvpa grants farmers the right to plant new crops of seeds descended from protected seeds that were legitimately purchased81 in contrast neither the utility nor the plant patent statutes contain these exemptions such activities may constitute infringements that may expose researchers and farmers to legal liability including damages and an injunction82 the usda has issued nearly 5000 plant variety protection certificates in total including 495 certificates in 200183 interfaces in intellectual property for plants the existence of three intellectual property statutes applicable to plant innovation has resulted in complex issues of interface between the plantspecific statutes and the utility patent system in particular experience has demonstrated that innovators have sought conc urrent protection of plan t innovation under the different regimes for example the innovator of seedbearing plant could possibly procure rights under all three statutes such an innovator could assert that the plant was useful novel and nonobvious and file utility patent app lication he could also demonstrate that the plant was new distin ct uniform and stable and therefore assert entitlement to plant variety protection certificate finally he could pr oduce cutting or otherwise asexually reproduce the pl ant and assert an entitlement to plant patent protection seedbearing plants are mo st commonly the subject of overlapping rights under the pvpa and the utility patent statute the significant legal distinctions between these statues appear to motivate innovators to seek multiple rights in contrast to utility patents plant

industry than the uspto which must interact with many sorts of inven tions and industries87 although plant variety protection certificat may be easier to obtain than utility patents they are generally viewed as providing less substantial rights88 seed replanting by farmers as well as experiment uses by scientific researchers are expressly declared not to infringe the rights afforded by plant variety protection certificate89 these acts would ordinarily constitute infringement under the utility patent statute90 as result some innovators of seedbearing plants view utility patent protection as even mo re valuable than the distinct intellectual property right specifically designed for such plants91 critics of this system of concurrent protection content that by enacting more specific legislation for plant innovation th intent of congress was to foreclose utility patent protection for such inventions92 in addition they assert that the possibility of utility patents for seedbearing plants effectively eliminates the infringement exemptions fo r research and seed repl anting available under the pvpa93 others were more favorably dis posed towards this overlap between intellectual

wrote the decision for the majority he initially observed that 101 of the 1952 patent act employed broad nguage including the words manufacture and composition of matter to define what subject matter could be subject to utility patent these terms include artificially generated plants and plant parts the majority reasoned the majority next rejected arguments that congressional enactment of specialized legislation evidenced the congressional intent that living plants could not be the subject of utility patents justi ce thomas found specifi c statement in the legislative history of the

observed that the uspto had assigned utility patents for many years without objecti on from congress or the usda justice thomas explained that in the face of these developments congress has not only failed to pass legislation indicating that it disagrees with the usptos interpretation of 101 it has even recognized the av ailability of utility patents for plants101 in support of this latter asser tion justice thomas cited 1999 amendments to the patent laws that appeared to acknowledge that utility patents could issue on seedbearing plants102 justice thomas also observed that partic ular legal or property interest is often the subject of multiple statutes for example computer software may qualify for protection under both the copyri ght and patent laws jus tice thomas concluded that merely because these laws may be of diffe rent scope does not suggest that some of them are inapplicable justice scalia wrote brief concurring opinion that agreed with the majority according to justice scalia the issue before the court had been settled by diamond v chakrabarty which held that living things may be the subject of utility patent103 justice breyer wrote dissenting opinion that justice stevens joined104 justice breyer believed that congre ss intended the two plantspecific statutes to exclude protection under the utility patent statute justice breyer reasoned that allowance of broader utility patents on plants would effectively override the more narrowly tailored rights under the pl ant patent act and pvpa105 justice breyer also distinguished diamond v chakrabarty from the current case according to justice brey er the bacteria at issue in diamond v chakrabarty was not plant within the meaning of eith er the plant patent act or the pvpa as result justice breyer concluded that diamond v chakrabarty had not addressed the issue of whether utility patents were av ailable for subject matter protectable under the plant patent act or pvpa106 the supreme court decision in jem

same manner as other inventions commentary on the jem v pioneer decision that utility patents offer plant breeders greater proprietary rights than plant patents or plant variety prot ection certificates is uncontroversial disagreement has arisen however over the propriety of the jem v pioneer holding and its effect upon the agricultural industry critics of the supreme courts opinion argue that allowing utility patents to issue on seed will harm research and development promote industry concentration and limit the tr aditional right of farmers to save seed in contrast other observers find these concerns overstated and believe that limited intellectual property rights for plants would negatively impact the agricultural industry critics of the jem v pioneer decision contend that the availability of utility patents will diminish access to the number of plant breeders for research joseph mendelson iii legal director for the international center for tec hnology assessment and the center fo r food safety asserts that agriculture involves the screening and manipulation of the genetic components of plants the larger the pool of genetic resources according to

and raw materials107 other studies have echoed these concer ns forum at the national academy of sciences provided among others the following account even when ownership of technology is not in doubt academic researchers sometimes find they are shut out from using inventions whose rights are controlled by private companies at iowa state university for example plant breeders have been rebuffed couple of times when they approached company about licensing technology we were refused even though the company is licensing to many other companies said patricia swan vice provost for research and advanced studies at iowa state university the company indicated that it did not want to license to us because it did not believe that unive rsities were capable of managing and looking after the

protection certificates tr ade secrets or other techniques critics have also asserted that the ava ilability of utility patents on plants has promoted consolidation within the seed industry110 these observers believe that many recent corporate mergers were motivated by desire to acquire control of proprietary genetic ma terials in addition critics cl aim that utility patents on plants place barrier to entry into the seed industry according to these commentators dominant firms with entrenched patent portfolios now enjoy increasing control over access to genetic materials research pathways and seed prices111 detractors of jem v pioneer further argue that th availability of utility patents on seed w ill limit the trad itional right of farmers to save seed112 farmers have long gathered seed from their own harvest to replant trade or sell utility patent protection allows innovative seed companie s to condition the sa of seed upon farmers agreement not to replant descenda nts of the purchased seed if farmers disregard this restriction they could be subject to charges of patent infringement in contrast to these critics other observers believe that seeds are appropriately the subject of utility patents some commentators believe that utility patents will best encourage research and development in biotechnology by providing intellectual properties commensurate with protection available in ot her fields of endeavor113 further if less rigorous intellectual property rights are available for plants than for other types of innovations it is argued that some actors may shift their research and development efforts away from plan ts and into other technologies114 commentators further observe that if plant innovations are excluded from the utility patent system

productive maintaining trade secret may require ex pensive security measures for example further unlike the subject matter disclosed in an issued patent instrument the subject matter of trade secret is not circulated to the general public as result others cannot use this information to generate add itional innovation118 other experts observe that the utility patent statute and the pvpa are not overlapping because they present different sets of rights and responsibilities the utility patent statute imposes th written description and nonobviousness requirements for example while the pvpa does not as explained by mark janis member of the university of iowa college of law the pvpa requires relatively lowquality disclosure as compared to the utility patent regime and in exchange confers relatively lowlevel protection as compared to the utility patent regime119 as the statutes are not wholly duplicative professor janis belie ves there is reason to restrict plant breeders to one regime or another120 supporters of the jem v pioneer decision also point to experience suggesting that patent attorneys are sometimes able to circumvent restrictions on patenteligible subject matter through the artful drafting of patent applications121 these drafting techniques focus upon one part of each utility patent the specific definitions of the patented invention known as the claims each utility patent application and resulting granted utility patent instrument must contain one or more claims122 in order to maximize their scope of protec tion most utility patents contain multiple claims that define the inve ntion in different ways given the ability of patent attorneys to draft variety of claims utility patent directed towards plant may have number of claims in addition to the plant as

breeders might still be able to obtain substantial intellectual property protection through the utility patent system legislative issues and options the jem v pioneer decision confirms the current uspto practice of allowing utility patents to issue on seeds competing views have arisen as to the propriety of this practice and its impact upon the agricultural industry should congress have an interest in legislating in this area variety of options are available if the availability of utility patents fo r plants is deemed sound then action need be taken alternatively cong ress could impose new restrictions upon the subject matter eligible for utility patents the utility patent statute might specify that plants or plant varieties ar not eligible for protection124 another option is to compel inventors to make an exclusive choice am ong one of the three intellectual property options under this system plant breeder could obtain either utility patent plant patent or plant protection certificate but not two or three of these intellectual properties another option would be to introduce an experimental use exception in the utility patent statute125 such an exception could be specific to plants in the manner of the existing provision within the plant variety protection act126 alternatively this legislation could be ge neral in nature the following provision introduced in the house of representatives in 1990 but not enacted is an example of general experimental use exception it shall not be an act of infringemen t to make or use patented invention solely for research and development purposes unless the patented invention has primary purpose of research or ex perimentation if the patented invention has primary purpose of res earch or experime ntation it shall not be an act of infringement to manufact ure or use such invention to study evaluate or characterize such invention 127 legislation pending before the 107th congress appears to bear upon this possibility

research uses of patented plant inventions that the plant breeding industry deems appropriate129 it should be noted however that these voluntary guidelines would not necessarily bind all patent owners

the trips agreement allows wto members to exclude plants from the utility patent system if they have enacted specialized regime for plant variety protection with both plant patent s and plant variety protection certificates available the united states would be elig ible to take advantage of this exception article 27 of the trips agreement furthe r requires that patent rights must be enjoyable without discrimination as to th field of technology in addition article 30 of the trips agreement allows members to provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by pa tent provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with normal ex ploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the leg itimate interests of the pa tent owner taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties unless plantspecific experimental use exception is considered sufficiently limited to qualify under article 30 such provision could be judged to violate article

operty options in the plant breeding field plants will continue to be subject to utility patents plant patents and plant variety protection certificates developed empirical record attentive to the unique structure and climate of innovation of the agricultural industry may be the best mechanism for determining the preferred interface between intellectual properties in plant innovation the impact of jem v pioneer may be most immediately felt with regard to the plant variety protection regime as u tility patents offer more robust rights than plant variety protection certificates plant breeders might decline to seek plant variety protection certificates in favor of utility patents for their more commercially important inventions it is possible that the pvpa may be rele gated to secondary petty patent regime employed for inventions with less marketplace significance or for inventions that do not meet the more rigorous standards of the utility patent statute the pvpa may deserve renewed ttention to determine whether that statute remains responsive to the current needs of the agricultural industry supreme court approval of multiple intellectual property alternatives for plant breeders offers an additional lesson the boundaries between various federal intellectual property regime s have not always been sharply drawn innovators sometimes may obtain concurrent protection through overlapping intellectual property regimes as result proposed legal reform of one intellectual property alternative be it patent copyright trademark or related regime may wish to account for other options available to innovators in par ticular industries
