over time if output rises but quarterly gdp growth can be aﬀected by four diﬀerent factors and each of these factors has diﬀerent implications for policy and for general wellbeing figure 1 illustrates these factors graphically over the past two business cycleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34072g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and

fluctuations seasonal fluctuations changes in the business cycle and longterm structural causes policy can influence the latter two business cycles refer to the regular cyclical pattern of economic boom expansions and bust recessions recessions are characterized by falling output and employment at the opposite end of the spectrum is an overheating economy characterized by unsustainably rapid economic growth and rising inflation capital investment spending is the most cyclical component of economic output whereas consumption is one of the least cyclical government can temper booms and busts through the use of monetary and fiscal policy monetary policy refers to changes in overnight interest rates by the federal reserve when the fed wishes to stimulate economic activity it reduces interest rates to curb economic activity it raises rates fiscal policy refers to changes in the federal budget deficit an increasing deficit stimulates economic activity whereas decreasing deficit curbs it by their nature policy changes to influence the business cycle affect the economy only temporarily because booms and busts are transient in recent decades expansions have become longer and recessions shallower perhaps because of improved stabilization policy or perhaps because of good luck longterm growth receives less attention from policymakers than cyclical growth yet in broader view of history longterm growth is the more important of the two because it is the key to raising living standards long term growth is caused by increases in labor capital and productivity policy changes in the areas of education taxation competition basic research and infrastructure can influence the economys longter m growth rate but only at the margins long term growth has altered very little over most of us history despite broad array of policy changes that fact is less surprising when one considers that the main contributor to longterm growth is technological progress over which the go vernment has little direct influence in recent years longterm growth has accelerated modestly because of higher productivity growth driven mainly by what is popularly referred to as the information technology it revolution although the government had little direct influence over the it revolution it provided an environment in which those technological changes were allowed to thrive which likely explains why many other economies did not experience similar productivity acceleration this report will be updated as events warrant

increases in gross domestic product gdp may appear to be unambiguously good because income can only rise over time if output rises but quarterly gdp growth can be affected by four different factors and each of these factors has different implications for policy and for general wellbeing figure 1 illustrates these factors graphically over the past two business cycles the four factors listed by length of duration from transient to longterm are as follows random or onetime events some of the changes in quarterly growth rates from quarter to quarter are not persistent and may have particular cause that can be systematically identified or predicted other changes are caused by onetime events that have lasting impact on the national economy such as the natural disasters that struck the economy in the fourth quarter of 2005 these disasters are widely credited with having caused below average growth in the fourth quarter of 2005 and above average growth in the first quarter of 2006 because of rebuilding random contributions to economic growth can be thought of as roughly the distance between the line labeled quarterly gdp growth in figure 1 and the line labeled business cycle as can be seen the distance between these lines is usually modest but at times can be large seasonal fluctuations economic activity fluctuates in predictable way over the course of the year for example agricultural output peaks at harvest time and consumption rises during the holidays since these seasonal fluctuations have lasting effect on the economy and do not offer any predictive information about the economys future path they are routinely stripped out of the data before it is used by the general public therefore seasonal effects are not shown in figure 1 business cycle effects over the course of several years the economy routinely experiences predictable pattern of boom expansion followed by bust recession followed by recovery that begins the pattern anew this can be seen in the line marked business cycle in figure 1 1 recessions are represented by the valleys that occur in the early 1990s and 2000s expansions are represented by the inclines after recession and peaks that occur later in the decades since the 1980s an entire cycle has taken about decade while the government cannot prevent cyclical fluctuations it can attempt to soften the booms and busts of the business cycle through monetary and fiscal policy structural growth in the long run economic progress is not driven by random seasonal or cyclical fluctuations it depends on an increase in labor and capital physical investment inputs and productivity improvements structural growth can be represented by the trend line in figure 1 which undergoes slight increase in the mid1990s that will be discussed later in the report over time the growth rates of these inputs and productivity vary but important lasting shifts occur infrequently microeconomic policy changes can foster faster growth in labor capital and productivity at the margin in addition government budget deficits can reduce the growth of the capital stock 1 the business cycle can be approximated using many different techniques figure 1 uses simple eight quarter moving average httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34072g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g9g155g152g160g157g145g561g138g151g141g561g157g145g142g561g4g158g156

determine the overall production of goods and serviceswhat is sometimes referred to as the supply side of th economy but in the short run growth can be influenced by the rate of overall spending also known as the demand side of the economy overall spending includes consumer spending business spending on capital goods government spending and foreign spending on us exports spending and production are equalized by prices because prices adjust gradually spending can temporarily grow faster or slower than the po tential growth rate of the supply side of the economy recessions are characterized by situation where spending is not growing fast enough to employ all of the economys labor and capital resources recessions can come to an end because government has used fiscal or monetary policy to boost spending or because spending recovers on its own when prices have gradually adjusted economic booms eventually give way to overheating which is characterized by situation where spending is growing too fast and labor capital and productivity cannot grow fast enough to keep up in this scenario faster economic growth can become too much of good thing because it is unsustainable overheating is typified by rise in inflationbecause there is greater demand for goods than

recession when in order to offset the rise in inflation monetary policy is tightened to reduce overall spending to the point where it is growing at the same pace as overall supply again in essence policymakers trade off lower rate of economic growth in the short run to achieve more stable and higher average growth rate over time although there is foolproof way to differentiate between changes in growth being caused by cyclical forces and structural forces movements in the inflation rate offer good indication when inflation is rising growth is probably above its sustainable rate because overall spending is growing too fast and when inflation is falling growth is probably below its sustainable rate because overall spending is too sluggish inflation is not perfect indicator of cyclical activity however because sudden spikes in the price of specific goods sometimes cause overall inflation to temporarily change v olatile energy prices are the prime example of when change in inflation may not correspond with the business cycle g7g150g153g149g152g162g150g142g151g157g561g138g151g141g561g157g145g142g561g4g158g156g146g151g142g156g156g561g5g162g140g149g142g561 just as rapid economic growth can be too much of good thing so too can rapid increases in employment and decreases in the unemployment rate as explained above the economys potential growth rate is determined by the growth rate of inputs to the production process such as labor when employment rises faster slower than the labor force grows the unemployment rate will fall rise with enough employment growth at some point all available labor will be utilized in the production process and this will happen before the unemployment rate reaches zero unemployment never reaches zero because some workers will always be in the process of leaving an old job and finding new one and some worker s will always be in the wrong place at the wrong time for the skills they have compared to the skills needed for local employment opportunities the rate of unemployment consistent with employment for all workers who do not fall into these two categories is known as the natural rate of unemployment or full employment or the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment nairu 2 if overall spending is growing rapidly enoug h unemployment can be temporarily pushed below the natural rate when unemployment is pushed below the natural rate too many jobs will be chasing too few workers causing wages to rise faster than productivity but wages cannot persistently rise faster than productivity because again overall spending cannot grow faster than production assuming labors share of income remains constant wages can temporarily rise faster than productivity but the result would be rising inflation in recessions the process works in reverse because spending is insufficient to match potential production businesses lay off workers this causes the unemployment rate to rise above the natural rate as unemployment rises workers moderate their wage demands in order to find scarce jobs or keep existing jobs as result inflation falls g10g146g156g157g152g155g146g140g138g149g561g18g138g157g157g142g155g151g156g561 as

recessions those beginning in 1973 and 1981 were unusually long the 1981 recession followed brief recession that had ended year earlier these two recessions are sometimes referred to collectively as the double dip recession from 1945 to 1981 there were eight recessions since 1982 there have been only two of course the complement of less frequent recessions is longer expansions since world war ii there have been three very long expansions occurring in the 1960s lasting 106 months 1980s 92 months and 1990s 120 months the historical record the current expansion which began in november 2001 may eventually turn out to be long one as wellthrough june 2007 it was already the fourth longest since world war ii the pattern of longer expansions and less frequent recessions that has prevailed since the 1980s expansion has been dubbed the great moderation by economists research has demonstrated statistically that there has been fundamental change in the economys behavior since the mid 1980s not only has the business cycle been smoother random fluctuations in growth have also been smaller since then economists have three hypotheses for what has caused the great moderation change in the structure of the economy better policy notably monetary policy or simply better luck 3 t able 1 recessions since w orld w ar ii period of c ontra ction months of ction cumulative ction in gdp maximum

business cycle and peoples expectations are not always rational john maynard keynes described the cause as animal spirits or peoples tendency to let emotions particularly swings from excessive optimism to excessive pessimism influence their economic actions for example businesses make investment decisions based on their projections of future rates of return which will depend on future sales and so on these inherently uncertain projections change as current conditions change if businesses believe 3 for more information see crs report rl33959 why has the economy become less volatile by

make investments today reducing the growth rate of gdp from what it otherwise would have been likewise households may postpone purchases of durable goods or housing if economic conditions look unfavorable peoples projections of the future may be overly influenced by the present or recent past economic shocks also play dominant role in the business cycle shock refers to any sharp and sudden change in economic circumstances on the demand or supply side of the economy that disrupts the steady flow of economic activity well known example are energy shocks when the price of energy suddenly rises it disrupts both production because energy is an important input to the production process and consumer demand because energy products account for sizeable portion of consumer purchases 4 other prominent shocks include natural disasters global events that influence foreign trade financial market unrest and so on sudden change in expectations that affects consumer or investment spending can also be thought of as shock to aggregate demand since these shocks are typically unpredictable the business cycle remains unavoidable

consumers decide to spend less and recoveries to revival in consumer spending as seen in figure 2 this view is not very accurate consumption is actually one of the most stable components of spending while its growth rate falls in recessions its growth rate usually stays positive and always falls by less than overall gdp growth which suggests that causation typicall runs from growth to consumption fixed investment is actually the most volatile component of spending as seen in the figure it undergoes larger declines than gdp during recessions and bigger booms than gdp during expansions figur 2

inventories are another component of gdp that play an important role in the business cycles buildup in inventories may result from lower sales than businesses had expected when this occurs businesses may have to work off the inventory buildup before they begin to produce again thereby prolonging downturn if businesses have become more adept at managing inventories thanks to just in time inventory management it may help to explain why recent recessions have been briefer and shallower the trade balance is typically countercyclical helps soften the business cycle all else equal representing the gap between saving and investment the trade deficit would be expected to decline in recession since investment would be exp ected to fall as share of output thought of differently the trade deficit would also be expe cted to decline since the growth consumption of imports would fall as overall consumption growth fell less foreign capital would be attracted to the united states causing the dollar to fall and exports to rise in the 19901991 recession the trade deficit fell but in the most recent recession it rose contrary to what theory predicted however national saving did not rise in the 2001 recession as theory predictedit fell more rapidly than investment the largest cause of the fall in national saving at the time was the increase in the federal budget deficit

standard of living today compared to 100 years ago or 200 years ago an argument can easily be made that longterm growth trumps shortterm fluctuations in importance 5 in recession boosting shortterm growth is mainly question of finding ways to stimulate overall spending so that the economy operates at its productive capacity in the long run concerns about matching the level of spending to the productive capacity of the economy are irrelevant because it will happen on its own instead longterm growth depends on increasing the economys productive capacity the economys productive capacity can be boosted in only two waysby boosting the economys inputs or by using existing inputs more productively inputs take the form of labor and physical capital investment in plant and equipment 5 for more

primarily on population growth although changes in employment patterns such as the entrance of women into the workforce can also be important at times higher longterm employment will lead to higher gdp but not necessarily higher living standards because living standards are determined by per capita gdp if the workerpopulation ratio stays constant as the population increases then the increase in the numerator gdp will be canceled out by the increase in the denominator population increases in employment can increase living standards only if the employmentpopulation ratio increases but this ratio is relatively stable in the long run since working age individuals have high and stable employment rates the coming decades could see decline in the employment population ratio caused by the aging of the population

increases in the capital stock increase gdp because to take the simplest example worker who has more equipment to use can produce more over fixed time once an environment has been created where investment is profitable the primary factor determining how quickly the capital stock can grow over time is the national saving ratereal resources are needed to finance capital investment and these resources are only available to invest if they are saved rather than consumed 6 saving is transformed into investment through financial intermediation national saving comes from three sources households businesses and the government when the government runs budget deficit it has negative saving rate that reduces the resources available to finance investment spending7 interest rates equilibrate saving and investmentwhen saving becomes scarcer interest rates rise which causes investment to fall as previously profitable investment projects become unprofitable at higher borrowing costs in recent years national investment has greatly outstripped national saving and the united states has had to borrow from foreigners to bridge the gap the only way to borrow from foreigners is by running trade deficit as the saving rate has fallen the trade deficit has risen alleviating upward pressure on interest rates since trade deficits in recent years have been large enough to increase foreign indebtedness faster than gdp is increasing the current pattern by definition cannot persist indefinitely at some point in the future although there is consensus how soon the trade deficit will have to decline either through rise in national saving or decline in investment 8 as seen in figure 3 fixed investment spending as share of gdp fell below its postwar average in the early 1990s but rose above average in the late 1990s contributing to the high gdp growth rates of that period beginning in the 2001 recession investment spending declined as share of gdp it began rising again in 2003 but has still not reached the levels of the late 1990s the case can be made however that when considering the effect of investment spending on gdp growth 6 for more on saving see crs report rl33112

production gdp will increase less all else equal in addition there are natural limits to how much labor inputs both hours worked and the labor force participation rate can be increased and the united states may already be operating close to those limits this implies that longterm strategy to boost growth cannot rely solely on increasing inputs herein lies the importance of productivity growth even with fixed amount of labor and capital output can increase if inputs are used more productively productivity increases can be caused by efficiency gains better business practices technological innovations research and development or increasing the training or education of the workforce economists often refer to the latter as an increase in human capital since education can be thought of as an investment in skills its importance to productivity growth should not be underestimated since the creation and implementation of many technological innovations would not be possible without it in the long run productivity growth can be thought of as the main force driving increasing living standards this statement becomes intuitive when thinking of the goods and services available to the

growth alone but capital investment without productivity growth would not lead to sustained growth empirically the measure that corresponds to the definition of productivity described here is referred to as totalfactor productivity or multifactor productivity it cannot be measured directly since adjustments must first be made for changes in labor and capital inputs perhaps for this reason labor productivity which is measured by simply dividing output by hours worked is more popular and wellknown measure but because labor productivity can increase due to increases in the capital stock or efficiency gains it does not correspond directly to the conceptual notion of productivity growth as seen in table 2 there was significant acceleration in productivity growth in 1996 this acceleration reversed the productivity slowdown that lasted from 1974 to 1995 bringing it closer to the growth rate of 1949 to 1973 most economists believe that the information technology it revolution has been responsible for the productivity growth rebound there is more disagreement on whether the rebound will be permanent some economists argue that after the initial burst of innovation caused by greater processing power and the invention of the internet further innovation will be limited and the productivity boom will fizzle out other economists argue that the fruits of these technological breakthroughs will be longer lasting the fact that productivity growth continued to be strong after the 2001 recession certainly bolsters the latter argument but labor productivity growth has fallen

1974 to 1990 or 1991 to 2001 when multifactor productivity growth was smaller source of gdp growth in absolute and relative terms cbo projects that multifactor productivity will continue to be the most important source of gdp growth over the next ten years as the growth rate of the labor supply continues to decline the postworld war ii baby boom explains why labor supply growth increased in the 1970s as the babyboomers entered the workforce and has decreased since as the babyboomers have begun to retire because the growth in the labor supply is projected to decline further cbos projection

for two reasons first much of the increase in capital is replacing rather than supplementing existing capital that has depr eciated although replacement capital increases gdp which is not adjusted for

prudent stabilization policymaking regime that has evolved since world war ii is an important reason why the economy has become less cyclical and recessions have become shallower although better luck may have also played role the government has two tools at its disposal to moderate the shortterm fluctuations of the business cyclefiscal policy or monetary policy fiscal policy refers to changes in the budget deficit monetary policy refers to changes in sh ortterm interest rates by the federal reserve the government can use expansionary fiscal policy to boost overall spending in the economy by increasing the budget deficit or reducing the budget surplus if the increased deficit is the result of increased government spending aggregate sp ending is boosted directly since government spending is component of aggregate demand since the deficit is financed by borrowing from the public resources that were previously being saved are now being used to finance government purchases or production of goods and services if the increased deficit is the result of tax cuts aggregate spending is boosted by the tax cuts recipient to the extent that the tax cut is spent not

that were previously being saved are now at the disposal of the tax cuts recipient and to the extent that the recipient decides to increase his consumption aggregate spending will rise likewise if the government wished to reduce the growth rate of overall spending in the economy it could reduce the deficit called contractionary policy by raising taxes or cutting spending in which case the process would work in reverse as discussed above any boost in spending as the result of fiscal policy is temporary since spending cannot grow faster than the economys productive capacity in the long run the federal reserve can use expansionary monetary policy to boost spending in the economy by lowering the overnight interest rate called the federal funds rate the fed alters interest rates by adding or withdrawing reserves from the banking system lower interest rates increase interest sensitive spending which includes physical investment ie plant and equipment by firms residential investment housing construction and consumer durable spending eg automobiles and appliances by households to reduce spending in the economy the fed raises interest rates and the process works in reverse 12 expansionary monetary or fiscal policy will produce at best fleeting gains in output when the economy is operating at full employment expansionary policy works by boosting spending in order to bring idle labor and capital resources back into use when the economy is already near full employment there are few idle resources available so the boost in spending quickly bids up prices in labor and capital markets generating higher inflation and interest rates in the brief lag between the boost in spending and the higher inflation output might be temporarily boosted but the economy cannot function for long above full capacity g15g152g151g142g157g138g155g162g561g152g155g561g8g146g156g140g138g149g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g501g561 monetary policy plays the primary role in economic stabilization today and has several practical advantages over fiscal policy first economic conditions change rapidly and monetary policy is much more nimble than fiscal policy the fed meets every six weeks to consider changes in interest rates and can call an unscheduled meeting any time in between changes to fiscal policy are likely to occur once year at most for example there were three large tax cuts from the 2001 recession through 200613 in the same period interest rates were changed 29 times once decision to alter fiscal policy has been made the proposal must travel through long and arduous legislative process lasting months before it can become law while monetary policy changes are made instantly 14 second political constraints frequently lead to fiscal policy being employed in only one direction over the course of the business cycle aggregate sp ending can be expected to be too high as often as it is too low this means that stabilization policy must be tightened as often as it is loosened 11 tax cut that was financed by lower government spending would not stimulate aggregate spending because the increase in private spending among the tax cuts recipients would be offset by the decrease in government spending in the keynesian model the key to stimulus is the larger deficit not the tax cut 12 for more information see crs report rl30354 monetary policy and the federal reserve current policy and conditions by gail makinen and marc labonte 13 the tax cuts are the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act pl 10716 the job creation and worker assistance act pl 107147 and the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act pl 10827 14 to some extent fiscal policy automatically mitigates changes in the business cycle without any policy changes because tax revenue falls relative to gdp and certain mandatory spending such as unemployment insurance rises when economic growth slows

implementing the spending cuts or tax increases necessary to reduce it as result the budget has been in deficit in 44 of the past 49 years by contrast the fed is highly insulated from political pressures15 and experience shows that it is as willing to raise interest rates as it is to lower them persistent budget deficits lead to the third problem third the long run consequences of fiscal and monetary policy differ expansionary fiscal policy creates federal debt that must be serviced by future generations some of this debt will be owed to ourselves but some presently about half will be owed to foreigners when expansionary fiscal policy crowds out private investment it leaves future generations poorer than they otherwise would have been16 expansionary monetary policy has effect on generational equity furthermore the government faces budget constraint that limits the scope of expansionary fiscal policyit can only issue debt as long as investor s believe that the debt will be honoredeven if economic conditions require larger deficits to restore equilibrium 17 fourth an economy such as the united states that is open to highly mobile capital flows changes the relative effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy if expansionary fiscal policy leads to higher interest rates it will attract foreign capital looking for higher rate of return foreign capital can only enter the united states on net through trade deficit thus higher foreign capital inflows lead to higher imports which reduce spending on domesticallyproduced substitutes and lower spending on exports the increase in the trade deficit would cancel out the expansionary effects of the increase in the budget deficit to some extent in theory entirely this theory is borne out by experience in the past few yearsas the budget deficit increased so did the trade deficit 18 expansionary monetary policy would have the opposite effectlower interest rates would cause capital to flow abroad in search of higher rates of return elsewhere foreign capital outflows would reduce the trade deficit through an increase in spending on exports and domestically produced import substitutes thus foreign capital flows would magnify the expansionary effects of monetary policy in cases where economic activity is extremely depressed monetary policy may lose some of its effectiveness when interest rates become extremely low interestsensitive spending may longer be very responsive to further rate cuts furthermore interest rates cannot be lowered below zero in this scenario fiscal policy may be more effective but the united states has not found itself in this scenario since the great depression although japan did in the 1990s of course using monetary and fiscal policy to stabilize the economy are not mutually exclusive policy options but because of the feds inde pendence from congress and the administration there is way to coordinate the two policy options if compatible fiscal and monetary policies are chosen by congress and the fed respectively then the economic effects would be more powerful than if either policy were implemented in isolation for example if stimulative monetary and fiscal policies were implemented the resulting economic stimulus would be larger 15 for more information see crs report rl31056 economics of federal reserve independence by marc labonte 16 an exception to the rule would be situation where the economy is so depressed that virtually crowding out takes place because the stimulus to spending generates nough resources to finance new capital spending 17 the analogous constraint on monetary policy is that after certain limit expansionary monetary policy would become highly inflationary but from the current startin g point of price stability problems with inflation would presumably only occur after point where the economy had returned to full employment 18 see crs report rs21409 the budget deficit and the trade deficit what is

policy were stimulative and the other were neutral but if incompatible policies are selected they could partially negate each other for example stimulative fiscal policy and contractionary monetary policy may end up having little effect on the economy one way or the other thus when fiscal and monetary policymakers disagree in the current system they can potentially choose policies with the intent of cancelling out each others actions19 whether this arrangement is better or worse for the economy depends on what policies are chosen if one actor chooses inappropriate policies then the lack of coordination usefully allows the other actor to try to negate its effects but if both actors choose appropriate policies the policies could be slightly less effective than if they had been coordinated g3g155g142g561g20g142g140g142g156g156g146g152g151g156g561g23g151g138g159g152g146g141g138g139g149g142g501g561 if recessions are usually caused by declines in aggregate spending and the government can alter aggregate spending through changes in monetary and fiscal policy then why is it that the government cannot use policy to prevent recessions from occurring in the first place while recessions should theoretically be avoidable there are several real world problems that keep stabilization from working with perfect efficiency in practice first many of the economic shocks that cause recessions are unforeseeable policymakers can only react to the shocks after they have already occurred by then it may be too late to avoid recession as their name suggests economic shocks tend to be sudden and unexpected few energy analysts predicted that the price of oil would rise from less than 20 per barrel in 2001 to almost 70 per barrel in 2006 if the rise in pr ice could not be predicted then neither could its effects on the economy second there is time lag between change to monetary or fiscal policy and its effect on the economy because individual behavior adjusts to interest rate or tax changes slowly for example higher interest rates will reduce housing demand but only graduallythe fed has been raising interest rates since 2004 but the housing market did not cool off until 2006 because of lags an optimal policy would need to be able to respond to change in economic conditions before it occurred for example if the economy were going to fall below full employment next year policy would need to be eased this year to prevent it third for stabilization policy to be effective given lags policymakers must have accurate economic forecasts yet even shortterm economic forecastingparticularly in the case of turning points in the business cycleis notoriously inaccurate in january 2001 for example the congressional budget office the office of ma nagement and budget the federal reserve and virtually all major private forecasts predicted growth between 20 and 31 for the year 20 in reality the economy entered recession two months later and grew by 08 for the year given the important role of unpredictable shocks in the business cycle perhaps this should not be surprise 19 it is important to take this possibility into consideratio n when evaluating the potential effects of fiscal policy on the business cycle because the fed presumably chooses and continually updates monetary policy that aims to keep the economy at full employment the fed would need to alter its policy to offset the effects of any stimulative fiscal policy changes that moved the economy above full employment thus the actual net stimulative effect of fiscal policy change after taking into account monetary policy adjustments could be less than the effects in isolation 20 blue chip economic indicators january 2001

the economy is limited and because the economy does not always respond to policy changes as expected policymakers sometimes make mistakes for example if the natural rate of unemployment nairu rises and policymakers do not realize it they may think that expansionary policy is needed to reduce unemployment economists believe that this is one reason inflation rose in the 1970s fifth in the case of monetary policy changes in shortterm interest rates do not lead to onefor one changes in longterm interest rates longterm interest rates are determined by supply and demand and many factors enter that equation besides shortterm interest rates yet many types of spending may be more sensitive to longterm rates reducing monetary policys effectiveness one reason the housing boom continued after 2004 was that mortgage rates increased far less than the federal funds rate sixth because policy changes do not lead to large and rapid changes in economic activity for the reasons listed above it may take extremely large policy changes to forestall recession yet policy changes of that magnitude could be dest abilizing in their own right for example extremely large swings in interest rates could impede the smooth functioning of the financial system and lead to large swings in the value of the dollar large increases in the budget deficit could hamper the governments future budgetary flexibility more modest policy changes are more prudent in light of uncertainty finally policys influence on the economy is blunted by the open nature of the us economy in an era of increasing globalization as discussed above the expansionary effects of increases in the budget deficit have been largely offset by increases in the trade deficit in recent years likewise the contractionary effects of higher shortterm interest rates have not led to significantly higher longterm rates because of the ready supply of foreign capital nevertheless higher shortterm interest rates have still had contractionary effect on the economy through the larger trade deficit that accompanies foreign capital inflows but in situation where some observers feared that the economy might be suffering from housing bubble higher interest rates might have been more desirable way to curb economic activity than an increase in the already recordhigh trade deficit an open economy is also one that is more influenced by developments abroadas the economys openness has increased over time foreign economic shocks positive or negative have had larger effect on the united states and domestic events including policy changes have had smaller effect

if policymakers were concerned with only economic growth policy decisions would be considerably easier above average growth woul d lead to contractionary policy and below average growth would lead to expansionary policy given uncertainty about the true state of the economy policymakers could err on the side of caution when tightening to avoid recessions unfortunately policymakers must weigh these considerations against the effects of policy change on price stability inflation typically the same policy is needed to achieve both price stability and economic stability the feds mandated goalsa tightening of policy when economic growth is above its sustainable rate will also help to keep inflation from rising and inflationary pressures are typically low during recessions of course underlying policy decisions are uncertain estimates of the economys sustainable rates of growth and unemployment so policymakers must decide how optimistic their assumptions of both should be more optimistic assumptions increase the risk of rising inflation while more pessimistic assumptions increase the risk of subpar growth

economic activity do not move in the same direction there are several possible reasons why inflation sometimes rises although economic activity is sluggish first prices of individual goods may rise for reasons unrelated to the business cycle if the price of specific good rises relatively quickly and other prices do not fall then overall inflation will rise most goods account for too small share of overall spending to boost inflation by more than trivial amount but few goods such as food shelter and especially energy are very large as share of overall spending energy increased the growth rate of the consumer price index by 05 percentage points from 2000 to 2006 the fed has argued that temporary individual price shocks that cause overall inflation to rise can be ignored as long as they do not feed through to other prices 21 yet it is difficult to argue that energys recent effects on inflation have been only temporary and nonenergy price inflation has risen steadily since 2003 second inflation shows persistence over timecurrent inflation is influenced by past inflation even when economic conditions have changed thus an economic slowdown may not instantly lead to lower inflation third expectations play an important role in determining inflation expectations change slowly which partially explains inflation persistence but economists generally believe that they eventually adjust to accurately reflect circumstances in other words persistently expansionary monetary policy will eventually lose its effectiveness causing inflation to rise even if economic growth is sluggish as occurred in the 1970s because of the role of expectations any shortterm tradeoff between inflation and growth will not persist in the long run in the long run the economy will adjust to any attempts to keep unemployment below its natural rate and that adjustment will come about through rising inflation rate in other words monetary policys effect on output is temporary but its effect on inflation is permanent therefore some economis ts argue that growth stability should be emphasized as policy goal and price stability s hould be given primacy perhaps through formal change to the feds statutory mandate 22 and indeed policy objective of maximizing economic stability would not deliver price stability since price shocks would need to be completely ignored but as long as policymakers are mindful of the limits of economic stabilization there is reason that monetary policy cannot be prudently used to reduce cyclical fluctuations without undermining price stability after all economic st ability and pr ice stability often go handinhand g21g145g152g158g149g141g561g21g157g138g139g146g149g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g515g8g146g151g142g561g22g158g151g142g516g501g561 another major debate is how vigorously stabilization policy should be pursued this may seem surprisingwhy would policymakers not take ev ery action they could to keep the economy at full employment but given our limited understanding of economic fluctuations skeptics argue that less policy interventionwhat they refer to as fine tuningcan often achieve better longterm results as discussed in the introduction the rate of economic growth changes because of both changes in the business cycle and random fluctu ations it is not obvious how to differentiate between the two until after the fact if monetary or fiscal policy is tightened in response to random fluctuation that temporarily boosts gdp growth then future growth would be inappropriately lower taken to the extreme if policymakers altered policy in response to every change in gdp growth random or cyclical then the economy could become more unstable 21 the price shocks could not have caused overall inflation to rise unless it had been accommodated by the fed with constant money supply the rise in energy prices would have been offset by fall in other prices in that sense the recent rise in inflation was not inevitable 22 for more information see crs report

employment on its own through natural market adjustments so there are permanent effects to more hands off policy approach but if policy was too hands off policymak ers would underreact to major swings in the business cycle most notably the onset of recessions this could prolong recessions length and increase its depth posing temporary hardship in the form of higher unemployment policy of fine tuning may lead to policy errors at times the relevant question is whether the cumulative errors that result are more or less harmful to the economy than policy of responding less vigorously to economic fluctuations the importance of policy lags and forecasting accuracy discussed in the previous section color the fine tuning debate lags mean that by the time policy change affects the economy the state of the economy may have already changed while policy of fine tuning could be optimal if policymakers had perfect forecasts it will fall short of optimal in the real world in practice opponents of fine tuning argue that the fed should respond more vigorously to changes in inflation and less vigorously to changes in output while most economists would argue that the fed has already moved in this direction some would like to see this change codified through the adoption of an inflation target and by changing the feds mandate to single goal of price stability this approach would reduce but not remove the feds response to business cycle fluctuations because changes in the business cycle have major influence on the inflation rate in the short run although some economists attribute the decline in the economys volatility to shift in monetary policy away from fine tuning the fed has still responded vigorously to changes in economic conditions often responding in an anticipatory fashion for example the fed reduced interest rates from 65 to 175 between january and december 2001 even though the recession which began in march 2001 was not officially declared until november 2001 clearly the fed is still willing to change interest rates quickly and drastically thus either the fed is still pursuing policy of fine tuning although conventional wis dom says otherwise or fine tuning cannot be defined in terms of large swings in interest rates however fine tuning could have two other meanings it could refer to frequent shifts in policy direction with higher rates being quickly followed by lower rates and so on as figure 4 illustrates since the 1990s the fed has tended to pursue consistent policy for an extended period of time before changing directions for example the fed tightened monetary policy continually from june 2004 to june 2006 by contrast in 1980 the federal funds rate was up 3 percentage points in march then down 65 percentage points in may then up 3 percentage points in november it is less clear that policy shifts are less common today than in the 1960s however

data are monthly market rate fine tuning could also refer to tendency to undertake sudden shifts in policy when economic growth picked up speed in 2004 the earlier monetary stimulus was arguably longer necessary to prevent return to recession the fed decided to remove the stimulus very cautiously raising rates onequarter of percent every six weeks in order to see how the economy would react in the 1970s and 1980s policy changes were often more sudden in hindsight if the fed had raised rates more quickly since 2004 it would likely have posed little harm to the current expansion but because of the unreliability of forecasts the fed had way of knowing at the time that more rapid growth would persist thus the 20042006 strategy minimized the risk that the monetary tightening would be destabilizing the strategy was not without its own risks howeverit may help explain why inflation has been undesirably high since 2005 according to chairman bernankes own definition 23 this episode illustrates that fine tuning and price stability are not always at odds as critics would have it

capacity or supply side are the key to longterm sustained improvements in living standards the economys productive capacity can be increased only by increasing productivity and inputs of labor and capital while government has great effect on longterm economic growth overall by fostering an environment conducive to capital investment and innovation policy changes are likely to have economic effects that are indirect and incremental for example an econom cannot operate at an advanced level without monetary and financial system justice system markets and property rights that are all

reforms may have positive effects on growth but the effects are likely to be too small to be discernable in the data other policy areas where good policy can foster higher longterm growth include education taxation competition basic research openness to trade and infrastructure24 each of these policy areas involves public goods that the private sector would underprovide without government involvement regarding national saving economists disagree whether governments proper role should be limited to eliminating the budget deficit so that its influence on saving is neutral or whether it should be extended to encouraging higher household saving 25 advocates of the latter often argue that individuals are often too shortsighted to save as much as they desire later in life and point to the negative household saving rate as supporting evidence advocates of more neutral role for government argue that saving should be based on private choice and the negative household saving rate is evidence that the myriad government incentives to save already available are ineffective the importance of the falling saving rate to longterm growth can be seen in recent capital investment levels which have been below the historical average in this decade another major challenge for longterm growth will be how to sustain growth in the labor supply in the face of the retirement of the baby boomers either through higher immigration or policies that encourage labor force participation among older workers nevertheless expectations over how much policy changes can raise economic growth should be tempered as discussed earlier increasing inputs of capital and labor play an important supporting role in longterm growth but productivity growth plays the primary role productivity growth relies on technological innovation made possible by human capital accumulation research and development and entrepreneurship tax cuts or other policy changes can arguably alter labor and capital inputsand case can be made that even inputs cannot be altered muchbut there is little evidence that government can effectively influence productivity growth directly recent history bears this out the only notable change in longterm economic growth in the last four decades has been the surge in productivity growth since 1995 although that surge would not have been possible without generally favorable policy environment the surge itself has been attributed to technological innovation notably in hightech industries for which economists have not found any evidence that changes in government policy were primarily responsible the general policy lesson from this experience would be that policy environment where innovation and entrepreneurship can prosper wit hout heavy intervention in the marketplace will result in more rapid economic growth this principle is best demonstrated by comparing the united states to its peers 26 of the seven major advanced world economies canada is the only country besides the united states that has enjoyed boost in percapita gdp growth since 1996 in fact many countries growth rates were lower in the latter period and the united kingdom 24 at present government policies to boost national saving would be unlikely to lead to higher growth rates via higher investment rates because foreign lending has allowed the united states to achieve high investment rates already rather it would increase americans income since more of the income generated in the united states would accrue to americans rather than foreigners as noted above boosting national saving would boost investment in the long run since foreign lending at current levels is not permanently sustainable 25 for more information see crs report rl32119 can public policy raise the saving rate by brian w cashell 26 it is not useful to compare growth rates in the united states to developing economies such as india or china b ecause those countries are starting from capital stock and productivity level that is an order of magnitude lower than exists in the united states therefore developing countries can achieve very high rates of growth through catch up growth by adopting already existing technologies by contrast the united states must generate growth by creating new technologies

comparable to the united states since 1996 as seen in table 4 this difference in economic experience since 1996 is all the more surprising since the technological innovations that are thought to have

the same and the united states has the lowest national saving rate of the group the main differences that can account for the disparate economic experience between the englishspeaking economies and the rest are policy differences 27 namely the englishspeaking economies all have reputation for pursuing more laissezfaire noninterventionist economic policies than the other countries although comparing differences in countries overall economic policy is admittedly subjective28 most economists agree that one important principle underlying the success of laissezfaire economies is that government should not try to pick winners by allocating economic resources to favored industries otherwise it is difficult to isolate which policies are most important and what policy changes would have the largest effect on growth going forward and it is useful to keep in mind that the surge in productivity growth since 1995 has raised the average growth rate of the economy by only 03 percentage pointseven major economic changes have limited effect nevertheless if that differential could be sustained the improvement in living standards would eventually accumulate into substantial difference 27 an 11year period should be long enough to rule out that the difference is caused by the business cycle although some would argue that japans prolonged economic slump is cyclical in nature the other potential broad explanation for the disparate results between countries could be cultural differences 28 for an international study on the effects of government spending on growth see
