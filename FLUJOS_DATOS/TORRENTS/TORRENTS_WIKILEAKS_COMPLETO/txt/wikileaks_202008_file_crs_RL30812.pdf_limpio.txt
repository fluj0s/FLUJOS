statutes and where to find them both in print and on the internet when congress passes law it may amend or repeal earlier enactments or it may write on clean slate newly enacted laws are published chronologically first as separate statutes in slip law form and later cumulatively in series of volumes known as the statutes at large statutes are numbered by order of enactment either as public laws or far less frequently private laws depending on their scope most statutes are incorporated into the united states code the united states code and its commercial counterparts arrange federal statutes that are of general and permanent nature by subject into titles as the statutes that underlie the code are revised superseded or repealed the provisions of the code are updated to reflect these changes the slip law versions of public laws are available in official print form from the government printing office federal depository libraries eg university and state libraries provide slip laws in print andor microfiche format the statutes at large series often is available at large libraries the united states code and its commercial counterparts are usually available at local libraries in addition statutes and the united states code can be found on the internet many significant statutes for example the social security act and the clean air act are published and updated both in the public law as amended version and in the united states code for some titles the public law as amended is the authoritative version of the statute and not the code in these instances an asterisk will not appear next to the title in the code after providing an overview on the basics of federal statutes this report gives guidance on where federal statutes in their various forms may be located on the internet this report will be updated periodically httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30812g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g21g157g138g157g158g157g142g156g497g561g25g145g138g157g561g22 g145g142g162g561g3

chronologically first as separate statutes in slip law form and later cumulatively in the bound volumes of the statutes at large additionally most statutes are also incorporated into the united states code usc the usc and its commercial counterparts united states code service uscs and united states code annotated usca take the federal statutes that are of general and permanent nature and arrange them by subject into fifty separate titles as the statutes that underlie the code are revised superseded or repealed the provisions of the code are updated to reflect these changes

section 7 of the constitution it is characterized as public law or private law each new statute is assigned number according to its order of enactment within particular congress eg the 10 th public law enacted in the 109th congress was numbered as pl 10910 the 10th private law was numbered private law 10910 private laws are enacted for the benefit of named individual or entity eg due to exceptional individual circumstances congress enacts law providing government reimbursement to named person who would not otherwise be eligible under general law in contrast public laws are of general applicability and permanent and continuing in nature public laws form the basis of the code all other laws must be researched in the slip laws statutes at large format the government printing office gpo publishes the first official text of new statute the slip law in pamphlet form individual slip laws in print format can be obtained from the gpo federal depository libraries located throughout the united states also provide free public access to copies of federal publications and other information list of federal depository libraries and their locations is accessible on the internet at httpwwwgpoaccessgovlibrarieshtml some private and public libraries compile the laws in looseleaf binders or in microfiche collections

not codified in the code such as appropriations or private laws g18g158g139g149g146g140g561g14g138g160g156g496g561g138g156g561g3g150g142g151g141g142g141g561 most statutes do not initiate new programs rather most statutes revise repeal or add to existing statutes consider the following sequence of enactments in 1952 congress passed the immigration and nationality act of 1952 pl 82 414 66 stat 163 this law generally consolidated and amended federal statutory law on the admission and stay of aliens in the us and how they may become citizens the immigration and nationality act of 1952 was codified at title 8 of the usc 1 et seq in 1986 congress passed the immigration reform and control act of 1986 pl 99603 100 stat 3359 section 101 of this act amended section 274 of the immigration and nationality act of 1952 codified at 8 usc 1324 by adding section 274a codified at 8 usc 1324a this new section section 274a made it unlawful for person to hire for employment in the united states an illegal alien in 1996 congress passed the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 pl 104208 division c 110 stat 3009 section 412 of the 1996 act amended the employer sanctions process by requiring an employer to verify that new employee is not an illegal alien as with the 1986 act the 1996 act expressly amended the immigration and nationality act of 1952 section 274a in this case and section 1324a in title 8 of the usc 8 usc 1324a as the above sequence illustrates the canvas upon which congress works is often an updated standalone version of an earlier public law eg immigration and nationality act of 1952 as amended and not the us code on the titles of united states code page of the code an asterisk appears next to some of the titles the asterisks refer to note that states this title has been enacted as positive law if the title is asterisked the code provides the authoritative version of the public law as amended for example there is asterisk beside title 42 of the usc thus the provisions codified in title 42 are not authoritative should there be discrepancy court will accept the language in the statutes at large as the authoritative source and not the code it should be noted that there is substantive difference between the language of the public law as published in the statutes at large and that of the code it is often difficult to find current updated versions of frequently amended public laws in print many congressional committees periodically issue committee prints containing the major public laws within their respective jurisdictions alternatively the various commercial publishers discussed herein print updated versions of major public laws in addition the amended versions of some major public laws can be found on the internet g23g151g146g157g142g141g561g21g157g138g157g142g156g561g5g152g141g142g561 the united states code is the official government codification of federal legislation this resource has been

bound volumes the latest edition is dated 2000 in the usc statutes are grouped by subject into fifty titles each title is further organized into chapters and sections listing of the titles is provided in each volume unlike the statutes the code is cited by title and section number eg 28 usc sec or 534 refers to section 534 of title 28 notes at the end of each section provide additional information including statutory origin of the code provision both by public law number and statutes at large citation the effective dates brief citation and discussion of any amendments and cross references to related provisions g3g151g151g152g157g138g157g142g141g561g7g141g146g157g146g152g151g156g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561 g23g151g146g157g142g141g561g21g157g138g157g142g156g561g5g152g141g142 g561 the united states code annotated usca published by thomsonwest and the united states code service uscs published by lexisnexis are unofficial privately published editions of the code these publications include the text of the code annotations to judicial decisions interpreting the code sections cross references to the code of federal regulations cf r provisions and historical notes both also provide references to selected secondary sources for example the uscs includes selected law review articles bound volumes of the usca and the uscs are updated by annual inserts pocket parts and supplements these updates include newly codified laws and annotations both usca and uscs issue pamphlets containing copies of recently enacted public laws arranged in chronological order since there is time lag in publishing the official usc codified versions of new enactments usually appear first in the usca and uscs supplements g9g142g151g142g155g138g149g561g11g151g141g142g161g561 each edition of the code has comprehensive index which is organized by subject for example to locate the provision of law establishing review committee for farm marketing quotas search the term farm marketing quotas in the index there are references to several other subject headings including the agricultural adjustment assistance act of 1938 turning to that heading and looking under the subheading farm marketing quotas there is reference to committee for review codified at 7 usc 1363 the index is updated in each annual supplement to the code g18g152g153g158g149g138g155g561g16g138g150g142g561g22g138g139g149g142g561 each edition of the code also has table which can be used to find an act if its citation is not known the public laws are arranged alphabetically and can be searched under their commonly known names this reference also provides the public law number and the citations to the statutes at large and the usc if the original laws have been amended the same information is provided for each amendment for example searching for the special drawing rights act in the table shows that it has been codified at 22 usc 286q

relationship between public laws the statutes at large and the usc researcher who has either public law number or statutes at large citation can use this table to ascertain where that law is codified and its present status the table is particularly useful when searching in one section of law that contains many subsections because it can be used to find where individual sections and subsections of public law have been codified for example the table indicates that pl 99661 section 1403 is codified in the usc at 20 usc 4702 usca and the uscs also have their own versions of the research tools discussed above g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g21g157g138g157g158g157g142g156g561g152g151g561g157g145g142g561g11g151g157g142g155g151g142g157g561 the internet has made legal resources including federal statutes more widely available to both scholars and the general public there are several considerations that should be taken into account when using internet materials materials on internet sites may not be uptodate and it may be difficult to discern how current the material is or whether it has been revised it may be difficult to find current federal statutes especially in the case of popular name statutes that are amended frequently on their websites federal agencies do not always include the current versions of the statutes they administer however they may provide useful summaries and discussions of the statutes websites are constantly changing the inclusion and location of information may differ from time to time the address or url of website may also change in addition each website has its own format and search capabilities which sometimes can result in frustrating and timeconsuming research process with the foregoing caveats in mind the following are public resources
