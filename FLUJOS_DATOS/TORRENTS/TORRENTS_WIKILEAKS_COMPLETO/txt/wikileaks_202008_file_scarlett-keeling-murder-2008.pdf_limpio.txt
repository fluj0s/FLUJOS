might only hear the guitar if there is si nger then thats usually w hat most people will hear first bec ause i am pianist when i listen to music i hear the piano if there is one some peop like to listen to the beat or the rh ythm of any song they lis ten to when you dance to musi c youll be dancing to the beat of the song so even if dont know it ou are dancing to the rhy thm of the song the rhythm of music is t he beat behind the music that you might not always immediately notic however this is what d rives you to move your body or tap your foo t when you listen to g the instruments that are u sed to make the beat and create rhythm are called percussion inst ruments there is actuall huge variety of these instrumen ts but the most common f all percussion instruments is the drum k it the drum kit is used m ost often in popular music but you ca n see it everywhere wh someone is studying rhythm they usu ally start on drum kit an d then from there they might specializ there are

also and like the ot hers african rhythms have unique asp ects to it learning rhythm is very important and when it co mes to playing in band situation or anytime youre playing with othe r musicians

project meditati on community by clickin g here hi there vikram i have noticed and answe red particular questions w ithin the community this week regarding various l evels within the lifeflow series i am ded icating this issue to expla ining in detail how you w ill benefit the most using lifeflow inside this issue filecments20and 20settings1desktopv ikram20varma20ema il20080222the20good 20life20for20vikra m78801452txt742009 43549 pm light state of med itation lifeflow 10 the deeper levels f lifeflow light state of meditat ion light state of meditatio n typically results in an in crease in production of m ainly alpha brainwaves when you find yourself lost in daydrea m staring off absentmin dedly into space for exam ple youre actually in l ight state of meditation your brain has boosted u p production of alpha wa ves as by product of thi s state the brainwaves p roduced would likely fall somewhere aro und 12hz perhaps poin t or two higher or lower but in the general range f 12hz lifeflow 10 the lf10 track is as ex plained before 10hz tr ack so it encourages the brain to descend to stat somewhat below that of common daydre am you may wonder the n what the tangible differ ences would be between this state and simply losing yourself in common daydream an d the differences would b many from physiological stan dpoint the breathing wou ld probably become some what slower and possibly little deeper there is common claim that the blood becomes m ore highly oxygenated bu t that is not really the cas the blood is normally very close to its maximum state of oxyge nation when person is b reathing in the usual man ner even if you give someon tank of oxygen to bre ath from the actual conte nt of oxygen in the blood in normal healthy person does not change all that much to get the blood to carry an significantly higher oxy gen levels requires pressurization in hyperb aric oxygen chamber on first learning this fact some people might be di sillusioned because theyv been told meditation in creases oxygen in the blood it doesnt but in fact what it does do i s much more significant meditation and the acco mpanying states of consciousness and their ttendant brainwave patter ns actually produce chang at the cellular level this is far more significa nt than simply putting mo re oxygen in the blood t his is changing the body at the cellular level in such way that t he cells of the body begin utilizing the oxygen they are exposed to more effi ciently thus requiring less oxygen to g et the same amount of wo rk done this is part of the reason why you hear of people who have various medica l ailments finding that the ir conditions improve after beginning practice of meditation it is not that they are inject ing more of something in to the body but rather the body is improv ing its efficiency at using the resources it already h as so for instance you may hear that someone suffer ing from emphysema beg ins to need less and less f their bottled oxygen it isnt because th eyve got more oxygen in their system its because on cellular level their b odies begin making better use of the available oxygen or someone experiencing anxiety or panic attacks who often feels as if he r she is getting insufficie nt oxygen while breathing common sym ptom of panic and anxiet will find this disturbin g sensation is alleviated nce they begin practice of meditation the deeper levels of li feflow there are other changes b esides breathing and oxy gen that occur during ditation but the point im trying to make is that this improved functio ning occurs in increasing amounts the deeper one goes in their states of sciousness the deeper the state of co nsciousness the slower th brainwaves and the gre ater the improvement of the physical functioning of the body n ot just superficially but c lear down to the cellular level and perhaps even d eeper than thatfilecments20and 20settings1desktopv ikram20varma20ema il20080222the20good 20life20for20vikra m78801452txt742009 43549 pmthe full lifeflow entrain ment suite is powerful aid to reaching those dee per states incredibly faste r than practicing meditation alone some f you may find light sta of meditation brings u exactly what you were seeking so you have interest in going deeper in my view that s fine theres need fo r you to feel like you mus t get to something better then again many of you will realize that if there i s something more somet hing that leads to even gr eater peace and wellbeing or greater s piritual connection you w ould like to pursue it ving series of tracks tha t target deeper brainwave states gives u the ability to do just tha t maybe think of using the lifeflow series as like c limbing up ladder one of the keys to moving up this ladder is spending time at each lev the rung or state of c onsciousness has to get to the point that it feels fam iliar and normal before you can really move on to the nex t stage and this means s pending time there this is another reason wh suite of progressive ntrainment tracks is bene ficial if harnessing your brainwaves permits you to reach and remain at deeper states of consciousness for longer periods of time you sho rten the length of time it ultimately takes fo r any given state to begin to feel like your new rmal state you will achieve the grea test benefits by using the lifeflow series as they h ave been

preludes in c sharp mino r this piece of music ch allenged in way that other piece h as and to be honest i hav never really nailed it to perfection i l oved the piece but frankl it was just little difficult for my sk ill level my feeling is that when ou come to learning full s ongs on the piano you should choose songs that you can progre ss slowly but surely and maintain your motivation by continuin g your success however i think that som etimes it is productive an d fun to take on piece that is really h ard for you it is always good to chall enge yourself in everythi ng you do this is true for everything in l ife though in general it is best to progressively improve ur skills i think somethin g can be gained from taking the occasiona l big leap forward the re ason for this is that it can introduce you to new techniques and id eas that can advance your playing so when you go back to p laying your normal songs you will find them lot easier when you get minute mail with what you h ave found to be your hardest piece of mu sic and what you did to master it thelonius monk thelonious sphere monk was born on red row r ocky mount north carolina on october 10 1 917 he grew up in new

her was in the choir by his teens he wa s playing rent parties w hen he was 17 he dropped out of high s chool to join an evangeli st on tour which travelled through the mid west it was on this tour that he met mary lou williams in kansas city as mary lou remembers thelonious still in his teens came into town with either an evan gelist or medicine show i forget which while he was in kaycee he jammed every night r eally used to blow on piano employing t more technique than he does today monks technique during this period would have s hown more of his initial influences than at later times though these influences teddy wilson james p johnson and duke elling ton would always be present in his music he returned to new york and apparently spent so time studying at juillard before getting j

did not record to the same extent and his erratic behaviour did not help him to get th kind of recognition he deserved alfred lion at blue note however recorded thelonious on several oc casions as leader of his wn group these recordings made in 1947 and 1948 featured various musicians art blakey shadow wil milt jackson and idr ees sulieman among others these sessions to gether with later one in

briti sh national the death of the anjuna teen ager scarlette eden due t âdrowningâ as cla imed by the anjuna polic does not appear to have gone down well with the locals as well as the victimâs mother m s fiona who claims that h er daughter was an excellent swimmer an d she just could not belie ve that her daughter got d rowned in just few inch of water ms fiona has also claimed th at the anjuna police have âdirectly liedâ to h er and neither the inspect or of police nor the dgpâs office has been sympathetic to her grievance mother of 9 children ms fiona who h as already complained to the igp an d dgp highly regretted that the officials attached to the dgp and igpâ s offices ill treated her and prevente d her from either meeting the igp or dgp saying t hat she would have to sit and wait for atleast four hours an em otionally upset ms fiona has even claimed that sh was receiving threats fo r pursuing the case the role of the anjuna po lice has in cloud as tho ugh psi nerlon albuque rque has maintained that the body was filecdocuments20a nd20settings1desktop vikram20varma20em ail20080227mapusa20 story78950075txt742 009 43553 pmfished out from the water in semi nude condition two eye witnesses richa rd and max claim that th ey had seen the body fully nude and on th sand much above the h igh tide line facing the w ater while richard claim s to have seen the body at 630 am on mond ay morning max who kn ew the girl is believed to have seen the body at 83 0 and informed the anjuna sarpanch who it is learnt was familiar w ith the girlâs lover on julio from siolim and i mmediately informed julio speaking to âthe navhind time sâ ms fiona says âœ julio had befriended my daughter on the context of working rela tionship however things later changed i began to doubt julioâs intentio ns however hoping that my daughter would be in his safe custo dy i had left her with him and gone to gokarnaâ â here it is pertinent to note that juli offering better job pro spects had taken scarlette to stay at his auntâs p lace at siolim though initially she was staying alone there julio later began to stay with h er according to reliable sources it is learnt that julio was highly â possessive and notoriou s â person few day s back it is believed that he was arrested by the pernem police for being involved in late n ight party that was creatin g sound pollution and the party was subsequently raided by th pernem police as was julio was behind bars s carlette it is learnt had be friended swedish boy with whom she would go out partyin g however julio on lear ning about this had warn ed the boy not to â touchâ scarlette ter however the swedish boy left for his country relating to the events tha t took place last sunday s ome eye witnesses have said that scarlette and an other friend one ruby from anjuna had g one for party that eveni ng at hotel in anjuna however late at night wh the two returned at rubyâs ho home it is learnt that both were âœhighly dru ggedâ though ruby we nt in it is not known with whom scarle tte went and that too in n intoxicated condition to the beach says fiona â œ my daughter although full of life and partying girl was also hi ghly respectable she was always aware of what sh was doing if she was drugged at the pa rty it must have been by some notorious elements who did so with malafi intention and later followed her till she was alone outside rubyâ s house and later took her to the beachâ the i nvestigations being conducted by the njuna police with possi ble intention to hush up t he case as mere drowni ng case throws question mark whether ch cases involving crime s on foreigners are delibe rately pushed under the c arpet by the goa police who ignore the po ssible international ramif ications if this is so the common man also is not safe in the hands of the police who could pos sibly turn such ârapeâ and murder cases into drowning though were some bruise marks on the body it has now come to light that th is fact was kept secret b the anjuna police to â push â the case as mere drowning further ms fiona claims that the anjuna police ve not all been taking thi s case seriously and also attempts are being made by the police to investigate the case â œ even my daughterâ s clothes and slippers were noticed by on the beach after g ood three days and mar k on the sand also proves that she was â unconsciously drowned â and then pulled and brought on the shore learned supreme court dvocate whom this reporter contacted s said that the circumstan ces leading to the âforc eful drowningâ and th ereafter leaving the victim nude the bea ch are highly suspicious w ith the police trying to co ver up the ârape and m urderâ of the victim as drowning th learned advocate has po inted out that the offence attracts punishment unde r section 302a and 376 of ipc as the vic tim was also sexually ass aulted and the victim bein g teenager the quantum of punishment is great however he also po inted out that it was still mystery to him why the anjuna police were treat ing the case under 178 ipc which is is mere drowning case âœ was it to shield som influential criminalsâ the advocate sought to know in the m eanwhile julioâs whe reabouts are still being as certained with rumours buzz that he is probably out of goa ano ther development that has unfolded is that the autop sy report conducted on th body has revealed that the victim w as sexually assaulted by t he culprits before she wa s drowned fact that has come to light by looking at the abrasions n the body and this fact w as kept under wraps by t he anjuna police it has also on the other hand anjuna psi nerlon albuquerque when cont acted has said that invest igations are still being co nducted in the case ms fiona has furthe r claimed that she has alr eady approached the brit ish embassy and british uthorities were seized about the matter s she has been receiving numerous phone calls fr om her country she is pr esently

arhythmical instrument w hen you push the keys do wn you do so in percussive manner the n ice thing about the piano is that you can vary the volume and leng th of the sound this can add more spice and variety to the music you play when i was first learning the piano i didnt concen trate enough on the rhythmical aspect of the piano instead what i was more interested in was playing the nice sounding melod ies and chords so i didnt usually concen trate on the timing of the piece i didnt concentrate on play ing at the right speed and getting the rhythm of the notes right unfortunately this is not good idea for learning t he piano what happened was i was negl ecting the rhythmical asp ect of the piano and later on in my learnin g i came into difficulty w ith my rhythm and ability to play in tim i had to work twice as hard to get my rhythm and timing at the level of the rest of my p laying the best way to practice rhythm is too listen to ur favorite song and try to count along to the rhythm most songs have count of 4 beats to each bar you m ight have heard people co unting to 4 before the song this is c ounting in the song at the right tempo so the band knows how f ast to play so if you can count along to the beat of your favorite song one two three fou r you should try and do this to the bea t of the song sometimes piano song will be very rhythmically orientated this means that the song is pla yed with lot of importa nce placed on the timing and the rhythm ical patterns an exampl of this kind of playing would be song like great balls of fire by jerry lee lewis if youve heard th song before youll hear the percussive nature of jerry lewis pla ying style the song itse lf is heavily rhythm based the beat i s quite driving and it has definite pulse to it he is playing heavily on the beat and the chords in repeated rhythmical pattern when playing with ban d rhythm and timing are very important when playing solo the rh ythm of song can vary this is because the rhythm and timing is performed is more open t interpretation by the pianist with ther instruments needing specific guidelines of timing the p iano can vary speed and adopt different rhythmical patterns at wi ll there are lot of differen t complicated aspects abo ut rhythm that are important to learn and understand because the piano is an instrument that has the ab ility to play rhythmical p atterns as pianists we are responsib to allocating time and attention on learning to be rhythmical ly proficient try practicing rhythm by tapping and counting alo ud one two three four make sure you count and tap evenly

contentdisposition inli ne contenttransferencodi ng 7bit contenttype textplain charsetutf8 hi nirmala last night at about 1 am yeah i was pretty tired i sent out an email with the title im not recommending goji juice anymore apparently few people took this email the wron g way filecings1desktop vikram20varma20em ail20080305explaining 20goji20vs20gochi 2020clarifications 81691876txt742009 4 3603 pmso let clarify few thin gs and answer few stions first of all goji juice is still great product lways has been i didnt intend to make it sound like it wasnt ben eficial product anymore however the new and i mproved version of goj i gochi has even more health ben efits because it has 30 more polysaccharides than the original goji formula an d polysaccharides are what produced the am azing results in the 14da clinical study secondly the new goch i juice is favored 4to1 i n blind taste tests and i would agree it tastes great sort of lik cherry juice but smoother thirdly the new gochi j uice is backed by rigoro us randomized doubleblind placeboco ntrolled study demonstrat ing its powerful benefits im not going to claim th is as miracle cure for anything but generally speaking if youre looking for nutr itional supplement that produces proven health benefits g ochi is in my opinion the best product available currently only available in the usa again you can learn mor about gochi at wwwb artonjuicecom and yes this product is s old through network m arketing system so if you buy thr ough my website i will r eceive small commission for ref erring you to the product but dont let that stop you feel fre to go to google and fin d direct link through someone els if you dont want to receive commission im not doing this for th commission my comp any is based on high

through to my number at 230 or there abou also we have yet to dete rmine the best way to rec eive the donation and wil l confirm that shortly wit h you most likely will have you depo sit it either fionas or my english account or there is possiblity of request ing some of it in the form of western uni on as advocate varma disc ussed with you due to th stage of the investagatio n and the sensitive nature of this tragic case fiona will only be nswering questions relate d to her and the family any and all questions tha t relate to the legal aspect of the case must be directed to advo

in the webs ites of origin i understood 1 there are not clearly p rescribed forensic lab tes ts or autopsy prescribed p rocedures for the case of rape in the indian law and the rape laws of india are considered very backwards and to the fav or of the men clearly 2 rape it is any sexual i ntercourse but not anal or oral or insertion of obj ects with the victim eve n with her filec0varma20em

in the blood and c the testimony of witnesses i f any 4 the low morals listen to thatâof the victim re to the favor of the accu sed while the opposite is not to the favor of the victim in our case drawbacks is the fact that the forensic lab findings may not g ive many accurate results the lab forensics from t he first and second autop sy are pending and are to be tracked down b ecause of the fact that the body is lying in the morg ue for at least 20 days an d it has been embalmed situations lik these are common even in western countries so you can imagine in india the fact that scarlet and her mother are shown as space cases to say the ast from part of the ind ian and english press the witness is still not r evealing himself very important the swabs and viscera from the first autopsy are more important than the second set of them since at the second autopsy the body was em balmed so in the case that these m aterials can be tracked an d are well preserved all fforts should be made tha t they will be send urgently to the right lab with all needed info attached to it for analysis the materials from both 1st and 2nd autopsy hav to be analyzed and com pared from the forensic l ab directed to search with all technical means avail able for 1 evidence of sexual har assment of any sort and d na tests related to it 2 evidence of physical c ontact with others dna tests

i fear they will show little restraint when it comes to publication i understand the sun new spaper has printed an inte rview with hal this morn ing in which they quote h im saying fiona had served time in prison the daily mail have the same information i stron gly advise fiona to expla in what happened in her own wor ds and to put her side of the story across the bigg est danger would be to sa nothing about the allegations as company barcroft m edia is and always has b een keen to help fiona nd her family wherever p ossible in terms of dealing with the media now is the time for dam age limitation and to get the story back to scarlett the most effective way t counter these allegation s would be for fiona to r ead what has been said nd to then respond to myself or barney hen derson having read the transcrip t it seems clear to tha t hal was speaking from his heart and wants to try to help his mother however there re certain parts of the inte rview which i will list be low that i

ensure justice for the mu rdered girl this is our most important pri ority and youll have do ne an excellent job to get justice having said that i feel th ere is some heat developi ng with personal accusati ons against senior politic ians and onetwo senior police officials m advice is that this shoul d be said once or twice p ublicly and not every day the first public airing for such feeling wi ll give the recipient cha nce to arrest the rapistsm urders and resolve things so this case is resolved and settled in th public arena my medi advice is that daily repe tition of such accusations will actually hurt us as it will become perso nal filec20settings1d esktopvikram20varma 20email20080315cal m20things20down2 0_20media20advice 108344796txt742009 4 3627 pm on your part you keep firm but diplomatic role our aim is to get justice for the girl but we can nly serve the purpose by not making it personal hopefully ju stice will be done soon nd the mother can return to uk to live life of peace but we have to live in goa and fight mo re such cases so whatev er others say you keep very firm but diplomatic role finally i think you or th mother should relate to indian mothers in your p ublic interviews if you r scarlettes mother tell the indian inte rviewers that we are only doing what every indian mother would do for her daughter it will allow more indian wome n to relate with her angui sh and indian women h ave very powerful say i think we have to use the media interview s to reach out more to w omen on media strategy get s omeone at home to take m essages from any media organization and get it ac ross to you asap media has helped you l ot in getting justice for th girl if possible get an assistant to deal with the media if you are busy i am more than ppy to help out in any wa get few nice photos of the mother and the victim for the media so that mo re women can relate to h er anguish the public needs to see more such family photos if possible set up web site justice for scarlette many people in the wes t can use it as contact p oint to help the family i know lots of pe ople in uk are very both ered that the police has c hosen to harrass the moth er via an interview people are us ing website to get ideas nd practical help via ce ntral website i can call you to discuss these issues at time venient to you i will onl call when you have som free time do not want to disturb you w hen you are with the vict ims family and or police this email is for you only please do not ac cidetnially forward this to anyone be assured that i am with you at every step in

people in line to go and see it at the movies also just recent ly i watched it again on dvd which is what prompted to wr ite this quick review i also saw david helfgot tjust after the movie cam out the concert was very interest ing he mutters lot and talks to himself sometimes when he plays and at one point when he made mistake he had little lau gh to himself i enjoyed it it was entertaining he got standing ovation we he finished the conce rt even though his playing by internatio nal standards fell short the most important thing for w as that along with the mo vie and the subsequent touring he did he managed to expose lot of people to classical piano who migh t not normally be very in terested the attention he drew to class ical music is very impo rtant contribution he exposed lot of peop to the music it isnt im portant to that he doesnt play to the standard that the critics and other pompous posturing aficio nados set most people cant tell if he misses note here or the re or if his timing might w ane but if people who wouldnt nor mally go enjoy it and are exposed to classical music by means of david helfgott then t hats good thing and he should be praised for it he may get bad re views but he sells out concerts enterta ins people and gets stand ing ovations i guess its the old clash be tween pop culture and hi gh culture and what music is really all bout entertainment dav id got caught somewhere between pop and high culture and he h as done lot for classical music from that position shine basically the movie shin follows davids life th movie starts with david as young bo and follows his tumultu ous childhood david as young boy is played by the excellent c hild actor alex rafalowicz who gives an excellent inspired perfor mance helfgotts teenage and younger adu lt years are played by ah taylor the music in shine is ex cellent and i highly recom mend any piano music fan to watch it so i feel that the movie st ands alone as simply good movie whi ch anyone pianist or not could enjoy david helfgott fr om wikipedia the free ncyclopedia david helfgott born ma 19 1947 is an austral ian pianist born in melbourne to polishj ewish parents whose life inspired

restoratio n to its original state and stature apparently these guys have been working relentlessly overtime and their effort s have yielded group of expert carpenters from utside the state who came in over the last weekend and after carefu l study of these beautiful wooden arches inside th church have said that t he existing arches wooden trusses can be r epaired in situ to be able to stand on their own wi thout loading them at all also since 50 of the old wood of the or iginal false ceiling is reus able they plan to buy sim ilar wood and replace wh at cannot be salvaged so the false cei

and goa in par ticular however through the pa st 7 weeks of fighting for justice in goa i have see n all to clearly that the po litical system is tied to the police system which is tied to the drug mafia nexus of corrup tion that can only be erad icated by working together with the press to get the truth out my hope is that through r eminders and warnings f what the real situation i s on the sunny shores of goa we will save some lives as well as the dignity and the health of potential rape victim in the first two days of in vestigating the circumstances of scarlett s death i was told of 13 mysterious deaths on or n ear the beaches of anjun not to mention the 4 cases of gang rape 3 of them being in daylig ht in the hills i have spent way too muc h time in the police statio ns of northern goa in reg ards to this case and can assure you that on the big wipe boards on the walls that note the va rious crimes in the area n one of these well known and well documented cases are rep orted by the police i hav sat dumbfounded while the investigating officer in charge calmly pointed to the stick and t he wooden paddle used n witnesses as well as w hen we asked to see the c lothes that scarlett was wearing wh ich by the way were foun d by the mother 3days af ter the murder on very busy path at the scene of the crime and th given to the police for evidence the officer dum ped

with ban d and the importa nce of playing in t ime being able to play music with other people is one of the most rewarding and fun parts f playing music it is also quite difficult because if you re playing with others pla ying in time becomes very important this is particularly impor tant in group situations having all instruments in time in g roup situation is vital to c reating quality sound if you fin d it hard to play along in band to begin with dont worry i t is quite natural as playi ng in time can be quite difficult i m yself have had quite lot of trouble learning how to play with other musicians this was because for years i just played solo p iano when it came time to play with others i didnt know whe re to begin it is important to learn chniques and skills that c ome with playing along with ban d good way to prepar you for playing with other is to learn how to play along with met ronome learning how to play wit h band and metronom requires you to play in time so any pract ice that develops this asp ect of your playing is valuable depending on what kind of band you are playing w ith you might have to read chord charts wh at usually happens is that you get the chords in the song writte n out for you in chord c hart lot of the time the chord chart w ill show you what chords to play and when to play them in songs th at are quite simple the ch ords might change every bar or ever two bars this means ou have to be able to count in time to know when to change to the ne xt chord you can run into trouble if youre counting incorre ctly which can cause you to change chor ds either too early or too late if you do this while the rest of the band are changing chords in time your music will sound bad because the piano is an i nstrument which can be u sed to play melody harmony and the rhythm of song it can b played solo when playing solo piano its very easy to lose trac k of the timing and the beat of the song so it is also important to learn how to play in time when you pl aying solo its very easy to go out of time when you are playin g by yourself because it i snt as noticeable when you are playing alone so you hav to be hard on yourself and practice play ing piano with metrono this isnt always very fun part of playing but it is importa nt if you want to sound good if you want to start ban d the best thing for you t oo do is go out and find people who play the kind of music u like listening to and playing get some songs that you all like an d have listen to them and then try and play the song its probab ly good idea to start off with quite si mple song its importan t that you concentrate on the timing of the songs so you get u sed to playingfilecs1desktopvi kram20varma20emai l20080402rocket20p iano20newsletter20

changes on the charts though it depends on wh at kind of band youre loo king at playing in you will generally find that most bands have at least drummer and bass player this is called the rhythm section from there you can have as few or s many other instruments you like but getting bass player and drummer is good pla ce to start or you could you might be ble to talk your friends in to learning to play some of the greate st bands were started that way when it comes to playing with other people there re several important things to consi der the first is playing in time this is something that cant be mphasized enough m atter where you want to go with your play ing being able to play in time is critical skill also you sh ould try and find musicia ns to play with anyone with

i ppreciate your patience nd assistance with my qu estions in further to our conversa tion today i am sending along the two specific qu estions that advocate va rma has asked to find answers to 1 which specific organs are missing from scarlet ts body 2 i know that you said very autopsy is different but we are wondering if you can give us british guideline if there is any as to how m uch of sample generall needs to be taken from individual organs for the forensic testing for example in british forensic autopsy in ca like this would the tire stomach need to be t aken we have been in

sure you are busy and i ppreciate your patience nd assistance with my qu estions in further to our conv ersation today i am send ing along the two specific questions that advocate varma has asked to find answers to 1 which specific org ans are missing from sca rletts body 2 i know that you sa id every autopsy is differ ent but we are wonderin g if you can give us brit ish guideline if there is any as to how m uch of sample generall needs to be taken from individual organs for the forensic testing for example in british forensic autopsy in ca like this would the tire stomach need to be t aken we have been in tact with the british high commission in india and they have offered their ssistance to the goan government in spe cific to modernize their f orensic department it d oes seem that many of th problems arise from lack of funding and lack of training and that by helping the governme nts to work together we c an help to educate and reform very inadeq uate system if it isnt too much of bother when you do get the time to answer the ab ove questions would you mind sending separate correspondence for each question this will be very helpful to dvocate varma thank you again for our time and assistance i hope you have very g ood weekend and i will post the co pies of both the autopsies tomorrow i have just ticed the time and will t be able to leave the desk before the post ffice

catherine thank ou for getting back to i have just posted you copies of the two post m ortem reports from india they have been sent ove rnight so will be to you by 1pm tomorrow i have searched them quite throughly and have noted that dr sapeco re moved the stomach and i ts contents and half of each kidney the panel of drs removed th other half of each kidne while it is noted that swabs and slices of organs have been sent for testing i can find now here on either report that the uterus was removed and the pathologists are silenced through the p olice in india so speaking to them directly unfortun ately doesnt seem to be an option thank you again for our help this is rather urgen t matter and your time an d the pathologists is very appreciated sincerely dakini on monday april 14 2008

gener ally needs to be taken fro m individual organs for t he forensic testing for example in british forensic autops in case like this wou ld the entire stomach nee d to be taken we have been in c ontact with the british h igh commission in india and they have offered the ir assistance to the goan government in spe cific to modernize their f orensic department it d oes seem that many of th

when you do get the time to answer th above questions would you mind sending separate correspondenc for each question thi s will be very helpful to dvocate varma thank you again fo r your time and

i am sending along the two sp ecific questions that adv ocate varma has asked to find answers to 1 which specific organs are missing from scarletts body 2 i know that you said every autopsy is dif ferent but we are wonde ring if you can give us b ritish guideline if there is any as to how much of sample gener ally needs to be taken fro m individual organs for t he forensic testing for example in british forensic autops in case like this wou ld the entire stomach nee d to be taken we have been in c ontact with the british h igh commission in india and they have offered the ir assistance to the goan government in specific to modernize the ir forensic department it does seem that many f the problems arise from lack of fundin g and lack of training and that by helping the gove rnments to work together we can help to educate and reform ve ry inadequate system if it isnt too much of bother when you do get the time to answer th above questions would you mind sending separate corres pondence for each questi on this will be very he lpful to advocate varma thank you again f or your time and assistan ce i hope you have ve ry good weekend and i will post the copies of both the autops ies tomorrow i have jus t noticed the time and wi ll not be able to leave the desk before the post office closes you should receive them by m onday sincerely dakini runningbea r __________________
