classified by deputy chief of mission arnold chacon for reasons 14 b and d 1 sbu summary hot issue in the spanish press since 2005 the detainee transfer flights that allegedly transited spain from 2002 until 2006 have once again hit the headlines the most recent flurry of reporting began november 30 when pais spains leading newspaper printed several stories based on internal gos documents purporting to relate us requests in 2002 for permission to use spanish airports should an emergency arise on flights transporting terrorism detainees to guantanamo although gos officials past and present continue to deny knowledge of any illegality this longrunning saga could have implications for our agreement on defense cooperation adc end summary the story that will not die 2 sbu the guantanamo detainee flight story has long since become press staple in spain the story appears on front pages starting in pais and disappears every two or three months an investigation is underway in spanish court brought by an ngo which claims illegally detained persons were transported via spain the press reporting almost invariably mixes socalled cia flights and us military flights via rota and moron of which there are thousands annually indiscriminantly it also draws heavily on claims by various ngos interested in guantanamo and presents their allegations as fact eg lists of aircraft tail numbers from planes alleged to have passed through spain carrying detainees the progress of the case appears desultory and that translates into periodic rash of stories each time the judge receives new information say from air traffic control authorities or the spanish mod naturally allowance is made in the press for the fact that guantanamo aside from being home to the detention facility is also us military base visited by routine logistical flights leaks 3 sbu the current iteration of the story is the most virulent so far it began november 30 when pais reported document recounting 2002 meeting between the thenspanish mfa director general for north america and the embassys politicalmilitary counselor nfi in which the us asked to use spain as an emergency landing destination for flights moving detainees from afghanistan to guantanamo the newspaper also described second document from the same mfa official addressed to the mod secretary general for defense policy expressing the mfas willingness to grant the us request and suggesting use of discreet military airport such as moron in related article december 3 pais published february 2007 letter from the spanish president of the joint permanent committee which manages implementation of the adc asking the us section to confirm that the us was in compliance with article 252 of the adc with respect to us military flights to and from guantanamo that article exempts from blanket flight clearances any plane carrying persons or cargo that would be controversial for spain the newspaper also published the us section response which was in the affirmative note in march 2007 the mod decided that all flights to and from guantanamo would require individual clearances that is the procedure in use today know nothings 4 sbu trying to get ahead of the story fm moratinos announced december 1 the formation of an independent investigative team including the chiefs of staff to the fm the secretary of state for foreign affairs and the undersecretary of state for foreign affairs as well as the fms parliamentary advisor on december 2 moratinos confirmed press reports the investigative team has not been able to locate the original of the 2002 document described in paragraph 1 although pais has printed facsimile this has only added to the governments embarrassment 5 c president zapatero and his cabinet have let it be madrid 00001280 0022 of 003 known that they had knowledge of any arrangements the previous administration that of jose maria aznar might have made with the us this tactic could be effective but is blunted by allegations the flights continued into 2006 well into zapateros first term given the socialists consistent outspoken antiguantanamo line it would be political disaster if they were shown to have winked at detainee flights it would be only somewhat less damaging if they were perceived to be so incompetent they did not notice the flights moratinos has denied any knowledge two former zapatero mods current president of congress jose bono and current senior socialist party congressional spokesman jose antonio alonso have said they knew of illegal us activity in spain the opposition popular party pp the party aznar led has accused the zapatero administration of leaking documents in an effort to discredit them and to distract public attention from zapateros alleged mishandling of the ailing spanish economy the pp has also pointed out that of two of the alleged flights occurred under aznar and nine came under zapateros presidency pp leader mariano rajoy has told the press he knew nothing about the flights although he was first vice president in aznars government at the time of the alleged agreement unsubstantiated rumor claims the leaker is the head of spains national intelligence center who is allegedly trying to pressure his former mentor bono into supporting renewal of his term as director we put little credence in such rumors but they give sense of how heated this has become adding to zapateros discomfort the small but noisy farleft party united left is in full cry over the story subpoenas 6 sbu the prosecutor handling the related court case indicated last year that there was plan to request information from the usg ref however the latest round of stories has included speculation that the court might seek testimony from aznar and members of his administration as well as from us embassy officials we have received official notification of any such requests and consider it unlikely comment 7 c beyond the fact that it sells newspapers there are variety of reasons for this storys longevity although antiamericanism in spain is more theoretical than practical the spanish people fundamentally like the us and want strong relations and the spanish government is anxious to establish closer ties with the incoming us administration there remains an important segment in the media that is oldschool european left more importantly the leftofcenter press here enjoys bashing aznar and his party especially for their support for the war in iraq additionally although itself leftofcenter pais has its differences with zapatero and may not mind inflicting pain on him as well as aznar neither is pais very fond of moratinos 8 c whatever the motive the continual media muddling of socalled cia flights and us military flights is unhelpful the adc provides us the extremely valuable use of two military bases in southern spain midway between the continental us and the theaters of operation in afghanistan and iraq to the extent our adc which generally receives little public attention in spain is hauled onto the front pages in connection with the detention facility at guantanamo we run the risk of seeing political support for the adc and our milmil relationship undermined by unfortunate coincidence the adc was already in the press in recent weeks thanks to mod chacons repeated references to her hope that the us would elevate it to the level of treaty septel 9 c in general we have taken the approach that the less said by us to the press on the overflight topic the better the mfa north america desk has told us in the past that they strongly prefer the embassy not say anything fearing it might stir the pot in any case our ability to beat down this story is constrained by the fact that we do not ourselves know factually what might have transpired five or six years ago as the battles in afghanistan and iraq began madrid 00001280 0032 of 003 yielding large numbers of potentially dangerous terrorist detainees and unlawful combatants naturally we are not going to answer questions on the activities of intelligence agencies so in any conversation about these issues we run the risk of appearing less than transparent and thus seeming to confirm the medias worst insinuations when we do speak publicly on the issue our mantra is that we have not violated spanish law and have complied fully with the adc needless to say we decline to comment on any leaked internal gos documents we also try at every opportunity to make the larger point about the war on terror and the very difficult choices that are faced when the us captures suspected terrorists on foreign battlefields frankly this is losing argument with spanish public that although attuned to the dangers of terrorism largely rejects the muscular us approach to fighting it overseas 10 c thus far the mod and mfa have done reasonably good job in their public affairs efforts of making clear that they do not believe we have violated the adc the mod issued december 2 statement saying it knew of us military flights that were either illegal or in violation of our bilateral agreements this echoes what mod officials have told us privately eg ref b however we have illusions politicians are not going to throw themselves on grenade to protect predecessor government they despise more than anything these stories are directed at aznar and his party and the damage to us interests is in some measure collateral 11 c our guess is that the story will continue to rear its head every month or two for the foreseeable future it is irresistible copy for spanish editors and aznar is the lefts favorite bogeyman the court case winding its way slowly through the system also provides periodic opportunities to revive it also the release in the us at some point in the future of information relating guantanamo and spain would certainly generate renewed press interest here baring categorical statement from the usg that detainees passed through spain and we understand that might be undesirable from policy standpoint even if factually correct nothing but time is going to make this go away aguirre
