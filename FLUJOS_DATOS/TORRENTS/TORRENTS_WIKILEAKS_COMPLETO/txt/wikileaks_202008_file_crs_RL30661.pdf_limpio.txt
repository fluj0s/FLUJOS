summary government reform and improved management of public resources have been common theme in congressional policymaking over the past decade this report provides an overview of the information technology management reform act itmra of 1996 or as it is better known the clingercohen act although the clinger cohen act is combination of the federal acquisition reform act fara and the itmra this report focuses on the information technology procurement and management reforms only at the time of its passage itmra reflected growing concern that the federal government was not prepared to successfully make the necessary information technology investments to streamline agencies and improve mission performance the itmra repealed the automatic data processing act of 1965 or as it is better known the brooks act the goal of the brooks act was to reform federal information technolog procurement by concentrating purchasing authority within the general services administration gsa however prolonged acquisition cycles and rapid changes in technology eventually diminished the effectiveness of the onesize fitsall approach of the brooks act the major provisions of itmra include eliminating gsas role as the primary agency for setting policy and regulations for federal information technology procurement mandating the creation of chief information officer cio in all of the major federal agencies establishing goals and reporting requirements for the reduction of costs and increase in efficiency through improved information management and creating two pilot programs shareinsavings and solutionsbased contracting to test alternative acquisition approaches several years later some of these issues still have not been completely resolved agency efforts to follow through on the cio provisions have been mixed non competitive salaries high turnover organizational inertia and budgetary control issues have been obstacles to implementation the development of annual performance plans to evaluate the value of information management have been delayed due to measurement problems in addition little progress has been made to utilize the shareinsavings pilot program for information technology procurement some observers believe this is the result of an inability to measure baseline costs poor project selection and lack of agency incentives looking ahead as congress has become increasingly interested in the internet and information technology issues it is possible that some provisions of the clinger cohen act and closelyrelated new concerns may receive attention in the 107th congress some of these issues include the use of reverse auctions to lower procure ment costs the possibility of creating position for federal cio and the potential need for

its passage itmra reflected growing concern that the federal government was not prepared to successfully make the necessary information technology investments to streamline agencies and improve mission performance the itmra repealed the automatic data processing act of 1965 pl 89306 or as it is better known the brooks act although based on very different assumptions than those that precipitated itmra the brooks act was also meant to reform federal information technology procurem ent practices specifically the brooks act was designed to address three problems the first problem was the concern that federal government computer purchasing was contributing to hardware monopoly by single manufacturer at that time the federal government was one of the largest purchasers of computer hardware giving it significant market influence moreover since it was common practice for an agency to buy replacement or additional equipment from the same vendor in order to reduce compatibility problems and upgrade costs there was the possibility that the us government could turn strong competitor into dominant one at the same time there was concern the government was not benefitting from its purchasing power while large companies were able to obtain discounts for bulk purchases the federal government had not channeled its purchasing power to take advantage of such opportunities the solution according to the brooks act supporters was to concentrate the purchasing power with one agency so that it could negotiate more favorable prices the second problem was the passive partial or informal types of leadership in computer equipment and services procurement by the various agencies5 related to this concern the third problem the brooks act was meant to address was the lack of common computing standards among agencies incompatible computer data meant that agencies could not share information easily without reformatting and recompiling the data which at that time was significant undertaking to address these problems the brooks act did the following 1 concentrated central purchasing authority of automatic data processing resources with the general services administr ation gsa 2 tasked the office of management and budget omb with oversight of agency information technology spending 3 mandated that the national bureau of standards nbs now known as the national institute of standards and technology nist set standards for information technology over the next thirty years both the technological and political landscape changed dramatically eventually prolonged acquisition cycles and rapid changes in technology diminished the effectivenes s of the onesizefitsall approach of the brooks act with procurement delays leading to the implementation of obsolete systems and the increasing diversity of agency needs and missions calls for management and procurement reform grew this led to the passage of several laws designed to address variety of perceived administrative and technical deficiencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30661crs3 6see crs report 91533 gov chief financial officers act of 1990 house action on funding limitations for fy 1992 by

fasa authorized the purchase of goods using simplified procedures for procurements of up to 100000 encouraged reliance on commercial products and allowed micropurchases under 2500 to be completed using purchase cards it also allowed agencies to discontinue the practice of awarding contracts solely on the lowest bid and instead be able to consider contractors past performance management skills

government affairs released an investigative report on federal agency compliance with the clingercohen act18 senator thompsons report contained three major findings 1 federal information technology management was suffering due to high turnover of agency cios 2 agencies were not complying with capital investment and planning and performance measures 3 agencies were not utilizing modular or incremental contracting for major information technology investments the report also made 12 recommendations to help federal departments and agencies become in full compliance with the clingercohen

on the proposed benefits of information technology investments in june 2001 senator thompson released two volume report on federal management problems entitled government at the brink urgent federal

several items of concern were highlighted included computer security procurement problems and aligning technology with the role of the agency these and related issues are discussed below recruiting

anticipated benefits of the cio mandate in the clingercohen act one of these factors concerns an agencys ability to recruit cio shortage of qualified cios in both the private and public sector means that many jobs may go unfilled or may be filled with less qualified candidates recruitment problems are compounded by salary and compensation disparities between government and private sector opportunities industry estimates of salaries of private sector cios running comparably sized companies show they may earn 250000 or more per year to help address pay concerns for approximately 33000 federal it workers in the gs5 through gs12 levels the office of personnel and management opm announced special salary scale that would result in salaries increases between seven and 33 percent effective january 1 200121 the lower grade levels which include entrylevel positions for which agencies were having difficulty finding qualified applicants received larger increases while higherlevel positions received smaller increases22 even when an agency can fill its cio position there is little guarantee it will remain filled for long in 1999 after less than three years since itmra went into effect it was reported that more than half of the original cios had left their jobs some industry observers claim that government cio turnover is comparable to that of the private sector where the average corporate cios tenure is less than three years23 however high turnover of top level it managers can adversely affect larger projects requiring long term planning and oversight for example in its september 1998 report to congress regarding the state departments information resource management irm practices the general accounting office gao noted that the state department lacked an integrated information technology infrastructure the gao attributed this in part to the absence of clear technical direction and sense of operational requirements24 the gao also observed that since march 1996 state has had two under secretaries of management one acting chief information officer and two chief operating officers25 during the same time period the office of information management also underwent two major reorganizations more recently in testimony to congress in may 2000 the gao levied similar criticism of the veterans administration va while noting that the va had

organizational and budgetary obstacles recruiting and retaining qualified cios represents only one part of the issue once in place federal agency cios have faced number of organizational and budgetary obstacles29 the clinger cohen act requires that the cio report directly to the agency head and have information resource management as primary function however in many cases this has not occurred in practice results from gao studies of government cios within the first few years of the enactment of the clingercohen act show that it was not uncommon for cios to report to the deputy secretary or other agency head subordinates rather than directly to the secretary in addition cios frequently wore several hats within their agencies for example the first va cio was also the departments cfo assistant secretary for management and the deputy assistant secretary for budget the cio for the department of defense was also the assistant secretary for command control communications and intelligence the departments of commerce education health and human services and justice all combined the responsibilities of the cfo and the cio into one position the gao states that the role of the cio is fulltime leadership position requiring complete attention to information resource management issues30 related to their lack of effective authority are concerns over budgetary control in recent survey of federal information technology it managers several issues were raised regarding the budget process one of the underlying problems cited is the budgetary short term focus when major it

of many organizations some industry observers believe that performance measurement of information technology has been an elusive goal for both the public and private sectors these observers cite the

rl30153 critical infrastructures background and early implementation of pdd63 for more information regarding computer security and critical infrastructuresperformance measures36 some experts suggest that one cause of this problem is that the public sector lacks the marketplace mechanism of profit and loss this focus on nonfinancial program benefits means that information management is still often seen as support function instead of strategic activity the gao also found that it performance measurement is in its infancy and measurement techniques are still evolving partly due to changes in technology37 as result required annual performance plans are still in the preliminary stages of development according to the gao an outgrowth of the difficulties associated with measuring the efficiency and value of information management to an organization is that it puts information management at disadvantage when competing for scarce resources but also when making its case in support of efficiency and effectiveness initiatives38 this can adversely affect the ability of agency heads and cios to fulfill their responsibility to computer securityinformation security as outlined in the paperwork reduction act the clingercohen act and omb circular a130 an october 1999 gao analysis revealed that 22 of the largest federal agencies were not adequately protecting critical federal operations and assets from computerbased attacks39 among other factors the gao identified lack of leadership poor security planning lack of effective control mechanisms and slow response times to security failures the report concluded that the failure of agencies to plan and dedicate resources to computer security creates potential risks for critical infrastructur operations such as telecommunications power distribution and emergency services40 information technology procurement reform sharein savings of the two pilot programs in itmra shareinsavings and solutionsbased contracting the shareinsavings program has attracted the most concern the shareinsavings pilot projects outlined in the clingercohen act of 1996 are cost avoidance programs they are based on plan in which the contractor pays the initial cost of implementing new information technology system and is then paid from the savings generated by the new system the advantage of shareinsavings provisions is that the contractor has the potential to make more money on the contract than if the bid was awarded on fixedcost basis the expectation is that this will lead to greater savings for the contracting

realize the benefits of this procurement method an agency must be able to determine the baseline costs so that savings can be accurately measured while shareinsavingsprograms are considered by many to be forward thinking policies with the potential to reduce spending and improve the quality of services some experts contend that there are number of obstacles to successfully instituting such programs these include being able to determine baseline costs and an agencys willingness to give the contractor more control over the details so the contractor will feel it has chance to achieve the cost savings some observers have asserted that agencies believe congress will reduce their appropriations once the cost savings is verified which while saving the federal government money will not provide any direct benefits to them ie reward hence they believe the agencies have limited incentive to actively pursue such contracts critics of the shareinsavings programs also state that they may create disadvantages for small businesses which do not have the capital outlay to bid on large projects some agencies such as the gsa are cognizant of this issue and try to encourage small business participation through partnering teaming and subcontracting according to steve kelman administrator of the office of federal procurement reform policy from 1993 to 1997 more fundamental reason why shareinsavings projects have not flourished is that some it managers see this as way to promote projects that did not receive budget approval because they were poor business cases with low savings potential this means that projects with the least appeal to contractor s have been or are considered for shareinsavings contract41 encouraged by some members of congress in january 1999 gsas federal technology service fts began its own pilot program to encourage sharein savings contracts governmentwide the gsa expects these types of provisions to be widely used within the next two years the gsas shareinsavings initiative can be viewed as response to the slow growth of the technique since it was first endorsed in the 1996 clingercohen act while the gsa initiative is supportive of clingercohens larger goal to reduce costs and improve efficiency it does not conform with another of clingercohens specific goals to eliminate gsas central role for setting information technology policy sharesavingstype contracts have reportedly been used by some defense department agencies and veterans affairs to procure auditing services to recover overpayments duplicate payments and other accounting errors42 the department of energy also uses savings performance contracts in its federal energy management program femp however the gsa has stated that only the department of education has

december 2001 ofsap entered into two additional shareinsavings contracts to continue its modernization effort the department of education anticipates these new contracts will save an estimated 173 million over ten years through consolidating systems and migrating applications to the internet46 although adoption of shareinsavings procurement opportunities has been slow by the departments and agencies president george w bush and some members of congress continue to express support for its use in his fiscal 2002 budget plan president bush endorsed the expanded use of shareinsavings approaches47 in the 106th congress senator bingaman introduced s3166 the information technology shareinsavings program improvement act of 2000 which was referred to the senate committee on governmental affairs s3166 sought to amend the clingercohen act to provide increased incentives to use the shareinsavings program under the act and to ease the use of such program to this end s3166 would have directed the administrator of gsa to move past the pilot programs and provide general authority to executive agencies to use this procurement method s3166 also would have allowed agencies to use retained savings for the acquisition of information technology without further appropriation and allowed the savings to remain available until expended in the 107th congress bills to facilitate the use of shareinsavings procurement methods have been introduced in both the senate and the house of representatives in the senate on may 1 2001 senator lieberman and 11 cosponsors introduced s 803

chairman of the house committee on government reform subcommittee on technology and procurement policy held hearing on services acquisition reform at which he announced his intention to introduce the services acquisition reform act sara in the near future49 in his opening statement representative davis stated that title iii of sara will focus on enhancing incentives and authorization for the use of innovative contract vehicles including sharein savings contracts50 reverse auctions the relatively lackluster perform ance of the pilot procurement programs authorized by the clingercohen act has not only raised congressional questions about how to fix them but also what other means can be used to improve procurement practices and save costs new option that has recently emerged is the use of reverse auctioning over the internet in reverse auction also sometimes referred to as private auction companies openly bid against each other in real time to win government contract the purpose of reverse auctions is to drive prices down to market levels because reverse auctions emphasize price these types of auctions are appropriate only where priceperformance tradeoffs are clear and easily assessed on may 5 2000 the navy conducted the federal governments first reverse auction over the internet proponents say that not only do reverse auctions offer potential cost savings the navy estimated it saved 289 percent over past prices they are also much quicker the may 2000 reverse auction lasted 51 minutes second reverse auction held on june 30 2000 lasted 30 minutes achieving an estimated cost savings of 22 percent in contrast standard procurement processes involving sealed bids or competitive proposals can take weeks to complete the navy plans to hold two more reverse auctions in august 2000 the gsa is also embracing the use of reverse auctions it plans to have new web site buyersgov available by the end of august 2000 buyersgov is designed to facilitate not only reverse auctions but also efast and quick quote procurement strategies51httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30661crs16 52for more comprehensive analysis of the federal cio issue see crs report 30914 federal

the final version of the bill however the idea of creating federal cio has gained renewed interest during the 106 th congress legislation was introduced in the house calling for the establishment of federal cio position one bill hr 4670 turner would have created federal cio in an office outside of omb established cio council by law rather than by executive order and made the cio head of the

revisited in the 107th congress on may 1 2001 senator lieberman introduced s 803 the egovernment act of 2001 among its many provisions s 803 calls for the establishment of federal cio to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate the federal cio would be in charge of proposed office of information policy and would report to the director of omb s 803 would also establish the cio

customers but have only recently gained notice in the public sector the differences between cio and cto are less clear as both positions continue to evolve with changing business dynamics however the prevailing industry view is that the cto is generally focused outward on the companys impact on its customers54 this is the result of the ctos rise to prominence in dotcom companies whose very existence depends on their ability to channel the benefits of information technology toward their clients in contrast cios reflect the more traditional inward focus on using information technology procurement to streamline internal processe s in practice the responsibilities of the cio and cto are often combined into one position at the time of this writing congress has not addressed the possible utilization of the position of cto as it has for cfos and cios nevertheless as interest in government grows and agencies are focusing more on delivering services to citizens via the internet and other technologically based means the cto concept has gained currency few agencies have already created cto position including the us postal service usps the gsas federal technology service the air force research laboratory and the defense information systems agency consequently it is possible that other agencies may institute the position or that the issue may appear in the near future as part of the larger debate to reform government information technology management in january 2002 norman lorentz began work as the first cto at omb lorentz former usps cto reports to mark forman lorentz has been tasked to lead and coordinate multiple efforts to identify and develop the technological architecture needed to support federal government egovern ment and other information technology initiatives55 the clingercohen act and egovernment one of the main objectives of the clingercohen act was to improve information technology planning and procurement so that the federal government could take greater advantage of advances in technology as egovernment initiatives continue to proliferate and information technology becomes more central to government operations achieving the goals and objectives associated with the clingercohen act may become more critical56 the future growth and evolution of egovernment will depend in part on the ability of departments and agencies to adapt their planning andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30661crs18 decision procedures however the evolutionary nature of egovernment suggests that the reforms themselves may also need to be revisited and
