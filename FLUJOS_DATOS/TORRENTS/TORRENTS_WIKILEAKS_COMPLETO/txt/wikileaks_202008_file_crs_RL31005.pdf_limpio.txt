submitted an amended fiscal year 2002 defense budget request to congress the request totaled 3435 billion in funding for the national defense budget function 329 billion above the amount originally enacted for fy2001 an 11 increase the total included funding for the department of defense and for defenserelated activities of the department of energy and other agencies both house and senate versions of the dod appropriations bill provided the total for national defense that the administration requested to accommodate that level congress adjusted limitations in the 1997 balanced budget act and set aside provisions in this years concurrent budget resolution that were designed to protect the social security surplus with the onset of recession last spring along with higher defense spending and additional federal spending in response to the terrorist attacks and lower revenues due to the tax cut the government is expected to run deficit as well as use all of the surplus generated by social security revenues with the destruction of the world trade center and the extensive damage to the pentagon by terrorists on september 11th congressional concerns shifted from whether the overall federal budget could accommodate higher defense expenditures without spending the budget surplus to adding funding for defense programs that combat terrorism funding to aid the victims and provide for recovery from the attacks for the ongoing conflict in afghanistan and for other programs to combat terrorism was approved in the 40 billion emergency terrorism response supplemental appropriations act pl 10738 that passed congress september 14 2001 of that total dod receives 175 billion of the total funding in the emergency terrorism response supplemental about 44 of

signed by the president on january 10 2002 although there had been broad bipartisan support for adding funds for recovery and response to the september 11 terrorism attacks sharp differences emerged about whether the total amount was sufficient and whether the allocations matched the most critical priorities particularly for new york and other homeland security needs the president however threatened to veto any spendin g measure this year that went beyond the 40 billion faced with this threat both the house and the senate rejected proposals to add more emergency funding to hr 3338 when they passed the bill instead within the 20 billion total that was acceptable to the president the conference bill shifts 34 billion of the 73 billion funds allocated to defense by the administration to homeland security and recovery of new york the conference version of the national defense authorization act for fy2002 was passed by the house and the senate on december 13 2001 and signed by the

the fy2002 dod appropriations act hr 3338 on december 20 2001 the house and the senate passed hr 3338 by 408 to 6 and 94 to 2 respectively in addition to providing the funding requested by the administration for dod the act allocates 20 billion in emergency terrorism response supplemental pl 10738 funding among all federal agencies to combat terrorism and provide aid and recovery to the victims of the attacks the debate on the fy2002 dod appropriations act centered on the allocation of the 20 billion in funding to combat terrorism the conferees resolved the significant differences between the house and senate versions by shifting 43 billion in fundin g requested by the administration for dod to nondefense agencies to combat terroris m and provide aid to new york city efforts in both houses to increase funding for antiterrorism beyond the 20 billion already enacted in the emergency supplemental failed after president bush threatened to veto any bill that exceeded that amount the final version of the bill provides 3172 billion to the department of defense in regular appropriations the dod authorization act s 1438 was passed on december 13 and also provided the amount requested by the administration the authorizers resolved the chief item of contention base closures by delaying the date to 2005 there was little controversy about the total amount of regular appropriations for dod along with funds for military construction and other defens erelated programs the 3172 billion for dod in the final versio n of hr 3338 provides 3433 billion about the same amount in total as requested by the administration because of the recession that began last spring along with accommodating the full defense request emergency spending to combat terrorism and lower tax revenues because of the tax act funding government expenditures in fy2002 will require not only using all of the social security surplus but also returning to deficit spendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs2 background congress provides funding for national defense programs in several annual appropriations measures the largest of which is the defense appropriations bill congress also acts every year on national defense authorization bill which authorizes programs funded in all of the regular appropriations measures the authorization bill addresses defense programs in almost precisely the same level of detail as the defense related appropriations and congressional debate about major defense policy and funding issues usually occurs mainly in action on the authorization because the defense authorization and appropriations bills are so closely related this report tracks congressional action on both measures the annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the department of defense dod including pay and benefits of military personnel operation and maintenanc of weapons and facilities weapons procurement and research and development as well as for other purposes most of the funding in the bill is for programs administered by the department of defense though the bill also provides 1 relatively small unclassified amounts for the central intelligence agency retirement fund and intelligence community manage ment 2 classified amounts for national foreign intelligence activities administered by the cia and by other agencies as well as by dod and 3 very small amounts for some other agencies five other appropriations bills also provide funds for national defense activities of dod and other agencies including the military construction appropriations bill which finances construction of military facilities and construction and operation of military family housing all administered by dod and the energy and water development appropriations bill which funds atomic energy defense activities administered by the department of energy the vahudindependent agenci appropriations bill which finances civil defense activities administered by the federal emergency management agency activities of the selective service system and dod support for national science foundation antarctic research the commercejusticestate approp riations bill which funds national securityrelated activities of the fbi the department of justice and some other agencies and the transportation appropriations bill which funds some defense related activities of the coast guardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs3 1 for an overview of the defense budget process in congress see crs report rl30002 defense budget primer by mary tyszkiewicz and stephen daggett 2 the total amount provided for the national defense function by congress was 3433 billion compared to the administrations request of 3435 billion but the 220 million difference reflected different estimates of spending in mandatory programs status1 on january 10 2002 the president signed pl 107117 hr 3338 the fy2002 dod appropriations act including both the regular funding for defense and the allocation of 20 billion among all government agencies that was provided in the emergency terrorism response supplemental to combat terrorism see hrept 107 350 and table 1a on december 20 2001 the house and the senate passed hr 3338pl 107117 the conference version of the fy2002 department of defense dod appropriations bill although congress provided 3433 billion for national defense close to the total requested by the administration congress reallocated the funding providing 17 billion less than requested for the department of defense and 500 million more for military construction and 750 million more for the department of energys defense programs2 of the 20 billion in emergency supplemental funding that was allocated in hr 3338 dod received 35 billion although pl 107117 hr 3338 makes various changes to the administrations fy2002 request for regular dod appropriations the administrations basic priorities are preserved including substantial increase in overall resources for defense large increase in military pay and full funding of defense health benefits and major jump in spending for missile defense congress does however reduce spending on operations and maintenance on the basis of various pricing adjustments and efficiency measures in order to accommodate increases to the procurement and rdte accounts see below for fuller discussion week earlier on december 13 2001 both houses passed s 1438 the conference version of the fy2002 dod authorization bill see srept 107333 and table 1b the conferees resolved the chief issue

funding to combat terrorism during floor consideration of the bill in both houses the debate centered on the adequacy and allocation of the 20 billion in emergency supplemental funding to combat terrorism in response to concerns raised by members that more funding was needed for the recovery of new york and homeland defense the conferees shifted 43 billion from funding requested by the administration for dod to those purposes several members suggested that the administration could request additional funding for defense in fy2002 supplemental earlier attempts to provide funding above the 20 billion already appropriated were stymied by the threat of presidential veto of the total 40 billion provided by the emergency supplemental dod received 175 billion including 14 billion that was allocated at the discretion of the president and 35 billion that was allocated in the fy2002 dod appropriations act see below3 nondefense agencies received total of 225 billion including 165 billion that was allocated in the fy2002 dod bill within that 165 billion for nondefense agencies the major programmatic emphasis is for recovery for new york and other affected areas 50 billion bioterrorism 28 billion and investigatory activities 23 billion see discussion below and crs report rl31187 terrorism funding congressional debate on emergency supplemental allocations by amy belasco and larry nowels total funding for national defense in fy2002 total funding appropriated for the national defense function in fy2002 including the 35 billion of funding from the emergency terrorism response supplemental that was allocated in the dod bill is 3468 billion see table 2 dod also received 140 billion in funding from the emergency terrorism responsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs5 4 pl 10738 permitted the president to allocate 20 billion of the 40 billion in emergency supplemental funding at his discretion whereas the second 20 billion would not become available until the allocation was included in subsequent appropriation act because additional legislative action was necessary for agencies to receive allotments from the first 20 billion cbo counts or scores allocations of the first 20 billion as fy2001 appropriations since allocations of the second 20 billion required additional legislation that occurred in fy2002 those funds are counted or scored as fy2002 funds 5 the comparison is between the total for national defense originally enacted for fy1981 3232 billion in fy2002 dollars and the final level in fy1982 of 3848 billion when the latepresident reagan came to office he proposed supplemental appropriations for fy1981 and an amended fy1982 budget 6 between 1980 and 1982 funding for national defense grew from 3103 billion to 3848 billion all in 2002 dollars including supplemental funding provided by congress in response to president reagans request in 1981 and the enacted version of reagans amended fy1982 budget see table 10 in crs report rl30976 defense budget for fy2002 data summary final version by mary t tyszkiewiczsupplemental that was distributed by the president see below4 those funds are included in dods fy2001 appropr iations including those funds along with 58 billion provided last summer in nonemergency supplemental funding for national defense in fy2001 totaled 3305 billion or 163 billion below the total for fy2002 since the advent of the new administration resources available to dod have increased by total of 56 billion including 58 billion appropriated in the nonemergency supplemental in late june 2001 326 billion increase for fy2002 provided by congress in the regular defense appropriations as requested by the administration and 175 billion in emergency supplemental funding to combat terrorism president bushs increase in resources for defense of 56 billion or 18 in real growth for defense within year is comparable to the 616 billion or 19 real growth in defense resources added by president reagan between 1981 and 1982 in his first year in office all figures in fy2002 dollars5 in comparison to growth in defense spending between 1965 and 1966 the beginning of the buildup for the vietnam war the additions by president bush are somewhat larger 56 billion compared to 535 billion in 2002 for vietnam6 combined with the emergency funding allocated to nondefense agencies and the impact of the recession that began in the spring of 2001 this additional funding for defense required that congress set aside earlier budgetary guidelines designed to protect the surplus generated by the social security and medicare trust funds and return to deficit spending see belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs6 table 2 national defense function by appropriations bill fy2001 to fy2002 enacted in

members however called for the infusion of immediate resources well above the 40 billion figure with an emphasis on funds for new york city in order to meet the 20 billion allocation directive in pl

for the afghan conflict to increased funding of intelligence and surveillance activities see figure 6 and table 5 under the presidents proposed allocations the defense department would have received

billion was already available to defense from the first 20 billion allocated by the president the remaining 2 billion was in the senate bill21 secretary of defense rumsfeld called on congress to give dod the entire 73 billion requested by the president in order to maintain the presidents priorities for fighting this war in afghanistan and to ensure that dod would not need to curtail training and operations22 in floor debate senator stevens suggested that the department of defense had already received large increase of over 42 billion compared to the previous year and under the emergency supplemental the president could submit requests for additional supplementals for any further requirements to combat terrorism senator stevens also mentioned that the department of defense has authority under the food and forage act section 3732 or title 41 usc section 11 to obligate monies in advance of appropria tions for emergencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs23 23 for senator stevens

conflict in afghanistan to repair and renovation of the pentagon and compares the amounts provided by the house and senate with the administrations request unlike submissions by other agencies and normal budget proposals the funding for dod is appropriated to central fund the defense emergency response fund rather than to individual appropriation accounts in order to give dod additional flexibility and to ensure separate tracking of these emergency funds24 if necessary dod could for example transfer additional funds from one category to worldwide military posture the category that

presidents proposal lacked enough funding for such things as law enforcement bioterrorism preparedness border protection and other homeland security priorities others especially members from new york contended that the presidents plan fell far short of the 20 billion that they anticipated would be allocated out of the 40 billion total to meet the specific needs of new york city virginia and rural pennsylvania where the attacks had the most direct impact they estimated that only about 97 billion was slated for new york still others believed that additional defense resources were required beyond the 73 billion recommended by the administration in the 20 billion plan this issue became more controversial when president bush on november 6 said he would veto the appropriation measure if it exceeded the 20 billion he had proposed house consideration of the defense request although the house provided the same amount as requested by the administration for the department of defense 73 billion hr 3338 shifted more than 600 million in funding from the allocation proposed by the administration to reflect house priorities indicating its policy priorities the house appropriations committee added funds in for precision guided munitions 79 million for equipment for special operations forces 145 million for chemicalbiological protection projects 105 million and other areashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs25 26 although the total amount of funds shifted was 21 billion the net increase was 15 billion because some of the funds had already been slated for new york the major change was to add 1825 billion to hud community development block grants to aid new york businesses to recover from the terrorist attacks by shifting funds from dol programs designed to extend unemployment benefits and health insurance to displaced workers those funds would have been widely distributed across the country see crs report rl31187 terrorism funding congressional debate on emergency supplemental allocations by amy velasco and larry nowels for additional detail on nondefense programshouse consideration of the nondefense request the most significant change during floor debate was the reallocation of an additional 15 billion to new york in the rules committee amendment that reflected an agreement reached between representative walsh and the white house26 with this change some estimated that the total for new york out of the entire 40 billion supplemental would have been about 115 billion the committee also recommended significant increases bioterrorism 600 million and included funds for counterterrorism aid to state and local governments that was not requested 400 million and passenger and baggage screening activities 125 billion that was to be offset by fees collected from passengers and airlines the house also proposed reductions to the presidents nondefense request including transferring funds for dislocated workers assistance 2 billion and fema

proposals to shift funds among categories will require omb approval 29 dod provided the appropriations committees with additional descriptive materials concerning their 73 billion request according to policy guidance funding for afghanistan is to represent incremental operating costs ie taking into account offsets for peacetime exercises funded in the normal budget that would not occur because units are deployed to the conflict period and 35 billion that was provided in dods fy2002 appropriations act27 see discussion above for congressional action on the administrations request table 6 shows the administrations request and congressional action on dods share of the 40 billion using the categories developed by the administration specifically for the emergency supplemental28 those purposes range from support for the conflict in afghanistan to repair and renovati on of the pentagon unlike submissions by the domestic agencies and normal budget proposals the funding for dod is being appropriated to central fund the defense emergency response fund rather than being appropriated to specific accounts funds will be transferred from the central fund to particular accounts in the services this approach was adopted to give dod additional flexibility and to ensure separate tracking of these emergency funds the discussion below describes the rationale for the administrations allocation of funds for congressional action on those allocations see discussion above estimating the cost of the afghan conflict the largest single category in the administrations request was 65 billion to support the higher operating tempo associated with ongoing operatio ns in afghanistan or elsewhere categorized by dod as increased worldwide posture since the funding is not specifically tagged for afghanistan but rather for higher operating costs the administration can use the funding for operations elsewhere that funding covers the cost of higher operating tempo for forces that are deployed the cost of airlifting supplies and setting up operations and additional pay for activating reservists and for activeduty forces eg hazardous duty pay according to dod that 65 billion request represented rough estimate of the additional funding that may be necessary to conduct operations in afghanistan for six months or until midmarch 2002 the estimate reflected 15 increase above normal operating tempo costs ie for unit training and related areas of all of dods forces rather than the number and makeup of forces likely to be deployed and is intended to ensure funding for the afghan conflict through midmarch after the convening of the next congress29 with rapid and unpredictable changes in the situation in afghanistan any estimate of costs is uncertain and initial estimates are likely to be revised in the coming months the department of defense has not released any estimates of costs incurred in the conflict thus far this funding is to be administered centrally by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs27 department of defense with the services submitting requests as expenses for deployments and other areas are incurred improving intelligence and surveillance the second largest category of funding 58 billion referred to by dod as increased situational awareness covers classified programs including upgrades to reconnaissance platforms aircraft unmanned vehicles communications stations and improvements to intelligence collection and processing early reports suggested that the funding would include the purchase of additional unmanned vehicles such as rc135 and ep3 reconnaissance aircraft assets in heavy use in afghanistan enhancing physical security an additional 24 billion has been requested by dod for enhanced force protection to purchase variety of selfdefense weapons and sensors for ships aircraft and other forces upgrades to and more physical security systems at bases and increases in the number of activeduty military personnel doing security duty at bases some of the purchases were based on the recommendations of the cole commission which reported on ways to improve security after the terrorist attack on the uss cole purchasing more precision guided munitions dod requested another 2 billion for offensive counterterrorism to purchase additional precisionguided missiles and other munitions tomahawks jdams alcms laserguided bombs that are being heavily used in the bombing attacks in afghanistan these expensive missiles are the weapon of choice in conflicts where the military is particularly concerned about accurate targeting the funding level in the supplemental was set to buy the maximum number of missiles that could be produced by defense contractors in fy2002 rather than specific estimate of the number that would be used in the conflict improving command and communication systems dod requested another 15 billion to improve connections both within the military and to local state and federal governments repairing the pentagon repair renovation and removal of debris at the pentagon as well as leasing of temporary space was anticipated to cost another 15 billion aiding new york patrolling the coasts and protecting airports the initial response to the bombing of the world trade center as well as the new mission of conducting combat air patrols off the east and west coasts and stationing national guard personnel at airports was estimated to cost almost 1 billion the additional funding provided to dod in the supplemental appeared to include mixture of onetime or temporary expenses such as the cost of the conflict in afghanistan and repair of the pentagon accelerations in current programs now given higher priority and recurring costs reflecting longerterm changes in mission in the months and years ahead congress may assess whether these programmatic changes are permanent requiring continuing investments in people equipment or facilities or whether dod will need to reorient its missions and

funding to combat terrorism there is consensus about either the definition of activities that are designed to combat terrorism or the categories to use to describe spending for those activities some use the term homeland defense for programs designed to combat terrorism in its 2002 report to congress omb uses set of categories for spending to combat terrorism that differs from those used by the department of defense for its current spending in response to the terrorist attacks making comparison between previous and current spending impossible based on the reporting provided thus far see below in an amended version of its august 2001 report to congress omb estimated that the national security community funding to combat terrorism in fy2001 totaled 55 billion or 57 of that total30 that total includes funding for both the department of defense and intelligence agencies for security reasons omb did not segregate the portion for the department of defense the omb report also estimates that dod was spending an additional 18 billion in fy2001 to protect critical infrastructure such as computer and communications networks for fy2002 the administrations estimated request for funding for the national security community to combat terrorism was 64 billion or 930 million more than the previous year this revised estimate reflected the amended budget request sent to congress by the president on june 27 rather than the initial current services estimate included in ombs annual report to congress that was issued in august 2001 table 7 shows the revised estimates from omb using set of categories that apply to all government agencies the table below divides dods spending into five categories law enforcement and investigative physical security of government physical security of

activities and 31billion for physical security of government see table 6 funding for law enforcement as described by omb includes all monies provided to dods investigative services and military police even though some of those assets may not be specifically directed against terrorism in similar fashion the funding for physical security includes protection of federal facilities including those located overseas where dod has substantial presence along with the state department the remaining funding included 249 million for preparing for and responding to terrorist attacks and 199 million for rd the total for preparing for and responding to terrorist attacks includes funding to protect dod facilities against attacks that rely on weapons of mass destruction wmd and dods role as coordinator of the actions by federal state and local agencies who are the first to respond to terrorist incidents rd efforts include funding to develop responses to biological warfare and dods contribution to interagency efforts to develop new technologies and equipment to counter terrorism because dod adopted unique set of categories in its request under the emergency terrorism response supplemental and because few details are available about the composition of both sets of categories it is difficult if not impossible to compare funding to combat terrorism before and after the september 11th

tables accompanying budget committees lay out revised budget outlook principles for continuedchanges in the budgetary context since the terrorist attacks since the terrorist attacks of september 11 the budgetary context for decisions on spending levels for federal programs has changed dramatically at the beginning of september leaders of both parties were debating whether higher spending for discretionary programs including an additional 184 billion above the administrations initial request for the department of defense could be accommodated after the tax cut in the spring without tapping the surplus generated by social security revenues with the recession that began in the spring of 2001 and the new spending to combat terrorism the possibility of keeping the social security surplus offlimits has disappeared and both the administration and the congressional budget office are predicting deficit spending in 2002 and 200331 in august 2001 cbo estimated that the total surplus in 2002 would be 176 billion see table 8 with all but 2 billion resulting from the surplus in social security revenues32 the lower cbo estimate reflected primarily the effects of the tax decreases enacted in the spring as well as the downturn in the economy33 with higher funding for dod as well as other agencies under consideration it was likely that congress would have to tap the surplus in the medicare hospital insurance fund hi and social security revenues after the attacks of september 11 however with the new concern about combating terrorism and the ongoing conflict in afghanistan the fiscal debate shifted from the potential problem of tapping the social security surplus to adding funding for defense programs and homeland security that additional spending coupled with the recession made worse by the terrorist attacks made that prospect inevitable likely reductions in the surplus bipartisan estimate budget committees lay out revised surplus estimates released on october 4 2001 by the house and senate budget committees suggested that the effects of recession coupled with additional emergency spending to combat terrorism as well as additional discretionary spending for defense

the experience of the 19901991 recession those estimates have turned out to be too low36 new predictions from cbo in its latest update in january 2002 predict that economic and technical changes will reduce the surplus by 242 billion rather than 80 billion as predicted by the budget committees last october37 on the other hand the estimate of 686 billion for total discretionary spending 10 billion in outlays more than assumed in the concurrent budget resolution turned out to be correct as congress did in fact conform to the agreement reached between the president and congress to allow 246 billion more in new discretionary budget authority 184 billion more for defense 4 billion more for education and 22 billion more for disasters that would together increase government outlays by about 10 billion38 although congress also conformed to the 40 billion emergency supplemental as assumed in the october estimates of antiterrorism spending in future years are uncertain estimates by the budget committee staff estimates below generally assumed continuation of the policies agreed to in 2002 for example continuation of 686 billion with increases for inflation for discretionary spending and an additional 20 billion for emergency antiterrorism spending each year other potential claims on the surplus the two budget committees also noted that congress is considering variety of other changes to current entitlement programs and tax policies that could place additional demands on the budget those policy changes ranging from additions for the farm bill to coverage of prescription drugs for seniors and changes to the alternative minimum tax could reduce the surplus further see table 9 in addition because of lack of consensus the budget committees did not include two other changes that could place large additional demands on federal spending an economic stimulus package that could reduce revenues by 50 billion to 100 billion and additional unspecified increases for the

billion in funding from the emergency terrorism response supplemental that had to be included in an appropriation act see discussion above enacted version of dod appropriations bill for regular defense appropriations the enacted version of hr 3338 provides dod with 3172 billion 17 billion below the administrations request congress reduced the amount for dod in order to provide higher funding for defenserelated activities that are funded in the department of energy 750 million military construction 500 million and defenserelated activities that are funded in other appropriations 200 million see table 2 with these adjustments the 3433 billion appropriated by congress for national defense including all defenserelated funding is close to the total requested by the administration39 congress also significantly changed the allocation of the emergenc response terrorism supplemental funds in the enacted bill by reducing the administrations request for emergency spending for dod from 73 billion to 35 billion and shifted those funds to homeland security and recovery activities on the nondefense side the chief changes in funding for homeland defense activities are doubling of the administrations funding requests for bioterrorism law enforcement and infrastructure security activities on the defense side the enacted version halves the administrations request for funding for intelligencerelated activities higher operating tempo related to the afghan war and homeland defense and efforts to protect dod facilities personnel and weapons see discussion above throughout the

also does not transfer missile defense programs to separate title as provided in the house bill provision that is opposed by the administration see below savings in operation and maintenance like the house the senate appropriators include several general provisions that would reduce funding for operation and maintenance om for pricing adjustments or savings as result of management reforms while preserving funding in readinessrelated programs in the senate version these adjustments total 19 billion in om for contract savings travel and foreign currencies less than half the amount that is included in the house bill see below proposal on tanker aircraft the senate appropriations committee also included potentially controversial provision to lease commercial transport aircraft for up to ten years and eventually convert them to military tanker aircraft as written the language in the bill was categorized by cbo as an operating lease which permits congress to fund the proposal on an annual basis rather than provide 20 billion in funding upfront as would be required in leasepurchase arrangement an operating lease however can only be used for commercial assets but the aircraft would need to be modified for use as military tankers modification permitted by the legislation at later date the validity of this approach was debated on the senate floor the house bill does not have similar provision major procurement programs both the senate and the house version of the bill fullyfunded the air forces f22 captor program and criticized the navy

staff and factoflife changes eg lower utilities rates42 this amount is considerably larger than similar savings included in the senate bill and is opposed by the administration major procurement programs the house bill added funding for an additional ddg51 ship 820 million to offset decrease of 493 million in the rdte for the dd21 the new surface combatant eliminated one lhd1 amphibious assault ship 267 million and funded the conversion of four rather than two trident submarines from strategic platform to cruise missile carrier 463 million like the senate the house also added about

billion and reallocates those funds to military construction 600 million and defenserelated activities of the department of energy 600 million passage of the fy2002 dod authorization act was delayed by the difficulty in resolving the issue of authorizing another round of base closures in 2003 as proposed by the administration initially the house opposed an additional round and the senate supported another round44 in the final compromise included in the conference version congress agreed to authorize round of base closures but delayed the date until 2005 as part of the compromise the conference version also requires that supermajority of at least seven of the nine commissioners approve any decision to add bases to those suggested by the secretary of defense45 during house floor debate several members raised concerns about the base closure provision on the senate side the chief concern raised during floor debate was the potentially stabilizing effects of president bushs decision to withdraw from the abm treaty announced on december 13 particularly at time of rapid buildup in the uss ballistic missile defense program an increase that was largely endorsed by congress in the 2002 budget completion and passage of the conference report was also delayed by the need to resolve the issue of the navys access to the training vase at vieques see below and by the debate about the allocation of emergency supplemental spending see above earlier congressional action on fy2002 defense authorization and appropriations bills had been delayed because the administration did not submit its amended request until june 27 because of the ongoing review of military strategy and because of the evacuation of congress due to the delivery of anthraxladen

approves the presidents request for another round of base closures but delayed the date to 2005 and changed the procedures proposed by dod authorizes the secretary of the navy to close the training facilities at vieques and transfer the facility to the department of the interior after certifying that alternative training sites are available provides 70 billion for ballistic missile defense as requested by the president but authorizes the president to transfer 13 billion of that total to efforts to combat terrorism permitting the president to fund the request fully adopts provisions that reduced nonreadiness related spending for operation and maintenance by 21 billion and working capital funds by 400 million to reflect savings in management reforms fuel and utility prices foreign currency decreases46 the conference version of the bill also authorizes the increases in pay 5 acrosstheboard and up to 10 for targeted skills and housing allowances as requested by the administration and fully funds the increase for the defense health program including the new benefit for seniors tricare for life the conference bill also increases funding beyond that requested by the administration for military construction and family housing and equipment and training for the reserve components congress also authorizes 212 billion in emergency funding to combat terrorism see above providing an upward limit on spending47 combining the funding allocated at the administrations discretion with the amounts provided by the appropriators dod received total of 175 billion as discussed above although the act endorses the proposal to authorize military retirees to receive va disability compensation without reduction in retirement benefits known as concurrent receipt the bill provides that the program will not go into effect until the president submits legislation and congress offsets the 55 billion in costs over the next 10 years see below dod objects to this additional benefit both because of its high cost and because the two programs retirement and disability payments werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs43 48 dod estimated that concurrent receipt would require an additional 41 billion in mandatory spending which would have to be offset by cuts to other entitlement programs and 14 billion in additional costs to the department of defense see letter

action on s 1438 fy2002 dod authorization bill the house matched the total amount requested by the administration and made relatively few changes to individual programs house floor action after considering the dod authorization bill hr 2586 on september 20 24 and 25 the house passed the bill by vote of 39817 the act provided total of 3435 billion for the national defense function matching the administrations request the rules committee limited the number of floor amendments and debate was less extensive because of the bipartisan support for defense spending in response to the terrorist attacks49 the major amendments passed were the following an add of 250 million for testing of the f22 aircraft 400 million increase for combating terrorism that was offset by cuts to bmd programs and consulting services see discussion above and an amendment offered by representative traficant permitting the secretary of defense to assign activeduty military personnel to assist with border patrol other amendments that were passed would 1 permit military installations to be used as polling places 2 allow private donations to repair the pentagon and 3 establish new medal to be awarded to civilians who are killed or wounded as result of hostile action see summary tables a2 and a3 for changes to major weapon system programs markup by house armed services committee the house armed services committee markup of hr 2586 provided 3435 billion for the national defense function generally endorsing the administrations request in military personnel the committee not only supported the administrations requests for substantial improvements in military pay but also provided for other improvements in compensation and health care in the case of funding for operation and maintenance om the committee supported the administrations request for additional funding for readinessrelated funding but cut nonreadiness related om by about 1 billion and redistributed some of those funds to enhancement of training of reserve forces see below for more detailed discussions of individual issueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs44 50 see subtitle c missile defense sections 221 to 224 these provisions also included reporting requirements for missile defense programs 51 the senate passed s 1438 after debate over six days september 21 24 25 and october 1 and october 2 the committee provided 474 billion for rdte 300 million more than the administrations request and supported all but 135 million of the presidents request for 82 billion for missile defense see crs report rl31111 missile defense the current debate coordinated by steven hildreth and amy f woolf the committee also added 525 million to the administrations request for procurement funds citing it as the weakest link in the administrations budget because decisions about modernization are awaiting completion of the quadrennial defense review senate action on s 1438 fy2002 dod authorization bill although the senate bill s 1438 provided total funding of 3448 13 billion above the administrations request the senate initially included more changes likely to be controversial in bipartisan compromise however the most controversial provisions requiring congressional approval of antiballistic missile testing were removed prior to floor debate see below senate floor action on october 2 as bipartisan compromise in the wake of the terrorist attacks the senate considered new version of the dod authorization act on the floor that stripped the bill of controversial provisions the new version s 1438 replaced s 1416 the bill that was reported out of committee the new version passed unanimously the compromise version longer required that the president to certify and congress to approve the funding of any activity that could violate the abm treaty50 the president had threatened to veto the bill if these provisions were included those provisions were included in separate bill s 1439 the senate permitted the president to restore 13 billion in funding cut from ballistic missile programs by authorizing the president to allocate those funds either to combating terrorism or to the bmd program compromise that was adopted in the final version of the bill that change increased the total amount authorized to 3448 billion or 13 billion above the administrations request the senate passed s 1438 by vote of 97 0 on october 251 in floor action the senate included the following significant amendments adopted provision restoring 13 billion that the senate armed services committee cut from ballistic missile defense bmd programs and allowing the president to allocate those funds to either rdte for bmd or combating terrorism and rejected an amendment that would have removed provisions adopted by the senate armed services committee providing for new round of base closures in 2003 and adopted the reid amendment permitting concurrent receipt of benefits for military retirees with serviceconnected disabilities that would increase entitlement spending by 29 billion in fy2002 byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs45 52 this accrual funding where the agency is required to include the anticipated cost of providing benefits to its current members is also used to fund military retirement the cost of providing the benefit to current recipients is mandatory spending that is not part of the dod budget 53 the senate armed services committee exempted the funding requested for military pay and defense health which totals 36 billion out of the 184 billion increase requested on june 27 by the administration see section 1302 of s 1416 allowing eligible persons to receive both retirement and va disability payments without the reduction required in current law longterm effect of expanded benefits to veterans authorizing concurrent receipt to improve the benefits received by military retirees with service connected disabilities would have significant effect on future budgetary requirements for the government as whole according to cost estimates from cbo authorizing concurrent receiptof both retirement benefits and va disability payments without requiring an offset to those eligible for benefits under both programs would increase mandatory or entitlement spending by 29 billion in fy2002 and 406 billion over the next ten years in addition the defense department would have to provide about 1 billion annually to cover the estimated cost of providing this benefit in the future for service members currently in the force52 the house version of the bill contained the language that was originally included in the senate bill which stated that the benefit would not be provided until the administration provided an offset to cover the mandatory or entitlement spending the administration supports current law markup by senate armed services committee like the house armed services committee the senate armed services committee markup of s 1416 provided 3433 billion for the national defense function the same amount as the administrations request the senate armed services committee however required that authorization of 152 billion of the administrations 184 billion increase would be contingent upon approval of additional funds for defense by the chair of the senate budget committee as provided in the fy2002 concurrent budget resolution see section below for more detailed discussion of the budget resolution53 the senate armed services committee also adjusted the administrations request to reflect the committees priorities see summary tables a2 and a3 for changes to major weapons programs the committees markup included the major changes outlined below the committee added funds in the following areas 450 million for family housing and military construction 250 million for military compensation primarily to reduce outof pocket housing costs for military personnel 400 million for procurement of additional helicopters and other equipment 307 million to convert four trident ballistic missile submarines ssbns to carry tomahawk cruise missiles 625 million more for theater missile defense systems like pac3 and thaadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs46 over 800 million for transformational rdte programs including over 250 million for science and technology programs over 600 million for new initiatives to deal with nontraditional threats including over 200 million to combat terrorism see section below and 270 million to operation and maintenance to improve readiness at the same time the senate armed services committee reduced the administrations request in the following areas 590 million less for the v22 tiltrotor osprey aircraft 247 million less for the joint strike fighter 13 billion less for ballistic missile defense and 16 billion reduction for savings from management efficiencies to improve the efficiency of defense operations and managem ent the committee also authorized another round of base closures in 2003 and directed the defense department to save 16 billion by applying best commercial practices and improving defense management dod was directed to achieve that 16 billion

3248 billion in new budget authority for the national defense budget function which includes department of energy defenserelated activities and defenserelated activities of other agencies as well as of the department of defense to allow for further increases in defense the resolution used the mechanism of reserve funds separately administered in the house and the senate to accommodate increased

well as other changes the downturn in the economy and additional spending in response to the terrorist attacks it will be impossible to accommoda the defense increase without tapping social security

strategy assuring us allies dissuading competitors from challenging the us or our allies deterring aggression and defeating adversaries decisively should deterrence fail59 citing the unpredictability of threats in the postcold war world the qdr called for adopting capabilitiesbased strategy rather than regional approach oriented to conflicts in two particular regions ie the two major regional conflicts endorsed in the previous qdr under capabilities approach the military would focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than specifically whom the adversary might be or where war might occur60 in light of the september terror attacks the report called for restoring the emphasis once placed on defending the united states and its land sea air and space approaches61 at the same time us military forces are still to be prepared to defeat attacks in two theaters of operation in overlapping time frames with decisive defeat in one theater and holding the enemy in the second as well as being ready to conduct smallerscale contingencies sscs of varying durations62 in the new capabilities approach however us military forces are to emphasize information operations ensuring us access to distant theaters and defending the united states despite the shift in approach the qdr did not propose any changes in the current force structure or military end strength unlike most of the report which is very general the qdr specifically required the services to make plans to redeploy forces to reorient the global posture of the us to give additional emphasis to the middle east and south asia rather than the current emphasis on western europe and northeast asia for example the secretary of the air force is tasked to develop plans to base more forces in the arabian gulf63 calling for

intelligence and space strengthening joint operations command and control and training selectively replacing current equipment and reforming dod management and acquisition practices to achieve efficiencies including achieving 35 billion in savings through consolidations citing the new requirements arising from the september terrorist attacks the qdr abandoned previous plans for gradual

27 2001 69 ibid and dod news briefing on amended budget for fy2002 june 27 2001 cited abovechief areas that grew in the amended request included defense health65 the amended budget included an additional 37 billion for the expanded health care coverage that congress authorized last year for military retirees over the age of 65 see below for more detail about the tricare for life program and 26 billion more to cover expanded benefits and higher costs for dependents of activeduty personnel the administ ration claimed that this reflects more realistic estimates for pharmacy costs and contracts for managed care66 optemporelated activities and depot maintenance for the dayto day training of military units typically referred to as optempo related activities the new budget provided an additional 2 billion67 that 15 boost in funding over the fy2001 level did not necessarily mean higher pace of training of operational units except for naval aviation units but rather more funding for the purchase of spare parts higher levels of depot repair and improving firing ranges in response to concerns raised by military leaders about shortfalls that could affect readiness 68 an addition 13 billion for depot maintenance 20 increase was also intended to improve readiness base support another 28 billion proposed addition in om was for base support 16 above last years level69 the

within om grew by about 10 procurement funding the fy2002 amended budget included 616 billion for procurement of new weapon systems 05 billion below last years level procurement spending largely

housing programs designed to maintain and modernize the defense infrastructure were slated for increases of 11 06 billion and 14 05 billion respectively the administration justified the increase for military construction as part of longterm initiative to improve the condition of facilities at the same time the administration proposed an efficient facilities initiative including round of base closures in fy2003 coupled with expansion of new way to share the use of land and facilities on military facilities based on pilot project at brooks air force base after much debate congress approved new round of base closures and agreed to an expanded pilot program of the brooks air force base initiativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs57 major issues in the fy2002 amended defense budget several issues emerged as key matters of debate on the fy2002 defense budget though the salience of some of these issues changed in response to the september 11 terrorist attack and new issues emerged about the appropriate role for the department of defense in combating terrorism and the changes in funding should flow from that role see discussion above about funding to combat terrorism major issues raised during this years debate on the defense budget included was the 3435 billion requested by the new administration the appropriate amount relative to defense needs and could that amount be accommodat ed without dipping into the medicare surplus in fy2002 was increased funding of over 60 and proposed restructuring of the ballistic missile defense program appropriate and how would the administrations plans affect the antiballistic missile treaty abm was funding for procurement slightly below last years level adequate what if any implications arise from the rapid growth in defense health costs were the large proposed increases in operation and maintenance funding necessary to support readiness and will higher funding for om squeeze out other defense needs in the future variety of other important issues ranging from the level of military compensation to finding alternatives to navy live fire training on vieques were also be considered and are discussed in later sections of this report accommodating the fy2002 increase within budget constraints the administration characterized the defense budget increase in fy2002 as an initial down payment designed to make up for several years of shortfalls in funding of the daytoday requirements of the services some argued that the increase was insufficient in response to request from representative skelton the ranking minority member in the house armed services commit tee the military services submitted list of unfunded requirements that totals another 32 billion in fy2002 the total for this list was twice as large as that submitted by the services last year supporters of higher funding argued that the administrations request did not correct shortfalls in longterm funding for weapon systems designed to recapitalize and modernize the force an issue that has been the focus of debate in recent years members of the defense committees expressed their dissatisfaction with the procurement levels proposed in the amended request others however argued that the administrati ons request could not be accommodated without dipping into the surplus generated by the medicare hospital insurance fund or shortchanging competing demands for higher funding forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs58 72 the fy2002 congressional budget resolution establishes reserve funds in each house to allow higher levels

exercised by revising the 302a allocations to the appropriations committees which are the mechanism by which the budget committees implements the targets included in the resolution on the senate side as long as the medicare surplus would not be reduced the chair of the budget committee can approve higher levels if the president submits an amended request and the authorizing and appropriating committe report bills with higher levels based on the recommendations of the presidents national defense review see section 217 in hconres 83 may 10 2001 the same restriction on dipping into the medicare surplus applies on the house side and the chair of the budget committee can consider the recommendation s of the presidents national defense review and other administration policy or budget submissions 73 see section 217 of hconres 83 hrept 10760 p 2425 for the reserve fund for defense in the senate the limitationabout dipping into the medicare hi surplus applies to all reserve funds except for medicare where the surplus in the hospital insurance fund can be used to finance new prescription drug benefit as long as funding does not exceed the caps continuededucation new coverage for medicare prescription drugs and adequate support of other domestic programs critics complained that the size of the administrations tax cut left little or room for defense increases although this perennial guns versus butter debate grew more intense when new lower estimates of the fy2002 federal budget surplus reflecting the effect of the tax cut on revenues and recent downturns in the economy were published in august in omb and cbos midsession updates these concerns dissipated temporarily at least with the terrorist attacks the defense appropriations bill was delayed because of congressional response to the terrorist attack and eight continuing resolutions were passed that covered government spending through january 10 2002 when the final appropriation bills were signed into law during this congressional session attentio n focused on the administrations proposals about allocation of the 40 billion provided in the emergency supplemental congress was less concerned with reconciling increases for defense with other competing spending demands although concerns about the effect of higher defense spending in the future could resurface with the reemergence of deficit spending and the reliance on the social security surplus to fund government programs rather than using those funds to pay down the debt and reduce the burden of payments for social security and medicare for the baby boomer generation constraints in the congressional budget resolution the final congressional budget resolution approved in may established reserve funds for defense and certain other highpriority areas the chair of the budget committees in each house could tap the reserve funds in other words approve higher levels of spending than those included in the congressional budget resolution only if the proposed increases would not reduce the surplus in the medicare hospital insurance hi fund and if certain other conditions are met72 if the proposed increase taken together with all previously enacted legislation tapped the medicare hi fund surplus any member could raise point of order against the proposal73 on the senate sidehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs59 73 continued in the resolution for fy2002 the cap is zero see section 211 of hconres 83 hrept 10760 p 2122 74 see section 218 of hconres 183 in hrept 10760 p 25sixty votes were required to override point of order on the house side the rules committee would decide whether point of order could be raised this limitation applied to all the reserve funds except for medicare itself where the hi surplus could be used to finance new prescription drug benefit unlike the other reserve funds the one set up for defense in the senate did not include any specified limits on the amount of additional funding that may be provided the chairman of the budget committee could adjust committee allocations to reflect use of this reserve fund74 see crs report rl30977 defen budget for fy2002 an overview of bush administration plans and key issues for congress by stephen daggett for more extensive discussion of the budget resolution these guidelines which were included in the concurrent budget resolution and hence did not have statutory effect were essentially set aside by congress during the debate on the dod appropriations bill because member raised point of order support for higher defense spending was high because of the september 11th attacks and overcame concerns about protecting the social security and medicare surpluses missile defense this section was prepared by steve hildreth and amy woolf whether and when the united states should deploy defenses designed to protect against attack from longrange ballistic missiles has been divisive defense issue for nearly 20 years although the bush administration has not outlined specific architecture for missile defense it has indicated that the development and deployment of missile defenses would be part of broader shift in the framework for international strategic stability away from reliance on nuclear and conventional deterrence and towards growing reliance on mix of offensive capabilities and missile defenses where the clinton administration sought to develop and deploy system that consisted of landbased interceptor missiles and radars with some reliance on space based sensors the bush administration has suggested that the united states develop and deploy land and seabased interceptors along with more extensive spacebased capabilities for identifying and tracking attacking missiles for an overview of national and theater missile defense see

shoot down missiles launched from aircraft are being transferred from the purview of the ballistic missile defense organization to the services75 debate about the administrations missile defense program focused on the following issues the foreign policy and arms control implications of the administrations plans the pace longrange cost design and acquisition strategy of the administrations program the potential squeeze on other rd efforts and the blurring of the distinction between the threats posed by theater and longrange missiles as well as the defense systems to be developed to meet those threats in test on july 14 2001 which came on the heels of two previous failures an interceptor destroyed dummy missile warhead in space about 140 miles above the ocean supporters contended that these results justify accelerating the program in response critics suggested that the test was not realistic because there was only one rather than many decoys and the target emitted signal whereas the decoy did not such differences in interpreting test results have been common in the past the large increase in funding from 51 billion in fy2001 to 83 billion in fy2002 reflected the administrations decision to accelerate rd efforts on systems currently in developm ent in order to deploy missile defenses as soon as possible on december 13 2001 president bush announced that the us would withdraw from the abm treaty in order to pursue testing development and deployment of missile defense system without constraint despite concerns that the russians would react negatively the growing cooperative relationship between the two nations in the wake of september 11th blunted the expected response the withdrawal was prompted partly by plans to construct missile defense test site in ft greely near fairbanks alaska in spring of 2002 and to test the capabilities of the navys aegis radar system tactical system during missile defense test and partly by pressure by some within the administration to get rid of relic of the cold war see crs report rl30967 national missile defense russias reaction by amy f woolf the bush program included rd on systems designed to intercept missiles at each stage from the initial boost phase to midcourse to the terminal phase of the flight secretary of rumsfelds plan to pursue wide range of programs and deploy rudimentary system as soon

responses to those threats that approach concerns many both inside and outside of congress the administration has not developed cost estimates for its new missile defense plan and some legislators have questioned whether sufficient funding will be available in light of the overall budget squeeze as well as other competing defense needs for example funding for missile defense could limit funding for other defense rd and procurement congressional action the conference version of the authorization bill s 1438 provided that 13 billion in funding could be used by the president either for rdte for bmd programs or for activities to combat terrorism if the president allocated the funding to bmd the administrations request would be funded fully this provision mirrored compromise adopted on the senate floor after september 11th when senator levin agreed to remove controversial sections included in the markup by the senate armed services committee that would have reduced funding for bmd by 13 billion and required congressional approval of activities that would violate the abm treaty the president had threatened to veto the defense authorization bill if those provisions were included the authorizers also transferred three terminal defense programs pac3 meads and navy area defense from the services to bmdo because of concern that the services would not adequately fund those programs in their conferen ce report the appropriators approved total of 77 billion reducing the presidents request by over 500 million and did not include the provision permitting transfer of funds that was

international studies in 1999 to midrange steadystate budget of 90 billion included in study by the congressional budget office in 2000 to 75 billion by fy2005 suggested by secretary cohen and senior dod officials during the clinton administration 79 tom ricks for military change is hard washington post july 19 2001adequacy of funding for procurement the new administration decided to delay major changes in funding for new weapon systems pending completion of its national defense review presumably for that reason the procurement budget in the amended fy2002 budget was 616 billion 05 billion below last years level76 until the review was completed the administration decided to emphasize funding of systems that will continue to be necessary even with significant shifts in defense strategy purchases of airlift aircraft was given as one example77 based on that rationale the administrations procurement request included only modest changes in current plans limited funding procurement fueled concerns among some defense supporters in congress particularly in light of the debate in recent years about alleged shortfalls in longterm defense funding particular for weapons modernization that debate has centered on whether the spending on new weapon systems needs to be increased and at what rate to recapitalize or replace those systems as they age although estimates of the amount necessary to replace current systems have varied widely there is near consensus among members of the defense committees in congress that some increase in the procurement budget in the near term is needed78 in testimony secretary of defense rumsfeld acknowledged that the current budget did not address the replacement issue but he argued that decisions on that issue could not be made until completion of the quadrennial defense review which would incorporate the findings of the national defense review those decisions which are to be included in the fy2003 budget are likely to be contentious within the defense department as well as in congress in part because changes in strategy and the transformation of todays forces to meet new military goals could require different mix of forces79 see summary tables a2 and a3 for the number and procurement and rdte funding for major weapon systems requested by the administration as well as congressional action congressional action

2001 p 14 81 although the treasury will finance the costs of current beneficiaries the defense department will have to pay into the trust fund annually to cover the cost in the future of this benefit for current personnel 82 the dod actuary will estimate those costs which will have to be included in dods budget beginning in fy2003 programs eg uh60 black hawk helicopters the appropriators however generally funded weapon systems at the request see discussion of individual weapon systems below this issue is likely to resurface in the fy2003 budget debate implications of recent rise in defense health costs this section was prepared by richard best the defense health program dhp has been matter of considerable congressional interest in recent years because of initiatives to expand medical coverage to military retirees and their dependents and also because of concern about continuing cost growth particularly for managed care contracts the substantial increase for the defense health program in the new budget reflected both additional benefits for military retirees 15 increase in the cost of drugs and 12 increase in the managed care contracts that provide care to the dependents of military personnel80 dod spokesman said that these higher funding levels were designed to eliminate the practice in recent years of turning to supplementals to cover earlier unrealistic estimates some 14 billion of the 55 billion supplemental recently passed by congress was for higherthananticipated costs in the defense health program the fy2001 defense authorization act provided new benefits dubbed tricare for life for medicareeligible military retirees the measure required that the defense department pay the full cost of the program for current beneficiaries out of appropriated funds in fy2002 but established trust fund to pay future costs which will be counted as mandatory spending financed outside of the defense budget in later years81 in future years the defense departments cost will reflect an actuarial estimate of the cost of future benefits for current personnel the same approach now used for retirement benefits there is great uncertainty about the size of those estimated future costs82 if the estimated costs are smaller than the 39 billion included for these benefits for medicaree ligible military retirees in the fy2002 budget the pressure on dods budget created by the defense health program may subside in later years otherwise dod could continue to face significant or even additional pressure on its total resources because of the obligation to provide this new benefit meanwhile the costs of other medical care in dod continued to increase and just as importantly the defense department has seldom been able to project its required expenditures accurately

costs for 12 of the past 16 years83 faced with both the obligation to provide more extensive benefits and rapidly rising costs senior dod officials suggested that congress may want to consider transferring other defense health costs to the mandatory side of the overall federal budget to relieve this pressure although such transfer would free up resources in the defense budget the government would of course still pay those costs along with the economywide pressure on medical costs from rising drug costs and technological advances dods health care system lacks mechanisms such as copayments that restrain the usage of medical services84 with removal of most copayments for activeduty beneficiaries and only modest copayments for retirees dod cannot rely on the tools that are typically used in the civilian sector to restrain health care usage and thus contain costs congressional action the authorizing and the appropriating committees both endorsed the administrations request the appropriators also added 235 million for research into breast and prostate cancer85 spending for operation and maintenance the amended fy2002 defense budget request included an increase of 177 billion in spending on operation and maintenance of that total about 2 billion was additional funding for flying hours steaming hours and training the funding that is most clearly related to military readiness daytoday training of operational units or operational tempo is typically referred to as optempo shortened version of the term other funding increased with direct effect on readiness included depot maintenance ensuring that weapon systems are available for training86 large share of the increase in the operation and maintenance budget this year however was for objectives that may not contribute so directly to military readiness some 63 billion is for the defense health program see discussion above although better benefits for retirees may contribute in some fashion to the morale of some military personnel showing direct effect on readiness would be difficult the other major increase in the om budget was to upgrade the facilities on military installations dod justified those increases as readinessrelated expense way to improve the morale of military personnel by improving the quality of their workplacehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs66 87 see hrept 107350 p 685 88 see

appropriations report on hr 3338 p 53 but it may be difficult to show how such spending directly affects the readiness of units to go to war congressional action although congress has generally supported increases in the om budget in order to preserve and protect readiness this year both the authorizers and the appropriators cut om funding by about 3 billion partly on the basis that dod could achieve savings from variety of management reform initiatives as well as specific pricing adjustments for fuel utility costs and foreign currency and cuts to administrative areas like headquarters citing testimony by secretary of defense rumsfeld that dod should be able to save 5 overall the authorizers included variety of reform initiatives particularly for procurement of services on which dod spends over 50 billion and cut funding by 13 billion87 the administration argued that such savings could not be achieved so quickly and that funding might therefore be drawn from readinessrelated accounts88 the appropriators also reduced funding for the overseas contingency operations transfer fund set up to give the secretary resources for unexpected costs by 650 million in response to gao work that found poor oversight of that spending as well as cuts in management headquarters and administrative areas89httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs67 other important issues

office emphasizing the need to increase pay and benefits for military personnel to deal with serious recruiting and career retention problems or continue recovery process which had already begun in february president bush announced that he would request 46 pay raise for military personnel with additional increases targeted to particular skills and grades the administration later raised its minimum to 5 and congress ended up approving that 5 request plus some targeted raises for members in particular pay grades and years of service up to 10 essentially ratifying the administration proposal there were proposals for higher minimum raisess ome close to 8but they were defeated for the third year in row congress refused to repeal statute which requires that any department of

in recent years were response in part to problems in recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified military personnel that began in the late 1990s frequently cited reasons include 1 competition for qualified workers from growing economy 2 rise in consumer living standards against which military families measure their own quality of life 3 increased military operations and training away from home and family 4 decreased propensity for military service among young people and 5 the availability of federal educational assistance that does not require military service although recruiting improved in 2000 and 2001 with the services meeting or exceeding their goals few if any observers felt that longterm solutions have been found it is not yet clear what effects the ongoing war against terrorism which began on september 11 2001 will have on military personnel issues sense of neartotal national support military successes with minimal combat casualties and compensation increases could well contribute to easier recruiting and retention recovering economy the possible need to increase the strength of the active duty forces to replace reservists who will have to be released and the stark realization that military service could indeed lead to combat could possibly hamper it or at least increase military compensation costs in the short term warrelated personnel deployments and military administrative actionknown as stoplossto prevent skilled personnel in particular occupational specialties from leaving active duty at least mask the underlying significance of retention statistics congressional action there was little if any fundamental disagreement between the two armed services committees in their yearly reworking of the administrations proposed military personnel programs both houses of congress endorsed thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs68 administrations proposal to expands compensation increases of recent years including the following actions accepting the administration proposal for january 1 2002 basic pay raise of minimum 5 and maximum 10 for military personnel depending on pay grade and years of service this was the largest annual raise since that of october 1 1981 fy1982 as well as being higher than the 46 that the permanent statutory formula would have provided increasing the proportion of housing costs that are reimbursed as part of an effort to completely eliminate outofpocket housing costs not covered by military housing allowances by fy2005 increasing reimbursements for wide range of moving costs authorizing officer accession bonuses for some officer candidates up to 60000 increasing the maximum age to commission college rotc scholarship recipients to from 27 to 31 creating new reenlistment bonus of up to 30000 in us savings bonds for those with critical skills who agree to serve at least six additional years of active duty allowing military personnel with critical skills to transfer up to 18 months of montgomery gi bill benefits to family members in return for serving at least another four years in matter with major implications for both governmentwide and dod funding that is of great interest to military retirees the fy2002 defense authorization act for the third year in row did not repeal statute that requires that those military retirees who receive va disability compensation must take an offset to their military retirement that is equal to their va disability payment the prohibition against concurrent receipt of benefits dod opposes any change in this prohibition arguing that the two programs military retirement and va disability payments were intended for different groups veterans who are eligible for retirement and veterans who are eligible for disability payments but not for retirement to ensure that military retirees with serviceconnected disabilities do not receive less than disabled veterans who are not eligible for retirement the current law permits disabled veterans to choose the larger of the two payments as long as the veteran waives the equivalent amount of retirement compensation although both the house and the senate version of the authorization act eliminated this offset and permitted veterans to receive full benefits under both programs the houses differed in their approach to funding the program the senate adopted an amendment which would have provided that concurrent receipt would be considered an entitlement program that would go into effect on october 1 2002 that change would have triggered an additional 3 billion in mandatory spending in 2002 and 40 billion in spending over the next ten years as well as requiring that dod provide an additional 1 billion annually under the house version this authorization of concurrent receipt of the two benefits would have become effective only if the president submitted budget proposal to offset the mandatory spending costs of the change in law and if congress approved legislation to provide such anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs69 90 if this provision were enacted and funded the accrual funding for military retirement would increaseoffset90 by accepting the house version congress guaranteed that concurrent receipt would not take place unless the administration reversed its consistent opposition possibly as partial recompense congress expanded the eligibility for some severely disabled military retirees social issues this section was prepared by david burrelli social issues are frequently matters of debate in the defense authorization process this year it was speculated that there could be efforts to revisit number of issue including the current policy under which in all services except the marine corps males and females receive basic training together likewise congress required last year that dod notify congress in advance of any plans to change the current policy of assigning only males to duty on submarines in addition according to press accounts panel reviewing the uniform code of military justice had concluded that sodomy between consenting adults should not be prohibited under the code despite that speculation these issues were not considered during this legislative session however efforts to expand the availability of abortion services to members of the armed forces and their dependents appear to be subject of annual debate congressional action on september 25 by vote of 217199 the house rejected an amendment offered by representative sanchez that would have allowed dod facilities overseas to perform privatelyfunded abortions for military personnel and their dependents major weapons issues the administrations fy2002 budget does not reflect decisions on major weapons programs but is largely continuation of previous plans this leaves unresolved two key budget issues 1 how much is needed for weapons procurement over the next several years and 2 whether some programs should be terminated to free up money for leapahead technologies that would support transformation in defense capabilities aviation forces this section was prepared by christopher bolkcom air force transformation many airpower advocates argue that the air forces emphasis on long range precision strike and stealth technology best reflects the goals of defense transformation the debate about the air forces transformation approach has centered on 1 whether emerging capabilities will enable air forces to halt enemy ground forces singlehandedly without relying on us ground forces for followup and 2 what is the most effective balance between shorterrange combat aircraft eg f22 joint strike fighter and longerrange combat aircraft b52s and b2s in light of the threats posed by surfacetoair missiles ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction combat aircraft currently three theaterrange combat aircraft modernization programs are in procurement or development the air force f22 the navy fahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs70 18ef and the multiservice joint strike fighter jsf see crs issue brief ib92115 the central issue for policy makers is whether dod can afford to pursue all three programs simultaneously an issue raised by president bush himself in an impromptu discussion with reporters and whether threats today or in the future would justify the need for these three programs some advocates of defense transformation argue that dod is placing too much emphasis on short range combat aircraft like the jsf at the expense of long range combat aircraft like the b2 bomber most recently however one of the panels contributing to the administrations defense policy review strongly recommended going ahead with the jsf as well as with other planned theater aircraft programs congressional action authorization and appropriation conferees both matched the administrations request for jsf funds despite an initial 250 million cut proposed by the senate armed services committee in expectation of likely delay in the selection of the final contractor funding at the level of the request keeps the rd program on track but both committees expressed concern about industrial base issues both conference committees also matched the f22 funding requests and the authorizes removed the 20 million legislative cost cap on f22 engineering manufacturing development designed to control costs longrange bombers the proposal in the administ rations fy2002 budget amendment to reduce the number of b1s in service from 93 to 60 and to consolidate operations at two rather than the current five bases which would have eliminated the b1 mission of the national guard this proposal was ultimately overturned by legislators in states where b1 operations would have been reduced see crs report rs20859 restarting b2 production retiring the b1 entirely and embarking on new bomber program was also discussed congressional action both the house and the senate armed services committees expressed concern about the administrations proposal to consolidate basing of b1s and restored funds to the air national guard to maintain its b1 capabilities to restore their b1 role appropriations conferees provided the air national guard with an additional 100 million in om funding unmanned aviation systems unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and unmanned combat aerial vehicles ucavs are seen as useful in performing missions too dangerous or too onerous for manned aircraft potentially at less cost the high altitude long endurance global hawk surveillance uav will augment and may replace the u2 and ucavs in research and development rd may eventually augment or replace numerous combat aircraft the precise capabilities of these unmanned systems are still unclear as is the pace at which they will be developed many observers predict that the predator uavs successful performance and the deployment of the prototype global hawk in the war in afghanistan will lead to the acceleration of many uav programs see crs report rl30727 and crs report rl31014 air mobility 2001 air force study found significant shortfall in the long range airlift fleets ability to meet the current national military strategy ongoing operations in afghanistan with its longrange deployments raise this issue anewhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs71 the best way to resolve shortfall either through procurement of additional c17s refurbishing some c5s or increased use of commercial variants continues to be debated increased use of commercial variants is also being explored see crs report rs20915 replacing aging kc10 and kc135s that provide aerial refueling key capability for expeditionar operations was also addressed this session recapitalizing this fleet is potentially 50 billion dollar endeavor see crs report rs20941 congressional action both committees endorsed the administrations request for an additional 15 c17 aircraft in fy2002 and also added provision authorizing the secretary of the air force to enter into another multiyear contract section 8159 of the pl 107117 gives dod the authority to lease 100 commercial boeing 767 aircraft and convert them into replacements for the oldest kc135 tanker aircraft using an operating lease and om rather than procurement funds to obtain the aircraft providing this authority generated controversy in congress and the administration partly because some including the administration argue that the operating lease would be far more expensive than buying the aircraft and partly because some suggest that alternatives have not been adequately explored v22 tiltrotor aircraft another controversial aviation program is the v22 tiltrotor aircraft that takes off and lands like helicopter but flies like an airplane the centerpiece of marine corps plans to transport forces within theaters this program is also designed to satisfy air force special operations forces needs the program has been blemished by four crashes three of which resulted in crew fatalities as well as recent findings by dods inspector general that v22 maintenance records were falsified critics have suggested cancelling or drastically curtailing the v22 program in december 2001 undersecretary of defense aldridge approved the resumption of v22 testing at the same time expressing his concerns regarding the program congressional action reflecting congression concerns about the technical maturity of the program authorization conferees cut one aircraft from the navys 12 aircraft procurement request and deleted air force procurement funds appropriation conferees reduced navy procurement by three aircraft rather than the one cut by the authorizes the appropriators also eliminated air force procurement funds but increased air force rdte funding by 226 million to purchase two development aircraft both committees cut 100 million from navy naval forces this section was prepared by ronald orourke naval transformation navy transformation plans center on the concept of networkcentric warfare ncw which entails using computers data links and networking software to tie naval personnel ships aircraft and installations into highly integrated networks the defense committees have closely followed certain navy programs for implementing ncw particularly the cooperative engagement capability cec program for ship air defense and the navymarine corps intranet nmci program for tying together navy and marine corps shore installations some members of the defense oversight committees have also expressed some interest in other proposals for naval transformation such as the streetfighter concept for building smaller ships to fight in heavilydefended littoral waters somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs72 analysts have suggested that turning to these types of smaller and less expensive ships could help relieve the pressure to maintain the current size of the fleet see crs report rs20851 and crs report rs20557 congressional action the conference report of the defense authorization bill permits the navy to proceed with the nmci project after meeting certain testing requirements the provision also requires the navy to submit to congress report on the scope and status of nmci testing and requires gao to study the impact of nmci implementation on the rate structure of naval shipyards and other repair depots the conferees expressed concern about delays in implementing the program and the resulting shortage of data about the viability and performance of nmci size of the navy the bush administrations 2001 quadrennial defense review qdr submitted to congress on september 30 2001 did not make any substantial changes to the clinton administrations plan for maintaining navy of about 310 ships including 12 aircraft carriers 116 major surface combatants 55 attack submarines 12 amphibious ready groups the 2001 qdr report did note however that as dods transformation effort matures dod will explore additional opportunities to restructure and reorganize the armed forces some analysts noting the pace of navy operations in recent years have questioned whether 310ship fleet is adequate they and some navy officials have called for increasing the planned size of the navy to about 360 ships including 15 aircraft carriers about 135 major surface combatants 60 to 70 attack submarines and 14 amphibious ready groups other analysts have questioned the need for maintaining forward deployments of carriers and other naval forces particularly in the mediterranean sea they have advocated reducing navalforward presence requirements in this region which could lead to reduction in the planned size of the navy below 310 ships the bush administration echoed concerns raised by the defense committees in recent years about the rate of navy ship procurement which has been about 6 ships per year since the early 1990s less than the average of about 9 ships per year assuming an average 35year service life that would be needed over the long run to maintain 310ship fleet the socalled steadystate replacement rate an even higher procurement rate of 10 to 12 ships per year catchup rate may be required to eliminate the backlog of deferred ship procurement that has accumulated relative to the steadystate rate since the early 1990s similar situation exists regarding the rate of naval aircraft procurement see crs report rs20535 ship financing alternatives in the last two years some members of the defense oversight committees have begun to explore alternative ways to finance ship procurement under longstanding policy known as the full funding policy the full cost of ship is appropriated at one time even though funds may be obligated and expended over several years alternatives to full funding include incremental funding which has been approved for the lhd8 amphibious ship and advance appropriations which can be thought of as legislatively lockedin form of incremental funding which some navy officials proposed last yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs73 91 hrept 10733 p 557 92 ibid p 510cost overruns and schedule delays various ships procured in previous fiscal years have experienced cost overruns totaling at least 24 billion the navy requested 800 million in fy2002 to cover the portion of these overruns that the navy says must be covered that year if work on these ships is to continue congressional action the defense authorizers and appropriators both approved about 725 million in fy2002 for prior year cost overruns reducing the request by 75million reduction overruns on previously appropriated lpd17 class amphibious ships new ddx future surfa ce combatant program on november 1 2001 in the midst of congressional deliberations on the defense budget the navy announced that it was replacing the dd21 destroyer program with restructured program called ddx for developing family of surface combatants rather than single destroyer in coming years under the navys plan the two industry teams that were competing for the dd21 program would now compete for the ddx program with winning team to be selected on april 30 2002 the ddx program raises potential issues for congress regarding the rationale for ending the dd21 program the potential impact of the ddx program on the shipbuildin g industrial base the navys proposed acquisition strategy for the ddx program and future navy capabilities the replacement of the dd21 program with the ddx program also created an immediate issue regarding the treatment of the 643million request for fy2002 funding for research and development work on the dd21 program the navy in briefings to congress explained that the initial ddx ship would use many of the same technologies as the dd21 and that all of the 643 million requested for the dd21 program in fy2002 would be needed for the new ddx program congressional action because the authorization conferees did not have specifics about the ddx program the conferees recommended 50million reduction in the 643million funding request resulting from the delay in the down select to future destroyer detail design the conferees plan to review the navys decision to restructure the dd21 program when more information is available91 to protect the destroyer industrial base the authorization conferees call on the secretary of the navy to include procurement of three arleigh burke ddg51class destroyers in the fiscal year 2003 budget request to attain an economic rate of production and consider options for maintaining and transitioning the industrial base including second tier suppliers to future destroyer production92 echoing the authorizers concerns the appropriation conferees reduced the 643million dd 21ddx research and development funding request by 125 million see crs report rs20698 submarines the bush administrations amended fy2002 budget requested 116 million in rd and procurement funding to begin converting two trident ballistic missile submarines ssbns into cruisemissile submarines ssgns andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs74 additional funds to retire and dismantle two other trident ssbns congressional supporters of the ssgn conversion program were interested in increasing the conversion funding so as to support 4boat ssgn conversion program congressional action the authorization conferees increase of 66 million is intended to support 4boat conversion program but falls short of the 163million increase that the navy considers the minimum for such program the appropriation conferees provided 324 million increase more than needed for faster conversion of four boats see crs report rs21007 ground forces this section was prepared by edward bruner army transformation the armys current transformation plans were reflected in the amended fy2002 budget the goal is to build new objective force centered on future combat system to be developed over the next ten years that would be fully fielded by 2020 more controversial may be the size of the armys legacy force the current mix of light and heavy forces the army plans some modernization and recapitalization of this legacy force to maintain combat readiness in the meantime to meet the need for forces that would be both mobile and yet lethal enough to survive in highintensity fastbreaking conflict that could arise in many regions gap in the current mix of forces the army is creating an interim force of 6 to 8 interim brigade combat teams ibct that would be deployable in c130 aircraft see crs report rs20787 congressional concerns some have questioned whether major effort to transform ground forces should be priority today given the current superiority of us military forces and perceived lowlevel of conventional ground combat threats in particular there is great concern that transformation be properly balanced with current readiness and recapitalization even if future dangers justify transformatio n has the army picked the right path perhaps it need not cover the entire spectrum of combat capabilities leaving more tasks to other services perhaps the objective force should create less stress on airlift assets by relying more on sealift some have suggested that radical reorganization of current units could yield more agile ground component for joint strike forces now long before any future combat system is fielded in general capabilities envisioned for the objective force will have more utility in situations like afghanistan than the current legacy force affordability is second major question critics have suggested that the transformation plan pays for three separate armies at once the legacy interim and objective forces the armys counter argument is that the overall size of the armys force structure remains constant throughout the transformation yet the army chief of staff testified that army plans require sustained increment of 10 billion annually beyond its average postcold war expenditures for rd and procurement in fy2002 congress supported the armys transformation efforts weapon systems issues key aviation component of the future objective force the armys comanche rah66 an armed reconnaissance helicopter is being designed with stealth and other advanced features and will replace aging helicopters see crs report rs20522 the army received full funding for two systems scheduled for fielding in fy08 the comanche helicopter and the more controversialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs75 because of its weight 40ton crusader which is designed to improve fire support in the legacy force the army also received its request for its largest effort to recapitalize the legacy force the 1 billion to rebuild and upgrade the current fleets of m1abrams tanks and m2 bradley fighting vehicles some of that money is dedicated to digitizing the battlefield in order to enable systems to operate in computer nets an improvement that the army eventually wants to include in all its systems in the objective interim and legacy forces 4 billion program over six years the armys new light armored vehicle iii 20 ton wheeled platform is intended to be the linchpin for equipping the new ibcts of the interim force defense rd spending this section was prepared by jack moteff in its june 27 budget amendment the bush administration requested 474 billion in research and development for the department of defense dod in fy2002 almost 7 billion more than the 2001 level about half of that increase was slated for missile defense however although the bush administration proposed increasing dods research and development by 20 billion over the next 5 years the 88 billion requested for dods science and technology st part of the request ie basic and applied research and advanced technology development traditionally congressional concern was slightly below the 9 billion provided in fy2001 the administration stated that it wants to redirect investments away from legacy systems

threat reduction cooperative threa t reduction this section was prepared by amy woolf established by congress in 1991 after the collapse of the soviet union the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction program ctr is dedicated to help russia and the former soviet republics safeguard store or destroy their nuclear weapons after comprehensive review the bush administration requested 403 million slightly below the 2001 level congressional action both the final defense authorization and appropriations acts approve the administrations request for dods ctr programs including funding for construction of chemical weapons destruction facility in russia that had been withheld for the past two years the emergency supplemental appropriations bill transferred 30 million from existing ctr accounts to the state department to help fund programs designed to reduce the threat of biological weapons proliferation from russia the authorization conferees provide 7769 million for department of energys defense nuclear nonproliferation programs many of which are geared to improving the security and control over nuclear materials in russia and other former soviet republics restoring the program to its 2001 level and providing100 million more than requested by the administration january 2001 report to doe authored by former senator howard baker and lloyd cutler recommended sharp increases in funding for these programs calling the proliferation risks created by nuclear materials in the former soviet union the greatest unmet national security need for the united states congress also increased funding for two doe programs designed to provide alternative employment for nuclear weapons scientists in the former soviet union as did the emergency supplemental appropriations bill

congressional action congress appropriated the 11 billion requested by the administration for the chemical weapons destruction program which is the same level as in the previous year military base s competitive procurement and defense industry base closure and realignment this section was prepared by david lockwood an important issue for members in the 107 congress was whether or not to authorize new rounds of military base closures93 for the past four years dod has sought congressional approval for one or two more rounds of base closures but to avail although most members of congress acknowledge the need for additional base closures members have been reluctant to authorize additional rounds because of continued resentment over president bill clintons controversial 1995 intervention in the closing of mcclellan air force base in california and inherent concern for the economic and social dislocations that local communities would face by fy2002 dod completed implementation of the 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 rounds as scheduled about 451 installations and facilities have been closed or affected in some fashion during the past 12 years on august 3 2001 the administration submitted proposal to congress for another round of base closures in fy2003 as well as new efficient facilities initiative efi designed to share facilities and land on some military bases the administrations proposal would have enhanced the role of the secretary of defense compared to the procedures used in previous base closures the efi was wide ranging proposal that would permit base commanders to waive current regulations and statutes and contract with public or private entities for use of military facilities and services in return for payments that would be deposited in an installation efficiency project fund that would be available to the secretary of defense to use at his discretion congressional action the house opposed any new round of closures and the senate supported another round the impasse was finally resolved when the authorization conferees reached compromise that authorized new round but delayed the date to 2005 the authorizers also basically extended the procedures used in previous rounds but as part of the compromise made it more difficult for the base closure commissioners to add bases to those recommended by the administration any additions would require approval by supermajority of at least seven of the nine commissioners the authorizes also permitted dod to extend the pilot program for alternative uses of military bases but with more restrictions than proposed by the department httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs79 94 see hrept 107298 p 4647competitive sourcing this section was prepared by valerie grasso the bush administration promised to mount ambitious efforts to improve efficiency by relying on the method that dod also pursued under the clinton administration competitive sourcing where private companies can compete with government organizations to perform work conducted under the rules established by omb circular a76 the program remains controversial because estimates of savings are considered problematic and the economic social and political ramifications from cuts in governme nt jobs are painfulsee crs report rl30392 defense outsourcing the omb circular a76 policy congressional action the fy2002 department of defense appropriations act hr 3338 prohibits the conversion of certain dod activities or functions to contractor performance if the activities are performed by ten or more civilian dod employees until most efficient and costeffective analysis is completed and certified to the congress ional appropriations committees see section 8014 the dod appropriation conferees also reduced om funds by 25 million to reflect their belief that the schedule for studies assumed by the administration was overly optimistic94 shipbuilding indust rial base this section was prepared by ronald orourke until recently the six privatesector shipyards that build the navys major ships were owned by three organizat ions general dynamics corporation gd which owned three of the yards northrop grumman corporation noc which owned two of them and newport news shipbuilding nns which was an independent publicly traded shipbuilding company in the spring of 2001 both gd and noc made offers to buy nns implementing either merger proposal would consolidate ownership of the six yards under two organizations and very likely end process of consolidation in the ownership of these yards that began in 1995 the department of defense and the department of justice reviewed both merger proposals for several months on october 23 2001 the two departments announced that they would oppose gds offer on the grounds that it would reduce competition and innovation in naval shipbuilding but would not oppose nocs northrops offer noc completed its acquisition of nns on november 30 2001 the two competing merger proposals raised issues for congress regarding the potential savings they would generate and their potential impact on competition in navy ship acquisition on the shipyards employment

thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs80 clintonrossello plan congress in 2000 approved 40 million in assistance funding for vieques and other legislatio n as part of pl 106246 hr 4425 and pl 106398 hr 4205 the bush administration had previously supported the clintonrossello plan as implemented by congress but the new governor of puerto rico sila maria calderon who took office in january 2001 did not and has instead worked toward an immediate end to the military training operations on the island congressional action the conference report on the defense authorization bill contains provision section 1049 that 1 cancels the requirement for holding the january 2002 referendum 2 authorizes the secretary of the navy to close the vieques range if the secretary certifies that equivalent or superior training facilities exist and are immediately available 3 requires the secretary in making this determination to take into account the views of navy and marine corps leaders and 4 transfers the lands to the department of the interior if the range is closed see crs report rs20458 vieques puerto rico naval training range background and issues for congress space intelligence and communications issues national security space programs this section was prepared by marcia smith today approximately 145 billion per year is spent on national security space activities for an overview see crs issue brief ib92011 us space programs civil military and commercial by marcia smith concern about how dod and the intelligence community manage and execute space programs led to creation by congress of commission chaired by now secretary of defense donald rumsfeld to assess national security space program management in may 2001 secretary rumsfeld announced number of management changes in the air force and dod to implement many of the commissions recommendations recommendations made by two other congressionally created commissionsone on the national imagery and mapping agency nima the other on the national reconnaissanc office nromay also impact the national security space program among the national security space programs that received attention during the fy2002 budget cycle were space control the means to deter and defend against hostile acts directed at us space assets and against the uses of space hostile to us interests spacebased weapons lasers or kinetic energy weapons for missile defense and new early warning satellite system consisting of two sets of satellites sbirshigh and sbirslow both sbirs programs have been the subject of management and technologi cal readiness concerns sbirslow was transferred from the air force to bmdo while sbirshigh remains an air force program congressional action although the house and senate sought to codify some of the recommendations of the space commission the final version of the fy2002 dod authorization bill requires only reports to congress on dods actions to implement the commissions recommendations congress approved the full request of 33 million for space control in the final versions of the appropriations and authorization bills for spacebased weapons the authorizers fully funded the 165 million requested for spacebased laser sbl development and the 20 million requested for kinetic energy weapons but the appropriators cut the sbl request by 120 million and cut kinetic energy weapons by 10 million although sbirshighhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs81 and sbirslow were both almost fully funded in the authorization bill the appropriations bill cut all 94 million requested for procurement for sbirshigh but increased the 405 million in rdte funding for that program by 40 million for sbirslow the appropriations bill cut the entire 385 million requested but created new line item funded at 250 million which the secretary of defense may choose to spend on sbirslow or development of other sensor technologies intelligence this section was prepared by richard best most of the funding for the nations intelligence effort is provided in national defense authorization and appropriations bills the budget of the central intelligence agency which is separate from the defense department is from practical standpoint overseen by the two intelligence committees but is included in various parts of the defense budget to preclude public disclosure the work of intelligence agencies that are part of the defense department including the defense intelligence agency the national security agency the national reconnaissance office and the national imagery and mapping agency is overseen by armed services and defense appropriations committees as well as by the two select intelligence committees budgetary allocations for specific intelligence programs are usually classified and discussed only in separate annexes to committee reports that are not available to the public though issues sometimes may become matters of open debate in congress see crs issue brief ib10012 intelligence issues for congress by richard best jr congressional action changes to specific programs made by the authorizing committees are covered in separate classified annex to their reports radiofrequ ency spectrum for dod this section was prepared by lennard kruger and linda k moore the department of defense uses various portions of the radiofrequency spectrum to support its operations and activities many in the wireless communications industry would like to use part of this spectrum for deployment of next generation wireless service known as 3g that portion of the spectrum the 17551850 mhz is currently used by dod for such applications as satellite systems precision guided munitions tactical radio relay communication systems air combat training systems targeting intelligence and other communications systems citing shortage of availabl spectrum for 3g the clinton administration directed the two agencies charged with management of the spectrum the federal communications commission for commercial users and the national telecommunications and information administration for federal government users to identify suitable 3g spectrum for commercial services by july 2001 and to auction licenses to competing applicants by september 30 2002 on june 26 2001 however fcc chairman michael powell recommended to secretary of commerce donald evans the extension of this deadline so that other ways to make additional spectrum available for advanced wireless services could be considered one option is to relocate dod to other frequency bands and auction the 1755 1850 mhz band for commercial use to meet requirements in the fy1999 and fy2000 dods authorization acts dod must be reimbursed for relocation costs andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31005crs82 provided with spectrum that has comparable technical capabilities so there is loss of mission capability in case of any transfer to the civilian sector see crs report rl30829 radiofreque ncy spectrum management background status and current issues and crs report rs20993 wireless technology and spectrum demand third generation 3g and beyond dod now contends that full migration to another frequency band could take many years because satellites currently in orbit cannot be reprogrammed to operate on another frequency for that reason they argue that relocation could not occur until 2010 for nonspace systems and 2017 for satellite control systems assuming that dod also received alternative comparable spectrum width and compensation thus far comparable bandwidth for dod has been proposed in new report gao concluded that more analysis is needed before making decisions about the 1755 1850 mhz band gao01795 august 2001 congressional action neither the house nor the senate armed services committees included any language about the issue of relocating dod to another frequency legislation budget resolution hconres 83 nussle concurrent resolution establishing the congressional budget for the united states government for fy2002
