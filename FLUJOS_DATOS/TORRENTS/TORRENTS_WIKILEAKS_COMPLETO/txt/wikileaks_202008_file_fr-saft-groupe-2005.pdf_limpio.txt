highend advanced technology batteries for industrial applications saft specializes in nickel cadmium or nicd and primary nonrechargeable and secondary rechargeable lithium batteries for specialized high performance applications saft estimates that the strategic markets for its products represented net sales of approximately 175 billion in 2004 in the specialized markets in which the group operates batteries must meet specific criteria regarding reliability size or resistance to extreme high and low temperatures and must be specially designed for the applications in which they are used defence sector applications systemcritical applications such as aviation satellites medical instruments safety equipment and lighting and applications subject to extreme physical conditions saft estimates that the total worldwide battery market represented approximately 28 billion in sales in 2004 industry trends saft believes that the following factors will continue to drive growth in the markets it serves growth in most of the groups key markets saft expects continuing growth in infrastructure development which is expected to lead to an increase in the combined revenues of the sbg and ibg divisions and in the sector of rail and aviation transportation which should lead to increased combined revenues in the ibg division in recent years the installation of automatic utility meter reading systems and automated tolling systems in the united states and europe has led to an increase in demand for lithium batteries manufactured by the groups sbg division in addition the aviation industry has resumed its growth trend in terms of flight hours after the decline in 2001 which has led to an increase in demand for nicd batteries manufactured by the groups ibg division saft expects these trends to continue resulting in growth in demand for advanced technology batteries used in these applications for example automated meter readers the use of automated utility meter readers has grown significantly in the united states in recent years these devices which are linked to utility meter each use primary lithium battery they allow utility company to read the meter from remote location making it unnecessary for an inperson inspection of the meter the group expects that demand for these applications will continue to increase in the united states as result of the cost saving initiatives of water gas and electric utility companies the european market where there is currently little use of automated meter readers represents significant potential market for these applications as european utility companies may adopt these applications in the future automated tolling systems road congestion in the united states and in europe in recent years has led to increasing use of automated tolling systems which rely on radio transmission of toll payment data through radio frequency identification rfid technology implementation of automated road tolling systems can lead to significant additional demand for batteries saft expects that this growth will continue in the near future in the united states and europe as well as in other counties such as brazil which has recently installed an automated tolling system that will use saft batteries batteries used in aviation applications after significant decline in 2001 air traffic resumed its growth trend in 2003 and 2004 saft expects this trend to continue in the years to come since demand for batteries used in aircraft is driven by air traffic more particularly the number of hours flown in the aviation industry an increase in traffic results in corresponding increase in demand for nicd aviation batteries which helps saft to maintain its leading position in this market recovery in certain sectors the recent upturn in the global economy has led to an increase in demand for batteries used in applications in cyclical industries including oil and gas exploration and production telecommunications and space industries marking an end to the period of significant downturn experienced after 2001 this renewed growth has led to an increase in demand for batteries 24strictlyconfidential used in applications in these sectors saft expects that this recovery in the global economy if it persists will continue to drive demand for batteries in these markets in the medium term which consequently is expected to lead to an increase in combined revenues for the sbg and ibg divisions in addition in periods of economic recovery customers are more inclined to make purchase decisions based on the life cycle cost of battery rather than on the initial cost of the battery despite an initial cost that is higher than that of lead acid batteries safts high technology batteries are generally more reliable particularly under extreme conditions and have much longer life or lower lifecycle cost thereby reducing the frequency and cost of replacement the result is cost saving over lead acid batteries for certain applications increased demand for new applications requiring standalone power sources saft believes that the worldwide development of portable and mobile applications will be growth factor for saft which is expected to lead to an increase in combined revenues of the sbg and rbs divisions for example the group produces batteries for various applications including future soldier programmes using liion batteries oems in the defence industry are continuing to develop future soldier programmes which will provide soldiers with an integrated suite of equipment including night vision goggles communications devices and weaponry all powered by single power source these applications will require high power specialized liion batteries of which saft is leading developer portable medical equipment applications saft produces lithium batteries for medical equipment applications such as portable defibrillators which are used more and more widely in the united states particularly in police and fire vehicles and at airports saft also produces liion batteries for portable blood transfusion equipment used in regions where access to fixed power sources is difficult development of environmentally friendly transport systems new environmental regulations are driving the development of transport systems that use less energy and produce lower emissions such as electric or hybrid electric vehicles and some mass transit systems the group was one of the first manufacturers to develop batteries for these applications and believes that it is wellpositioned to satisfy demand for batteries for these applications if this trend continues it is expected to result in an increase in combined revenues for the groups ibg and rbs divisions development of hybrid electric vehicles saft believes that hybrid vehicles powered by thermal and electric engines will satisfy the demand for vehicles that use less energy and produce lower emissions hybrid electric vehicles using highpower battery use significantly less fuel and produce much lower emissions than conventional vehicles number of major car manufacturers are currently developing hybrid electric vehicles particularly in the united states and japan which are the main markets for hybrid electric vehicles according to jd power lmc more than 200000 hybrid or electric vehicles will be sold in the united states in 2005 the first generation of hybrid electric vehicles currently in production is equipped with nickel metal hydride or nimh batteries produced by japanese manufacturers saft is collaborating with daimlerchrysler for the development of high performance liion batteries to be used in the next generation of hybrid electric vehicles development of electric bicycles and scooters saft develops nimh batteries for engines used in personal mobility devices for example saft manufactures batteries for electric bicycles and scooters as well as for the segwayhuman transporter growth of infrastructure investment in developing countries the growth in infrastructure investment in developing countries is accelerating increasing demand for currently existing high technology applications saft believes that growth in these countries will lead to increased demand for advanced technology batteries which consequently is expected to lead to an increase in combined revenues for the sbg and ibg divisions particularly as result of an increase in installation of electric utility meters in private homes in countries such as india and china as water gas and electric utility companies in these countries begin charging for services on usage basis according to group estimates two thirds of households worldwide are provided with water gas or electricity without consumption being monitored by an electric meter as one of the worlds leading producers of batteries for electric utility meters this market represents significant growth opportunity for the group 25strictlyconfidential 42 competitivestrengths as world leader in the design development and manufacture of advanced technology batteries for industrial applications saft supplies energy solutions to oems that are crucial components of the applications they develop and supplies batteries necessary for the utility meter readers installed by water gas and electricity distributors saft also supplies replacement batteries to end users of these applications saft holds market leading positions in number of specialized markets as result of the following competitive advantages market leading position in growing markets for specialized battery applications saft holds significant market shares worldwide in specialized segments of the battery market where its advanced battery technologies provide significant advantage over alternative technologies over 70 of safts combined revenues in 2004 were generated in markets where it is market leader saft focuses on innovative technologies and markets where it can bring significant value to its customers in addition by supplying high value added products customized to meet its customers needs saft is able to achieve high profit margins on large number of its products the group has discontinued or disposed of substantially all of its consumer oriented activities to focus on more profitable highend specialized battery markets the technological expertise high level of industrial investment and the qualification time periods required to design and manufacture products that meet the standards required by safts customers allow saft to remain ahead of its competitors in many of the markets it targets in the aviation defence and space markets suppliers are required to go through one to three year qualification process for each product before they can sell them as result once qualified supplier has strong market position for high margin replacement sales for example in the aviation market generally once manufacturer is qualified to supply the battery for particular type of aircraft it supplies the batteries for each new aircraft and in most cases it will be the sole supplier of replacement batteries because saft operates in highend markets where these demands are particularly prevalent the group believes that the risk of competition from lowcost manufacturers is limited strong customer relationships sales in safts key markets are based on strong long term relationships with its major customers including airbus to which saft is the sole supplier bombardier alstom and legrand as well as the us and french armed forces substantial proportion of the groups combined revenues come from products designed and developed to meet specific customer requirements these special relationships have allowed saft to work with customers in the development phase of new applications which in turn leads to opportunities for new supply contracts anestablished reputation for high quality products saft supplies batteries for applications where the cost of failure can be high to end users particularly in the aviation defence and space industries safts extensive track record of supplying customers with reliable safe high performance products has made saft the supplier of choice for highly technical solutions for critical applications safts reputation represents significant competitive advantage in the key markets that it targets and enhances its ability to

sales forces report directly to the divisions sales director based in bagnolet france the divisions marketing policy is centralized as is the coordination of international bidding for projects where number of the companys customers may be competing for the same project the sbg divisions sales forces are organized around the various brand names under which its products are marketed and therefore has two sales forces worldwide one of which is responsible for marketing and sales of its batteries sold under the saft brand and another which is responsible for products marketed under the sonnenschein and tadiran brands specialized local sales forces are dedicated to the space and defence industries asb the subsidiary jointly owned with eads has its own sales force the rbs division has its own sales and marketing teams although in some small markets it shares its sales team with the sbg division in most of the high technology battery markets that saft targets the saft brand name is key criterion in clients purchasing decisions this brand reflects the groups reputation as producer of reliable safe and high performance batteries and is an important competitive advantage the group also markets its products under other recognized brand names which allow saft to benefit from strong positions in certain specialized markets around the world these other brand names are alcad tadiran sonnenschein lithium friwo emisa nife and ferak the tadiran sonnenschein lithium and ferak brands have an excellent reputation in certain markets for historical reasons in addition to commercial brands saft maintains numerous brand names for various product lines for example the ulm brand used for the marketing of batteries for the aviation industry saft registers its trademarks in order to protect them in all the countries where the group sells its products or in those where there is risk of trademark infringement 463 research anddevelopment the group maintains its main research and

these strikes had material effect on the groups business other significant labor unrest business interruption or significant strikes have occurred over the past three years the group believes that on the whole its relations with its employees are good in addition the groups french companies entered into agreements with union organizations in connection with the application of french legislation relating to the reduction of working week time given the complexity of these regulations the group had to make certain number of decisions regarding the mode of applying these regulations saft expects

relationship with alcatel since the sale of the saft group in january 2004 by alcatel to the doughty hanson funds relations between alcatel and saft have been good and have been essentially limited to their respective obligations under the terms of the contracts relating to the sale saft finance sarl is required in connection with the acquisition agreement between the doughty hanson funds and alcatel to pay to alcatel half of the cash held by asb on the date of the sale of the saft group by alcatel to the doughty hanson funds amounting to 42 million as soon as such amount may be distributed in agreement with eads which owns 50 of the share capital of asb asb paid its shareholders in september 2004 dividend of 607484 and saft finance must therefore pursuant to the above

shares of saft finance sarl will be contributed to the company in order that the operating companies of the group will all be entirely held or in the case of asb the jointly held subsidiary with eads held 50 indirectly by the company prior to the listing of the companys shares on the eurolist market of euronext paris description of the reorganisation is set forth in section 323 hereof 48 regulation 481 environmental regulation overview saft is subject to broad range of environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates production site which impose increasingly stringent standards on saft and in most cases require specific permits for saft to conduct its business they relate to among other things air emissions waste water discharges the use and handling of hazardous materials asbestos removal waste disposal practices and cleanup of environmental contamination see section 4134 hereof eulegislation the current european legislation in force applicable to batteries containing certain hazardous materials is the directive 91157eec this directive limits the amount of mercury that can be used in batteries requires separate collection of batteries containing mercury cadmium and lead and requires standard marking on products containing these metals all of the groups batteries conform to these provisions the european commission has proposed an amendment to this directive to require the collection of all types of batteries and to introduce producer responsibility for collection the european parliament and the european council have both proposed amendments to the european commissions proposal and the current draft provides only for ban on the production and sale of nicd consumer batteries the proposed directive is scheduled to undergo second review by the european parliament in the near future another proposed regulation that may affect the groups business is the european unions regulation concerning the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach draft form of which was adopted by the european commission on october 29 2003 and which is currently under review by the european parliament and european council this regulation could be adopted as early as 2006 uslegislation the us department of transportation and similar government authorities of other countries consider lithium to be dangerous substance and therefore regulate the transport of lithium batteries by air the group is in compliance with these air transport regulations however assurance can be made that additional or modified regulations will not be adopted in the future concerning the manufacture transportation use storage and disposal of lithium batteries and the substances used in their production or that any such regulation will not have significant effect on the financial situation of the group or its customers 49strictlyconfidential 482 export controls certain national regulations especially in france the united kingdom and germany restrict in general or specific manner the exportation of certain products these regulations are namely applicable to products which could be or are intended for military or nuclear applications these restrictions affect countries considered sensitive for national security reasons among other things embargoes may be put in place relating to certain persons groups of persons or organizations considered terrorists in addition to the exportation of products certain accessory transactions such as technology transfers for example the provision of technical assistance or the sale of knowhow are also subject to export restrictions transfers of technology to certain countries must be notified to the competent authorities who may under certain circumstances require specific authorization to be obtained these types of restrictions affect the group namely regarding china where the country soon intends to open new production facility in the united states application of the international traffic in arms regulations itar is handled by the state department directorate of defense trade controls the ddtc previously known as the office of defense trade control these regulations restrict exportation from the united states and importation into the united states of certain arms arms components or other goods technologies and services designed modified or used for primarily military purposes or any goods containing such components itar applies extraterritorially to all persons whether or not they have any connection with the united states or are located outside of the jurisdiction of the united states itar prohibits the exportation or temporary importation of certain arms arms components or other goods technologies and services designed modified or used for primarily military purposes or any goods containing such components except pursuant to license or written authorization from ddtc the list of goods subject to the restriction is defined in itar article 121 and is commonly referred to as the united states munitions list certain batteries appear on this list as general rule only persons of us nationality and foreign state entities may obtain license or written authorization from ddtc foreigners other than state entities are not eligible in the event of noncompliance with itar the ddtc can impose civil penalties of up to 500000 per violation revoke the export authorization or license and seize goods sent from the united states any false or misleading declaration made to the ddtc by an entity or person is also crime punishable by imprisonment of up to 10 years and penalty of up to 1 million these licenses are as general matter subject to regular controls by the issuing states export licenses are only rarely challenged it is nevertheless possible under exceptional circumstances that licenses will not be issued in the future or will be revoked either for political reasons linked to the development of geopolitical events or changes in the political regime in the country where the products in question are exported any actual or intended violation of the conditions of use of these licenses could affect the groups financial situation 483 statement of final endusers the export of batteries used primarily in military applications to noneu or nonnato north atlantic treaty organization member countries or to countries not allied with nato requires statement from the final end user these statements are issued by the government authority of the destination country and must indicate precisely the identity of the recipient of the batteries and the purpose for which the batteries are to be used in france such statements are required for all exportation to noneu or nonnato member countries or to countries that are not allied with nato the purpose of the statements is to avoid reexportation of the batteries to politically sensitive countries or to unauthorized individuals or groups any such reexportation could result in the authority which delivered the statement being put on watch list and all future export requests could be delayed or refused by the french state 484 transactions with customers in countries sanctioned byofac as result of the international nature of its business the group is subject to series of laws and regulations in numerous countries in which it operates as well as to international conventions namely those relating to international sales of goods certain countries in which the group operates including iran syria and libya are 50strictlyconfidential or have been subject to sanctions by the united states treasury departments office of foreign assets controls ofac us persons are involved in the provision by the group of products and services to customers located in countries sanctioned by ofac the group does not engage in any reexportation transactions of us goods to customers located in countries sanctioned by ofac 49 dependenceon certainfactors 491 dependence onpatents andlicenses most of safts products incorporate wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by individual patents the group currently holds 490 patents in 126 families relating to advanced technology batteries the groups patents are held primarily in europe japan and the united states saft acquired large number of the patents in its portfolio in connection with an agreement with alcatel on january 14 2004 the change of ownership pursuant to this agreement was notified to the relevant administrations where the patents are registered and is awaiting publication saft will only be able to assert its rights with respect to these patents once the change of ownership is published saft is not dependent upon any one patent or group of related patents which it does not own except for two patents related solely to nimh technology and which are used in the manufacturing of certain batteries of the rbs division saft has the necessary licenses for the use of these patents from their owners revenues generated by saft using nimh patents represented approximately 3 of the groups combined revenues all competitors in the industry using nimh technology have similar dependence on the use of these patents while the group currently maintains good relationships with these patent owners and has taken steps to protect its interests in its agreements with such parties there can be assurance that it will continue to benefit from such rights or that the terms of these agreements will be respected many of the technologies used in the manufacture of safts products are treated as trade secrets and the group has programs in place to protect these trade secrets all of the groups employees working on these technologies are required to enter into agreements providing for confidentiality and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while employed by the group there can however be assurance that these agreements will be enforceable by the group or that in the event of breach satisfactory recourse could be obtained saft also has numerous trademarks including the saft alcad nife friwo tadiran ferak and emisa names saft power systems formerly an alcatel subsidiary has royaltyfree worldwide and nonexclusive other than in respect of the use of the saft name in connection with the terms power or system license to use the saft name subject to certain conditions through 2009 saft power systems may also obtain an extension of this license through 2011 in exchange for the payment of royalty during such additional period 492 dependence onsupply industrial commercial or financial agreements the following are agreements upon which the groups business is dependent usgovernment contracts the us government as well as various us government agencies are among the most significant of the groups customers certain contracts with these customers include unilateral termination provisions permitting the customer to terminate the contracts at its convenience however if the contracts are terminated saft is entitled to certain payments as defined in the contracts as well as to reimbursement for allowable costs prior to the date of termination contracts with us government agencies are also subject to unilateral modification of price and other terms by the us government notably in the event of budgetary constraints and for the adjustment of certain means of production to its needs the groups current contracts with the us armed forces for military lithium batteries which represented 123 of the groups combined revenues in 2004 including 113 with the us defense logistics agency allow the us armed forces to order batteries from saft through november 2006 due to the groups strong relationship with the us armed forces and the amount of time it takes to secure new supplier which could take up to 18 months saft hopes to continue to supply the us armed forces with lithium batteries under these contracts in fiscal year 2004 there was other significant customer representing more than 3 of the groups combined revenues 51strictlyconfidential contract for the supply of nickel powder there is only one company in the world that produces nickel powder saft and other battery producers are therefore exclusively dependent upon this producer to continue to supply nickel powder there are other suppliers holding monopoly position and on which the group is similarly dependent as of the date hereof there is other contract representing more than 5 of the groups combined revenues commitments with israel andfrance by letter dated december 11 2003 and in connection with the sale of the saft group by alcatel to the doughty hanson funds tadiran the companys israeli subsidiary committed to the israeli ministry of defence the mod to keep confidential all information relating to the order of batteries by the mod and classified under the israeli security directorate tadiran also undertook that its general manager would be an israeli citizen meeting strict security requirements any change in control of tadiran must be notified to the mod and be pre approved by the chief scientist office and the investment center of the israeli ministry of industry and commerce as of the date hereof in view of the offering the required notification and authorization in respect thereof have been provided and received by letter dated january 9 2004 saft finance sarl and saft acquisition sas entered into commitments with the french state regarding assets activities and technologies owned by saft sa asb and certain of their subsidiaries to be used for french national defence in this letter the companies granted to the french state right of first refusal in the event of change of control of the saft group this right has been terminated and may longer be applied in connection with the offering nor in the future the other commitments will last as long as doughty hanson owns more than onethird of the share capital of saft groupe through its subsidiary saft beta once saft beta sarl falls below this onethird threshold the only commitments that will be binding on the company are those described below the company concluded with the french state an agreement dated may 4 2005 which lasts 90 years under the terms of this agreement the group has agreed to maintain the general management of the group and associated functions in france the company has entered into certain commitments and has agreed to ensure that its subsidiaries will comply with their obligations for the direct or indirect benefit of the french ministry of defence and relating namely to the future provision by its french subsidiaries of products used in french national space and defence applications on fair and reasonable terms for all parties and has also agreed under certain conditions relating mainly to the competitive environment to maintain and develop in france certain assets and critical technologies relating to french national defence the assets and critical technologies for french national defence applications include those existing on the date of the entry in force of the agreement or that are developed during the course of the agreement for french defence markets these assets and critical technologies extend to project oversight capability conception production integration and operational maintenance of batteries used namely in nuclear arms aircraft and missiles used by the french armed forces finally the state will name government commissioner to saft groupe sa in similar manner as it named government commissioner to saft sa and asb in 2004 the government commissioner must receive certain information relating to the groups cash flows principal changes in shareholdings and all information communicated to the members of the supervisory board the provision to the government commissioner of various information within the scope of his position does not affect the confidentiality agreements binding on the company or it subsidiaries any change of control of the company would have impact on the companys commitments towards the french state in the event of breach of these commitments the state may seek to hold the company liable in accordance with legal provisions applicable to the agreement saft finance sarl and saft acquisition sas two subsidiaries of the company were absolved of all responsibility arising from the authorization relating to foreign investors delivered on january 9 2004 other contracts the company and its subsidiaries enter into large number of supply agreements for which the term pricing and payment conditions liability provisions applicable law and other terms vary significantly from one agreement to another this diversity results from the varied practices of the different customers with which saft conducts business as well as the numerous markets in which it operates in accordance with legislation applicable in the groups main markets certain number of contracts entered into with public sector entities in particular in the defence and public sectors may be granted only at the end of bidding procedure governed by local laws and regulations 52strictlyconfidential the warranties granted by saft to its customers vary according to the applications for which the batteries are intended except for military contracts and certain agreements with oems that include specific warranty clauses safts contractual warranties generally cover manufacturing and product defects and apply only when the customer uses the product in accordance with the terms of the contract the warranties are generally limited to the replacement by the group of the defective battery the groups standard contract clauses thereby limit the right of customers to return products solely in the case of technical malfunction and do not in this respect contain general clauses allowing for returns by customers of unsold items nevertheless for commercial reasons the group may recall batteries if it considers that they were not satisfactory to the customer or present risk for the user the cost of such returns is estimated at approximately 5 million per year and represents approximately 08 of the groups combined revenues except in exceptional cases the groups contracts contain warranties the terms of which vary according to the particular application and technology and which are typically as follows ibg industrial standby 1 to 3 years ibg telecommunications standby 5 to 10 years on sliding scale ibg rail and aviation 1 to 5 years ibg electric vehicles 4 years sbg civil lithium 1 to 2 years and rbs all products 1 year in the space sector the contractual warranty period generally ends upon the launch of the satellite finally certain longterm contracts entered into with the groups customers in the defence sector include price revision clauses that allow all or part of the increase in the cost of raw materials to be reflected in the sales prices of the groups products 410 litigation the group is involved in litigation and arbitration proceedings in the normal course of its business provisions have been made for such litigation and arbitration proceedings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in france litigation or arbitration over the past five years has had significant impact on the groups financial situation business or results of operations saft does not expect that such litigation and arbitration proceedings individually or collectively will have material adverse effect on the groups results of operations business or financial situation for more information concerning the method of provisioning for such litigation see

increased in 2004 compared to 2003 reflecting the acquisition of production equipment for new applications cost reduction programs and essential maintenance replacement and improvement of production equipment for example the group invested in equipment at its poitiers facility in order to allow for the launch of new range of primary lithium products principal capital expenditures in progress saft expects to spend approximately 24 million on capital expenditures in 2005 for the development of batteries for new applications cost reduction programs and essential maintenance and replacement of equipment including 34 million relating to opening its first manufacturing plant in china which will manufacture batteries for both its ibg and sbg divisions method of financing saft finances its capital expenditures through cash generated from operations production capacity the production units of saft currently all have unused production potential capacity saft believes therefore that it has unused production capacity allowing it to meet possible increases in demand nevertheless in view of the complexity of the sectors in which the group operates production capacity at certain principal production facilities may from time to time operate at full capacity the group believes it has sufficient production capacity to meet increases in demand in the medium term as anticipated by the management 412 parentsubsidiaryrelations the group is structured in order to maintain at least one subsidiary in each country in which it manufactures its products profit and loss items at the group

relating to safts business andstrategy technological developments could result in loss of the groups competitive advantages safts business is focused on specialized highend markets for advanced technology batteries saft holds leading positions in many of these markets because it provides high valueadded products to its customers through its innovative technologies and its ability to customize its products for the development and specifications of its customers at present standardized batteries produced using technologies currently available generally do not meet safts customers needs however technological developments in battery manufacturing may result in standardized batteries that meet these needs for example if technological developments enable modification of existing lowcost battery technologies such as lead acid batteries to meet the needs of its customers the groups combined revenues could be significantly affected in addition over the past several years new energy storage technologies such as fuel cell and flywheel technology have been introduced by certain of the groups competitors for use in selected applications that compete with the groups products safts ability to achieve significant and sustained penetration of key developing markets including aerospace and defence will depend upon its success in enhancing its products and 54strictlyconfidential developing new products to successfully compete with those new technologies if saft fails to develop manufacture and sell products that satisfy its customers demands market acceptance of its products could reduce significantly and its business could be adversely affected saft cannot ensure that its products will remain competitive with products based on new technologies such as fuel cell and flywheel technologies thegroupis exposed to competition andprice pressure certain segments of the groups activities are exposed to competition from low cost battery producers particularly in china for example with respect to small portable rechargeable batteries produced by the rbs division this competition creates downward pressure on prices preventing the group from recovering the increased cost of its raw materials in its pricing for products in these segments there can be assurance that new market entrants from countries with lower labor costs will not compete with the group in its other activities thereby forcing the group to lower prices and reduce margins thegroupis dependent onkey customers whomay reduce their demand for its products safts largest single customer is the us armed forces other major customers include the uk french and israeli armed forces sales to the us armed forces accounted for 123 of the groups combined revenues in 2004 including 113 with the us defense logistics agency change in safts relationship with these principal customers may have material adverse affect on its business and significant decrease in orders from the us armed forces and defence industry customers or the governments unilateral termination of the groups contracts with the us armed forces could result in substantial decrease in the groups revenues operating results and net income sales of the groups military lithium batteries to the us armed forces have increased due to recent international conflicts if the number of lithium batteries the us armed forces has purchased from saft exceeds the amount it currently needs due to changes in the geopolitical environment or because the us armed forces has purchased in excess of its needs they may significantly reduce their orders for the groups military lithium batteries in future years quality problems with the groups products could harm its reputation anderode its competitive position the success of safts business depends upon the quality of its products and its relationships with customers in the event that its products fail to meet its customers standards safts reputation could be harmed which could adversely affect its marketing and sales efforts saft cannot ensure that its customers will not experience quality problems with its products thegroupis dependent onits managers andkey employees safts success is highly dependent on its experienced management team which has strong reputation in the industry in addition safts production processes and research and development activities are dependent upon large number of engineers and other key employees there can be assurance that these members of management and key employees will remain with the group the groups future success will depend in particular on its ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified employees and managers however since competition to attract employees with such qualifications is intense there can be assurance that saft will be able to do so the loss of one or more key employees or manager or safts inability to attract other qualified employees could have material adverse effect on its results of operations thegroups cost reduction or profit improvement initiatives may prove inefficient the group must continue to implement cost reduction initiatives to achieve additional cost savings saft cannot ensure that it will be able to achieve all of the cost savings that it expects to realize the group may be unable to implement one or more of its initiatives successfully or it may experience unexpected cost increases that offset any savings that it may achieve which could have significant effect on its profit margins and net income relocation of the groups customers operations could adversely affect its business the trend by number of the groups customers to move manufacturing operations and expand their businesses into asia and other low laborcost markets may have an adverse impact on its business as the groups customers in traditional industries seek to move their manufacturing operations to lower cost territories there is risk that these customers will source their energy storage products from competitors of the group located in these territories 55strictlyconfidential for example an increasing number of the groups rail customers have production facilities in china although the group is planning to open new manufacturing facility in china to service these customers the group cannot ensure that it will be able to compete effectively with other battery producers in this country disagreements between eadsandthe groupover the jointlyheld subsidiary asbcould harm safts business one of safts subsidiaries is party with eads france to shareholders agreement relating to equal participation in the holding of asb company which primarily produces thermal batteries for military applications under the terms of this agreement any change of control of one of the two shareholders of asb gives the other party purchase option with respect to all the shares of asb held by the shareholder that is the subject of change of control see section 3332 hereof in such situation the price will be determined in the absence of an agreement between the parties by an expert chosen in accordance with article 18434 of the french civil code the group believes that eads france is not likely to exercise this purchase option in connection with the offering this shareholders agreement also provides for an alternative forced exit on financial terms imposed by the other party and not defined in the agreement in the event of serious and persistent disagreement between the parties while saft currently has good relationship with eads if this relationship were to deteriorate its business could be adversely affected in addition in the event of change of control allowing eads france to exercise its purchase option and the exercise by eads of this option or in the event of exercise of the alternative forced exit clause by eads france the group would longer benefit from the assets liabilities gains and charges of asb described in note 12 to the combined financial statements appearing in section 539 hereof risks related to commitments to the french state in connection with the agreement between the company and the french state described in section 492 hereof the companys french operating subsidiaries could be required to maintain in france for period exceeding six months the operation of certain activities and the development of certain products used for french national defence even though such operation or development may longer be economically viable and could thereby affect the financial situation of these subsidiaries in consideration of the products that are the subject of these commitments saft does not expect the effect of the commitments to have significant impact on the financial situation of the group thegroupmay fail to integrate successfully any acquisitions that it makes as part of its business development strategy saft has acquired other new or complimentary product lines technologies or facilities that complement or expand its existing business in particular by acquiring other companies future acquisitions may involve the issuance of equity securities of the company or of companies of the group as payment in part or in full for the businesses or assets acquired any future issuances of equity securities of the company would dilute the ownership interests of existing investors in addition future acquisitions may have the effect of decreasing the groups combined net income and consequently earnings per share the group also may incur additional debt or suffer adverse tax and accounting consequences in connection with any future acquisitions the group might experience difficulties in integrating any acquired business or assets which may hinder the groups business acquisitions might result in unanticipated liabilities unforeseen expenses and disruption of the groups organisation 4132 risks relating to the groups industry costs of certain of the groups raw materials are volatile and expose it to significant movements in its product costs the group uses significant amounts of metals in its manufacturing processes some of which are traded on world commodity markets the metals so traded and predominantly used by the group include nickel cadmium and cobalt with nickel representing 83 of purchases of these three metals the costs of these raw materials are function of supply and demand and are thereby beyond the groups control by way of example the london metals exchange posted for the period from january 2002 to december 2004 an increase of more than 150 in both cobalt and nickel prices while the price of cadmium increased nearly 100 56strictlyconfidential the increase in raw material cost has affected and may continue to affect safts operating results and make periodtoperiod comparisons extremely difficult the group cannot ensure that it will be able to acquire raw materials at reasonable cost or to pass on to its customers the increased costs in the event of an increase in world commodity prices for metals for example the group estimates that the impact of 10 variation in the price of nickel on the international markets would result without taking into account the effect of hedging arrangements in gain or loss of approximately 2 million as cobalt purchases represent only 2 million per year similar variation in the price of this metal would not have significant impact on the group in addition nickel powder which saft uses in the production of its nicd batteries is only available from single supplier while saft has had good relationship with this supplier in the past there can be assurance that the group will continue to be able to procure nickel powder from this supplier on reasonable terms cyclical industry conditions and geopolitical events have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the groups results of operations the groups operating results are affected by the cyclical pattern of its business as well as its customers needs for example the capital expenditures made by the telecommunications industry during the period from 1999 through 2001 contributed to the increase in demand for satellite and telecommunications equipment as the telecommunications industry significantly reduced capital expenditure programs in response to massive overcapacity the demand for batteries for these applications declined in addition the groups sales of batteries in the industrial markets are generally dependent on the level of capital expenditures in that sector weak capital expenditure environment could have material adverse effect on safts results of operations the groups combined revenues are also subject to the inherently unpredictable activities of the armed forces it supplies in recent years substantial amounts of military lithium products have been sold to the us armed forces geopolitical developments could lead to decline in sales of the groups military lithium products in future years revenues are also affected by trends in the aviation market the sharp decrease in air traffic in 2001 resulted in significant decline in demand for the batteries that the group supplies to the aviation market finally other events could negatively affect the groups volume of sales such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic which led to reduction in sales of batteries in the aviation market and slowed economic activity in asia thegroups combined revenues are dependent in part ongovernment spending significant portion of safts revenues is derived from defence spending defence spending for each country depends on complex mix of geopolitical considerations budgetary constraints and the ability of the armed forces to meet unforeseen threats and perform certain missions defence spending may be subject to significant fluctuations from year to year as result adverse economic and political conditions or downturns in broad economic trends in defence markets may have negative effect on the groups results of operations and financial condition in addition the contracts for many aerospace and defence products are awarded on the basis of home country preference saft may be at competitive disadvantage in some countries in relation to local contractors the strategic importance and political sensitivity attached to the aerospace and defence industries means that political considerations will continue to play role in the selection of suppliers thegroupis subject to number of procurement rules andregulations saft must comply with laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of government contracts government contract laws and regulations affect how it does business with its customers and in some instances impose added costs on its business violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the termination of safts contracts or prohibition from bidding on similar contracts these laws and regulations generally impose terms or rights that are more favorable to government authorities than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions for example the us government may at its convenience terminate any of safts government contracts 57strictlyconfidential defence transformation andplanning may affect future procurement priorities andexisting programs recent international conflicts and the continuing global war on terrorism have emphasized the need for the rapid deployment of sophisticated defence power and reaffirmed the need for new defence capabilities and solutions recent geopolitical events also highlight the need for improved logistics and information gathering and continued operations capability following the completion of hostilities toward that end defence agencies are considering transformative changes in operational concepts organizational structure and technologies the group may not be in position to respond to such changes in the needs of its defence clients and could thereby lose portion of these customers for example at the end of 2004 the group was unable to increase production of military lithium batteries sufficiently to meet the needs of the us armed forces leading the us armed forces to increase purchases from some of the groups competitors thegroups batteries are subject to export controls the export market is significant market for the group certain batteries produced by the group may be exported only after obtaining license namely in the united states united kingdom france israel or germany the approval procedures for such licenses are generally lengthy the distribution of products by the group is dependent on restrictions that either do not apply or only partially apply to the groups noneuropean competitors in addition us companies and companies located in the us must comply with the us regulations relating to the control of exports that limit the distribution of certain information products and materials to foreign individuals and entities the group could find itself longer able to operate in the united states and its customers would longer be able to supply themselves with batteries in the united states if the export licenses were not timely obtained the export licenses did not permit the shipment of all products ordered or the export licenses obtained contained conditions or restrictions creating significant technical or commercial difficulties any such occurrence could have significant affect on the groups combined revenues and results of operations if any other countries were to implement similar restrictions or if existing export licensing procedures were to become more restrictive distribution of the groups products could be significantly affected in addition the group cannot anticipate whether geopolitical events will make it impossible to obtain export licenses in certain countries which could equally have significant effect on the groups financial situation and results of operations thegroupis subject to risks of operating in many different countries significant portion of safts combined revenues is derived from its operations outside of europe and the united states which exposes it to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries in which it operates the occurrence of any of the risks described below could have material adverse effect on safts business political and economic instability civil unrest acts of terrorism force majeure war or other armed conflict natural disasters including those related to earthquakes and flooding inflation currency fluctuations devaluations and conversion restrictions confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies 58strictlyconfidential governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets restrict payments or limit the movement of funds governmental activities that may result in the deprivation of contract rights the absence or insufficiency of legislation protecting industrial property rights and trade restrictions and economic embargoes 4133 market risks exchange rate risk the group incurs large part of its expenses and receives part of its revenues in certain foreign currencies particularly us dollars and accordingly it is exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates between those currencies and the euro the groups us dollar costs are less than its us dollar revenues as result the recent decline of the us dollar against the euro has had negative impact on the groups profitability any further weakening of the us dollar against the euro or strengthening of the euro against the us dollar would further negatively affect safts results of operations and may also change safts competitive position as many of its competitors may benefit from having substantial portion of their costs based in weaker currencies enabling them to offer their products at more competitive prices in order to minimize in whole or in part the negative effects of currency fluctuations hedging arrangements were entered into in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 in the form of forward contracts covering the groups net exposure for periods of six months following the sale of the saft group by alcatel to the doughty hanson funds the hedging mechanisms put in place by alcatel longer apply to the group for practical reasons the group did not put in place hedging mechanisms in 2004 but intends in the future to pursue the policy put in place by the alcatel group prior to the sale see note 20 to the combined financial statements appearing in section 539 hereof in addition the group uses accounting software mfgpro which could permit it to determine which exchange rate positions to cover the company uses magnitude software for its reporting the group intends to use these computing tools in connection with its exchange risk coverage policy that it intends to implement in the near future finally significant portion of the groups financial debt as set forth in the pro forma financial statements as described in chapter 546 hereof is and will be following the initial public offering denominated in us dollars safts operations allow for payment of portion of the service of this debt through revenues invoiced in dollars the table below shows revenues operating expenses including costs of sales and other operating expenses such as personnel and research and development costs and net position of the group in us dollars and swedish krona at december 31 2004 these amounts are based on the financial statements including intragroup transactions of the groups foreign subsidiaries denominated in one of these currencies and taken into account in preparing the combined financial statements inmillions us dollars swedish krona revenues 341 619 operating expenditures 287 501 net position 54 118 the group considers that its exposure to other currencies is not significant 59strictlyconfidential liquidity risk due to the groups indebtedness as of december 31 2004 on the basis of the groups pro forma financial statements as described in chapter 546 hereof saft had 3750 million of pro forma debt safts significant amount of debt could have important consequences for example it could increase safts vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions including interest rate increases because significant portion of its borrowings bears interest at floating rates require saft to dedicate substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to debt service payments which would reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital capital expenditures cost reduction programs or acquire other businesses limit the groups ability to pay dividends limit the groups flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and the markets in which it operates restrict the groups ability to introduce new products or develop new technologies or exploit business opportunities place the group at disadvantage compared with competitors that have proportionately less debt and limit the groups ability to borrow additional funds in the future due to financial and restrictive covenants in its debt agreements the financing arrangements entered into or to be entered into by the groups companies in connection with the initial public offering of the company contain or will contain financial covenants see section 5432 hereof the groups ability to comply with these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond its control and the group cannot ensure that it will be able to comply with these covenants breach of any of these covenants could result in all amounts outstanding under these contracts to be immediately due and payable if the lenders were to accelerate the repayment of borrowings the group cannot ensure that it would have sufficient assets to repay the amounts due certain defaults or the acceleration of any repayment obligation under any of its material debt instruments could permit its other creditors to accelerate its obligations with respect to such debt when the companies of the group have excess cash the corresponding funds are invested on shortterm basis in monetary openended investment companies within the authorised contractual limits in connection with the planned refinancing to occur upon the companys initial public offering these limits will be cancelled upon the implementation of the refinancing and the group will use all options at its disposal for investment and management of available excess cash the groups companies currently generate and saft expects they will continue to generate in the future sufficient cash flow to meet the debt service requirements that they have contracted or will contract in connection with the companys initial public offering the group believes it will be able to achieve the objectives set forth in its strategic development plan described in section 43 hereof without recourse to additional funds interest rate risk on the basis of the assumptions mentioned in section 544 hereof 50 of the groups pro forma debt amounting to 1875 million is expected to be covered by interest rate swaps following the companys initial public offering as result without additional hedging 50 of the groups pro forma debt could bear interest at variable rates significant increase in interest rates could substantially increase the cost of this debt adversely affecting the groups consolidated net income based on the above assumptions the groups sensitivity to change of 1 in interest rates would be 19 million for description of the management of the groups exposure to interest rate risk see section 544 hereof 60strictlyconfidential share risk as the group does not own stake in any listed companies it is not exposed to share risk 4134 legal risks thegroups operations expose it to the risk of material environmental liabilities in the manufacture of its products the group has used and continues to use significant amounts of hazardous materials including nickel cobalt cadmium and lithium and to lesser extent mercury and asbestos as result the group is subject to extensive and changing local and international environmental protection health and safety laws and regulations these regulations which are ever more restrictive govern among other things emissions or discharges of hazardous materials into the air or water the handling storage use and disposal of hazardous materials asbestos removal and the remediation of environmental pollution compliance with these laws and regulations has resulted in ongoing costs for the group the assessment of the environmental risks of the group is carried out on regular basis under the direction of the groups manager responsible for the environment with the monitoring assistance of the person responsible for the groups sites in the united states and the person responsible for the groups site in sweden who in turn are assisted by site managers the company saft finance sarl benefits from certain contractual guarantees regarding environmental matters that cover within certain limits costs linked to cleanup of facilities and grounds polluted by group activities prior to 2004 these guarantees are valid until 2014 nevertheless the group is or could become subject to pollution monitoring andor environmental remediation by competent authorities for certain number of its sites as well as indemnification claims brought by local residents in the area of these sites in this regard the group recorded provision of 72 million linked to cleanup costs for its valdosta facility none of the groups other facilities individually represents an environmental risk with potential significant costs the group may be required to incur significant additional expenses in the event that new laws regulations or government policies are adopted or in the event of additional demands by competent authorities additional regulations could also limit the groups ability to modify or expand its facilities or continue production and require it to install additional costly pollution control equipment and make other significant capital improvements particularly with respect to the remediation of existing sites failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of administrative civil and criminal sanctions in certain countries environmental laws and regulations assess liability not only on the basis of group activities and sites it operates but also on the basis of past activity or with respect to sites that have been discontinued or sold many of the groups current and former manufacturing sites have prior history of industrial use in addition the group may be liable in application of certain laws for contribution to the cleanup of locations owned or operated by other persons to which the group has sent waste for disposal pursuant to such laws the owner or operator of the contaminated site and the producer of the waste disposed of at the site may be held jointly responsible for the cleanup of these sites regardless of fault the european parliament has recently introduced an amendment to the existing regulation governing batteries which proposes to require collection of all batteries after use with responsibility for doing so placed on the manufacturer the proposal would also ban the use of cadmium in consumer batteries although the group already has system in place for the collection of batteries used by its customers the ban on the use of cadmium could have significant impact on sales of consumer batteries manufactured by the rbs division and could result in additional costs if the group is required to use different metals for these batteries the company is not in position to measure the costs that may be incurred as result of the new draft european regulations whose definitive terms are not yet known assurance can be given that this ban will not also eventually apply to the groups other applications due to the high energy density of lithium batteries manufactured by the group these batteries can pose safety risks especially fire risk while saft has implemented safety measures in its research and development and production processes assurance can be made that an accident will not occur in addition while the group has subscribed for insurance policies covering environmental risks and the risk of destruction of its factories and manufacturing equipment any accident whether occurring at production site or in connection with the use of 61strictlyconfidential one of the groups products could result in considerable production delays or claims for indemnification based on strict liability any such occurrence could have an adverse effect on the groups activities financial situation and results of operations finally in the realm of the regulation of products and their placement on the market the adoption of the future european regulation concerning the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach see section 481 hereof draft form of which was adopted by the european commission on october 29 2003 and which is currently under review by the european parliament and european council could require the group to modify certain manufacturing processes or could result in significant additional costs to the group nevertheless these consequences and costs cannot be precisely estimated given the current uncertainties regarding the content of this regulation the spreading of costs among the different parties and the unknown date of its adoption current and former employees of the group may have been and to certain degree may continue to be exposed to hazardous or toxic substances in the manufacture of its products the group used and continues to use significant amounts of toxic or hazardous materials despite the safety and monitoring procedures implemented at the group level and at each individual production site the groups employees could have been exposed to these substances and may develop illnesses for which they may seek to hold the group liable in addition the groups employees at certain sites may have been exposed and may continue to be exposed to other hazardous or toxic materials for which they may seek to hold the groups companies liable should they develop illnesses related to such exposure thegroupmay be subject to product liability andwarranty claims the group designs develops and produces number of high technology products for use notably in the rail aviation and space industries in certain contracts saft provides warranties on its products lasting from one to 10 years on the proper functioning of its products and the conformity of product to the specific use defined by the customer in case of the failure of battery produced by saft to function properly saft could face contractual or tortious liability for bodily injury or other tangible or intangible damages suffered as result in addition if device equipped with saft battery is faulty it cannot be ruled out that the manufacturer of the device will allege that the saft battery is the cause of the fault even if the battery complies with contractual specifications this risk is particularly acute with batteries used in aircraft and satellites as it is often difficult in these cases to determine the cause of the fault the failure of device equipped with saft battery could also result in additional research and development costs monopolize the groups technical and economic resources and damage safts commercial reputation the group could also be exposed to significant expenses as result of products being returned by customers such expenses could result in significant reduction in safts available cash and significantly reduce its future profitability in addition saft may give customers discounts on future products as result of product failure which could adversely affect its future earnings finally saft could lose certain customers which would negatively affect its combined revenues thegroupmay not be able to adequately protect its proprietary industrial property andtechnology despite the groups efforts to protect its proprietary industrial property and technology and other confidential information third parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use its industrial property and proprietary technologies without authorization monitoring the unauthorized use of safts industrial property rights is costly and difficult and saft may be unable to adequately protect its industrial property rights or prevent its unauthorized appropriation in addition any litigation to enforce the groups industrial property rights or to ensure the confidentiality of its proprietary information may result in substantial costs for the group and if decided unfavorably to the group could have material adverse effect on its results business or financial condition 62strictlyconfidential thegroupoffers its products under variety of brand names the protection of which is important to its reputation for quality in the consumer marketplace the group relies upon combination of trademark licensing and contractual covenants to protect the brand names of its products in many market segments the groups reputation is closely related to its brand names the group engages in monitoring designed to prevent or terminate all unauthorized use of its trademarks the group recently brought an action in the uk for trademark infringement concerning its nife trademark against the companies hbl nife uk ltd and hbl nife power systems ltd and has sent cease and desist letter to hbl china hk ltd in hong kong monitoring unauthorized use of safts brand names is difficult and it cannot be certain that the steps it has taken will prevent their unauthorized use particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not fully protect the groups proprietary rights the group cannot ensure that its brand names will not be misappropriated or utilized without its consent or that such actions will not have material adverse effect on its reputation and on its results of operations confidentiality constraints may prevent management from gaining access to technical commercial andother data relating to its subsidiaries these constraints may prevent saft from disclosing certain information to investors certain of the groups subsidiaries supply the armed forces of various countries in particular those of the united states israel and france and may therefore be subject to confidentiality constraints that restrict the ability to disclose sensitive information to anyone not from the country in question these constraints may prevent safts management from having access to certain confidential technical and commercial information relating to its subsidiaries which may impair managements ability to make informed strategic decisions or to have access to certain information necessary for the preparation of safts financial data in addition even if safts management were to have access to this information confidentiality constraints could prevent management from disclosing detailed information relating to commercial activity or projects that investors may consider significant 63strictlyconfidential 5 assetsandliabilitiesfinancialpositionresults 51 generaldescriptionof thefinancialstatements general description the group saft is organized into three divisions the specialty battery group sbg which manufactures batteries for applications including water gas and electricity utility meters automated meter readers and road tolling systems computer memory backup systems satellites radios and other portable systems for military use missiles and torpedoes the industrial battery group ibg which manufactures batteries used for standby power supplies for industrial applications telecommunications networks and the aviation and rail industries as well as for powering electric and hybrid vehicles the rechargeable battery systems rbs division which manufactures specialized range of rechargeable batteries used in emergency lighting professional electronics and limited number of consumer electronics applications in january 2004 the doughty hanson funds acquired from alcatel all of the operations of the saft group which are now carried on by the operating entities of the group description of the financial statements the description and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the whole of this information document and in particular the audited combined financial statements of saft for the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 and the notes thereto the combined financial statements presented in section 539 and the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 the pro forma financial statements presented in section 54 the discussion and analysis of the financial position and results of operations provided in section 532 were prepared on the basis of the combined financial statements in view of the date of their appointment the current auditors of saft were unable to attend the physical inventory counts of the operating entities of saft for the years ended december 31 2001 2002 and 2003 the auditors have explained the consequences of this situation in their declaration contained in section 12 of this information document and in their reports on the combined financial statements the pro forma financial statements and the ifrs reconciliation unless otherwise indicated the term combined revenues when used in this chapter refers to the combined revenues of the operating entities of the group as presented in the combined financial statements the combined financial statements the combined financial statements present on combined basis the assets liabilities revenues and expenses directly attributable to the activities of the group for the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 they have been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers audit whose report is included in section 5310 of this information document because alcatel did not prepare separate financial statements for the activities now included in the scope of safts operations the combined financial statements for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2003 have been prepared on the basis of financial statements of the operating entities of the saft group prepared for the purposes of the consolidation of the alcatel group for these years the combined financial statements do not include the financial and accounting consequences of the formation of the new group in particular i the acquisition of the operating entities of the saft group by the doughty hanson funds in january 2004 and ii the financing structure implemented in december 2004 the combined financial statements are not necessarily representative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been reported if the group had been an independent entity from january 1 2002 64strictlyconfidential the discussion of combined revenues and net income from operations contained in section 532 is based on the combined income statements of the group the pro formafinancial statements the pro forma financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the combined financial statements and the notes thereto they have not been audited by safts auditors but have been subject to limited review in accordance with french auditing standards as set out in standard 4102 of the compagnie nationale des commissaires aux comptes cncc the pro forma financial statements have been prepared by making adjustments to the combined financial statements based on the assumptions described in section 542 of this information document these adjustments are intended to reflect the financial position and results of operations of the group that would have been reported if it had existed as separate and autonomous entity during the periods in question on the basis of estimates and assumptions made by group management pro forma financial statements restate historical financial information on the basis that transaction or event occurred on date earlier than that on which it actually occurred or might reasonably be expected to occur however they are not necessarily representative of the financial position or the performance that would have been reported if that transaction or event had occurred on date before that on which it actually occurred or might be expected to occur the pro forma financial statements cover the combination of the new group following the acquisition in january 2004 of the operating entities of the saft group by the doughty hanson funds the pro forma financial statements also aim to portray the financial situation following the reorganisation and the refinancing transactions that will occur simultaneously with the initial public offering of the company the costs of previous financings and the non recurring charges borne by the holding companies from the above mentioned acquisition and its financing were as result excluded from the income statement included in the pro forma financial statements but are however included in the balance sheet for the year ended december 31 2004 presented in the pro forma financial statements the pro forma financial statements show the impact on the financial statements of the allocation of the acquisition price to the assets and liabilities of the group based on the price paid for the operating entities in january 2004 the effects of the reorganisation as described in section 323 hereof are also included in the pro forma financial statements the pro forma financial statements also take into account the effects of the refinancing of 4600 million in debt contracted in euros and us dollars on december 17 2004 which is expected to be put in place upon the admission for trading of the companys shares on the eurolist market of euronext paris at current exchange rates the amount of debt to be refinanced was estimated in the pro forma financial statements at 4700 million this refinancing will occur by new financing of 375 million as described in section 543 hereof use of portion of the groups available cash and use of the net cash proceeds from capital increase to be raised in the offering for the purposes of establishing the pro forma financial statements the net proceeds from the above mentioned capital increase are estimated at 80 million this amount may nevertheless vary as function of the final conditions of the offering and the final amount of the fees and commissions paid by the company in connection with the capital increase under this assumption 15 million of the available cash of the group would be used transition to ifrs pursuant to european regulation 16062002 of july 19 2002 on international accounting standards the consolidated financial statements of saft groupe sa for the year ending december 31 2005 will be prepared in accordance with international accounting standards and international financial reporting standards collectively ifrs the effects of the transition to ifrs on the pro forma financial statements are described in section 55 of this information document 65strictlyconfidential highlights of the 20022004 period growth in revenues combined revenues of the group increased from 5524 million in 2002 to 5572 million in 2003 and 5869 million in 2004 trends in combined revenues from 2002 to 2004 for each of the groups divisions are discussed below sbg in both 2003 and 2004 the growth in the divisions revenues was due to the growing use of lithium batteries for variety of military and industrial applications in particular rising demand from the us french uk and indian armed forces was factor in revenue growth among civil applications contributing to the growth in sbg division revenues were automated meter readers and road tolling systems especially in the united states and europe and the growing demand for batteries for utility meters especially in china ibg after period of substantial investment in stationary industrial batteries followed by sharp economic slowdown starting in 2001 the recovery that started in 2003 continued in 2004 increasing sales of these batteries for the ibg division the recovery in air traffic over the same period led to increased demand for the batteries produced by the division for the aviation industry rbs despite difficult market conditions due to competition from china which has exerted downward pressure on prices the rbs division recorded an increase in revenues in 2004 largely due to demand for emergency lighting batteries in the united states and the united kingdom changes in the scope of combination in april 2003 the alcatel group acquired friemann und wolf batterietechnik gmbh friwo from exide and certain assets of emisa and centra these companies produce nicd industrial batteries primary lithium batteries for the defence industry and batteries installed in torpedoes friwo and the emisa and centra assets have been included in the scope of combination of the saft group from april 2003 generating revenues of 149 million for the year ended december 31 2003 however the payment by alcatel of the acquisition price is not included in the scope of combination because the price of the acquisition was incorporated into the price at which the saft group was sold to the doughty hanson funds tadiran batteries ltd and its subsidiaries were acquired by the alcatel group in 2000 the activities of these companies managed by the saft group have been included in the scope of combination for the entire period in 2003 the shares in tadiran were sold by the alcatel group to saft ab sweden for 288 million strong growth in combined revenues at constant exchange rates due to significant exchange rate fluctuations in 2003 and 2004 in particular the decline in the us dollar against the euro and other currencies such as the swedish krona pound sterling and the czech koruna the improvement in the operating results of saft is not fully reflected in the groups results of operations as result of these significant fluctuations and in order to keep better track of its operational performance saft measures trends in revenues at constant exchange rates by applying to the 2002 and 2003 figures the average 2004 exchange rates for currencies used by the group saft not only calculates combined revenues at constant exchange rates retrospectively to measure past performance but also uses constant exchange rates as growth indicator to set targets for future periods saft believes this method to be satisfactory indicator of the groups progress and prospects because it eliminates the impact of exchange rates on trends in combined revenues at constant exchange rates combined revenues rose from 4889 million in 2002 to 5365 million in 2003 and 5869 million in 2004 reflecting growth of 20 between 2002 and 2004 within the group the sbg division achieved substantial growth in revenues between 2002 and 2004 recording rise of 456 at constant exchange rates the average exchange rates used in the income statement were 094 to 10 for the year ended december 31 2002 113 to 10 for the year ended

margin gross margin as percentage of combined revenues increased from 262 in 2002 to 274 in 2003 and 309 in 2004 despite increases in the prices of raw materials used by saft in the production of batteries component and raw materials costs represent significant portion of cost of sales in 2004 these costs amounted to1862 million accounting for over half of the groups combined cost of sales and 317 of combined revenues in particular large quantities of metals are used in the groups manufacturing processes during 2004 the group spent approximately 487 million on metals purchases including approximately 239 million on nickel cobalt and cadmium these metals have undergone substantial price fluctuations in recent years for example on the london metals exchange for the period from january 2002 through december 2004 the prices of cobalt and nickel increased by over 150 and the price of cadmium by nearly 100 these price increases primarily affected gross margins in the ibg and rbs divisions the sbg division was affected to much lesser extent because the price of lithium its main material has not fluctuated significantly in recent years saft has managed to increase gross margins as percentage of combined revenues despite these increases in raw material prices as result of its hedging strategy its ability to pass on portion of the increase in costs to customers and production cost savings in 2003 and 2004 these savings were achieved by restructuring number of production units and are result of the program of continuous improvement the world class manufacturing excellence program implemented by the group see section 43 of this information document for description of this program restructuring costs during the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 saft carried out restructuring activities that had an impact on net income from operations for these years these costs amounted to 86 million in 2002 177 million in 2003 and 26 million in 2004 and related mainly to the following restructuring plans in 2002 strategic refocusing of the rbs division incurring restructuring costs of 20 million at the west palm beach site united states and 57 million at the nersac site france in 2003 restructuring of the nersac site france at cost of 22 million in 2004 closure of the plant at duisburg germany belonging to friwo with the transfer of production from this site to another group site at büdingen germany resulting in charge of 136 million for the year ended december 31 2003 and charge of 25 million for the year ended december 31 2004 these restructuring plans have reduced the groups fixed cost base and generated savings in production costs saft has also recorded certain income and expenses related to restructuring plans carried out in 2002 and 2003 under other operating incomeexpense net the resulting amounts are net charge of 69 million in 2002 net gain of 58 million in 2003 and net gain of 17 million in 2004 the net charge for 2002 mainly comprises charges to provisions for impairment of assets due to idle capacity arising from the restructuring of the nersac site 34 million and from decline in activities relating to the telecommunications sector at the bordeaux site 09 million and the valdosta site 18 million in 2003 saft recognized 31 million gain on the divestment of its interest in saft power systems the net gain of 17 million recorded in the year ended december 31 2004 includes an amount of 05 million relating to the restructuring of friwo and gain of 08 million on an insurance payout received following fire at facility

include the impact of the historical presence of the operating entities of the group within the alcatel group and of their withdrawal from the alcatel group in 2004 this resulted in the recognition of noncash deferred tax gain of 82 million in 2003 and non cash deferred tax charge of 159 million in 2004 excluding these noncash items relating to the groups former position within the alcatel group the income tax charge would have been 123 million in 2002 171 million in 2003 and 266 million in 2004 income taxes actually paid by the operating entities of the saft group amounted to 58 million in 2002 171 million in 2003 and 170 million in 2004 the pro forma financial statements presented in section 54 eliminate items attributable to the withdrawal from the alcatel group and include the effects of the acquisition of the saft group entities by the doughty hanson funds in january 2004 these effects are attributable mainly to more favorable tax treatment within the groups us subsidiaries and to the deductibility of interest charges on the debt used to finance the acquisition however the deductibility of these interest charges was only partially taken into account because portion of the debt of saft finance sarl company organized under luxembourg law was not deductible in the absence of any luxembourgbased operating entities that might have been able to offset the interest charges on the debt against their profits saft intends in the future to structure its debt so as to maximize the deductibility of the interest charges arising on the debt for detailed

accordance with french generally accepted accounting principles as contained in regulation 9902 of the comité réglementation comptable on the consolidated financial statements of commercial companies issued on april 29 1999 the financial statements of the operating entities of the saft group have been adjusted to bring them into conformity with the accounting policies applied by saft for list of the main combined operating entities see note 3 to the combined financial statements presented in section 539 of this information document revenue recognition in general and in accordance with french accounting rules revenue is recognized when there is formal agreement with the customer delivery has occurred the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to saft in recognizing revenues and profits on longterm contracts in particular contracts relating to the construction or design of specific batteries saft applies the percentage of completion method subject to certain specific criteria such as achievement of contractuallyagreed milestones or the actual costs incurred relative to the estimated total cost of the contract in the year ended december 31 2004 such contracts represented revenues of approximately 40 million equivalent to approximately 7 of combined revenues partial payments received on longterm contracts are recorded as liability under prepayments from customers 71strictlyconfidential cost of sales cost of sales principally comprises production costs which includes the cost of raw materials and other components used in production direct production costs mainly salaries and indirect production costs that are attributable to the production of the goods sold depreciation of property plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets provisions and direct selling costs freight packaging and sales commissions foreign currency translation for the purposes of the combined financial statements the balance sheets of companies located outside the euro zone ie whose functional currency is not the euro are translated into euros at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and their income statements and statements of cash flows are translated into euros at the average exchange rates for the year the resulting translation difference is included in shareholders equity under cumulative translation adjustment transactions expressed in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction at the balance sheet date monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on that date all translation differences are recorded in the income statement unless otherwise indicated figures presented in chapter 5 relating wholly or partially to transactions expressed in foreign currencies have been converted into euros in accordance with the accounting principles described in the two preceding paragraphs inventories andworkin process the procedures applied by the operating entities of saft require physical inventory count to be performed at least once year these counts are performed by operational personnel and involve either i taking single full count of all inventory items in given location or ii checking inventory quantities by means of cycle counts organized so that virtually all inventory lines are checked at least once in each financial year these procedures were applied by the operating entities of the saft group during the years ended december 31 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 provisions provisions for liabilities and charges provisions or liabilities and charges are recorded when the group has present obligation legal or constructive resulting from past event it is probable that an outflow of resources will be necessary to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably measured where the group expects the amount provided for to be repaid in full or in part for example under an insurance policy or vendors guarantee of liabilities the repayment is recognized as separate asset provided that recovery is certain provisions for contractual claims relate mainly to product warranties and other specific risks provisions for product warranties primarily cover the risk of valid product returns during the warranty period except in exceptional cases the warranty period ranges from 12 months for standard batteries to 10 years for more information see note 18 to the combined financial statements and section 492 of this information document the group also recognizes provisions to cover claims from customers in respect of products shipped by the group 72strictlyconfidential provisions for contractual claims are determined on the basis of information indicating that technical problem has arisen on product whether sold or in inventory information may be obtained from internal sources quality control department or from external sources customer claims referred to the sales department the information is then processed by the technical and quality departments which analyze and calculate on statistical basis the quantities affected the group recognizes warranty provisions by reference to contractual terms and statistics based on past experience and on the basis of estimates and assumptions made by group management in the light of information about the underlying risks these estimates and assumptions are determined on the basis of formal claims made by the groups customers the information contained in these claims is compared with internal technical data in order to quantify the extent of the risk the costs actually incurred by the group may differ from these estimates which may have material impact on its financial position for historical data about charges to provisions and releases and utilization of provisions during the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 see note 18 to the combined financial statements presented in section 539 of this information document provisions for restructuring restructuring costs are provided for immediately and in full when the group has an obligation towards third parties arising from decision by an appropriate corporate body which is evidenced before the balance sheet date by the announcement of the decision to the third parties involved the costs recognized mainly comprise termination payments and early retirement benefits termination notice periods not provided to employees costs for retraining of employees made redundant and site closure costs retirements of fixed assets and impairment of inventories and other assets directly attributable to restructuring plans are also included in these provisions provisions for pension and retirement benefit obligations the group has pension early retirement and retirement benefit plans that comply with the laws and customs of each of the countries in which it operates contributions to basic pension plans and other definedcontribution plans are recognized as an expense when they fall due provision is recorded as the group has obligation beyond the contributions paid provisions for obligations in respect of definedbenefit postemployment benefit plans are measured on the following basis the actuarial method used is the projected unit credit method which regards each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation these calculations build in assumptions regarding mortality employee turnover and salary inflation the estimated future benefits are discounted using rates appropriate to each country discount rates are determined by reference to the yield on government bonds and highquality corporate bonds actuarial gains or losses representing over 10 of the amount of the obligation or of the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining working lives of the employees in the plan the following definedbenefit plans operate within the group annuity retirees are paid pension throughout their retirement these plans operate mainly in germany lump sum on retirement or cessation of employment in france employees are entitled to receive lump sum benefit when they retire 73strictlyconfidential 532 discussion and analysis of combined results for the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 5321 comparison of the years

calculated by applying the average exchange rate for the year ended december 31 2004 used to translate the income statements of entities located outside the euro zone the modest growth in the groups revenues during 2003 was due to the appreciation of the euro which had negative effect on the groups reported revenues other factors that adversely affected the groups revenues included the strategy of reducing sales to consumer markets in the rbs division and the general economic slowdown from 2001 through 2003 which in particular had an effect on the ibg division especially products for the aviation industry conversely the sbg division recorded strong growth as result of strong sales in the civil lithium and military lithium segments the growth recorded in 2004 was due largely to an increase in orders for batteries in cyclical industries such as oil telecommunications and space and to the geopolitical situation which continued to create favorable climate for the batteries made by saft for the defence industry these trends were helpful for the sbg division especially the military lithium and civil lithium segments and the ibg division all segments but especially new

lithium sales were not recorded separately the total for these segments amounted to 1462 million the breakdown for the year ended december 31 2002 shown here is based on estimates made by the group over the last two years the divisions revenues benefited from strong sales driven by strong demand for lithium batteries in defence markets especially in the united states and by the development of civil markets for lithium batteries another reason for the increase in sbg division combined revenues in 2003 was the acquisition of friwo in april 2003 which added 94 million to revenues for that year growth during 2003 and 2004 however was significantly hampered by the appreciation of the euro as over half of the sbg divisions sales are generated outside the euro zone civil lithium in both 2003 and 2004 the growth in civil lithium revenues was direct result of growing use of lithium batteries for variety of industrial applications such as automated meter reading and road tolling systems especially in the united states and europe and rising demand for batteries for utility meters especially in china the civil lithium market is experiencing strong growth worldwide especially in the united states and asia where the number of applications is continually growing with new applications such as satellite tracking systems tyre pressure sensors and other equipment for highend vehicles over the last three years civil lithium segment revenues have been adversely affected by the decline in value of the us dollar 75strictlyconfidential military lithium in both 2003 and 2004 the growth in military lithium revenues reflected increased demand by the us armed forces which began to decrease gradually in the second half of 2004 after reaching high levels as result of the geopolitical situation additional growth factors in 2003 included strong demand from the israeli armed forces and the acquisition of friwo which contributed 32 million to military lithium revenues in 2004 heavy demand for batteries from the french and uk armed forces also contributed to growth the fall in the us dollar negatively impacted the growth in revenues recorded by this segment in 2003 and 2004 traditional defense the high rate of growth in revenues in 2003 was mainly due to the acquisition during the year of friwo which contributed 62 million to combined revenues for this segment during 2003 friwo accelerated shipments and billings in anticipation of the closure of the duisburg site which took place in 2004 thermal battery producer asb jointly owned by saft and eads recorded strong revenues in 2004 in this segment the majority of revenues are generated in europe or in other markets where sales are invoiced in euros consequently growth in revenues at constant exchange rates is virtually the same as growth in revenues at actual exchange rates satellites in sector affected by the depressed state of the telecommunications market in 2002 and 2003 saft managed to achieve revenue growth at constant exchange rates in both 2003 and 2004 as result of the first shipments of pioneering liion technology satellite batteries the first two geostationary satellites to use these batteries were successfully deployed in 2004 the growth in combined revenues for this segment in 2004 was mainly due to an increase in demand from some telecommunications operators the fall in the us dollar had an adverse effect on this segment mainly in 2002 newdefense in 2003 the awarding of contracts to develop liion batteries was the main growth factor for this segment in 2004 saft signed its first contract for batteries intended for sophisticated missileguidance system although revenues declined yearonyear due largely to the effect of the declining value of the us dollar air depolarized these batteries based on old technology represent historical business for saft in contracting market saft nevertheless intends to retain this business for as long as it continues to generate adequate margins all revenues for this segment are generated in the euro zone or in other markets where sales are billed in euros consequently the trends in this segment at constant or actual exchange rates are the same ibg division the tables below show combined revenues for the ibg division by market segment at actual and constant exchange rates for the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004

factors firstly the appreciation of the euro had an adverse effect on its revenues since more than half of the divisions revenues are generated outside the euro zone secondly the global economic slowdown and the continuation of the crisis that first emerged in the telecommunications and aviation sectors in 2001 affected the entire ibg division in 2002 and 2003 however both sectors saw recovery starting in the second half of 2003 the impact of which was felt primarily in 2004 industrial standby in 2003 the industrial standby segment experienced slight increase in revenues despite slowdown in investment by the oil industry in the middle east as result of the unfavorable geopolitical climate during the year saft recognized most of the revenues on the bess contract for the supply of the most powerful battery ever built to be used as standby power source in the city of fairbanks alaska in the event of power failure growth in 2004 and especially in 2003 was also hampered by the fall in the us dollar the strong growth recorded in 2004 was due mainly to increased sales of batteries related to the world economic recovery and marked upturn in investment particularly in oil and gas production due to high oil prices telecoms standby growth in standby batteries for the telecommunications industry generally correlates with the level of investment in telecommunications infrastructure the decline in this segments revenues during 2003 was consequence of the crisis in the telecommunications sector in 2001 and 2002 and the resulting slowdown in investment amplified by the impact of the falling dollar in segment which generates the majority of its sales in the united states the strong growth recorded in 2004 was reflection of the upturn in the telecommunications sector which began that year aviation industry the growth recorded by the aviation industry segment in 2004 reflects growing demand for batteries associated with the significant recovery in air traffic during the year following the marked slowdown in the industry in response to the sars epidemic in asia and the geopolitical events of 2001 2002 and 2003 the growth in 2004 was also the result of rebuilding inventories by distributors who supply airlines which had fallen to abnormally low levels at the end of 2003 in both 2003 and 2004 growth was impaired by the appreciation of the euro rail industry the decline during 2003 was mainly due to slowdown in investment by rail operators in france in particular and to the completion of certain major rail programs in the united states in 2004 the strong results in this segment were largely driven by programs initiated by railway manufacturers especially in the united kingdom and italy and by new contracts in the united states in both 2003 and 2004 the rise in the euro affected the segments growth 77strictlyconfidential electric hybrid electric vehiclesnew technologies the decrease in this segments revenues in 2003 was mainly due to the completion of programs relating to the first generation of electric vehicles fitted with the nicd batteries developed by saft for automobile manufacturers the growth recorded in 2004 was generated by expansion in the new technologies segment due in part to the development of nimh technology for hybrid tramway programme as well as to the billing of contract to develop liion batteries for newgeneration hybrid electric vehicles to be produced by daimlerchrysler because the majority of this segments sales are made in the euro zone or in other markets where sales are invoiced in euros

electronics mobility sales were not recorded separately the breakdown shown here for the year ended december 31 2002 is based on estimates made by the group the significant decline in the divisions revenues in 2003 was mainly result of safts strategy of further reducing its exposure to consumer markets retaining only high margin and high value added products most of the divisions competitors price their products in us dollars they therefore have competitive edge over the rbs division which incurs its costs in euros and are exerting downward pressure on prices in 2004 the effect of the continuing strategy of phased withdrawal from consumer products was almost entirely offset by modest growth in emergency lighting alarms and professional electronics 78strictlyconfidential emergency lighting alarms the decrease in this segments revenues during 2003 was attributable primarily to contraction in the market closely correlated with the construction industry the end user of emergency lighting and to erosion of safts market share in 2004 with the market recording slight growth saft recaptured some of its market share especially in the united kingdom and the united states despite the aggressive pricing policies of its chinese competitors professional electronics mobility in this segment saft sells mainly to small and midsized enterprises manufacturing wide variety of products this segment reported decrease in revenues in 2003 due to reduced demand from distributors serving certain defence markets although sales in the mobility sector increased the slight growth recorded in 2004 came mainly from sales to the highend tool and mobility markets illustrating the benefits of diversified range of products in both 2003 and 2004 growth in this segment was limited by lower sales prices portable telecommunications and consumer world demand in this segment is largely driven by consumer electronics manufacturers with production sites in asia the decline in this segments combined revenues in 2003 and 2004 reflects safts strategy of phased withdrawal from consumer markets retaining only highmargin and high valueadded products and focusing primarily on the european market the decrease in this segments revenues in 2003 and 2004 was due to lower selling prices and reduction in safts market share amplified by the appreciation of the euro 53212 gross profit the tables below

in 2004 this result takes into account or reflects the appreciation of the euro significant increases in the prices of some raw materials used by the group net of the impact of hedging contracts and the groups ability to pass some of the raw material price increases on to customers 79strictlyconfidential sbg division the increase in gross profit in 2003 and 2004 was attributable to growth in revenues which rose by 426 million in 2003 and by 99 million in 2004 and an improvement in variable margin which had an impact of 3 million in 2003 and 2 million in 2004 variable profit is defined as gross profit before depreciation and amortization provisions for liabilities and charges and indirect production costs major factor in the increase in gross profit for 2003 was the acquisition of friwo in april 2003 which generated 94 million in revenues and 20 million of gross profit another factor was marked improvement in margins on longterm contracts for products in the space and defence industries these positive effects were offset by an increase in fixed costs associated with the acquisition of friwo 27 million and by the redesignation of the cockeysville site from research site to production site 23 million previously recorded in rd costs reclassified as production costs in 2004 factors underlying the increase in gross profit included an insurance payout of 08 million to the groups israeli subsidiary tadiran batteries ltd as compensation for loss of profits following fire oneoff royalty payment of 08 million made to saft america inc by competitor for using saft technology and reclassification of 16 million from production costs to administrative expenses these favorable factors were partly offset by sharp increase of 25 million in charges to provisions mainly to cover specific technical risk connected with contract in the satellite sector unlike the rbs and ibg divisions the sbg division for the reasons explained under growth in gross margin in section 51 of this information document experienced little impact from the increase in raw material prices ibg division the decline in gross profit in 2003 was mainly due to the decrease in revenues which was only partially offset by reduction in fixed production costs of 3 million in 2004 the increase in gross profit was due to combination of higher revenues an increase of 213 million in 2004 lower fixed production costs decrease of 05 million in 2004 despite higher production volumes and a24 million reduction in charges to provisions this increase in gross profit was achieved despite sharp increase in the cost of the raw materials used by the division in particular the price of nickel more than doubled between the end of june 2003 and the end of june 2004 and despite unfavorable exchange rate movements rbsdivision the rbs division recorded an increase in gross profit in 2003 despite decrease in revenues this was largely due to lower fixed production costs which were reduced by 34 million at the nersac site following the restructuring carried out in 2002 and 2003 in 2004 the decline in gross profit was mainly due to combination of lower revenues and an increase in the price of metals primarily nickel cobalt and steel these negative effects were only partly offset by 05 million decrease in fixed production costs and 26 million reduction in charges to provisions in 2003 provision of this amount had been booked to cover the indirect financial consequences of the termination of programme with european automobile manufacturer 80strictlyconfidential 53213 net income from operations

divisions ebitda was attributable mainly to the 18 million increase in gross profit and the 18 million reduction in fixed costs in 2004 the increase was due to 91 million increase in gross profit

operating activities in 2003 was mainly due to an increase of 248 million in working capital needs compared with 384 million decrease in working capital needs for the year ended december 31 2002 figures at the end of 2002 were affected by the alcatel groups policy of reducing working capital needs in particular through factoring and the assignment of receivables totaling 106 million in 2003 this improvement in working capital needs was sustainable largely due to combination of higher yearend trade receivables as result of strong revenue growth relative to 2002 in the latter part of the year and additional advance payments made to suppliers to guarantee certain raw materials prices in 2004 more even spread of sales through the year and close management of the period of credit

information may be obtained from internal sources quality control department or from external sources customer claims referred to the sales department the information is then processed by the technical and quality departments which analyze and calculate on statistical basis the quantities at issue the group recognizes warranty provisions by reference to contractual terms and statistics based on past experience and on estimates and assumptions made by the group in the light of information about the underlying risks these estimates and assumptions are determined on the basis of formal claims made by the groups customers the information contained in these claims is compared with internal technical data in order to quantify the extent of the risk the costs actually incurred by the group may differ from these estimates and this may have material impact on its financial position restructuring costs are provided for immediately and in full when the group has an obligation towards third party arising from decision by an appropriate corporate body which is evidenced before the balance sheet date by the announcement of the decision to the third parties involved the costs

contributions paid provisions for obligations in respect of postemployment definedbenefit plans are measured on the following basis the actuarial method used is the projected unit credit method which sees each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation these calculations build in assumptions regarding mortality employee turnover and salary inflation the estimated future benefits are discounted using rates appropriate to each country discount rates are determined by reference to the yield on government bonds and highquality corporate bonds actuarial gains or losses representing over 10 of the amount of the obligation or of the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining working lives of the employees in the plan the following definedbenefit plans operate within the group i annuity retirees are paid pension throughout their retirement these plans operate mainly in germany ii lump sum on retirement or cessation of employment in france employees are entitled to receive lump sum benefit when they retire certain other employee benefits such as

commodity price risk fluctuations in the prices of metals used by saft in the production of batteries may have material impact on the groups gross margin some metals used by saft in the production of batteries in particular nickel and cobalt are traded on the international commodity markets saft hedges significant portion of its projected nickel and cobalt requirements using forward purchase contracts generally denominated in euros gains and losses arising on these hedging contracts are recognized in cost of sales for the division whose future needs are covered by the hedge 106strictlyconfidential b management of exposure to currency risk saft has production sites in 9 countries and sells its products in 95 countries in some countries saft is required to use currencies other than the euro in such cases sales of goods or services are denominated in currencies other than the euro with the us dollar being the main foreign currency used by saft fluctuations in exchange rates may therefore have material future impact on the financial position of saft and on the comparability of financial information between accounting periods this impact may arise in one of two ways risks associated with movements in currency other than the euro in which group company maintains its financial accounts and risks associated with movements in currency other than that in which group company maintains its financial accounts in order to mitigate some or all of the negative effects of exchange rate movements currency hedges were entered into during 2002 and 2003 in the form of forward contracts that hedged the net exposure six months forward following the sale of the saft group by alcatel to the doughty hanson funds the hedging strategies established by alcatel ceased to apply to the group for practical reasons the group did not set up any currency hedging strategies in 2004 however it intends in future to continue with the policy implemented by the alcatel group prior to the sale in addition the nature of safts activities is such that its us dollardenominated debt can be partially serviced out of revenues invoiced in us dollars c concentration of counterparty risk the nature of safts activities is such that trade receivables represent the main source of counterparty risk saft records bad debt provisions based on quarterly assessment of the risk of nonrecovery or when events make the recovery of receivable uncertain saft also reviews the solvency of its customers on regular basis note 21prepayments from suppliers inmillions years ended december

combined financial statements of the operating entities of the saft group for the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 as presented in section 539 of the saft groupe sa information document the combined financial statements have been prepared under the responsibility of the management board of saft groupe sa our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit opinion onthe combined financial statements we conducted our audit in accordance with the professional standards applicable in france subject to the exception mentioned below those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the combined financial statements are free from material misstatement an audit includes examining on test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in these financial statements an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made in preparing these financial statements as well as evaluating their overall presentation we believe that our audit provides reasonable basis for the opinion expressed below we were appointed as auditors of the combined operating entities during the year ended december 31 2004 and consequently were unable either to i attend the physical inventory counts of these entities at december 31 2001 2002 and 2003 or ii for approximately onethird of inventories primarily held in the us entities use alternative procedures to verify physical quantities of those inventories held as of december 31 2001 and 2002 because inventories at the start of the period are factor in determining net income from operations for that period we were unable to determine whether any adjustments were required to net income for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2003 and opening balances of retained earnings for those years in our opinion subject to the impact on net income for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2003 and on opening balances of retained earnings for those years of any adjustments to net income from operations for those years that might have been identified had we been able to verify physical quantities for approximately onethird of inventories primarily held in the us entities at december 31 2001 2002 and 2003 the combined financial statements of the operating entities of the saft group as presented

statements have been prepared on the basis of the combined financial statements and the notes thereto as presented in this information document and should therefore be read in conjunction with the combined financial statements the pro forma financial statements have not been audited by the statutory auditors of saft but have been subject to limited review in accordance with french auditing standards as set out in standard 4102 of the compagnie nationale des commissaires aux comptes 541 introductory comments about the pro forma financial statements the pro forma financial statements have been prepared by making adjustments to the combined financial statements based on the assumptions described in section 542 of this information document these adjustments are intended to reflect the financial position and results of operations of the group that would have been reported if it had existed as separate and autonomous entity during the periods in question on the basis of estimates and assumptions made by group management pro forma financial statements restate historical financial information on the basis that transaction or event occurred on date earlier than that on which it actually occurred or might reasonably be expected to occur however they are not necessarily representative of the financial position or performances that would have been reported if that transaction or event had occurred on date before that on which it actually occurred or might be expected to occur the pro forma financial statements cover the combination of the new group following the acquisition in january 2004 of the operating entities of the saft group by the doughty hanson funds the pro forma financial statements also aim to portray the financial situation after the reorganisation and the refinancing transactions to occur simultaneously with the companys initial public offering the cost of previous financings and non recurring charges borne by the holding companies from the abovementioned acquisition and its financing were therefore excluded from the pro forma income statements but are included in the pro forma balance sheet at december 31 2004 presented in the pro forma financial statements the pro forma financial statements show the impact on the financial statements of the allocation of the acquisition price to the assets and liabilities of the group based on the price paid for the operating entities in january 2004 the effects of the reorganisation as described in section 323 hereof are also included in the pro forma financial statements the pro forma financial statements also take into account the effects of the refinancing of 460 million in debt contracted in euros and us dollars on december 17 2004 to be put in place upon the admission of the companys shares to the eurolist market of euronext paris at current exchange rates the amount of debt to be refinanced was estimated in the pro forma financial statements at 470 million this refinancing will occur by new financing of 3750 million as described in section 543 hereof use of portion of the groups available cash and use of the net cash proceeds from the capital increase to be raised in the offering for purposes of establishing the pro forma financial statements the net proceeds from the above mentioned capital increase are estimated at 80 million this amount may nevertheless vary as function of the final conditions of the offering and the final amount of the fees and commissions paid by the company in connection with the capital increase under this assumption 15 million of the available cash of the group would be used 542 assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial statements the pro forma financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the combined financial statements to which the adjustments described below have been made 111strictlyconfidential 5421 acquisition of the operating entities of the group and reorganisation treatment applied to the acquisition by the doughty hanson funds during january 2004 the alcatel group sold its battery activities to the doughty hanson funds and in the same month the operating entities of the group were transferred to the holding companies the pro forma financial statements reflect the transfer value of the operating entities of the group corresponding to the price paid in january 2004 by the doughty hanson funds enterprise value of 413 million including direct acquisition costs the acquisition price paid by the doughty hanson funds for the operating entities of the group was allocated in part to the assets and liabilities transferred measured at january 14 2004 at fair value based on an independent experts valuation this remeasurement relative to the carrying amounts in the combined financial statements for the year ended december 31 2004 related to intangible assets 201 million primarily consisting of brand names research and development projects and customer lists by product line the impact of the remeasurement of these assets on the amortization charge is 78 million per year property plant and equipment 24 million the estimated useful lives of these assets were also reviewed and the net impact of the remeasurement of the value of property plant and equipment and of adjustments to the estimated useful lives of these assets resulted in reduction of 37 million in the annual depreciation charge inventories 11 million an adjustment that flowed through the income statement in full during the year ended december 31 2004 generating reduction in gross profit equal to the same amount non recurring effect the residual unallocated acquisition value 112 million was treated as goodwill treatment of the reorganisation prior to admission of the companys shares to listing on the eurolist market of euronext paris it is anticipated that all the shares in saft finance sarl will be contributed to saft groupe sa on the terms described in section 323 of this information document this reorganisation will be accounted for in accordance with the terms of the transfer agreement and with regulation 200401 of the comité réglementation comptable issued on may 4 2004 the pro forma financial statements presented below have been prepared in order to provide consolidated information on the financial position and results of operation for the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 of the group as it will be constituted on completion of the reorganisation based on cost of 2040 million for the saft finance sarl shares contributed and financed by the assumption of debt of 591 million comprising 574 million in principal and 17 million in accrued interest as of the completion date of the transfer and capital increase of 1449 million of saft groupe sa the transfer value of 2040 million corresponds to the price of the shares of saft finance sarl contributed to the luxembourgregistered holding companies of the group following the refinancing of the acquisition debt in december 2004 the net assets of saft finance sarl transferred amounted to 110 million the transfer therefore generates under french generally accepted accounting principles further 1930 million of goodwill in addition to the goodwill arising on the acquisition by the doughty hanson funds treatment of goodwill after allocation of the acquisition price as described above and based on the consolidated net assets of the group as measured at december 31 2004 goodwill of 3050 million has been recognized comprising 1120 million on the acquisition by the doughty hanson funds and 1930 million on the transfer as described above this goodwill is amortized over 20 years and generates an annual amortization charge of 152 million 112strictlyconfidential other considerations the accounting adjustments made in connection with the allocation of the acquisition price paid by the doughty hanson funds for the shares of the operating entities of the group have impact on the groups cash flows for the purposes of the pro forma financial statements the adjustments made in each of the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 were identical except for the adjustment to the value of inventories recorded solely in respect of the year ended december 31 2004 5422 debt the acquisition of the saft group by the doughty hanson funds in january 2004 was financed with bank debt of 290 million assumed by saft finance sarl and the other holding companies and by advances from shareholders current accounts in an amount of 1085 million arrangement fees in the amount of 138 million were paid upon the putting in place of the financing and were capitalized the financial charges relating to all of the financing amounted to 312 million for the year ended december 31 2004 these charges were recorded by the companies in their income statement for the period ended december 31 2004 however only the impact of these charges on cash was taken into account in the pro forma financial statements on december 17 2004 the initial debt was prepaid and financing of 460 million was put in place see section 543 hereof new arrangement fees of 98 million were paid in connection with this refinancing and capitalized prepayment fees of 23 million relating to prepayment of the initial debt were also paid and recorded as charge by the holding companies for fiscal year 2004 the arrangement fees in the amount of 138 million capitalized following the financing described in the preceding paragraph by each borrowing company pro rata to the amounts borrowed were fully amortized by the holding companies in their income statements for the year ended december 31 2004 however only the impact on cash of the costs incurred in connection with the refinancing in december 2004 was taken into account in the pro forma financial statements the company expects in connection with its initial public offering to refinance the 460 million in debt contracted on december 17 2004 the means of prepayment of this debt and its financing are described in more detail in section 541 hereof the effect of this new refinancing will be that the arrangement fees of 98 million capitalized in connection with the december 2004 refinancing at the level of the holding companies pro rata to the amounts borrowed will be fully amortized by these companies in their income statements for the year ending december 31 2005 prepayment fees in an estimated amount of 23 million for the prepayment of the debt contracted in december 2004 will be recorded as charge in the income statement of the holding companies for the year ending december 31 2005 these charges relating to fiscal year 2005 are not included in the pro forma financial statements in the pro forma financial statements only the interest generated by the new bank debt of 3750 million was taken into account on the basis of an average annual interest rate of 423 generating an annual interest charge of159 million arrangement fees corresponding to approximately 30 million were also recorded as charge and amortized over fiveyear period corresponding to the duration of these loans for an annual charge of 06 million the total financial charges so determined was recorded in the pro forma financial statements the difference between the effective financial charges paid on december 31 2004 by the holding companies and the pro forma charges recorded for the period then ended as well as the impact on the cash position of the refinancing anticipated to occur upon the initial public offering or 509 million in total appears in the pro forma financial statements under the heading pro forma adjustment and is presented in the pro forma balance sheet as reduction of liabilities for the year ended

financial charges related to financing and refinancing realized in 2004 and recorded by the holding companies in this period but not reflected in the pro forma income and shareholders equity amortization of arrangement fees to be capitalized by the companies in 2005 that are not reflected in the pro forma income and shareholders equity impact taken into account by deducting cash from the pro forma financial statements the impact on the cash position of all the financing and refinancing transactions in 2004 or anticipated in 2005 in the context of the initial public offering were taken into account in the pro forma cash position at december 31 2004 5423 cost of administrative services savings generated on the cost of services provided by alcatel to saft group entities prior to their sale are estimated at 21 million these savings have been included for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2003 but those for 2004 have not been as they represent savings of the new group 5424 income taxes and deferred taxes tax charges and savings associated with the pro forma adjustments described above have been recognized in each of the periods to which they relate the rate applied to adjustments arising from the allocation of the acquisition price to the assets and liabilities acquired is the current tax rate of the company involved the rate applied to all other pro forma adjustments is the estimated average tax rate for the group of 35 the acquisition by the doughty hanson funds has led to the group adopting new tax base determined on the basis of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and of the goodwill generated on the basis of the acquisition price of the groups us entities amortization of this goodwill is taxdeductible in the united states the effects of this new us tax structure have been reflected in the pro forma financial statements the structure of the group put in place at the time of the acquisition resulted in most of the interest on the groups debt being taxdeductible this debt is split between various legal entities of the group in particular in france the united states sweden and the czech republic which in 2004 generated profits against which the interest charge on the debt contracted by each entity was offset however the deductibility of the interest charges and arrangement fees on the debt was capped at debt figure of 300 million 80 of pro forma financial debt corresponding to the level of debt carried by group companies covered by the beneficial treatment available under the group tax election although the group intends to modify the financing structure so that the full amount of interest charges will be deductible the impact of full deductibility has not been reflected in the pro forma financial statements in the year ended december 31 2003 deferred tax assets were recognized in connection with the alcatel group tax election these assets related to past tax losses generated by the us entities and amounted to 82 million 114strictlyconfidential the net deferred tax asset at december 31 2003 was 159 million on the withdrawal of the saft group entities from the alcatel group and the formation of the new group the possibility of using these tax credits was lost resulting in deferred tax loss of 159 million in 2004 in the combined financial statements the gain recognized in 2003 and the loss recognized in 2004 in respect of these deferred tax assets have been eliminated in the pro forma financial statements 5425 other adjustments in 2004 the transactions that led to the

statements of saft groupe sa for the year ending december 31 2005 will be prepared in accordance with international accounting standards and international financial reporting standards collectively ifrs applicable as of december 31 2005 as approved by the european union the first financial statements to be published in accordance with ifrs will be those for the year ending december 31 2005 in order to ensure comparability of data comparative consolidated financial statements will be presented for the year ended december 31 2004 these comparative consolidated financial statements will be prepared in accordance with ifrs except for ias 32 and ias 39 which will be applied with effect from the year ending december 31 2005 in accordance with the transitional provisions of ifrs 1 in view of the publication of these comparative consolidated financial statements for the year ending december 31 2005 and in accordance with the recommendation of the autorité des marchés financiers amf on financial disclosures during the transitional period the saft group has prepared 2004 financial information on the transition to ifrs based on the pro forma financial statements for the year ended december 31 2004 and giving preliminary quantified indication of the expected impact of the transition to ifrs on shareholders equity at january 1 2004 performance for the year ended december 31 2004 and shareholders equity at december 31 2004 the pro forma financial statements were prepared by applying to the combined financial statements the adjustments described in section 542 these adjustments were reviewed for ifrs compliance to determine whether they should be retained under ifrs primarily ifrs 3 the combined financial statements of the group were prepared in accordance with the accounting policies described in note 2 to the combined financial statements in section 539 of this information document the accounting polices were also reviewed for ifrs compliance to identify any restatements required for the purposes of financial statements prepared under ifrs the quantified financial information on the expected impact of the transition to ifrs has been prepared by applying to the 2004 pro forma financial statements those ifrs standards and interpretations that the saft group believes it will be required to apply in preparing its published consolidated financial statements for the year ending december 31 2005 consequently the basis of preparation of the reconciliation statements showing the impact of the transition to ifrs on the 2004 pro forma financial statements as described in section 5531 is as follows ifrs standards and interpretations mandatorily applicable in respect of the year ending december 31 2005 as currently known excluding the impact of ias 32 and ias 39 which will be applicable only from january 1 2005 and the elective treatments that the group will in all probability adopt for the preparation of its first ifrs consolidated financial statements for the year ending december 31 2005 for these reasons it is possible that shareholders equity at january 1 and december 31 2004 as restated under ifrs and as shown in section 555 of this information document may differ from consolidated shareholders equity at january 1 and december 31 2004 under ifrs as actually published for comparative purposes in the financial statements for the year ending december 31 2005 namely as result of the conventions used for the pro forma financial statements see sections 541 and 5422 the arrangement fees relating to the january 2004 and december 2004 financings were not taken into account in the pro forma income statements rather an estimated recurring charge generating difference between the pro forma shareholders net equity at

standards and interpretations applied in the preparation of the initial quantified ifrsinformation 5531 description of the standards applied the group has applied all ifrs principles relating to the recognition and measurement of assets liabilities revenues and expenses except for those relating to ias 32 and ias 39 which will be applied with effect from the year ending december 31 2005 125strictlyconfidential 5532 description of ifrs adjustments actuarial gains andlosses under the accounting principles applied by the group actuarial gains and losses are amortized using the corridor method under ifrs these actuarial gains and losses have been eliminated as result of the accounting treatment applied to the business combination consequently the amortization of actuarial gains and losses recognized under the groups accounting policies in the pro forma financial statements for the year ended december 31 2004 has been eliminated discounting of provisions provisions are recognized where the group has present obligation legal or constructive as result of past event it is probable that an outflow of resources representing economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation under the accounting principles applied by the group longterm provisions are not discounted under ifrs provisions must be discounted if the impact of discounting is material the provision of 49 million as of january 14 2004 recorded by us subsidiary of the group to cover the cost of endoflife recycling of batteries has been discounted at rate of 57 the impact at january 14 2004 is 15 million before deferred taxes the impact on net income for the year ended december 31 2004 is 156000 this results from the effect of discounting the provision over the period in question and from the effect of change in the discount rate 53 at december 31 2004 versus 57 at january 1 2003 the impact of discounting the other provisions recorded by the group is immaterial revenues andconstruction contracts in recognizing revenues and profits on longterm contracts primarily for the construction or design of specific batteries the group applies the percentage of completion method in accordance with the principles described above subject to certain specific criteria such as achievement of contractuallyagreed milestones or the actual costs incurred relative to the estimated total cost of the contract probable losses on completion are recognized immediately in the event of uncertainty regarding customer acceptance or in the case of relatively shortterm contracts revenues are only recognized up to the amount of recoverable costs incurred or of costs required to complete the contract work in process on longterm contracts is recorded at production cost and does not include any administrative or selling expenses partial payments received in respect of longterm contracts are recognized as liability in the balance sheet under prepayments from customers the principles used by the group in accounting for longterm contracts see note 2 to the combined financial statements located in section 539 hereof are very close to those of ias 11 construction contracts however application of the accounting methods stipulated in ias 11 for certain provisions for contracts has resulted in an increase of 301000 in ifrs net income for the year ended december 31 2004 under ias 11 contract penalties must be treated as deduction from revenues and not as cost of the contract an amount of 09 million has been reclassified as deduction from 2004 combined revenues with impact on net income for the year rdcosts on recurring basis in accordance with the accounting principles applied by the group all research and development costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred under ifrs development costs must be capitalized if the criteria for capitalization set out in ias 38 are met research and
