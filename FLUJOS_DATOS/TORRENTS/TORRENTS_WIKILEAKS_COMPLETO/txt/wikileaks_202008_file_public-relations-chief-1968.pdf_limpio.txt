i 1 i j tpublic relations chief t purpose to help ron create oralter the public image of scien tology scientology orgs and scientologists so as to project an image or images desirable in preventing or combating attacks from supp resaives to create press stories which accomplish thispurpose to xpose publicly the attacking enemies ofscientology based on iformation given by intelligence to obtain excellent press cov erage for scientology and derogatory press coverage for enemies of scientology to associate attacking groups activities with rep rehensiblepast groups and to study and use words currently rep rehensible to describe the enemies of scientology and their actions to use any and all means of communication to counterinfluence officials pressurized by suppressives into attacking scientology by supplying them facts and by representing the side of scientology 1 to direct the functions of the three branches of the public re lations bureau 2 to ensure public relations campaigns are properly planned and octain approval to effect same 3 to ensure that all necessary actions in public relations cam paign are carried out 4 to see that the public relations cic board is maintained in present time 5to study and use areas of suppressive violence so as to get two such forces battling each other rather than attacking us example using negro violence in the us so as to attack and counter the supp ressive use of taxsystems in the us for subversive purposes 64 to use press tactics of denial to the benefit of scientology th pres can always get someone to deny something and thereby create press exple suppressives in the area of east grinstead have spread the lie that scientology is buying up and now secretly owns all the property of east grinstead public relations can use this to benefit by offering to purchase several first class hotels in brighton at reasonable yet low enough figure to be refused and thus get press stories stating prominent brighton hotels refused offer of purchase from scientologistsl 7 to create artificial areas of conflict which are reprehensible example scientologists dont take against drugs scientologists are not doing anything damagingpracticesof psychiatry 01 80to create local protest groups around the country so as to get such groups writing in to protest lack of scientology responsibility along such actions as mentioned in number 7 abovenot actually enough action about the 90 to create front groups for our enemies and to get such frqnts to attack scientology so that our legal can then suethem sucessfully example create society of friends to psychiat rists get group together and then influence the group to issue written libel against scientology libel easily proven as such our legal can then sue to handle along pro lines all attacks upon scientology indep endently and separately from actions being undertaken by otherguardian bureaus 2 11 fro ensure datais assembled and issued by any communications means so as to handle possible future or current attacks upon scien tology such communication means include personal interviews letters phone calls press stories radio programmes public relationtypeadvertisements etc 12 to ensure that some campaign is always underway to handle the areas from which we have learned to expect attack governmental tax agencies governmental health agencies and governmental immigrationagencies 13 to keep ethics in on yourself and on your personnel so that admin nd tech will stay in 14 to make things go right on your post 15 to efficiently carry out the purposes and duties of your post 16 to propose long range promotion by mary sue hubbard i f f i i t successfully handlinq tvinterviews when under attack 1 decide on the purpose of your interview which when under attack is to get an attack on your enemies across 2 decide exactly what you intend to say 3 only go on tv with another scientologist do not go on alone 4 do trs before interview together and ask each other sp qnes tions get grooved in on the answers 5 do not believe any sweetness and light or promises of tv interviewers they are out to do you in 6 if one of you cant answer an sp question the other cuts in and picks up the ball giving the first person chance to recover 7 if you dont want to answer uimply q and and introducesome other aspect of scientology tv interviewers have comm cycle and will happily forget the first question and follow your direction 8 ntrovert tv interviewer by asking him direct question he will answer it and then you make whatever statement you wish to 9 do not go into effect cut the comm line chop the nonsense scientologistshave beautifulcomm cycles they must deliberately violate this and simply sweep into the attack dont wait for an sp on tv to finish some long drawn out entheta statement chop it amd introduce somethingelse eg sp iwas done in etc etc scientologist iithatsso sad but i think that you have missed the point of the whole overtmotivator sequence when per does something etc 10 ihen handling tv team who has come down to film in the grounds establish the ground rules very thoroughly first if you canget legal agreement do so if they break your agree mentinany way simply throw them out the word will spread and other tv teams will abide by the rules 11 on taped interviews inerviews which are not live remember that any part can be cut david was very clever in that he started each sentencewith poor mr robinson which gave the tv boys something to cut out and they left the rest in ie you say things that they cant have on then attention goes onto this when editing and they leave the rest in 12 never let the tv team wander about on their own accompany them and watch where the camera is turned if you want to stop them dont hesitate to step in and stop them you can always intimate befoe the interview starts that if they step out of line you will remove the film and send them away this is stated with in tention so that the message is received 13 our interview has been successful if you have achieved your purpo3e and got across what you intended to get across 14 the attack is more important than defending scientology as scieltology needs defence 15 very important datum is toon them give an interviewer work with symbol on front and the table or deskalways carry books with the symbolssmall book like problems of have some where he can see them on written up by david gaiman and jane kember pro ww dguardian ww handlinq the press 1 never employ an outside pro firm matter how tiji yj10w nothing about public relations with regard to scientvloc 2 when you write press statement which you wartthe pcess c publish mix your attack up in such way that the press cannot tac out extracts without destroying the sense of the statement other ise 90 percent of the statement will not be printed 3 have an organization photographer take photos of each reporter fcporters cannot stand any inflow and this puts them at effect 4 have persona grata and persona non gata list prominently displayed on the wall in an office where press are interviewed any reporter who misquotes you asks sp questions or misbehves is wr itten by name and paper he represents on non grall list any re perter who behaves himself goes on the persona grata lt lu rs paper when you want to give press release or goo story et vc oilly contact the good reporters so they get the scoops th others soon learn 5 never be afraid to cave in the anchor points of reporter most reporters are degraded beings dbs work for sps if you are mre suppressive than the newspaper he works for hpwill start werking for you and will print the stories you want printed you can shout makf guilty be very rude be very abusive miss withholds deliber ately refuse to see them keep them waiting for hours refuse them anypreference and the result will be beautiful respect the next day you can be as sweet as pie the unpredictability and motion is overwhelming and unconfrontable 6 do not ever be afraid of the press they have power they thik that they have power this is lie do not validate this lie the truth is that reporter is making living out f writil1g theta supply him with entheta about your enemies he will be hapy to write about anyone so long as it is entheta i i7 if one newspaper is being really suppressive eg daily mail in england truth in australia ring them up reverse the flow ac interview them ask questions such as 1 is it true that your circulation is dropping 2 is it true that you are in the middle of financial crisis and other spquestions you then publish the interviw like this daily blabber deries that its circulation is dropping daily blabber denies it is in financial crisis mr smith stated that he is unaware of the drop in ciculation etc this caves in newspaper anchor points make sure thayou get the name of the person you interview from the newspaper and print his name as having told you 8 if newspaper rings up and states that it has mr jones who has been badly treated by you etc etc if possible have this sps crime to hand and give it to the ewspaper really give it to the pape make sure theyvegot it make sure you can prove it dont give crime that you cant prove this has remarkable effect of stopping paper dead in its tracks 9 when you want press release published release it at 4 oclock intheafternoon so that the next days morning papers print it the evening papers start printing at 10 am if you release your state ment early it goes into evening papers which are not read as idely as daily papers 10 you must maintain comm line with the press or some of the press so that you can get your attack printed you must attack with out cessation and do not defend scientology needs defense your objective isto put our attackers on the defensive 2 11 u your prss corron linestoprintrumours which core1s c1r tackrs start the rumours yourself then 2ss r1em in pees the press dont check facts and will print eg david manufactured the story that 800 scientologists were coming in for our congress tmmqra tion went into total spin looking for 800 sciciltologists every 1t11 line into britain was januned while tourists were searched and scien tologists found this illustrated the futility of baning religious philosophys students every incoming scientologist sot in happily the government and home office looked absolute 0015 start rumour and deny it sper pro hat write up l2 issue ytit on every libelous statement made in paper this caves inanchorpoints and makes them much more c3utious 13 make the opposition goof write to tnem their replies will be stupid because they are connected to sps or are sp and are off target then publish their stupid replies 14 when in doubt attackattackattack never get reasonable or trusting be dangerous unpredictable pleasant emotional sad but always be aware that you intend to create certain effect 15 do nct let anyone who was heavily involved in the melbourne

prss remember the symbols have command vcllu8 re 3 ot vis on guardian pro lines at n vou tollow it you winpons written up b dav gaian ann jane keme pron d3arciln i successful pro actions 27868 ill tell you right from the start the minister made his announcement on friday so friday and saturday the papers we2 f1ll of it and it looked as though theyd wiped us out and the orta out and the daily mail was printing lot of bad gear sc 0n fida took the job pro in the afternoon i came in and thee i8sn t very much one could do except grab the intelligence files i spent friday most of friday night just reading intellignc files and talking to jane we broke up about 4 oclock 5atuday morning and the press were due to arrive saturday mornin 10 hit the sunday papers and saturdays press was very bad so eh bylan as on the pro line at the time and by and he asbringu1 don some public relations guys so they came down they didnl time they finally showed up about 4 oclock saturday ry whic time id said to jane theyre not coming theyve got old feet so we sat down and i wrote an attack it was the first sq 1 ob an attack on robinson from what id learned on the files thsetl pro guys arrived and said theyd prepared statement and tpr statement was exactly the opposite t9 ours it was everythtn you 3houldnt have in statement we sid youd better reatd thl5 and they read it then they took it away and they rewrote it so tha it would get published on the basis that one would publin it it was just so libelous was probably quite good thing it taugl how to tone things down the good thing i learned from that was that if you want them to publish you mix it up to that one can extract from your statement you have to mix the statement up so tl one can extract from it without totally desoying the sense of the thing so about 5 oclock the press were called into the hall and rettie and i went out to meet them our photographer was there and he started taking photographs of the press which quite stunned them little that was quite fun i noticed from that these guy cannot stand an inflow cant take an inflow so then we hd the interview the comment on the statement i and rettie was sulpsed to be handling it but after about three or four minutes i thought id be better than him so i tookit from him what went rigt was that i found i was much quicker than reporters id given them an c altitude which wasnt there what went wrong was i was being care ful of what i was saying i was thinking if i say that hell say that and so on so that wasnt good and the press next day well we had our first duplication of us was in the the national paper not the grinstead observer that was the only paper that did duplicate us deeley from the observer printed us ancreted us accurately come the next morning it was sunday and ifb 24 hours were unto us we came in and the papers were phoning ltduing were going on etc and we found the pro hat was found sheila set to work and started tidying up the back log of things finging thin and again i was reading files getting familiar with intelligence we organized the board cicboard so we could get some protcts going so the next big thing that happened on monday 24 hours had come on and the thing i learned from that was that you can neve trust themnever and angelopope promised that if there was going to be an attackwe would be giien chance to speak last and we would be given the opportunity to give our point of view we had to practice tv trs and predict and prepare we had one good dy and that was not one but two we decided for tv if ycure going to be interviewed have and jane and i agreed tha matter what happened it we couldnt go in together we woulcot go on id already done one television bit in the west country wbich ad gone quite well going down to the west country 16 bec trd all the way by margaret lynch on what i was likely to beafked so i was in good shape when i got there we sat down and prechced what was going to happen theyd produce spls who the sps wold be and so on we did the interview bit backwards and fcr rjs by the time we got to 24 hours we were in good shape as far as the tr of the thing wasconcernedi t r 2 we got there and we were well conned they were absolutely charming ultilwe got on and then he julia pettifer had flag orders policy mission orders stacked up there they brought on old bray the sp and mrs hennslow hidden frqm behind the ur tain but when i dropped the ball jane picked it up and vice versa we operated quite well we came away from there and i had this cognition if its oneone game then we must be better at being oneone than anybody and the other thing i learned was that these guys cannot complete comm cycle so that you can q and any way you like and who can q and better than us and it doesnt matter what you do as long as youre not put at effect so that the thing to do as soon as you feel yourself put into effect is not to be rational or justify anything but attack next morning who should arrive but the bbc news team complete with cameras they were headed by fellow called john bearman i said to tti1 ii i want to try it out ii lets do what they do being 11 and this terribly british iihello my names david do come in this is exactly what they do i said john beard man he said yes iii said im david gaiman pro how do you do do come over jane wants to meet yon in his suede shoes and we brought him up the driveway and then sat him in the chair then i said you right comfortable he said yes i said good you bastard what did you come for to see if were still alive he said hi dont know anything about it you fucking liar i vas thumping the table and shaking my fist in his face and he was sweating cobs i was sort of watching myself and watching him and i thought good lord this cant hurt him and in the end he said nill you let us film i said yes but on one condition one foot ot1tof place and youre off so he brought his camera men down and i sent him out with sheila to film and they went into reception and started filmingthe telex machine so sheila called and i burst in there and said out and right away the cameramanputs the camera on theyvegot the camera running and theyve got the thing im performing so i said you bastards i axpect standard of courtesy and good behaviour that we have come to expect in this place outside youve broken the spirit of your agreement you are not filming the telex machine thats private so hes going i dont know what you mean so i get outside and i start to walk away and theyve still got in carnerdlike their filming walk away so i thought you bastard i can see that on television so i walked back and was talking to sheila and im walking towards the fellow with the camera but talking to sheila to keep in focus hes got to back upso i just kept talking to sheila and walking towards him until he baded into the curb he fellyousee and i said oh im terribly sorry and then we threw them out and they were really relieved to get out the other thing i did was i had our blokes go up with tape recorder and ask them questions ask them if they have sex with their wives what they do anything just ask thm anything this was total cave in so they left and i thought that was pretty successful it was successfulline because it raught them that we had sting in our tail i was going to get respect if nothing else i was going to get respect ful pressmen cause they thought we were finished so we stuck out the persona grata list the persona non grata list and i started utting all the people i hate on the nongrata list this local ellow from the courrier larkin he thought that we didnt know that he was feeding the daily mail giving them information and all thatsoi called him in and i gave him bloody great rucking nd then i thought ill see how far i can go so just see how rude you can get to these guys before theyll react i told larkin that he was barred from here for week i didnt want to talk to him and he put it in the paper so i called him in and said i didn it put an thics order on you that wasnt ethics ordr or anything it was personal youre not barred 3 lom sa int hill i happen to be the press officer and i dont like you thats why youre not allowed here its purely per sonal i think youre turd do you know what turd is turdispiece of sht thats wha t you are little sht fu off ithat was good indicators on him and we started to get better press in the c6urier so i thought this is definitely sucess line i learned to phone press newspapers who entheta an cliberately upset them by shouting and being 11 so there ere two or three guys who were be ing nice ithere w victor chappel from the sun who was giving us fair press one two others but all the others i would really work at caving r their anchor points now look im quite good on the telephone id hang up on them and shout and scream on the telephone ten id be very very nice to the next fellow so they didn1t rsally know if they were coming or going so the daily mail they were really the sps thatid do is instead of waiting for them to phone them and id ask them tf_ings you know one day i got sheila to phone up iines sight wth column that were really having go for it and i said ioan interview get listof questions just ask them the questions like is it true that lord rothermare is newsight h6how much did your newspaper lose in money last year is your readership rising or falling and we published it in the broad sheet which was quite good we got the case of ronald manning do you know he showed up at the daily mail1 alison parkhouse came in and told us what mannings game had been and jane phoned him right back but like it didnt get across it really didnt connect so i let 10 minutes go by and i rang them again their g2me is they ask you to comment they tell you something and ajif youd care to comment so i got through to newsight the reporter and i said mr mann just in case you didn it ge tit do you agree its 10 to 10 he said yes i said well do you aaree on the date1i and i told him the date i didnt have it taped or anything i just wanted to get him to thik it was so i aid right mr mann i want you to know the reason for r1r maning was not allowed on the ship was because hes uilty ofist you know what incest is dont you mr mann f he said ves1i i said thats why his wife ran away from him and i can hve her here within 12 hours and swear an oath in front of the commissioner of oaths that this is true and if you publish i insist you publish the full story would you care to comment he said i cant comment but ill talk to the editor so he got the editor on the phone and the editor saidmr gaiman i dont think i have anything to comment to you so i said thats fine but as i thought you would want the whole story as you have the reputation for reporting accurately and in full and he said mr gaiman your remarks are libels and i said well only if theyre not true sir remember if you publish this story bearing in mind there are young children involved you may not be guilty of libel but youll be guilty of far greater crime before god and before man yes sir before god and before man and he really went quite chunky on this very so i hung up on him and like thatswhat i started using on the local press to anybody who was really after us id sort of say just take look at your responsibility in this matter for the bloodshed that could take place and like that was success line making them aware of the overt its not even the overt they think it is but this overt before god bit is really resimulator so thats really the whole bit on the press apart from the fact that we started getting good press another thing was as soon as wed get press statement from ron wed release it and then i learned if you want to get it published release it about 4 oclock in the afternoon if you release it in the morning the evening papers pick it up 4 which means the dailys wont so you make the press releases after 400 and if youve got good story dont release it until after midday because if its good for the evening papers its good for the dailys right i believe that far more people read the dailys than they read the evenings victor chappel started to come good and give us good consis tent press and the times were quite fair we started making ter minals with some of these guys not from the point of view of trust or anything but to get our own attack home the other thing i learnd you dont care about defending what can they say about us that they havent said already and what worse can they say than has been said the thing to do is get your attack in scient ologiss hardly read the news anyway and it cant restimulate them much im sure it upsets mr robinson to see him called nasty things if were going to feed them stories well have to man ufacture stories so i manufactured the story of the 800 students coming in to the congress once they put the block on the gress it disperses them and it kept us in the newspapers and it made the government look silly you were starting to see editorials like the government looked like they were about to slip on another banana skin while its left to the scientologists to make the running whereas they were catching something like 9 out of 10 incoming scientologists when this story of tpe 800 hit the papers front pages the next day there was immigration stopping every body every incoming passenger for one day was stopped they were interrogated it caused such chaos that by the following day every incoming scientologist got in even with scientologist on their passport they immigrationjust went into apathy about the whole thing only one scientologist was sent back it was two day3 good news for us it also looked very dicy whether wed get i needed an alibi in case the congress was empty there were only 500 people at the congress when it opened well i could say thats 500 and the 800 they didnt let in makes 1300 thats how it started i wanted an alibi for an empty congress thd there was denying i got quite good at denying i denied ron was in the congo then i starteddenying i got good mechanisms and then id sai and another thing theres rumor going around that ron hubbards in england and i want to deny that and then id get the newspaper men to ring up the home office id say hypothetically if hubbard were inwould they let him stay in for the congress and in the end we had this new3 story going that he was in then i wrote to the hover craft people inquired for hovercraft and we got correspon dence going we denied we were buying hovercraft denied all sorts of silly things the thing to do is to start the rumor and then deny it aniaywe turned the daily mail off one good thing one juicy with hold switched tem off the manning with hold the other newspapers actually without legal writing them like 64 ntits our job would have been much harder the game is to re lease the news of win with comment then you get value out of it if you lose its got to be publishedwith comment i didnt realize at the time but the thing to do is get on it and comment right away you get comment tied onto it which helps to get your attack ther we got our eie board out we did several television bits the television film is for the birds because they can chop it up any way they care to if youre going to have television film had two hours of itv interview they threw everything i there trying to break us or get us to back off really nasty uff li1e do you employ private detectives all this crap 5 bits of policy and so on it was mainly on how you deal with sps this was the policy they c0nstantly used he couldt brak us up so when it came on it was only actually 30 seconds two hours hour and half interview was actuallv 30 seconds on the screen so i thought sod this when they did an inter vis for itv at the congress every time i was asked question thdt had to do with kenneth robinson i said poor kenneth rob inson i thought if i hog enough of this interviewtheyre going tohave to cut that out because its just too invalidative theyve got to leave the other stuff in iireally thats the way more or less it worked out if youre going to go on film you say things which they cant have on and thats what their attention will go on when theyre editing the other thing i learned was if you want to make them goof get to corneto you the ministry thats attacking you govern ment thats attacking you or any organization thats attacking you must be in contact with an sp right if theyre in contact with an sp they must be stupid so we just keep writing to the miistry of health and to jeffrey johnson smith and keep writing to callahan and then we keep publishing the replies then there was the very quite fortuious thing neil was asked to leave his school neil my boy the fellow head moster was so stupid i said youve broken my heart etc 1111 give you the chance to do the right thinglet him stay ii so he said well ill think about it iii said think about but write to and let know the twit actually wrote letter whrh we published the next day the same with jane she wrote to the doctor and he wrote back the health ministry the other thing to do is to get letters to cross so you send telegram write letter and the letter comes back in reply to the telegram and you take it that its the reply to the letter another thing ive learned is when the intellectlal writer s come to interview them to write it down to do you in depth the mistake we made is not showing them the subzero awareness scale get them to read and find out where they are because nor of these have worked well weve been done in dpth by three writers the only time its really been worth anrthingwasthe sunday times when they named the names they say how ridiculous the sciento10gistssay lord balnieljeffreyjohnson smith chattaway and so on theyre all in it together iihow silly this is but they name the names these intellectual maga ziresare not worth tosser the people they send down are only awale of their own evaluation and they made their evaluation beforeever they got here i did learn one thing this attackingworks on any of them this woman ann lapping was doing write up for the new society and she got her hands on the original policy onwhat you do to an sp they may be destroyed injured imprisoned etc and like you cant explain that she phones up and she says iinow what about this policy iso i said now look im fed up with you if youll pardon the expression im pissed off with you weve shown you evything and you pick up an 016 outdated policy which was wi th drawn the day it came out and try and make capital out of it i just didnt think you were that low i thought you were trying to do n honest job and she didnt even mention it actually it was replaced by policy of july of this year what we did was we wrote an ed thatwas october 18 we wrote an ed for the 19th sayig this policy was obviously withdrawn and would be reissued in different form later the only policy that applied to an sp was find out who you are and da da weve got 20 copies of that ed weve put them away and locked them in the filing cabinet if that is the evidence that robinson haswell produce the ed 6 we got out the eic board that is very useful because every time wed have moment wed sit down and figure out what wed do niththis one etc the broad sheet was very good line we found that that destimulated and we found that people loved something with the insid dope written on it they were grabbing them off the street the saturday of the fsm rally in the cafe royale in london the press suddenly showed up in force about 20 of them they produced the daily mailwhichwas the last shot this was just be fore the manning thing which was the following monday it was the big thing rons bank account the fact that theyd seen him in bezerte and all this rubbish they put the paper down in frontof and i took it and i went down the article and attacked it i didnt explain single thing and it was from that point that destarted getting good press its not that we get good press its that robinson and crew get bad press they started to get the leader columns would say the absurd cult of scientology the ministers action would seem to be an infringement of personal liberty is this religious persecution it was _from that point that we started to manufacture news i started to realize that you could manufacture news and these guys were so stupid that they would buy it the other thing i learned at the congress was if youre going to manufacture story you have to manfacture it yourself its good putting reporter in it at the congress i tried to put couple of stories together with reporters id say lidoyou want story lets work one out it didnt norkthey were good stories but they cant get them past their editor the moral of the story would seem to be itifyoure going to create news story you have to do it yourself and sell it to them as true at the cafe royale i learned that you cannot keep them out youre beter off to let them in and si alone corral them but let them feel that theyre seeing everything t the congress lelet them in and i learned something else anybody whos in hglbourne during the melbourne inquiry goes in raving psychosis if you mention newspaper so the thing to do is keep nybody from melbourne right away from the press theyre really pts to the whole thing if youre going to let them interview scientologists pick your scientologists and bring them to th press dont let the press go to the scientologists so what we were doing we were bringing them up half dozen at time but we were picking them and we briefed them before they went up all the dangerous press weve had has been from uncontrolled intervieoslike aoukwere giving interviews whicp were absolutely disastrous woman called kathleen jones wanted to go on tele ision and we got that screwed but she gave couple of inter views that were quite dreadful the next stage would be getting the attack home really getting our attack home i find that pro would be job if we had enough intelligence i mean if we had the crimes of mr hordon jeffrey johnson smith and so on if we really had their crime pro wouldnt jve to do anything except say this is the crime of jeffrey smith jnd mr hordon the less intelligence youre gotj the more youve got to work what is not good line isdont encourage scientolo ist to write member of parliament dont encourage them to write to the newspapers and dont give them the bad news the broad sieets as were publishing themj are not putting out the flap heres this misunderstanding theres jam up they think our c n lxeci_1tives get the idea that the broad sheet is advertising the 1 7 uk flal there is nothing about the uk flap real1 in the boac she t except the attack line that is dastimulator ive watched people read that broad sheet and unpts on it the boad sheet was my ida i tho1ghthow do you get what we waht to say published theres wa of getting it published well the way to get it published is to rint 100000 and see that they go into fleet street thats herethepapers are so the broad sheet is very good line actually for the attack and weve actually said some very libelous things interesting thing is weve not yet had one libel wit neve libeled jeffrey johnson smith and so on i reckon they dare lot go to court in case we are daring them to sue us for libe we ue libeld the government of victoria now and yet nobody has issued ri t hic i think is fascinating it would seem that you dont 1aveto be careful i think somewhere in policy rorsays tdont be arefljust get your attacker this is very valuable because theill not react to it wehave not got the situation where they are entrenched theyve aken position that is to say the health ministry and the home ffice and we now have to get them to decamp from that position heyre not willing to give up the art would seem to be that we redict better than they can they are nct thinkinganalytically 7heyre bank which we can restimulateas we wish it would seem hat we have to get from pro point of view the best thing to do ls to take the attack on them seem to some from about 15 different laces to that one would try to tie in n arrival of 1000 scientolo rists ho are coming in to set up new organization in wales theyre all going to be from the commonwealth which is going to be bit of problm to them because they know commonwealth are allowed in at he sletime make contact with all the churches who have stayed ell ot of it up to now and force them to make statement one ayorthe other and they can onlymake it one way on the grounds tha tvieare areligious philosophy at the same time we should go if to i1e health ministry and demand to see robinson and make it lear that were going to go in to see himtipping tv people before go so they are waiting on the steps when we come out hell refuse to see us at the same time distribute the broad sheet we take the broad sheet but the list of every psychiatrist in the country well distribute the broad sheet to them the idea would be to have asma1y attack lines and you can be as imaginativeas you like on the ministries and at the moment we are stayingon one targetwhich iis kenneth robinson and if that doesnt do i we should include icallahan in the attack iivwritten to the prime minister but ive written him an org ltypepetition letter which is petition being on the lines of the org with csw asking him to investigate and right the wrong if he doemt youve got to go higher wi ch is the queen i suppose ii fee the danger would have been to been to disburse the attack write dsperate letters to jeffrey johnson you get terribly desper ate about it write first to jeffrey johnson i must see you i get letter back from his secretary mr johnson is on holiday can you tell what the meeting is about i said my childrens future is threatened my wife is driven to distraction and i find thati am now secondclass citizen for god sake see iithere was reply so i sent them letter li1he situation is deterior atinq fast i must see you1t weve hit the bastard with two libel suits this week hes dead scared to talk to us you know were dangerous all the time he wont see us its bad publicity for him on conducting interviews with the press is not to defend us say on the basis that everything robinson has said about us is true sono youve got nothing to defend if its all true which itisnt 8 letis take look at his action well start the thing from there reporter walks in and i say look its confidence trick its good like youve gotto admit its rich one can accuse us of being poor and like were getting 500 lttters day as res11t of this publicity he says do you think youll sur vive 1 s id well the amazing thing is hes actuilly done us more good then youd ever thought possible getting 1000 letters day i reckon that our membership will be up by 50000 by the end of thyear they buy it they dont check it they print it the other thing ive found is they ever do any homework they just lock t newspaper cuttings if youve had bad press this is why weve had continually bad press they look up the old cuttings tihat rive learned is that you apply the policy never to be put at effect as soon as you feel you are being put at effect then you attack you attack on the basis that the fellow has bank which you can restimulate this applies actually to any interview line vhether its dealing with the government or with the papers the last thing is to take the attack into their ground we take the attack into the ministry ito parliament and this week well visit nespaper offices as well you cant bring them in here to thump the table because they the editors wont come but you can go into there and be thrown out so theres another story not slccessful is employing anybody from the outside not suc cessful is trying to arrange anything with wog even if its wog reporter be willing to take any sort of clobbering whether it be on tv 0r the press in order to get your own attack in what is successful is control the twelve or thirteen reporters who covered the congress loved us we 8cd them viciously any pro activity is better than pro activity beause it gives them the arc break vf not there they can write whatever they want to about whats ln their 0ank success is not being careful of the better the intelligence the better pro can do part of pro is actually is legal because yqu can stage manage things newspapers nevr expect you to deliver all they want is story so you can say were going to the ul1iednations and you dont have to go youd better plan your story for the next three or four days these guys need an angle so you must feed them new ones if you dont give them the angle teyll find one that doesnt necessarily come from you if you provide them with the angle they are so lazy that they will buy he angle you sell them most of them are lazy you can them 11loulke but they dont like to look silly in their own eyes the jroad sheet is success line other big success factor in the pro line is the fact there are three ocrjiis in the guardians officer you need it
