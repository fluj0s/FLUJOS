state legislatures by special group of mbers of congress chosen by lot and by direct popular election late in the c onvention the matter was referred to the committee of eleven on postponed matters

persons prohibited from serving as electors are senators represen tatives and persons holding an office of trust or profit under the united states3 in order to forestall partisan intr igue and manipulation the electors were required to assemble as sepa rate groups in their respectiv states and cast their ballots as separate delegations in their respective states rather than meet as body in single location at least one of the candidates for whom the electors voted was required to be an inhabitant of another state this wa s intended to counter what the framers feared would be provincial

intended to insure that the winning candidate enjoyed broad support while ection by the house was provided as default method in the event of electoral college deadlock finally congress was empowered to set nationwide dates for choice and meeting of electors the original method of electing the pr esident and vice president however proved unworkable under this system each elector cast two votes for two different candidates for the office of president but votes for vice president the candidate who received the most electoral votes was elected provided he received majority of the whole number of electors not ma jority of electoral votes the runnerup was elected vice president this system which was intended to bring the two best qualified candidates to office never anticipated the early growth

original arrangement the only way to make the system work was for all of the partys electors to cast one vote for the recognized presidential candidate while one elector withheld his vote for the

dged vice presidential candidate this let to tie between presid ential candidate thomas jeffe rson and his running mate aaron burr and the election was decided in the house of representatives the constitutional crisis resulting from the election of 1800 led to the 12th amendment which was proposed by congress and speedily ratified by the states as noted later in this report the electoral college today4 notwithstanding the founders efforts the electoral college system almost never functioned as they intended but as with so many constitutional provisions the document prescribed only the systems basic elements leaving ample room for development as the repub lic evolved so did the electoral college system and by the late 19th century the following range of constitutional federal and state legal and political elements of the cont emporary system were in place who are the electors5 the constituti on as noted earlier in this report states what the electors may not be that is it prohibits senators representatives and persons holding an office of trust or profit under the united states from serving in effect this language bars not only mbers of the two houses of congress but any person who is an employee of the unite d states government justices judges and staff of the us courts and the federal judiciary all political employees of the legislative and executive branches

governors and other state and local elected officials party activists local and state celebrities and ordinary citizens for the office of elector while they may be well known persons such as governors

committees by primary election and by the partys presid ential nominee provisions governing new and minor political parties as well as independent candidacies are generally prescribed in state law and are even more widely varied6 how are electoral votes allocated among the states t h constitution gives each state number of electors equal to the combined total of its senate membership two for each state and house of representatives delegation currently ranging from one to 53 depending on population the 23rd amendment provides an additional three electors to the district of columbia the total number of electoral votes per stat based on the most recent 2000 census ranges from three for seven states and the district of columbia to 55 for california the most populous state table 1 in the appendix of this repor t see page 15 provides current electoral vote allocations by state and dc these totals are adjusted following each decennial census in process called reapportionment which reallocates th number of members of the house of representatives to reflect changing rates of population growth or decline among the states thus state may gain or lose ectors following reapportionment as it gains or loses representatives but it always retains its two senatorial electors and at least one more reflecting its house dele gation the current allocation among the states is in effect for the presidential elections of 2004 and 2008 electoral votes are to next be reallocated following the 2010 cen and would be in effect for the 2012 2016 and 2020 elections how are the electors chosen

population culminating in the extension of the franchise to all eligible citizens 18 years of age or older the tradition that the voters choose the presid ential electors thus became permanent feature

and they normally vote to confirm the choice of the citizens who elected them the exception as noted previously would be the infrequent faithless elector the general ticket system has been favored since the 19th century as it tends to magnify the winning candidate s victory margin within states and across the nation and generally guarantees national electoral college majority for the winners it has however been criticized on the grounds that it effectively negates the votes for the runnersup returning to state some critics suggest that it would be more equitable given the state of the

least 270 of the current total of 538 in order to be ected president or vice president in the event of tie or if candidate receives majority then choice of the president and vice president defaults to congress in procedure known as contingent election in contingent election the house of repr esentatives elects the president choosing from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes the senate elects the vice president in continge nt election choosing between the two candidates who received the largest number of electoral votes perhaps the most remarkable feature of contingent election is that each state has the same vote regardless of population in the house each state delegation casts single vote for president while in the vice presidential election each senator casts single vote30 mending the electoral college reform proposals two alternative methods for awarding electoral votes which pass the test of constitutionality have long been available to the states the district and proportional plans they have historically been promoted as avoiding the alleged failings of the general ticket system and according to thei r advocates they have an added virtue in that they would not require constitutional amendment31 third reform option the automatic plan would however require constitutional amendment the district plan the first is the district pl an or system which as noted in the summary of this report has been dopted by maine and nebraska under the district system two electors are chosen on statewide atlarge basis representing the two senatorial electors allotted to each state regardless of population and one is elected in each congressional district32 each voter still casts single vote for president and vice president but the votes are counted twice first on statewide basis with the two atlarge electorcandidates who win the most votes plurality elected bloc and then again in each district where the district electorcandidate winning the most votes in each district again plurality is sufficient is elected httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32611crs11 33 the district plan became operative in maine for the presidential election of 1972 and in nebraska for the election of 1992 34 given that the strict proportiona l plan by providing for fracti ons of electoral votes would almost certainly require us constitutional amendment and since the proposed colorado constitutional amendment proposed rounded pr oportional system the strict proportional plan allocation of electoral votes has not been included in this illustrationthis is how the district system might work in state which is apportioned eight representatives in congress and thus when its two senatorial electors are added has 10member electoral college legation assume that party x receives 51 of the statewide vote and party 49 party xs candidates for the two statewide or senatorial elector offices are thus elected assume also that party x receives plurality or major ity of the popular vote in five of state as congressional districts while party wins three of the districts under th district plan the district electoral votes would be simila rly awarded so that party x would receive seven electoral votes five district electors and the two statewide electors while party would receive the three electors that reflected its congressional district majorities the claimed advantage of the district system is that it is said to more accurately reflect differences in support in various parts of state nd does not necessarily disenfranchise voters who picked the losing ticket for instance state that has one or more large cities and large ru ral and suburban population with differing political preferences and voting patterns mig ht well split its electoral vote under the district system opponents suggest that the district system with its division of electoral votes within states would more frequently lead to deadlocked elections in which candidate receives majority of electoral votes neither maine nor nebraska has split its electoral vote during the time the district system has been in place33 in every presidential election the ove rall winners also gained the most votes in each congressional district the proportional plan the other commonly proposed option is the proportional plan or system which has neve r been adopted by state but was the subject of proposed colorado constitutiona l amendment that was rejected by that states voters in the 2004 general election the proportional plan allocates electors and electoral votes in direct proportion to the number of votes gained by each state unlike the district plan it does not acc ount for geographical voting patterns but allocates electors on purely statewide basi s two variations of the proportional plan exist the strict proportional plan which would allocate electoral votes to thousandths of electoral votes that is to the third decimal point and the rounded proportional plan which woul d use some method of rounding to allocate only whole electoral votes this is how the rounded proportional plan might operate in state with its 10 electoral votes for this cas assume party x receives 60 of the popular vote and party receives 40 when these totals are rounded party x would be awarded six electors and party would gain four34httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32611crs12 proponents of the proportional system argue that this is the fairest plan since it most accurately reflects in its electorelectoral vote allocation the preferences of the voters acting as statewide political community the also note that it would provide recognition for newparty or th irdparty candidates that achieve substantial level of support in state opponents suggest that like the district system the proportional plan would more frequently lead to d eadlocked elections in which candidate receives majority of electoral votes nationwide the automatic plan the automatic plan comes closest to replicating the current winnertakeall or general ticket system by which the winning candidates in state take all the states electors and electoral votes it would accomplish this goal by eliminating the office of presidential elector and award electoral votes directly to candidates who w on the most popular votes in particular state unlike the district system and the rounded propor tional system however the automatic plan would likely require constitutional amendm ent because it would abolish the office of presidential elector supporters claim it preserves what they c onsider to be some of the advantages of the existing system first they assert it would continue to deliver all of states electoral votes to the winning candidates thus contribu ting to decisive results in presidential elections and would also help maintain the nations current ideologically broad and stable twoparty political system opponents claim that it would continue to disenfranchise voters who picked th losing candidates by using the winner takeall device and that in common with other proposed elector college reforms it would not guarantee that the candidate s winning the most popular votes would always be elected reform through state or private alternatives constitutional amendments that would revise electoral college procedures or eliminate the system altogether are routinely introduced in every congress the obstacles faced by would be constitutional amendments are considerable however there has been floor action in congress on any of these proposal s since 1979 and the most recent hearings were held in 1992 in r ecent years measures to change the nations presidential election system are increasingly likely to have originated on the state level or be offered by nongovernmental orga nizations these have included colorado amendment 36 proportiona l plan initiative rejected by the voters of that state in 2004 the california presidential reform act california counts district plan proposal that failed to win ballot access in that state in 2008 and national popular vote nongovernmental public interest campaign to establish an interstate comp act under which participating states would agree to award their elector votes to the nationwide popular vote winner httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32611crs13 35 the only exceptions might occur under variations that call for election by congress in the event of tie or if candidate receives requisite minimum of votes eg 40 36 in this case the peoples choice is defi ned as the candidate or candidates who won majority or plurality of popular votes 37 for more detailed information on reform proposals please consult crs report rl34604 electoral college reform 110th congress proposals the nati onal popular vote campaign and other alternatives by thomas h neale 38 in 1824 the popular and electoral vote was split among four candidates leading to election of the president in the house of representatives where the runnerup in popular and electoral votes was chosen over the pl urality winner in both categories in 1876 1888 and 2000 the candidate receiving majority of electoral votes but fewer popular votes than his main opponent was electedending the electoral college direct popular election by constitutional amendment the most widelyintroduced proposal to reform the electoral college system would actually eliminate the current arrangements and repl ace them with direct popular election of the president and vice pr esident most direct election proposals provide for the election of the joint ticket of candidates for president and vice president who win plurality of the popular vote some versions have called for 40 threshold in order to win with either runoff or election by congress if the necessary percentage is not gained proponents of direct popular election argu that it is simple democratic and foolproof the candidates with the mo st popular votes win under almost all circumstances35 opponents and defenders of the electoral college claim that the existing system is an integral and vital element in the us federal system that it contributes to stable and ideologically diverse two party system and that it has delivered the peoples choice36 in 47 of 51 presidential elections since the 12th amendment came into effect in 1804 what they characterize as an excellent track record37 for further information on mending or ending the electoral college please consult crs report rl34604 electoral college reform 110th congress proposals the national popular vote campaign and other alternatives by thomas h neale concluding observations the electoral college system has demonstrated both durability and adaptability during more than two centuries of government under the us constitution although its structural elements remain largely unchanged in operation it has never worked in quite the way the founders antic ipated and has evolve d into patchwork assemblage of constitutional provisions state laws political party practices and enduring traditions the electoral college system has always had flaws and critics and it has been the subject of controversy in four elections38 but as noted earlier it has delivered president and vice presid ent who won both the popular and electoralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32611crs14 vote in 47 of 51 elections since the 12th amendment took effect given the high hurdles faced by proposed constitutional amendments it seems likely to remain in place unless or until its alleged failings beco so compelling that large concurrent majorities in the public congre ss and the states are prep ared to undertake its reform or abolition group of potential alternatives to cons titutional change has emerged in recent years however and it is arguable that these state and grass roots movements may have greater chances for success than constitutional amendment as noted earlier in this report colorados amendment 36 in itiative was rejected at the polls in 2004 and the politically controve rsial california counts initiative proposal failed to attain ballot access in the latte r state in 2008 it is arguable however that the interest generated by colorado ame ndment 36 and california count s may stimulate further experimentation in alternative electoral college plans in which the states might serve in their classic role as laboratories for national policy moreover the most notably successful electoral college re form effort in recent decad has been nonfederal and at least in its origins nongovernmental the national popular vote campaign cited earlier in this report has enjoyed modest degree of success having been approved in four states with total of 50 electoral vot it has also been passed by one or both legislative chambers but not gained final pproval in seven add itional states with total of 103 electoral votes here again however the ultimate fate of the electoral college system arguably rests on the results it produces in modern times the college is expected to ratify the public choice by delivering the presidency to the candidates who have gained the most popular votes if the electoral college system meets expectations these proposals and others lik them may languish if it does not they or others may attract sufficient popular and political support to become viable alternativeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32611crs15 appendix electoral vote allocation by jurisdiction table 1 electoral vote allocation by jurisdiction 20042008 state electors
