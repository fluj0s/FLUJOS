appropriations for fy2000 military construction summary the military construction milcon appropriations bill finances 1 military construction projects in the united states and overseas 2 military family housing operations and construction 3 us contributions to the nato security investment program and 4 most base realignment and closure costs this paper reviews the appropriations and authorization process for military construction the congressional debate perennially centers on the adequacy of the presidents budget for military construction needs and the necessity for congressional addons especially for guard and reserve projects in recent years congress has pointed out that the pentagon has not funded nor planned adequately for military construction the administration has asked the congress to approve an unusual funding mechanism for the fy2000 military construction program in order to fit its defense budget request within the caps set on total discretionary spending in the budget enforcement act of 1997 for fy2000 the administration has requested budget authority of 54 billion which is only part of the funding necessary to carry out the proposed projects the rest of the fy2000 military construction program would be funded by advance appropriations of 31 billion in fy2001 in this advance appropriations proposal congress would approve the 31 billion now for the fy2000 program which would be spent and scored in fy2001 adding the split fy2000 request with the advance appropriations request brings the total value of the proposed fy2000 military construction program to 85 billion this total continues downward trend from the fy1996 level of 112 billion the fy1997 level of 98 billion the fy1998 level of 93 billion and the fy1999

dedicated infrastructure covering over 40000 square miles of land and physical plant worth over 500 billion the military construction appropriations bill provides large part of the funding to maintain this infrastructure the bill funds construction projects and real property maintenance of the active army navy marine corps air force and their reserve components defensewide construction us contributions to the nato security investment program formerly called the nato infrastructure program and military family housing operations and construction the bill also provides funding for the base realignment and closure brac account which finances most base realignment and closure costs including construction of new facilities for transferred personnel and functions and environmental cleanup at closing sites the military construction appropriations bill is only one of several annual pieces of legislation that provide funding for national defense other major legislation includes 1 the defense appropriations bill that provides funds for all military activities of the department of defense except for military construction 2 the national defense authorization bill that authorizes appropriations for national defense1 and 3 the energy and water development appropriations bill that provides funding for atomic energy defense activities of the department of energy two other appropriations bills vahudindependent agencies and commercejusticestate 1 see appropriations for fy2000 defense by stephen daggett crs report rl30205 for details on the defense authorization and appropriation process crs2 also include small amounts for national defense in addition the energy and water development appropriations bill provides funds for civil projects carried out by the us army corps of engineers the annual defense authorization bill authorizes all the activities in the defense appropriation measures described above therefore major debates over defense policy and funding issues including military construction can be also found in the authorization bill since issues in the defense authorization and appropriations bills intertwine this report highlights salient parts of the authorization bill along with the military construction appropriation process the separate military construction appropriations bill dates to the late 1950s when large defense buildup occurred in response to intercontinental ballistic missile threats and the soviet launch of sputnik defense construction spending soared as facilities were hardened missile silos were constructed and other infrastructure was built the appropriations committees established military construction subcommittees to deal with this new level of activity consequently the separate military construction bill was created the first standalone military construction bill was in fy1959 pl 85852 previously military construction funding was provided through annual defense appropriations or supplemental appropriations bills military construction appropriations are the major but not the sole source of funds for facility investments by the military services and defense agencies the defense appropriations bill provides some funds for real property maintenance in operation and maintenance accounts in addition funds for construction and maintenance of morale welfare and recreationrelated facilities are partially provided through proceeds of commissaries recreation user fees and other income most funds appropriated by congress each year must be obligated in that fiscal year military construction appropriations are an exception since these funds are made available for obligation for five fiscal years consideration of the military construction budget starts when the presidents budget is delivered to the congress in february for fy2000 the president requested 54 billion in funding for the military construction program and advance appropriations2 request of 31 billion to be scored in fy2001 2 from congressional quarterlys glossary of congressional terms an advance appropriation is defined as in an appropriation act for particular fiscal year an appropriation that does not become available for spending or obligation until subsequent fiscal year the amount of the advance appropriation is counted as part of the budget for the fiscal year in which it becomes available

housing improvement fund based on adjusted estimates of number of housing privatization projects the sac report also highlighted the committees concern over the pentagons acquisition and planning for forward operating locations for drug interdiction and counterdrug activities the proposal was to construct three bases in costa rica ecuador and curacao using funds from the drug interdiction and counterdrug activities defense appropriations the sac believes that it is premature to appropriate funds for these bases until congress has been provided longrange crs4 master plan for each location the committee directed the pentagon to submit future requests for specific military construction projects in support of drug interdiction and counterdrug activities as part of the budget request for military construction therefore the committee only recommended 50 million of planning and design funds instead of the 428 million that the pentagon requested house action on july 2 1999 the house

entire 85 billion request and added 100 million the hasc added nearly 11 billion to the presidents military housing request for military family housing which the committee sees as priority on june 10 1999 the house passed its version hr 1401 on vote of 365 58 on july 1 the house armed services subcommittee on installations and facilities had hearing on economic development conveyances the hearing was based on pentagon proposal to amend the statutory framework governing the economic development conveyance process for real property affected by the base realignment and closure brac process the proposal would give nocost conveyances to local authorities to spur job creation and facility reuse one downside is that the pentagon will recoup less money from the brac process and this could lead to the need for direct appropriations to help transition the nocost conveyance properties the senate went ahead and added the pentagons proposal in its version of the defense authorization bill the conference report of the defense authorization bill was completed on august 5 1999 crs5 key policy issues ongoing congressional concerns split funding and advance appropriations proposal for the fy2000 military construction budget request3 the defense departments fy2000 military construction budget plan includes 85 billion worth of projects but the administration is requesting only 54 billion in appropriations the remaining 31 billion is requested as advance appropriations to be scored as new budget authority in fy2001 this 31 billion is money that normally would not be necessary for the approved projects until after the initial year of availability typically military construction funds are available for obligation for five years and only part of the money is obligated in the initial year of availability the defense departments normal practice known as the full funding policy4 has been to request all of the funding needed for each military construction project in single annual appropriation though some projects have occasionally been funded incrementally the request to provide split funding for fy2000 projects is not change in policy but onetime exercise done only because of budget rules the intent is to reduce requested budget authority in fy2000 when caps on discretionary funding will remain in place and restore the funding in fy2001 when presumably the caps will be adjusted upward the administration took this unusual step to help the dod fund 126 billion in additions to the fy2000 budget compared to last years plan for fy2000 the 126 billion in added defense programs for readiness and modernization lead to an increase of only 41 billion in the defense budget topline the remaining 85 billion in added programs is offset by 1 38 billion in inflation and fuel price savings 2 16 billion in proposed rescissions of prior year funds and 3 31 billion from fy2000 military construction programs split funding proposal some observers believe that the house and senate will look for alternatives to the administrations proposal in order to fully fund the fy2000 military construction program because advance appropriations commits future funding it also limits congressional discretion on those budget items in the future in the fy1999 military construction budget debate the defense appropriations and authorization committees rejected an army proposal for advance appropriations to fund several large military construction projects during the hearings on the fy2000 military construction plan members of the house armed services committee and the senate appropriations committee sac 3 for information about how the administrations fy2000 defense budget increases are financed within budget caps created by budget enforcement act of 1997 see crs report rl30205 appropriations for fy2000 defense by stephen daggett 4 dods official full funding policy however technically applies only to procurement accounts see department of defense comptroller financial management regulations volume 2a budget formulation and presentation june 1993 p 118 crs6 expressed skepticism that this will be only time they will be asked to defer funding for the military construction program on march 23 senator burns chairman of the sac subcommittee on military construction stated that fiscal challenges that led to the fy2000 military construction proposal will be present in years to come he stated that this shortterm fix could cost the american taxpayer more money as contractors may assume more risk associated with building military facilities for dod potentially increasing construction costs over the longer term although the dod states that the advance procurement is onetime budget fix the committees are wary that partial funding could become regular pattern in future military construction budgets partial funding the committees fear could compound what they see as the problem of chronic underfunding of the military construction program longterm planning for military construction throughout the 1990s the congress and administration have debated about whether military construction funding and longterm planning are adequate members of congress have complained that poor planning and insufficient funding on the pentagons part has made it difficult for the congress to insure that added military construction projects meet pressing priorities the department of defense uses formal process called the planning programming and budgeting system ppbs to create its budget for congress5 the ppbs process is also used to prepare dods internal longterm financial plan the longterm plan extends over sixyear period and is known as the future years defense plan fydp in the 1990s congress has criticized the pentagons longterm planning for military construction in hearings on the fy2000 military construction request legislators expressed continuing concern over military construction planning and the sufficiency of funding rep joel hefley chair of the military installations and facilities subcommittee of the house armed services committee argued at hearing on march 16 1999 that the fy2000 budget request like the previous fy199799 requests continues the poor planning and downward trend for military construction budgets for the fy1997 2000 military construction requests the administration requested fewer funds than it had programmed in its budget assumptions in the previous years fydp this mismatch between plans and funding was cited in the congressional criticism of the pentagons military construction planning since fydp and requested amount decreases each year for military construction mr hefley states that he is finding it difficult to take pentagon future plans for military construction seriously that sentiment was echoed by the senate appropriations military construction subcommittee chair sen conrad burns who expressed dismay at the lack of longterm planning seen in the fy2000 military construction proposal implementation of the privatization of military family housing initiative in testimony to the house armed services committee on march 9 1999 randall 5 for discussion of the formulation of the defense budget proposal by the dod see crs report rl30002 defense budget primer by mary t tyszkiewicz and stephen daggett crs7 yim acting deputy under secretary of defense installations described the continuing problem of military family housing he stated that approximately twothirds of dods nearly 300000 family housing units need extensive renovation or replacement yim also testified that fixing this problem using only traditional military construction methods would take 30 years and cost as much as 16 billion recognizing the severity of this problem four years ago congress passed the military housing privatization initiative in the fy1996 defense authorization act pl 104106 this gave the pentagon new authorities to obtain private sector financing and expertise for military housing the authorities are guarantees both loan and rental conveyance or lease of existing property and facilities differential lease payments investments both limited partnerships and stockbond ownership and direct loans the legislation enables the new authorities to be used individually or in combination6 the department of defenses housing revitalization support office hrso is coordinating the implementation of the new authorities for each of the services7 hrso is staffed with 16 fulltime housing and real estate experts from each of the services and the office of secretary of defense along with consultant support the pentagon estimates that with these authorities defense dollars can be leveraged to build three times the amount of housing units financed the traditional way new policies and procedures in the services and dod were needed to implement the privatization initiative new mindset of how to work with commercial realestate practices and practitioners had to be formed for example office of management and budget had to determine rules approved in june 1997 to account for government obligations with each of the authorities also the pentagon needed to develop loan and loan guarantee concepts into actual documents that the private financial community would trust for investment grade financing which took some time progress with the privatization initiative has been slow rep joel hefley chair of the military installations and facilities subcommittee of the house armed services committee stated in march 9 1999 hearing that the congress has been disappointed in the pace of privatization implementation especially as the expiration date of february 10 2001 for the fiveyear test period of these authorities approaches the general accounting office gao highlighted some concerns with the privatization initiative when it reviewed dods military housing situation in july 6 for more detailed information on the authorities see the dods privatization of military housing website httpwwwacqosdmiliaihrsowelcomehtm 7 each service has its own program name for housing privatization army residential communities initiative formerly known as the capital venture initiative cvi navy publicprivate venture ppv and air force housing privatization program crs8 19988 initial evaluation of lifecycle costs of privatized housing versus traditional military housing showed potential savings of only about 10 or less the proposed longterm time horizons for some privatization projects of 50 years or more brought up concerns that the housing might be not needed in the that far into future also the gao pointed out the continuing weakness in the pentagon planning for military housing gao stated that housing requirements are not integrated with particular facilities and community needs that the plans underutilize the use of local housing and that there is poor communication between offices responsible for housing allowances and military housing construction gao recommended that comprehensive better integrated plans could help maximize the privatization initiative while minimizing total housing costs rep hefley also raised serious policy issue in the pentagons current approach to the implementation of its military family housing privatization program he expressed concern that the military departments particularly in the army and the navy were placing virtually all of their hopes for improving military family housing on privatization without being certain that it would work in all locations rep hefley pointed out that privatization was only one tool along with regular military construction funds which could ameliorate family housing problems history and context the funding pattern for military construction budgets in recent years the congress has added significant amounts to annual administration military construction budget requests this has been recurring pattern in the 1990s the president proposes what the congress calls an inadequate military construction budget especially for guard and reserve needs the congress then adds funding for military construction with some attention to guard and reserve projects for example congress added 479 million in fy1996 850 million in fy1997 800 million in fy1998 and 875 million in fy1999 to the military construction accounts congressional additions to the military construction budget have been common and controversial throughout the 1990s three themes explain the pattern of recurring congressional additions first some members of the military construction subcommittees have believed that military construction has been chronically underfunded this theme was echoed in recent hearings on the fy2000 budget and the fy1999 and fy1998 reports from the house appropriations committee and the defense authorizing committees second often congress has different priorities than the administration as reflected in frequent congressional cuts to overseas construction requests and contributions to the nato security investment program third other members of congress as senator bond commented during the floor debate on fy1996 military construction appropriations believe that the pentagon counts on congress to add money to guard and reserve programs in recent years congress has added large amounts for national guard and reserve construction projects including peak amount of 4018 million in fy1995 see table 4 8 us general accounting office military housing privatization off to slow start and continued management attention needed gao report number nsiad98178 july 1998 crs9 debate over congressional additions to the military construction budget involves several overlapping issues military construction proponents including facility advocates in the military services argue that military facilities have been systematically underfunded for many years even some say in the midst of the buildup of the early to mid1980s this line of argument was prominent during house appropriations committee markup of the fy1996 military construction bill some complained that the funding level was up 28 from the prior year while others defended the increase as necessary to make up for previous shortfalls in funding for new construction and maintenance the fy1996 enacted amount for military construction peaked that year at 112 billion the house report on the fy1997 bill hrept 104591 cited dod backlog of deferred maintenance and repair for family housing alone that totaled over 45 billion dollars dod facility managers have not met their goal to allocate 3 of the plant replacement value of dod facilities for annual construction and maintenance called real property maintenance at the pentagon although this 3 goal is below the average for public facilities nationwide actual dod funding has typically run at 1 to 2 of plant replacement value for example the air force testified on march 16 1999 to the house armed services subcommittee for military installations and facilities that the air force could budget only 1 for real property maintenance this is why facility proponents welcome any congressional additions finally congressional military construction subcommittees authorization as well as appropriations subcommittees have frequently taken issue with administration military construction priorities in the early 1990s for example the committees frequently reduced amounts requested for construction overseas on the grounds that troop levels abroad should be reduced and that allied burdensharing contributions should increase and reallocated the funds to domestic projects in addition congressional committees have added unrequested funds for quality of life improvements such as day care centers and barracks renovation the congress has argued that the military services have tended to neglect these areas in favor of warfighting investments the debate over added projects since the congress has added significant amounts to military construction budgets over the last 10 years congressional debate has centered on how to prioritize worthy additional projects in 1994 the senate debate on the military construction appropriations bill focused the amount of congressional additions to the request despite constraints on overall defense spending senator mccain in particular objected to the provision of substantial amounts for projects that the administration had not requested he argued that such projects largely represented pork barrel spending and came at the expense of higher priority defense programs in senate floor consideration of the military construction bill that year the managers accepted mccain amendment that called for criteria to be applied to additional projects his amendment included provision that any added project should be on the military lists of critical yet unbudgeted projects the mccain amendment was not incorporated into the final conference version of the bill however and the conference agreement provided over 900 million for unrequested construction projects crs10 the national defense authorization act for fy1995 pl 103337 however incorporated senator mccains criteria as sense of the senate provision9 providing that the unrequested projects should be 1 essential to the dods national security mission 2 not inconsistent with the base realignment and closure act 3 in the services future years defense plan see above 4 executable in the year they are authorized and appropriated and 5 offset by reductions in other defense accounts through advice from the secretary of defense since the 104th congress the house military construction authorizing and appropriations committees have also used similar criteria in collaboration with the pentagon to add projects to the military construction budget each potential project needs to pass the following criteria similar to the mccain criteria is the project essential to the dod mission consistent with brac plans in the future years defense plan and executable in the coming fiscal year if the project can meet those criteria the military construction authorizing and appropriations committees may add the project debate over congressionallyadded projects continues in debate on the fy1999 military construction appropriations conference report senator mccain continued to discuss projects added by congress he noted that the congress added 148 domestic projects in all at cost of nearly 977 million senator mccain presented his list of questionable projects in the congressional record in letter to the president and on his web page httpwwwsenategovmccainmilcnf99htm major funding trends the administration has proposed to split funding for fy2000 military construction projects between the fy2000 and the fy2001 budgets the budget request for fy2000 is 54 billion with an additional 31 billion in an advance appropriations for future costs in fy2001 adding the fy2000 request with the advance appropriations request brings the total value of the proposed fy2000 military construction program to 85 billion this total continues downward trend from the fy1996 level of 112 billion the fy1997 level of 98 billion the fy1998 level of 93 billion and the fy1999 level of 87 billion the fy2000 conference report recommends 84 billion table 2 shows overall military construction program funding since fy1996 table 3 breaks down the fy2000 request and fy2000 program value by appropriations account and compares it to fy1998 and fy1999 levels table 4 9 sense of the senate provision is provision that requires approval by the senate but is not formally part of the bill and therefore does not have the force of law this type of provision expresses the sense of the senate on policy issues there can also be similar sense of the house and sense of the congress provisions crs11 shows congressional military construction addons for guard and reserve projects from fy19851999
