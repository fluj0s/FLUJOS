becoming prime minister in 1991 oddsson chose jonssonthen one of icelands few security policy experts at the countrys sole think tankto be his foreign policy adviser jonsson held this position until 2004 when he was promoted to ambassador and special adviser to the ministry of foreign affairs and external trade mfa after oddsson became its minister there jonsson remained as one of oddssons closest allies and according to dipl omatic reporting almost his only foreign policy adviser in 2005 jonsson became icelands lead negotiator in talks with the united states about the fate of the us naval air station at keflavik naskef us diplomats note it is testament to jonssons talentsand oddssons continued influencethat the former retained his mfa positions under two subsequent foreign ministers after oddsson left the government in 2005 jonssons appointment as ambassador in washington reflects the high regard he enjoys in reykjavik but also clears the way for new foreign policy

leader ingibjorg solrun gisladottir to take the foreign affairs and external trade portfolio the shift of power to the sda may reduce jonssons standing in reykjavik somewhat as ambassador to the

security relations since the closure of naskef in september 2006a move he adamantly opposed cnf jonsson and the base u jonsson student of security policy and us icelandic relations after world war ii is by all accounts champion of close bilateral cooperation us diplomats credit him with shaping and reinforcing oddssons strong support for an american presence at naskef even in the face of domestic opposition for several years jonsson translated this backing into strict interpretation of the 1951 usiceland defense agreement arguing with us officials that i celandic security could only be guaranteed by the constant presence of us troops and aircraft at naskef since the closure of the base jonsson has sought opportunities to develop air defense cooperation between iceland and both the

confrontations from 1958 to 1976 about rights to fishing grounds in which iceland eventually prevailed the same diplomat speculated that jonsson applied similar strategy of stubbornness to security discussions with the united states stance that led to oddssons declarations in 2001 that iceland would discontinue defense cooperation with the united states altogether if it removed its four iceland

businesslike and constructive attitude during base negotiations in the summer of 2006 however us diplomats say that in his eyes the united states failed to live up to its side of the 1951 defense agreement cnf sensitive to how issues play out in domestic politics jonsson can be prickly when according to diplomatic reporting he perceives that iceland is not being treated as an equal partner or when core national interests are at stake for instance he protested privately when explanations of alleged use of icelandic airspace by ciaoperated planes were three weeks late in arriving and in his view inadequate but he worked with us diplomats to downplay the issue publicly in everyday dealings us officials have found jonsson charming and courteous to officers of all ranks in 2002 these officials noted he often received visitors with his sleeves rolled up and cigarette in his mouth cnf flexible on the eu and whaling cnf jonsson appears to share the reservations that oddsson and his independence party colleagues express toward icelands potential membership in the eu concerns about ceding control of the countrys critical fish ing industry and other economic levers to brussels make jonsson wary of membership us diplomats say however he is careful in policy statements not to rule out membership as an option for the future he has advocated close icelandic s ecurity coordination with the eu early in his policymaking career he pushed for reykjavik to join the western european union as an associate member and for icelandic participation in the european economic area of free trade with the eu according to diplomatic reporting jonsson like most icelanders is in favor of whaling according to diplomatic reporting but he has advocated that iceland pursue the practice only

had served as acting foreign minister since the onset of gisladottirs illness in september 2008 he became minister of industry energy and tourism in may 2007 when his sda formed government with the centerright independence party ip public outcry about icelands economic collapse led to the resignation of that coaliti on in january 2009 but he retained the portfolio when the sda formed minority government with the antibusiness left green movement lgm which will rule until new election is held on 25 april 2009 cnf as minster of industry energy and tourism skarphedinsson has actively sought international partners in geothermal energy development traveling widely to foster cooperation with the collapse of icelands oncesizeable banking sector in october 2008 investment in other industries will be key to the countrys recovery skarphedinssons foreign policy challenges include repairing ties to britain which soured in late 2008 after london used antiterrorism legislation to freeze the assets of an icelandic bank to protect british depositors the minister worked to cancel planned british mission to patrol icelandic airspace in december saying it would be blow to icelandic pride given londons recent actions according to the icelandic press he must also keep up icelands diplomatic and defense capabilities in the face of large budget cuts cnf dealing with skarphedinsson cnf review of reporting suggests that skarphedinsson is informal in meetings and that he likes to put an idea forward and gather information and feedback from others before making decision us diplomats said in 1993 that he did not take himself too seriously and that he liked to present himself as an academic who had drifted into politics cnf skarphedinsson is fond of the united states and has been close us embassy contact for many years according to review of diplomatic reporting nevertheless he frequently takes dramatic foreign policy stances some of which conflict with us policy for example he vigorously opposed icelands support for the invasion of iraq in 2003 and coarsely criticized washington for not stepping in to loan reykjavik money during the global economic crisis in late 2008 in january 2009 skarphedinsson refused to meet with israels minister of education yael tamir who was traveling in europe to explain tel avivs view of the conflict with gaza skarphedinsson has however

the icelandic defense agency ida which was set up in april 2008 and is responsible for operating icelands airspace radar maintaining the former us naval base at keflavik and gathering intelligence and

expenditures skarphedinsson has held fast to icelands nonmilitary tradition and warmly welcomed changes to reykjaviks peacekeeping strategy that would focus it on civilian tasks cnf looking to europe u skarphedinsson has argued for closer icelandic integration in european institutions since at least the mid1990s he was instrumental in making support for icelandic eu membership cornerstone of sda electoral platforms in 2003 and 2007 skarphedinsson argues that iceland is not well served by merely remaining member of the european economic area eeawhich assures reykjavik access to european marketsbut should also have access to and influence in the many other new areas of european cooperation such as defense since at least 2002 he has advocated increased international cooperation against transnational threats such as terrorism arguing that the eea treaty should be expanded to include defense cooperation skarphedinsson also notes that reykjavik lacks representation in the increasingly influential european parliament and lacks access to the stabilizing monetary policy afforded by the euro currency his arguments have become more popular with the icelandic public since the economic collapse published polls show but skarphedinsson will be unable to press forward with eu membership until after the next election because the lgm views the issue much more skeptically cnf fishing for votes u skarphedinsson holds phd in ichthyology fish breeding but appears to have spent most of his career in politics in the mid1980s he was member of the leftist peoples alliance pa party and an influential editor of its newspaper who opposed the us presence on the keflavik base and urged labor unions not to compromise during collective bargaining perhaps as result of his familys conservative political views us diplomats posit skarphedinssons politics shifted to the right and he left the pa paper in 1987 by 1991 he had won seat in the althing aligned himself with the pronato probusiness wing of the social democratic party sdp headed by then party chair jon baldvin hannibalsson and was serving as the chair of the sdps parliamentary group at the time us diplomats attributed to his remarkable achievements to his personal charm skill and pivotal position in the political spectrum skarphedinsson served as minister of the environment in the ipsdp government during 199395 and edited two party newspapers from 1996 to 1998 cnf skarphedinssons political skill was also evident in 2000 when he united several small parties on the political left into the sda under his leadership the party voted in 2005 to install gisladottir as chair in the hopes that her greater public appeal would bring more electoral success although the sda won fewer seats in 2007 than in 2003 it was able to form government with the ip skarphedinsson appears to work well with gisladottir his sisterinlaw their spouses are siblings but press reports allude to lingering tensions between their respective party wings cnf personal background u skarphedinsson was born on 19 june 1953 in reykjavik his father was an agronomist and the younger skarphedinsson received bachelors degree in biology 1979 from
