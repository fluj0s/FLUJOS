the legislative process government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360filibusters and cloture in the senate summary the filibuster is widely viewed as one of the senates most characteristic procedural features filibustering includes any use of dilatory or obstructive tactics to block measure by preventing it from coming to vote the possibility of filibusters exists because senate rule s place few limits on senators rights and opportunities in the legislative process in particular senator who seeks recogn ition usually has right to the floor if other senator is speaking and then may speak for as long as he or she wishes also there is motion by which simple majority of the senate can stop debate and allow the senate to vote in favor of an amendment bill or resolution or any other debatable question almost every b ill actually is subject to two potential filibusters before the senate votes on whether to pass it first filibuster on motion to proceed to the bills consideration nd second after the senate agrees to this motion filibuster on the bill itself senate rule xxii however known as th cloture rule enables senators to end filibuster on any debatable matter the senate is considering sixteen senators initiate this process by presenting motion to end the debate the senate does not vote on this cloture motion until the second day after the motion is made then it usually requires the votes of at least three fifths of all senato rs normally 60 votes to invoke cloture invoking cloture on proposal to amend the senates standing rules requires the support of twothirds of the sena tors present and voting the primary effect of invoking clotur on question is to impose maximum of 30 additional hours for considering th at question this 30hour period for consideration encompasses all time consumed by roll call votes quorum calls and other actions as well as the time used fo r debate during this 30hour period each senator may speak for more than one hour apiece although several senators can have additiona l time yielded to them under cloture the only amendments that senators can offer are amendments that are germane and that were submitted in writing before the cloture vote took place the presiding officer also enjoys certain additional powers under cloture for exampl to count to determine whether quorum is present and to rule amendments motions and other actions out of order on the grounds that they are dilatory the ability of senators to engage in filibusters has pr ofound and pervasive effect on how the senate conducts its bus iness on the floor in the face of threatened filibuster for example the majority leader may decide not to call bill up for floor consideration or to defer calling it up if there are other equally important bills that the senate can consider and pass without undue delay similarly the prospect of filibuster can persuade bills proponents to accept changes in the bill that they do not support but that are n ecessary to prevent an actual filibuster for further information on filibuste rs and cloture see crs report rl30850 minority rights and senate procedures and crs report rl32878 cloture

parliamentarian rev and ed by alan s frumin washington gpo 1992 pp 282filibusters and cloture in the senate the filibuster is widely viewed as one of the senates most distinctive procedural features today the term is mo st often used to refer to senators holding the floor in extended debate more gene rally however filibustering includes any tactics aimed at blocking measure by preventing it from coming to vote as consequence the senate has speci fic rules for filibus tering instead possibilities for filibustering exist because senate rules deliberately lack provisions that would place specific limits on senato rs rights and opportunities in the legislative process in particular those rules establish generally applicable limits on the length of debate nor any motions by which majority could vote to bring debate to an end the only senate rule that permits the body by vote to bring consideration of matter to an end is paragraph 2 of rule xxii known as the cloture rule invoking cloture requires supermajority vot usually 60 out of 100 senators and does not terminate consideration but onl imposes time limit it also imposes restrictions on certain other potentially dilatory procedures in recent years as result cloture has increasingly been used to overcome filibuste rs being conducted not only by debate but through vari ous other delaying tactics this report discusses major as pects of senate procedure related to filibusters and cloture the two however are not always as closely linked in practice as they are in popular conception even when opponents of measure resort to extended debate or other tactics of delay supporters may not decide to seek cloture although this situation seems to have been more common in earlier decades than today in recent times conversely the senate leadership has increasingly u tilized cloture as routine tool to manage the flow of business even in the absence of any apparent filibuster for these reasons the presence or absen ce of cloture attemp ts cannot be taken as reliable guide to the presence or absence of filibuster inasmuch as filibustering does not depend on the use of any specific rules whether filibuster is present is always matter of judgment the following discussion focuses chiefl on the conduct of filibusters through extended debate and on cloture as mean s of overcoming them the discussion does not encompass all possible contingencie s or consider every relevant precedent authoritative information on cloture pro cedure can be found under that heading in riddicks senate procedure 1 senators and staff so may consult the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs2 1 continued 334parliamentarian on an question concerning the nates procedural rules precedents and practices the right to debate the core rule of the senate governing floor debate is graph 1a of rule xix which states that when senator desires to speak he sha ll rise and address the presiding officer and shall not proceed until he is recognized and the presiding officer shall recognize the senator who shall first address him senator shall interrupt another senator in debate without his consent and to obtain such consent he shall first address the presiding office r and senator shall speak more than twice upon any one question in debate on the same legislative day without leave of the senate which shall be determined without debate this is essentially all that the senates rules have to sa about the right to speak on the floor so the rule is just as important for what it does not say as for what it does say the lack of discretion by the chair in recognizing senators and the lack of time limits on debate combine to create the possibility of filibusters by debate the right to recognition rule xix affords the presiding officer choice and discretion in recognition as general rule if sena tor seeks recognition when other senator has the floor the presiding officer must recognize him or her the presiding officer may not decline to recognize the senator whether for reasons of personal preference or partisan advantage or to enable the senate to reach vote on the pending matter as result when the senate is consid ering any debatable question it cannot vote on the question so long as any senator wa nts to be recognized to debate it if more than one senator seeks reco gnition rule xix directs the presiding officer to recognize whichever is the firs t to do so the result is that although senator can be sure that he or she will be recognized promptly for debate on pending question each can be sure of recognition eventually as senate rules provide for motions that could have the effect of terminating debate senator can do nothing while she or he has the floor that would preclude another senator from being recognized afterwards the motion to table and time agreements by unanimous consent both of which represent partial exceptions to this statement are discussed later by wellestablished precedent and practice the senate does not comply strictly with the requirement that the first senator addressing the chair be recognized all senators accept that the majority leader and then the minority leader must be able to secure recognition if they are to do some of the things the senate expects them to dohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs3 2 the record for the longest single speech remains that made by sen strom thurmond of south carolina on aug 2829 1957 which consumed 24 hours and 18 minutes us senate committee on rules and administration senate cloture rule committee print 99th cong 1st sess sprt 9995 was hington gpo 1985 p 40to arrange the daily agenda and weekly schedule and to ma ke motions and propound unanimous consent agreements necessary for the relatively orderly conduct of business on the floor in practice the part leaders receive preference in recognition this means that if two senators are seeking recognition at more or less the same time and one of them is party floor leader the presiding officer recognizes the leader and the majority leader in preference to the minority leader next after these two leaders the majority and minority floor managers of legisl ation being debated also generally are accorded preference in recognition they receive this preference because they also bear responsibilities for suring an orderly process of considering measure the right to speak at length and the twospeech rule under rule xix unless any special limits on debate are in effect senators who have been recognized may speak for as long as they wish2 they usually cannot be forced to cede the floor or even interrupte d without their consent there are some exceptions for example senators can lose the floor if they violate the senates standards of decorum in debate or as discussed later they may be interrupted for the presentation of cloture motion rule xix places limit on the length of individual speeches or on the number of senators who may speak on pending stion it does however tend to limit the possibility of extended debate by its provision that senator shall speak more than twice upon any one question in debate on th same legislative day without leave of the senate which sha ll be determined without deba this provision commonly called the twospeech rule limits each nator to making two speeches per day however long each speech may be on each debatable question that the senate considers senator who has made two speeches on single question becomes ineligible to be recognized for another speech on the same question on the same day the day during which senator can make more than two speeches on the same question is not calendar day but gislative day legislative day ends only with an adjournment so that whenever the senate recesses overnight rather than adjourning the same legislative day tinues into the next calendar day legislative day may therefore extend over several calendar days the leadership may continue to recess the senate rather than adjourning as means of attempting to overcome filibuster by compelling fili bustering senators to exhaust their opportunities of gaining recognition senators rarely invoke the twospeech ru because they generally do not believe that there is any need to do so sometimes however they may insist that the two speech rule be enforced as means of ttempting to overcome filibuster on such occasions nevertheless senators often can circumvent the twospeech rule by making motion or offering an amendment that constitutes new and differenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs4 3 therefore the two speech rule requires not mechanical test but the application of the rule of reason riddicks senate procedure pp 782783debatable question for example each nator can make two speeches on each bill each firstdegree amendment to bill and each seconddegree amendment to each of those amendments as well in recent practice the senate considers that being recognized and engaging in debate constitutes speech the sena however does not consider that recognition for any purpose constitutes speech currently effective precedents have held that certain procedural moti ons and requests were examples of actions that did not constitute speeches for purposes of the two speech rule these matters include such things as making parliame ntary inquiry and suggesting the absence of quorum3 nevertheless if senator is recognized for substantive comment however brief on the pending question that remark may count as speech the motion to table there is one way in which the senate can end debate on question even though there may be senators who still might want to speak on it during the debate it is normally possible for senator to move to table the pending question more formally to lay the question on the table the motion is not debatable and requires only simple majority vote to be adopted in the senate to table something is to kill it so when the senate votes to table matter it thereby disposes of the matter permanently and adversely the senate fre quently disposes of amendments by voting to table them rather than by taking what often are called up or down votes to agree to or not agree to the amendment itself if there is unanimous consent agreement in effect that limits the time for debate the motion to table may not be offered until the time is consumed also in order to offer the motion senator must first be recognized another senator who has already been recognized may not be interrupted for motion to table matter how long he or she has been speaking within these limitations if majority of senators oppose matter the motion to tabl may enable them to prevail at time of their choosing by this means sena tors can prevent debate from continuing indefinitely if they are prepared to reject the amendment motion or bill that is being debated if on the other hand oppone nts of matter do not command enough support to table it they may decide to extend the debate by conducting what supporters of the matter might we ll characterize as filibuster the motion to table however offers means for supporters of matter to overcome filibuster being conducted against it through extended debate if the senate agrees to motion to table the bate is brought to an end but only at the cost of defeating the matter if the sena votes against the tabling motion the matter remains before the senate and senators can resume debating it at length instead for purposes of overcoming fili busters the chief use of the motion to table arises when the filibuster is being conducted through the ffering of potentially dilatory amendments and motions for exam ple supporters of filibuster may offerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs5 amendments in order to renew their righ t to recognition under the twospeech rule each time the senate tables such an amendment it can continue debate on the underlying bill or at least can go on to consider other amendments the conduct of filibusters conducting filibuster by ex tended debate is simple though it can be physically demanding senator seeks recognition and once recognized speaks at length when that first senator concludes and yields the floor another senator seeks recognition and continues the debate the debate can proceed in this way until all the participating senators have made their two speeches on the pending question then it usually is possible to offer an amendment or make some other motion in order to create new debatable question on which the same sena tors can make two more speeches there is need for the participating senators to monopolize the debate what is important is that someone speak not that it be someone on their side of the question although one purpose of filibus ter is to try to change the minds of senators who support the question being bated the purpose of delay is served by senators speaking matter which side of the question they take germaneness of debate more often than not there is need for the debate to be germane to the question being considered w ith one important exception paragraph 1b of rule xix often called the pasto re rule in recognition of former senator john pastore of rhode island requires th at debate be germane each calendar day during the first three hours after the senate be gins to consider its unfinis hed or pending legislative business in other words the time consumed by the majority and minority leaders and any speeches during routine morning business at the beginning of daily session is not included in this three hour period the senate can waive this germaneness requirement by unanimous cons ent or by agreeing to nondebatable motion for that purpose like the twospeech rule the pastore rule usually is not enforced because senators do not see the need to enforce it during filibusters however senators may be called upon to comply with the germanen ess requirement on bate when it is in effect in practice this does not put mu ch extra burden on participating senators because most speeches made during filibuste rs today tend to be germane anyway in earlier times filibusteri ng senators were known to speak about virtually anything in his 1940 study of filibusters franklin burdette re ported that senator huey long of louisiana would dictate for the benefit of the congressional record recipes for cooking upon which his authoritative advice had been regularly in demand in washington social circles he then proceeded to tell the senate at great length and inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs6 4 franklin burdette filibustering in the senate new york russell russell 1965 reprint of 1940 princeton university press edition p 4 5 riddicks senate procedure p 755 6 senators sometimes ask unanimous consent to yield to colleague for something other than question without losing their right to the fl oor any senator can object to this requestmeticulous detail how to fry oysters nor did he omit rambling discourse on the subject of potlikker4 at that time the senate had rule of germaneness in debate even during the first three hours of each day but even at the time to which burdette referred discourse such as senator longs was unusual yielding the floor and yielding for questions senator who has the floor for purposes of debate must re main standing and must speak more or less continuously5 complying with these requirements obviously becomes more of strain as time passes however senators must be careful when they try to give some relief to their colleagues who are speaking senate precedents prohibit senators from yielding the floor to each other to gain the floor senator must seek recognition from the presiding officer thus if senator simply yields to colleague he or she has yielded relinquished the floor however inadvertently this is another one of those sena procedures that often is not observed during the normal conduct of business on the floor but during filibusters senators are much more likely to insist on it being observed senator may yield to colleague without losing the floor only if the senator yields for question6 with this in mind colleague of filibustering senator may give that senator some relief by asking him or her to yield for question the senator who retains control of the floor must remain standing while the question is being asked the peculiar advantage of this tactic is that it sometimes takes senators quite some time to ask their question and th presiding officer is reluctant to force them to state their question before they are ready to do so in this way participating senators can extend the debate through an exchange of what sometimes are long questions followed by short answers rather than by relying exclusively on series of long uninterrupted speeches quorums and quorum calls there are ways other than debate by which senators can delay and sometimes even prevent the senate from voting on question that it is considering for example each amendment that is offered on the senate floor must be read in full before debate on it can be gin although the senate usually agrees by unanimous consent to waive the reading in additi on quorum calls can be demanded not for the purpose of confirming or securing the pres ence of quorum but in order to consume timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs7 7 riddicks senate procedure p 1053 on what constitutes intervening business see pp 10421046a senator who has been recognized can suggest the absence of quorum asking in effect whether the senate is complying with the constitutional requirement that quorum majority of all senators be presen t for the senate to conduct business the presiding officer normally does not have the authority to count to determine whether quorum actually is present which is rarely the case and so directs the clerk to call the roll senators usually use quorum calls to suspend the senates floor proceedings temporarily perhaps to discu ss procedural or policy probl em or to await the arrival of certain senator in those cases the clerk calls the roll very slowly and before the call of the roll is completed the senate agrees by unanimous consent to call off the quorum call to dispense with furt her proceedings under the quorum call because the absence of quorum has not act ually been demonstrated the senate can resume its business such quorum calls can be timeconsuming and so can serve the interests of filibus tering senators during filibuster however the clerk may be directed to call the roll more rapidly as if rollcall vote were in progress doing so reduces the time that the quorum call consumes but it also creates th real possibility that the quorum call may demonstrate that quorum in f act is not present in that case the senate has only two options to adjourn or to take steps necessa ry to secure the presence of enough absent senators to create quorum typically the majority leader or the majority floor manager opts for the latter course and makes motion that the sergeant at arms secure the attendance of absent senators and then asks for rollcall vote on that motion senators who did not respond to th quorum call are likely to come to the floor for the rollcall vote on this motion almost always therefore the vote establishes that quorum is present so the senate can resume its business without the sergeant at arms actually having to execute the senates directive this process also can be timeconsu ming because of the time required to conduct the rollcall vote just discussed n onetheless the proponents of the bill or other matter being filibustered may prefer that the roll be called quickly because it requires unanimous consent to call off r outine quorum call in which the clerk calls the roll very slowly before it is completed filibustering senator has only to suggest the absence of quorum and then object to calling off the quorum call in order to provoke motion to secure the ttendance of absentees and with the support of at least 10 other senators rollcall vot on that motion if this motion is likely to be necessary one way or the other it is usually in the interests of the bills proponents to have the motion made nd agreed to as soon as possible when senators suggest the absence of quorum however they lose the floor also it is not in order for senato r to demand quorum call if business has intervened since the last call business mu st intervene before second quorum call or between calls if the question is raised or point of order made7 these restrictions limit the extent to which quorum calls may be used as means of conducting filibustershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs8 8 the senate unlike the house does not use an electronic voting system 9 the sufficiency of the number of senators demanding rollcall is based on the last preceding rollcall the chair noting that 81 senators had just voted denied the yeas and nays when only 16 senators responded to request for sufficient second demand for the yeas and nays immediately following call of the senate is seconded by onefifth of those answering such call or immediately fo llowing yea and nay vote seconded by one fifth of those voting riddicks senate procedure p 1417roll call voting as the preceding discussion indicates rollcall votes are another source of delay any question put to the senate for its d ecision requires vote and minimum of 11 senators can require that it be roll call vot each such vote consumes at least 15 minutes unless the senate agrees in advance to reduce the time for voting8 the constitution provides that the yeas and nays shall be ordered at the desire of onefifth of those present ar ticle i section 5 because quorum is presumed to be present the senate requi res at least 11 senators onefifth of the minimal quorum of 51 to request ro llcall vote on the pending question when senator wants rollcall vote other senators frequently support the request as courtesy to colleague du ring filibuster however the supporters of the bill or amendment sometimes try to discourage other senators from supporting requests for timeconsuming rollcall votes also the proponents sometimes can make it more difficult for their opponents to secure rollcall vote when the request for rollcall vote is made immediately af ter quorum call or another rollcall vote senators can insist that the request be supported by onefifth of however many senators answered that call or cast their votes9 since this is almost certainly more than 51 and in practice is much closer to 100 the number of senators required to secure roll call can increase to maximum of 20 the time allowed for senators to cast roll call votes is minimum of 15 minutes unless the senate agrees before the vote begins to reduced time when the 15 minutes expire the vote usually is left open for some additional time in order to accommodate other senators who are thought to be route to the floor to vote thus the actual time for roll call vote can extend to 20 minutes or more during filibusters however call for the regular order can lead the presiding officer to announce the result of roll call vote s oon after the 15 minutes allotted for it senators usually can secure two votes in connection with the disposition of each bill amendment motion or other question the first is the vote on the question itself or on motion to table it the second is the vote on motion to r econsider the vote by which the first question was decided or on motion to table the motion to reconsider with sufficient support ro ll call votes can be ordered on each motion so that completing action on both of them consumes at least 30 minuteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs9 scheduling filibusters contemporary filibusters usua lly are fairly courteous affairs the senates daily schedule normally is arranged so that filibusters are not unduly disruptive or inconvenient to senators one way to ma ke conducting filibuster more costly and difficult is to keep the senate in session until late at night or even all night requiring the participating senators to speak or otherwise consume the senates time during some contentious filibusters of the 1950s cots were brought into the senates anterooms for senators to use during aroundtheclock sessions today allnight sessions are very unusua l the senate may not even convene earlier or remain in session later when filibuster is in progress than it does on other days one reason may be that filibuste rs are not the extraordinary and unusual occurrences that they once were another may be that senators are less willing to endure the inconvenience and discom fort of prolonged sessions the latter point is important because latenight or allnight sessions put as much or more of burden on the proponents of the question being debated than on its opponents the senators partic ipating in the filibuster need only ensure that at least one of their number always is present on the floor to speak the proponents of the question however need to ensure that major ity of the senate is present or at least available to respond to quorum call or roll call vote if late in the evening or in the middle of the night senator suggests the absence of quorum and quorum does not appear the senate must adjourn or at least suspend its proceedings until quorum is established this works to the advantage of the fili bustering senators so the burden rests on their opponents to ensure that the constitutional quorum requirement always can be met invoking cloture the procedures for invoking cloture are governed by paragraph 2 of rule xxii which also governs procedures under clotur as discussed late r in this report the process begins when senator presents cloture motion that is signed by 16 senators proposing to bring to clos the debate upon the pending question the motion is presented to the senate while it is in session and must be presented while the question on which cloture is sought is pending for example it is not in order for senator to present motion to invoke cloture on bill that the senate has not yet agreed to consider or on an amendment that has not yet been offered senator does not need to be recognized by the chair in order to present cloture petition the senator who has the floor may be interrupted for the purpose but retains the floor thereafter and may continue speaking the motion is read to the senate but the senate then returns to whatever business it had been transacting the nate does not act on the cloture motion in any way on the day on which it is submitted or on the following day instead the next action on the motion occurs on the fo llowing calendar day but one that ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs10 10 rule xxii paragraph 2 11 committee on rules and administration senate cloture rule pp 119121on the second day after it is presented so if the motion is presented on monday the senate acts on it on wednesday during the intervening time the senate does not have to continue debating the question on which cloture has been proposed but can turn to other business one hour after the nate convenes on the day the cloture motion has ripened or matured the presiding officer interrupts the proceedings of the senate regardless of what is under consideration at the time and presents the cloture motion to the senate for vote at this point the presiding officer is required to direct that an actual or live quorum call take place the senate of ten waives this quorum call by unanimous consent when the presence of quorum is established the senate proceeds without debate to vote on the cloture motion the presiding officer shall without debate submit to the senate by yeaandnay vote the question is it the sense of the senate that the debate sha ll be brought to close 10 the terms of the rule require an automatic roll call vote invoking cloture usually requires thr eefifths vote of the entire senate threefifths of the senators duly chosen and sworn if there are vacancies therefore 60 senators must vote to invoke cloture in contrast most other votes require only simple majority that is 51 of the senators present and voting assuming that those senators constitute quor um in the case of cloture vote the key is the number of senators voting fo r cloture not the number voting against failing to vote on cloture motion has the same effect as voting against the motion it deprives the motion of one of the 60 votes needed to agree to it there is an important exception to the th reefifths requirement to invoke cloture under rule xxii an affirmative vote of twothirds of the senators present and voting is required to invoke cloture on measure or motion to amend the senate rules this exception has its origin in the recent history of the cloture rule before 1975 twothirds of the senators present and voting quorum being present was required for cloture on all matters in early 1975 at the beginning of the 94th congress senators sought to amend the rule to make it somewhat easier to invoke cloture however some senators feared that if this effort succeeded that would only make it easier to amend the rule again ma king cloture still easie r to invoke as compromise the senate agreed to move from maximum of 67 votes twothirds of the senators present and voting to minimum of 60 votes threefifths of the senators duly chosen and swor n on all matters except future rules changes including changes in the cloture rule itself11 if the senate does vote to invoke cloture that vote may not be reconsidered on the other hand it is in order to reconsider the vote by which the senate voted against invoking cloture on few recent occa sions supporters of cl oture have moved to reconsider vote against clot ure so that second vote on cloture vote occurs without second petition being filedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs11 12 senate rule vii paragraph 2 and senate rule viii paragraph 2 alt hough senate rules do not restrict who may offer motion to proceed the senate normally accords the majority leader the prerogative of doing so in pursu ance of his functions of arranging the floor agenda riddicks senate procedure p 655 even in the equally divided senate of the 107th cong the powersharing agreement s res 8 adopted jan 5 2001 affirmed this practicethe senate sometimes agrees by unanimous consent to alter the way in which various requirements of the cloture rule pply to consideration of specified matter in particular senators by unanimous consent sometimes permit cloture motion to be filed on matter that is not then pending also as mentioned the required quorum call pr eceding cloture vote is often waived by consent in addition the senate may give unanimous consent to adjust the time when the cloture vote will take place on some occasions the senate has even agreed by unanimous consent to vote on cloture at sp ecified time even though clot ure motion is formally filed matters on which cloture may be invoked any debatable question that the senate considers can be filibustered and therefore may be the subject of clotur motion unless the time for debate is limited by the senates rules by law or by unanimous consent agreement consequently senators may present cloture motions to end debate on bills resolutions amendments conference reports and various debatable motions in relation to the senates initial cons ideration of bill or resolution there usually can be at least two filibusters first filibuster on the motion to proceed to the measures consideration and second af ter the senate agrees to this motion filibuster on the measure itself if the nate cannot agree to take up measure by unanimous consent the majority leaders recourse is to make motion that the senate proceed to its consideration this motion to proceed as it is called usually is debatable and c onsequently subject to filibuster12 therefore the senate may have to invoke cloture on this motion befo re being able to vote on it once the senate adopts the motion to proceed and be gins consideration of the measure itself filibuster on the measure then may begin so that cloture must be sought anew on the measure itself except by unanimous consent cloture cannot be sought on the measure during consideration of the motion to proceed because cloture may be moved only on question that is pending be fore the senate threatened filibusters on motions to proceed once were rare but have become somewhat more common in recent years sometimes an amendment pr ovokes filibuster even though the underlying bill does not if cloture is invoked on the amendment the operation of cloture is exhausted once the amendment is disposed of thereafter debate on the bill continues but under the gene ral rules of the senate on occasion cloture has been invoked in this way sepa rately on several amendmen ts to bill in succession alternatively cloture may be invoked on the bill itself so that debate on the amendment continues under the re strictions of cloture on th overall measure if the amendment is not germane to the bill however its supporters will oppose this approach for as discusse d later the cloture rule requires that amendmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs12 13 nomination also is subject to only one

nongermane amendment is pending the am endment becomes out of order and may not be further considered in such case it may be necessary instead to invoke cloture on the amendment so as to secure final vote on it and then after the amendment is disposed of move for cloture on the bill as well after the senate has passe d measure additional action may be necessary in order that the senate may go to conferen ce with the house on the legislation the motions necessary for this purpose are debatable and as result supporters of the measure have occasionally found it nece ssary to move for cloture thereon conference reports themselves unlike m easures on initial consideration are not subject to double filibuster because they are privileged matters so that motions to proceed to their consideration are not debatable13 inasmuch as conference reports themselves are debatable however it may be found necessary to move for cloture on conference report occasionally cloture has also been sought on other debatable questions such as motions to waive the budget act motions to recommit measure with instructions that it be reported back forthwith with an amendment or overriding presidential veto timing of cloture motions the relation of cloture motions to fili busters may depend on when the cloture motions are filed prior to the 1970s cons ideration of matter was usually allowed to proceed for some days or even weeks before cloture was sought or cloture might not be sought at all in more recent decades it has become common to seek cloture on matter much earlier in the course of consideration even immediately after consideration has begun in some cases cloture motion has been filed or has been deemed to have been filed even before the matter in question has been called up because the rules permit filing motion for cloture only on pending question either of these actions of course requi res unanimous consent when cloture is sought before any dilatory action actually occurs the action may be an indication that the threat of filibuster is present or at least is thought to be present when cloture is filed at the time the senate commences to consider matter or earlier the senate may then sometimes also lay the matter aside or omit to take it up until the time for the cloture vote arrives if cloture is then invoked in such situation the entire active floor considera tion of the matter may occur under cloture in the early months of the 107th congre ss 20012002 when the senate was equally divided between the major parties the so called powersharing agreement providedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs13 14 sres 8 107th cong adopted jan 5 2001 15 hypothetically therefore one senator coul d control maximum of 13 hours for debate this would require eight senators to yield ll of their time to the four designated party leaders and floor managers two senators yieldi ng their time to one of the four giving each continuedthat cloture motion be filed on any am endable matter during its first 12 hours of senate debate14 this arrangement was intended to preclude situations in which senators would have opport unity to debate and especi ally offer amendments to measure except under the re strictions of cloture there often has been more than one cl oture vote on the same question if and when the senate rejects cloture motion senator then can file second motion to invoke cloture on that question in some cas senators even have anticipated that cloture motion may fail so they have f iled second motion befo re the senate has voted on the first one for example one cloture motion may be presented on monday and another on tuesday if the senate rejects the first motion when it matures on wednesday the s econd motion will ripen for vote on thursday if the senate agrees to the first motion there is need of course for it to act on the second there have been instances in wh ich there have been even more cloture votes on the same question during the 100th congress 19871988 for example there were eight cloture votes all unsu ccessful in connection with campaign finance reform bill effects of invoking cloture invoking cloture on bill or on any other question does not produce an immediate vote on it the effect of invoking cloture is only to gu arantee that vote will take place eventually time for consideration and debate rule xxii imposes cap of more th an 30 additional hours for the senate to consider question after invoking cloture on it this 30hour cap is ceiling on the time available for postcloture consideration not just for debate the time used in debate is counted against the 30 hours but so too is the time consumed by quorum calls roll call votes parliame ntary inquiries and all other proceedings that occur while the senate is operating under cloture the 30 hour period can be increased if the senate agrees to nondebatable moti on for that purpose adopting this motion also requires threefifths vote of the senators duly chosen and sworn during the period for postcloture c onsideration each senator is entitled to speak for total of not more than one hour senators may yield part or all of their time to any of four others the majority or minority leaders or the majority or minority floor managers none of these senato rs can accumulate more than two hours of additional time for debate but in turn they can yield some or all of their time to others15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs14 15 continued party leader and floor manager control of three hours apiece if the four designated senators then yielded all of their combined 12 hours to fifth senator who controls one hour in his or her own right that senator would control 13 hours 16 when one senator yields to another for question the time required to ask the question comes out of the hour controlled by the senator who yielded 17 when senator has consumed all of his or her hour for debate that senator may continue to offer amendments but has time to explain them at the end of the 30 hours for post cloture consideration further amendments may be offeredthere is insufficient time for all senato rs to use their allotted hours for debate within the 30hour cap for postcloture cons ideration this disparity results from recent amendment to the cloture rule before 1979 there was cap at all on post cloture consideration the only restriction in rule xx ii was the limit of one hour per senator for debate the time consumed by reading amendments and conducting roll call votes and quorum calls was not deduc ted from anyones hour as result senators could and did engage in what became known as post cloture filibusters by offering one amendment after another for example and demanding roll call votes to dispose of them senators could consume hours of the senates time while consuming little if any of their allotted hour for debate in reaction the senate amended rule xxii in 1979 to impose 100 hour cap on postcloture consideration in theory at least this time period could accommodate the one hour of debate per senator but only if senators used all of the 100 hours only for debate then in 1985 the senate agreed without significan t dissent to reduce the 100 hours to 30 hours while leaving unchanged the allocati on of one hour for each senator to debate the result is that there is not enoug h time available under cloture for each senator to speak for an hour16 in principle 30 senators speaking for one hour each could consume all the time for postcloture consideration howe ver rule xxii does provide limited protection fo r all senators by providing that when the 30 hours expire any senator who has not used or yiel ded at least ten minutes is if he seeks recognition guaranteed up to ten nutes inclusive to speak only17 under these conditions senators may still be able to pursue postcloture filibuster but it can last longer than the 30 hours available for consideration under cloture as result once cloture has imposed its definitive limit on further consideration op ponents may s ee little benefit in the limited delay they might still obtain and may instead permit final vote well before the available 30 hours expires sometimes the senate agrees by unanimous consent that the 30 hours be considered to run continuously even when the senate is not actively considering the measure or even remains in session there is one other notable difference in the senates debate rules before and after cloture is invoked as discussed bove senate floor bate normally does not have to be germane except when the past ore rule applies under cloture debate must be germane this requirement rives from the language of rule xxii that allows each senator to speak for more than one hour on the measure motion or other matter pending before the senate senate precedents make clear that senators should not expect the presiding offi cer to insist on germane debate at his orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs15 18 on what constitutes germane amendment see riddicks senate procedure pp 291294 19 riddicks senate procedure p 291her initiative senators wishing to enforce the requirement that debate be germane can do so by making points of order from the floor offering amendments and motions there are several key restrictions governing the amendments that senators can propose under cloture that do not apply to nate floor amendments under most other circumstances some of these restrictions also apply to other motions senators may offer or actions they may take under cloture germane amendments only only germane amendments are eligible for floor consideration under cloture18 this germaneness requirement applies to the amendments that senators ffer after cloture is invoked and the requirement applies as well to any amendments that were pending that is amendments that had been called up for consideration but were not yet disposed of at the time that the senate votes for cloture thus immediately afte r successful cloture vote the presiding officer may announce at his own initiative th at one or more amendments that were pending when the vote began now must fall because they are not germane to the matter on which the senate just invoked cloture this germaneness requirement helps expl ain why the senate may have to invoke cloture on an amendment to bill and th invoke cloture again on the bill itself it is quite common for senate committee to report bill back to the senate with an amendment in the nature of substitute complete alternative for the text of the bill as introduced the senate almost always adopts this substitute immediately before voting to pass the bill as amended by the substitute however it also is not unusual for the committee substitute to be nong ermane to the bill in some respect thus if the senate invokes cloture on the bill before it votes on the committee substitute the substitute becomes out of order as nongermane so that the senate cannot agree to it to protect the committee substitute or any other nongermane amendment that the senate is considering the senate can first invoke cloture on the amendment doing so limits further consideration of the amendment to more than 30 more hours if the senate then adopt s the amendment cloture longer is in effect and senators can filibuster the bill as amended however inasmuch as the previous nongermane amendment is now part of the text of the bill it therefore cannot now be nongermane to the bill at th is point therefore the senate may again vote to invoke cloture this time on the bill as amended with respect to amendments offered after the cloture vote the presiding officer may wait for senator to make point of order against an amendment before ruling that it is not germane sometimes however the presiding officer has taken the initiative to rule amendments out of orde r as nongermane in fact when obviously nongermane the chair may rule the amendmen t out of order even before it has been read or stated by the clerk19 similarly presiding officers have taken the initiativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs16 20 senator can call up an amendment that another senator had submitted in writing though senators rarely do so also senator may recall amendments that he or she submitted in writing before cloture vote by recalling an amendment the senator removes it from potential consideration under clotureto rule amendments out of order sometime s even before they were read because the amendments sought to change bill in two or more noncontiguous places any senator can appeal the chairs ruling that certain amendment is nongermane allowing the sena to overturn that ruling by simple majority vote however the senate is unlikely to take this action because doing so could fundamentally undermine the integrity and utility of the cloture procedure in sense the decision to invoke cloture cons titutes kind of treaty by which senators relinquish their right to filibuster in ex change for guarantee that nongermane amendments will be offered under cloture th at some of those senators would want to filibuster unless sena tor could be confident that under cloture his colleagues could not offer amendments on unrelated s ubjects that the senator would insist on filibustering that senator would have serious qualms bout ever voting for cloture although there are some senate rules that senators some times c hoose not to enforce when enforcing them would be in convenient the requirement for germane amendments under cloture is not one of th em on some occasions when senator did appeal ruling of the chair under clot ure that an amendment was not germane senators who may have s upported the amendment on its merits nonetheless voted to sustain the ruling of the chair with the l ongterm viability of the cloture procedure in mind cloture is sometimes sought not for the purpose of overcoming filibuster by debate but primarily to trigger the requirement for germaneness of amendments one way in which this situation can occur may arise when senators wish to secure floor consideration for bill that the majority party leadership is reluctant to schedule for floor consideration supporters of the bill may offer the text of that bill as nongermane amendment to anothe r bill that the majority party leadership is eager to pass opponents of the amendment may re spond by moving for cloture on the bill then prolonging the debate so as to prevent vote on the amendment until the time comes for voting on the cloture motion if the senate votes to invoke cloture the presiding officer announces that the nonger mane amendment is longer in order in this way its opponents can dispose of the amendment adversely without ever having to vote on it or even on motion to table it but only of course if they can mobilize threefifths of the senate to vote for cloture this possibility which is more than hypothetical illustrates that not ev ery cloture vote takes place to overcome filibuster that is already in progress amendments submitted in writing to be in order under cloture amendments must be submitted at the desk in writing and for printing in the congressional record before the cloture vote takes place20 there are different requirements for firstdegree amendments amendments to change the text of bill or resolution and secondde gree amendments amendments to change the text of pending firstdegree amendm ent under rule xxiihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs17 21 riddicks senate procedure p 88except by unanimous consent amendment shall be proposed after the vote to bring the debate to close unless it had been submitted in writing to the journal clerk by 1 oclock pm on the day followi ng the filing of the cloture motion if an amendment in the first degree and unless it had been so submitted at least one hour prior to the beginning of the cloture vote if an amendment in the second degree senators sometimes submit large number of amendments to bill for printing in the congressional record even before cloture motion is presented this often is intended and understood to be clear sign that the senators who submitted the amendments for printing are contemplating filibuster in practice the deadline in rule xxii usually gives senators most or all of day after cloture is proposed to draft germane amendments to the bill senators then usually have most or all of the next day to review those firstdegree amendments and to decide what seconddegree amendments if any they might offer to them in this way senators can be fully aware of ll the amendments they may encounter under cloture before they vote on whether or not to invoke cloture submitting an amendment in writing does not exempt that amendment from the restriction that only germane amendments are in order under cloture rule xxii establishes separate deadline for submitting amendments in the nature of substitute ie substitutes for the full text of measure which are amendable in two degrees that is an amendment to an amendment in the nature of substitute is firstdegree amendment21 an amendment in the nature of substitute might be submitted at any time up to the deadline for firstdegree amendments if it were submitted just before that deadline senators might have essentially time to prepare amendments to it one result of these requirements is that whenever cloture is proposed senators and their staffs must decide whether they need to prepare and submit amendments to the measure when the senate has voted to invoke cloture on bill it is too late for senator then to think about what amendm ents to the bill he or she might want to propose when cloture motion is filed nators often conclude that they need to proceed with drafting whatever amendments they might want to offer on the assumption that the senate will approve the motion two days later one result is that there often are more amendments submitted for printing in the record than senators actually offer after cloture is invoked under cloture senator may not modify an amendment that he or she has offered permitting modifications would be inconsistent with the principle implicit in the cloture rule that senators should be able to know what amendments may be offered under cloture before the senate deci des if it will invoke cloture rule xxii permits only one limited circumstance in which senators are allowed to change the amendments they offer under cl oture if measure or ot her matter is reprinted for some reason after the senate has invoked cloture on it and if the reprinting changes page and line numbers amendments that otherwise are in order will remain in order and can be reprinted to make conforming changes in page and line numberinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs18 22 amendments that only express the sense of the senate or the sense of congress and therefore would not have the force of law if enacted have been considered dilatory per under cloture other type of amendment has been held to be dilatory per under cloture 23 in 1982 the presiding officer stated that the right to appeal is basic right of each senator and would be held dilatory only in the most extraordinary circumstances riddicks senate procedure p 312 24 an amendment that was offered and divided before the cloture vote continues to be considered as divided after cloture is invokedmultiple amendments rule xxii states that senator shall call up more than two amendments until every ot her senator shall ve had the opportunity to do likewise the evident purpose of th is provision is to prevent some senators from dominating the senates proceedings under cloture this restriction which senators have rarely if ever chosen to enforce does not create significant problem for those wishing to consume the time ava ilable for postcloture consideration from their perspective what is most important is that amendments be offered not who offers them dilatory amendmen ts and motions rule xxii provides that dilatory motion or amendment is in order under cl oture furthermore the senate has established precedents that empower the presiding officer to rule motions and amendments out of order as dilatory without senators first maki ng points of order to that effect from the floor presiding officers rarely have exercised this authority on occasion however and whether at their ow n initiative or in response to points of order presiding officers have ruled amendments and various kinds of motions to be dilatory and therefore not in order22 for example motions to adjourn postpone recess and reconsider have been held to be dilatory there also is precedent supporting the authority of the presiding officer to rule that quorum call is dilatory under normal senate proce dures appeals from rulings of the chair usually are debatable though they also are subject to tabling motions under cloture however appeals are not debatable in extraordinary circumstances appeals from rulings of the chair have even been ruled out of order as dilatory23 reading and division of amendments under normal nate procedure each amendment that is offered must be read before debate on it may begin unless the reading is waived by unanimous cons ent as it usually is under rule xxii however the reading of any amendment au tomatically is waived if it has been available in printed form at the desk of the members for not less than twentyfour hours this requirement us ually is satisfied because amendments considered under cloture must have been submitted for printing before the cloture vote also under normal senate procedur any senator can demand that an amendment be divided into two or more co mponent parts if each part could stand as an independent proposition but amendments in the form of motions to strike out and insert are not divisible under cloture however senator cannot demand as matter of right that an amendment be divided24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs19 25 riddicks senate procedure p 287the authority of the presiding officer when the senate is operating under clotur the senates presiding officer has powers that he or she does not have unde r the senates regular procedures as already noted the presiding officer may ru amendments and motions out of order at his or her own initiative without waiting for senators to make points of order from the floor and even without waiting for th amendments to be read under the senates precedents once cloture has b een invoked the chair is required to take the initiative to rule out of order dilatory amendments and the chair makes the determination regarding dilatory intent also under clot ure the chair has taken the initiative to rule out of order amendm ents that were dilatory nongermane or improperly drafted as each was called up and before the amendment could be reported25 there is one other potentially important authority that the presiding officer exercises after the senate vot to invoke cloture u nder normal sena procedure the chair is not empowered to count whet her quorum is present on the floor when senator suggests the absence of quorum th chairs only response is to direct the clerk to call the roll under cloture however the presiding officer can count to ascertain the presence of quorum business on the senate floor cloture also affects the consequences of filibuster for other legislative and executive business that the senate could c onduct rule xxii provides that once the senate invokes cloture the n said measure motion or other matter pending before the senate or the unfinished business shall be the unfinished business to the exclusion of all other business until disposed of if the senate invokes cloture on bill in other words the rule requires the body to continue to consider that bill until it completes action on it the rule provides mechanism for the senate to set aside the matter being considered under cloture even temporarily in order to consider other matters even those that are of an emergency nature or fa r less contentious as result filibuster can affect the fate not only of the matter that provokes it but also other matters that the senate may not be able to consider or at least not as soon as it would like because of the filibuster in practi ce however the senate often provides by unanimous consent for the consideration of other matters arrangements of this kind permit the senate to accomp lish necessary routine business or make progress on other matters at the same time as it continues to move toward final resolution of the matter on which it has invoked cloturehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs20 the impact of filibusters obviously filibuster has the greatest impact on the senate when 60vote majority cannot be asse mbled to invoke cloture in th at case the measure or other matter that is being filibus tered is doomed unless its oppone nts relent and allow the senate to vote on it even if cloture is invoked however f ilibuster can significantly affect how when and even wh ether the senate conduc ts its legislative and executive business in fact it is not an exaggeration to say that filibusters and the prospect of filibusters shape much of the way in which the senate does its work on the floor impact on the time for consideration in principle truly determined minor ity of senators even one too small to prevent cloture usually can delay for as much as two weeks the time at which the senate finally votes to pass b ill that most senators support table 1 summarizes hypothetical example in this exam ple motion to proceed to the bills consideration is made on monday day 1 if filibuster on that motion is begun or is anticipated proponents of the motion and the bill can present cloture motion on the same day however under rule xxii the cloture vote on the motion to proceed does not take place until wednesday day 3 assuming the senate invokes cloture on wednesday there then begi ns the 30hour period for postcloture consideration of the motion if the sena is in session for eight hours per day monday through friday th 30hour peri od if fully consumed will extend over almost four full days of session or at leas t until the end of the senates session on the following monday day 6 if at that time the senate votes for the motion to proceed the bills opponents then may begin to filibuster the bill itself requiring another cloture motion anothe r successful cloture vote on day 8 and the expiration of another 30hour period for postcloture consideration under these conditions rule xxii would require that the vote on final passage occur on the 11th day of consideration or the 15th calendar day after the motion to proceed was made table 1

15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs21 how long an actual filibuster can delay final senate action may be affected by the answers that can be given in the i ndividual case to many questions these include is cloture pr oposed as s oon as the motion to pro ceed is made and then again as soon as possible afte r the senate takes up the bill after having agreed to the motion to proceed can the bills supporters secure the 60 votes needed to agree to the first cloture motion on the motion to proceed or is more than one attempt necessary before the sena votes for cloture on the motion similarly does the sena adopt the first cloture motion on the bill itself or is cloture invoked on the bill only on second or subsequent attempt can the senate agree by unanimous consent to expedite the process by providing for votes on cloture before the time specified in rule xxii are the bills opponents willing and able to consume the entire 30 hour period for postcloture consider ation of the motion to proceed and also the same amount of time for postcloture consideration of the bill after the senate invokes cloture for how many days and for how many hours per day is th senate in session to consider the bill does the senate meet late into the evening or all night or on the weekend in order to consume both 30hour periods more quickly than it otherwise would or can unanimous consent be obtained that the 30hour periods run continuously although the actual time consumed varies from case to case clearly filibusters can create significant delays even when there are 60vote majorities to invoke cloture how much delay the senate experiences depends in part on how much time the senate and especially its majority party leadership is prepared to devote to the bill in question if the bill is particularly important to the nati on and to the majority partys legislative agenda for example the majority leader may be willing to invest the days or even weeks that can be necessary to withstand and ultimately end filibuster another consideration is the point in th annual session and in the biennial life of congress at which filibuster takes place in the first months of the first session for example there may be relatively little business that is ready for senate floor consideration in that case the senate ma be able to endure an extended filibuster without sacrificing its ability to act in timely way on other legi slation toward the end of each sessi on however and especially as the senate approaches sine die adjournment at the end of the second ssion time becomes increasingly scarce and precious every hour and every day of floor time that one bill consumes is time thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs22 is not available for the senate to act on other measures that will die if not enacted into law before the end of the congress therefore the costs of filibusters increase because their effects on the legislative pros pects of other bills become greater and greater even at early stages of congress 30 hours for postcloture consideration is long time for the senate to devote to any single matter in fact the senate never has actually consumed the entire 30hour period for considering any measure or motion under cloture as noted earlier the nate voted in 1985 to reduce from 100 to 30 hours the time permitted for considering matter on which cloture has been invoked this change in rule xxii provoked little if any controversy probably because the senate had never even come very close to consuming the entire 100 hours cutting that time by more than twothirds was not expected to have much practical effect on the ability of senators to delay final floor votes the prospect of filibuster however much effect filibusters have on the operations of the senate perhaps more pervasive effect is attributable to filibusters that have not taken place at least not yet in many instances clot ure motions may be filed not to overcome filibusters in progress but to preempt ones that are only anticipated also the prospect of filibuster often affects when or whether the senate will consider measure on the floor and how the senate will consider it holds senator who does not want the nate to take up certain measure whether temporarily or permanently can m onitor the senate floor and then object if and when the majority leader proposes to call up the bill for consideration the practice of placing holds on measures however has devel oped informally as way for senators to interpose such an objecti on in advance and without having to do so in person on the floor for senator to pl ace hold on bill or resolution is for the senator to request that the majority leader not even try to call up the measure for consideration at least not without giving advance notice to the senator who has placed the hold this request has formal standing in senate rules and is not binding on the leader fundamentally however when senator places the hold he or she is implicitly registering his or her intention to object to any unanimous consent request for the measures consideration in tur n the majority leader and the measures prospective floor manager understand that senator who objects to allowing the bill or resolution to be called up by unanimous consent may back up his or her objection by filibustering motion to proceed to its consideration recent majority leaders have accordingly tended to honor holds both as courtesy to their colleagues and in recognition that if they choose not to do so they may well confront filibusters that they prefer to avoid in this way the threat of filibuster often is sufficient to prevent bill from coming to the senate floor at minimum the bills supporters may discuss with the senators making the threat frequently but not necessarily by placing hold on it whether the bill can be amended in way that satisfies their concerns and removes any danger of filibuster even if the bills proponents are satisfied that they couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs23 invoke cloture on the bill they still may be willing to accept unwelcome amendments to the bill in order to avoid protracted process of floor consideration in fact depending on the importance of the bill and the other measures that await floor action the majority leader may be reluctan t to schedule the bill unless he is assured that the senate can complete action on it without undue delay linkage and leverage as noted above sometimes filibuster or the threat of filibuster can affect the prospects of other bills simply by compelling the senate to devote so much time to the filibustered bill that there is insufficient time available to take up all the other measures that it ot herwise would consider and pass senators also have been known to use their rights under rule xxii to lay action on one bill as leverage to secure the action or inaction they want on another unrelated measure suppose for example that senator opposes s 1 but knows that he or she lacks the support to filibuster against it effec tively senator in this situation may not have enough leverage to prevent senate floor consider ation of s 1 or to secure satisfactory changes in the bill so the senator may seek to increase his or her leverage by delaying or threatening to delay the senates consideration of other bills that are scheduled for floor action before s 1 by threatening to filibuster s 2 s 3 and s 4 for example or by actually dela ying their consideration the senator may strengthen his or her bargaining position by making it clear that more is at stake than the prospects and provisions of s 1 in this way senators opposition to one bill can affect the senates floor agenda in unexpected and unpredictable ways consensus more generally the possibility of filibusters creates powerful incentive for senators to strive for legi slative consensus the votes of only 51 senators are needed to pass bill on the floor it can however require the votes of 60 senators to invoke cloture on the bill in order to overcome filibuster and enable the senate to reach that vote on final passa ge knowing this bills supporters have good reason to write it in way that will attr act the support of at least threefifths of all senators since 1980 neith er party has ever held 60 of all the seats in the senate thus as long as this situation persists every bill that the senate passes must enjoy at least minimal degree of bipartisan acceptance what is more there often are more bills that are ready to be considered on the senate floor than there is time available for acting on them under these circumstances the majority leader may be reluctant especially toward the end of congress even to call up bill unless he can be assured that it will not be filibustered at all the threat of filibuster may be enough to convince the majority leader to devote the senates time to other matters instead even if all concerned agree that the filibuster ul timately w ould not succeed in preventing the senate from passing the bill in such case bills supporters may not be content with securing the support of even 60 senators in the hope of limina ting the threat of filibuster the proponents may try to accommoda the interests of all senators or at least to convince them that good faith effort has been made to assuage their concerns at best opponents can become supporters at worst opponents may remain opposed but may decide against expressing their opposition through filibuster while true consensus on major legislative issues may be impossible the dynamics of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360crs24 senates legislative process do promote efforts to come as close to consensus as the strongly held beliefs of senators permit
