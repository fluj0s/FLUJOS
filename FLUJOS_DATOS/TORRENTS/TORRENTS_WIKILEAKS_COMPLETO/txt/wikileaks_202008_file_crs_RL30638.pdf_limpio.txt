finance government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30638taxexempt bonds description of state and local government debt summary this report provides informa tion about state and local government debt state and local governments often issue debt instruments in exchange for the use of individuals and businesses sa vings this debt obligates state and local governments to make interest payments for the use of these savings and to repay at some time in the future the amount borrowed state and local governments finance capital facilities with debt rather than out of current tax revenue in order to match the time pattern of benefits from these capital facilitie s with the time pattern of tax payments the federal government subsidizes the cost of most state and local debt by excluding the interest income from federa l income taxation this tax exemption of interest income is granted because it is believed that state nd local capital facilities will be under provided if state and local taxpayers have to pay the full cost state and local debt is issued as bonds to be repaid over period of time greater than one year and perhaps exceeding 20 years and as notes to be repaid within one year general obligation bonds are secured by the promise to repay with general tax revenue and revenue bonds are secured w ith the promise to use the stream of revenue generated by the f acility built with the bond proceeds most debt is issued to finance new capital facilities but some is issued to refund prior bond issue usually to take advantage of lower interest rates taxexempt bonds issued for some activities are cl assified as governmental bonds and can be issued without federal constraint because most of the be nefits from the capital facilities are enjoyed by the general public many taxexempt revenue bonds are issued for activities congress has classified as private because most of the benefits from the activities appear to be enjoyed by private indivi duals and businesses the annual volume of subset of these taxexempt privateactivity bonds is capped arbitrage bonds devote substantial shar of the proceeds to the purchase of assets with higher interest rates than that being paid on the taxexempt bonds such arbitrage bonds are not tax exempt because congress does not want state and local governments to issue taxexempt bonds and use the proceeds to earn arbitrage profits the arbitrage profits could substitute for state and local taxes the major policy issue in this area is the effort to use taxexempt bonds to increase federal financial s upport for variety of public facilities another policy issue is whether constraints should be re laxed on the types of activities for which state and local governments can issue tax exempt debt the extent to which the current arbitrage bond rules prohibit what some consider leg itimate state and local financial behavior is related area of dispute the list of activities that classify tax exempt privateactivity bonds and whethe r they should be included in the volume cap is another area of controversy this report will be updated as new data become

bonds description of state and local government debt what is debt individuals and businesses lend their accumulated savings to borrowers in exchange borrowers give lenders debt instrument these debt instruments typically called bonds represent promise by borrowers to pay interest income to lenders on the principal the amount of m oney borrowed until the principal is repaid to the lenders this princi pal sometimes called the proceeds generally is used to finance the construction of capital facilities why do state and local governments issue debt since public capital facilities provide services over long period of time it makes financial and economic sense to pay for the facilities over similarly long period of time this is particularly true for state and local governments their taxpayers lay claim to the benefits from these facilities by dint of residency and relinquish their claim to benefits when they move given the demands market oriented society places on labor mobility ta xpayers are reluctant to pay today for state and local capital services to be received in the future the rational response of the state or local official concerned with satisfying the preferences of constituents is to match the timing of the payments to the flow of services precisely the function served by longterm bond financing an attempt to pay fo r capital facilities up front is likely to result in less than optimal rate of pub lic capital formation state and local governments are also faced with the necessity of planning their budget for the year or in some cases for two years this requires balancing of revenue forecasts against forecasts of the demand for services and spending not infrequently the inevitable unforeseen ci rcumstances that undermine any forecast cause revenue shortfall which must be financed with shortterm borrowing or notes in addition even when the fo recasts are met the timing of expenditures may precede the arrival of revenues creating the necessity to borrow within an otherwise balanced fiscal year finally mporarily high interest rates that prevail at the time bonds are issued to finan ce capital project may induce shortterm borrowing in anticipation of drop in rates thus state and local governments have va lid reasons to borrow funds in fact these reasons are so universally accepted that both taxpayers and the courts havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30638crs2 1 dennis zimmerman history of municipal bonds in his the private use of taxexempt bonds controlling the public subsidy of private activity washington the urban institute press 1991 pp 1727ignored the nineteenth century legacy of unrealistically restrictive constitutional and statutory limitations on state and local borrowing1 what makes state and local debt special the federal government has chosen to intervene in the public capital market by granting the debt instruments of state nd local governments unique privilege the exemption of interest income earne d on these bonds from federal income tax the tax exemption lowers the cost of capital for state and local governments which should then induce an increas in state and local capital formation the lower cost of capital arises because investors would be indifferent between taxable bonds eg corporate bonds that yield 10 rate of return before taxes and taxexempt bonds of equivalent risk that yield 65 retu rn the taxable bond interest earnings carry tax liability 35 of the interest income in most cases making the after tax return on the two bonds identical at 65 thus state and local governments could raise capital from investors at an interest co st 35 percentage points 350 basis points lower than borrower issuing taxable debt generally the degree to which taxexempt debt is favored is measured in two ways the yield spread is the difference between interest rate on corporate bonds and the interest rate on municipa l bonds of equivalent risk table 1 lists the average yield on highgrade municipal bonds and aaarated corporate bonds from 1980 to 2007 and the corresponding yield spread the spread grew to high of 343 in 1980 and dropped to low of 094 in 2003 the greater the yield spread the greater is the nominal savings to state and local governments as measured by the interest rates they would have to pay if they financed with taxable debt as the spread approaches zero state and local borrowing costs approach the level of taxable bond interest rates another measure the yield ratio which is an average rate on taxexempt bonds divided by an average rate on corporate bond of like term and risk adjusts the spread for the level of interest rates the lower the ratio the greater the savings to state and local governments relative to taxabl debt as the ratio approaches one the cost of taxexempt state and local borrowing approaches that of taxable borrowing as shown in table 1 the ratio was lowest in 1980 at 071 and reached peak of 084 in 1982 for the last decade the ratio has been relatively stable these variations in the cost of state and local borrowing relative to the cost of taxable borrowing depend upon the demand fo r and supply of both taxexempt and taxable bonds demand for taxexempt bonds depends upon the number of investors their wealth statutory tax rates and lternative investment opportunities supply depends upon the desire of the state and cal sector for capital facilities and their ability to engage in conduit financing issu ing state or local government bonds and passing the proceeds through to businesses or individuals for their private usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30638crs3 almost all of the factors which influence demand and supply are affected by federal tax policy table 1 yield on taxexempt and corporate bonds of

president february 2008 table b73httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30638crs4 2 the decision about preferred alternatives is critical to estimates of the revenue loss from taxexempt bonds an entire range of financial nd real assets exists with different yields risk and degree of preferential taxation it is not true that the municipal bond purchasers preferred alternative is always taxable bond 3 these estimates are derived by summing the revenue loss estimates for each activity listed in the tax expenditures budget technically th is is incorrect because each activitys revenue loss is calculated in isolation and there are in teractive effects nonetheless without an estimate of the interactive effects impact on revenue loss the summing employed here provides the best available order of magnitudewhat does tax exemption cost the federal government the direct cost to the federal government of this interest exclusion is the individual and corporate inco tax revenue forgone c onsider 35 marginal tax rate corporate investor who purchases 65 taxexempt bond with principal of 1000 that is to be repaid after 20 years each year for 20 years this taxpayer receives 65 in taxexempt interest inco each year the federal government forgoes collecting 35 of revenue because the revenue loss is based upon the yield the taxpayer forgoes for example if the investor had purchased taxable bond carrying 10 interest rate he would have received 100 in interest income and paid 35 in income taxes on that income2 the annual federal revenue loss or tax expenditure on the outstanding stock of taxexempt bonds is reported in the analytical perspectives section of the budget every year the estimates for the last 14 years are displayed in table 2 3 because they are based upon the outstanding stoc k of publicpurpose taxexempt bonds it takes time for some legisla tive changes to show up in these data the amount of forgone tax revenue from the exclusion of interest income on publicpurpose

budget of the united states government various yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30638crs5 why does the federal government subsidize state and local debt when first introduced in 1913 the fede ral income tax excluded the interest income earned by holders of the debt obligations of states and their political subdivisions from taxable income it was sserted by many that any taxation of this interest income would be unconstitutional because the exemption was protected by the tenth amendment and the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity the us supreme court rejected this claim of constituti onal protection in 1988 in south carolina v baker 485 us 505 1988 although the legal basis for the subsidy is statutory rather than constitutional the policy reason for the subsidy is economic economic theory suggests that certain types of goods and services will not be pr ovided in the correct or optimal amounts by the private sector because some of the benefits are consumed collectively street light for example the nations welfare can be increased by public provision of these goods and services and some of these public goods and services are best provided by state or local governments however some of the goods and services provided by state or local governments be nefit both residents who pay taxes and nonresidents who pay minimal if any taxes since state and local taxpayers are likely to be unwilling to provide these services to nonresidents without compensation it is probable that state and local services will be under provided in theory the cost reduction provided by the ex emption of interest income compensates state and local taxpayers for benefits provi ded to nonresidents and encourages these governments to provide the op timal amount of public services classifying state and local debt instruments state and local debt can be classified based on 1 the maturity or term which is the length of time before the principal is repaid 2 the type of security which is the financial backing for the debt 3 the use of the proceeds for either new facilities or to refinance previouslyi ssued bonds and 4 whether the type of activity being financed has public or private purpose another important factor is the level risk just about every bond issued by state or local government is rated based on the probability of default the privately managed rating agencies incorporate all of the above factors as well as th financial health of the entity issuing the bonds when arriving upon bond rating the higher the default risk the lower the rating maturity shortterm vs longterm tax and revenue anticipation notes state and local governments must borrow money for long periods of time and for short periods of time longterm debt instruments are usually referred to as bonds and carry matur ities in excess of one year shortterm debt instruments ar usually referred to as notes and carry maturities of 12 months or less if the notes are to be paid from

blishes the new ars rate all bidders receive that rate unique features of arss arss typically have call option where the issuer can buy the ars back at par face value at any scheduled auction and then retire the debt most arss are in sured by the issuer because they do not carry put option that would allow bondholders to sell the bonds at specified price to the issuer or designated third party the bond insurance reduces risk and thus interest rate making the bonds less costly to issuers for this reason arss are very sensitive to changes in credit ra tings and normally require the highest ratings eg aaaaaa to make them marketable this is usually achieved with bond insurance4 failed auction the existing holders of arss offer bids as well as new bidders if all bids of both existing bond holders and new participants fail to clear the market the auction is termed failed auction in this scenario the original agreement with bondholder stipulat reservation interest rate the issuer must pay in the event of failed auction at leas t until the next successful auction the reservation rate is typically significantly higher than current market interest rates because the rate is higher than market inte rest rates issuers of arss wish to avoid paying the reservation rate growth of arss the issuance of arss has grown considerably in the last 20 years in 1988 the bond buyer identified one

equipment could be leased from vendor us ing rental agreement or an installmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30638crs9 sales contract under this ty pe of agreement the monthl payments to the vendor are

bonds longterm taxexempt bond issues also can be characterized by their status as new issues or refunding issues new issu represent bonds issued to finance new capital facilities refunding s usually are made to replace outstanding bonds with bonds that carry lower interest rates or othe r favorable terms as such the refunding bonds usually do not add to the stock of out standing bonds or the capital stock the proceeds of the refunding bonds are used to pay off the remaining principal of the original bond issue which is retired advance refunding bonds however do add to the outstanding stock of bonds without addi ng to the stock of capital advance refunding bonds are issued prior to the da on which the original bonds are refunded so that for period of time there are two bond issues outstanding to finance the same capital facilities the last two columns of table 4 show the dollar value of refunding issues and their share of total longterm bond volume the share varies widely depending to great extent on changes in the relative magnitudes of taxable and taxexempt interest rates note that the 1993 increase in the top marginal individual income tax rates may have increased the demand for taxexempt bonds higher tax rates make taxexempt bonds more attractive relative to taxable bonds all other things being equal the increased demand and accomp anying lower interest rates may have prompted state and local governments to replace outstanding issues with refunding bonds that carried lower interest rates in contrast refunding s dropped considerably in 1999 and 2000 the decline could have been in response to higher interest rates or to strong economic conditions in most states which minimized the need for debt finance generally the story is reve rsed from 2001 to 2003 as the economy slowed and state budgets were strained by lower ta x revenue collections new issues in 2003 were more than double the amount of new issues in 2000 in 2005 go bonds and refunding bond volume peaked likely reflecting the historically low interest rates on taxexempt debt see table 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30638crs10 public purpose vs private purpose an important characteristic of taxexem pt bonds is the purpose or activity for which the bonds are issued most of the tax legislation pertaining to taxexempt bonds over the last 30 years reflects an ffort to restrict tax exemption to bonds issued for activities that satisfy some broa dly defined public purpose that is for which federal taxpayers are likely to r eceive substantial be nefits bonds are considered to be for public purpose if they satisfy either of two criteria less than 10 of the proceeds are used directly or indirectly by nongovernmental entity or less than 10 of the bond proceeds are secured directly or indirectly by property used in trade or business bonds that sa tisfy either of these tests are termed governmental bonds and can be issued w ithout federal limit bonds that fail both of these tests are termed privateac tivity bonds pabs because they provide significant benefits to private individuals or businesses these projects are ineligible for taxexempt financing activities which fail the two tests but are considered to provide both public and private benefits have been termed eligible or qualified pabs these selected activities can be financed with taxexempt bonds table 5

arbitrage bonds many individuals and businesses make money by engaging in arbitrage borrowing money at one intere st rate and lending that borrowed money to others at higher interest rate the difference betw een the rate at which one borrows and the rate at which one lends produces arbitrage earnings at its most basic level it is the primary activity of commercial banks pay depositors an interest rate of x and use the deposits to make commercial automobile and home loans at x interest rate in this context arbitrage is timehonored and appropria financial market activity that is not the case in the taxexempt bond market state and local governments do not pay federal income tax and absent federal constraint have unlimited capacity to issue debt at low intere st rates and reinvest the bond proceeds in higheryielding taxable debt instruments thereby earning arbitrage profits unchecked state and local governments could substitute arbitrage earnings for substantial portion of their own citizens tax efforthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30638crs15 11 26 irc section 148a 12 for more detailed explanation of tax credit bonds or qzabs see crs report rs20606 tax credit bonds brief explanation by steven maguire 13 119 stat 594 14 119 stat 994congress has decided that such arbitr age should be limited and that taxexempt bond proceeds must be used as quickly as possible to pay contractors for the construction of the capital facilities for which the bonds were issued since it is impossible for bonds to be issued precisely when contractors must be paid for their expenses incurred in building public capital facilities the tax law provides threeyear period to spend an increasing sh are of the bond proceeds bond issues that have unspent proceeds in excess of the llowed amounts during this threeyear spend down schedule must rebate any arbitrage ear nings to the department of the treasury bond issues are considered to be taxable arbitrage bonds if governmental unit in violation of the arbitrage restriction in th tax code invested substantial portion of the proceeds to acquire higher yielding i nvestments or to replace funds which were used directly or indirectly to ac quire higher yielding investments11 what are tax credit bonds the 1997 taxpayer relief act created ne w category of tax preferred state and local bonds the qualified zone academy bond qzab for renovating public school facilities congress authorized qzab debt of 400 million year for 1998 through 2005 or 32 billion over the eight years the annual limit is allocated among the states in proportion to their share of all individuals below the poverty line12 in 2005 congress created two new ty pes of tax credit bonds called clean renewable energy bonds crebs and gu lf tax credit bonds gtcbs crebs were created with the enactment of the energy policy act of 2005 pl 1095813 the bonds are intended to encourage the velopment of renewable energy sources as with qzabs purchasers of crebs receive federal tax credits in lieu of interest payments and the borrower only repays th principal the total creb bond volume is limited to 800 million nationally and the bonds must be issued before january 1 2008 only 500 million may be allocated to qualified proj ects of qualified borrowers which ar governmental bodies14 in addition third party must spend at least 10 of the proceeds of the issu for the bond to qualify the third party would likely be private business or i ndividual that would benefit from the creb expenditures after hurricane katrina congress creat ed yet another tax credit bond called gulf tax credit bonds gtcbs these tax credit bonds are different from the others in that the maturity is capped at two years and only three states can issue limited amount alabama 50 million l ouisiana 200 million and mississippi 100 million the tax credit ra will approximate the in terest rate on equivalent twoyear taxable securities in additi on gtcbs require an equal match from the issuing state the proceeds from the bonds can be used to pay principal interest orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30638crs16 premiums on state governmental bonds or make loans to any political subdivision of the state to then be used to pay principal interest or premiums on the political subdivisions governmental bonds th bonds can only be issued in 2006 the subsidy for tax credit bonds is not pr ovided in the form of the exemption of interest income from fede ral income tax as is true for taxexempt bonds including bonds issued for public elementary and sec ondary education fac ilities rather the subsidy for them is credit taken by eligible financial institutions against the federal taxes they owe the credit rate is calculated by the treasury department such that the bonds can be issued without discount and without any interest cost to the issuer unlike qzabs where issuers are chosen by the state issuers of crebs are selected by the secretary of treasury for gtcbs the governor of the issuing state designates the use of the bond proceeds one way to think of this alternative subsidy is that financial institutions can be induced to purchase these bonds if they recei ve the same aftertax return from the tax credit bonds that they would from the tax exemption the value of the credit must be included in taxable income but is then used to reduce regular or alternative minimum tax liability assuming the taxpayer is subject to the regular corporate income tax the credit rate should equal the ratio of th purchasers forgone market interest rate on taxexempt bonds divided by one minus th corporate tax rate for example if the taxexempt interest rate is 6 and the corporate tax rate is 35 the credit rate would be equal to 0061 035 or about 92 thus financial institution purchasing 1000 tax credit bond would receive 92 tax credit for each year it holds the bond the implicit subsidy is much greater for tax credit bonds than for taxexempt bonds all of the interest costs for tax cr edit bonds are paid by the federal taxpayer for taxexempt bonds the federal taxpayer absorbs only the difference between the taxable and taxexempt interest rates for example if the taxable rate is 92 and the taxexempt rate is 6 the nontax credit bond receives subsidy equal to 32 percentage points the difference between 92 and 6 the tax credit bond receives subsidy equal to ll 92 percentage points the relationship between three types of bonds all with the same aftertax yield of 6 is presented in table 8 the most important column is the last titled implicit subsidy to borrower which is synonymous with th federal revenue loss presented in table 2 for all outstanding taxexempt debt the implicit subsidy is the amount the borrower saves because of favorab federal tax treatment in the case of tax credit bonds the subsidy is consider ably greater than with traditional tax exempt bondshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30638crs17 table 8 comparison of three types of bonds with

the federal government receives some additional tax revenue because the credit is included in taxable income however the loss in reve nue from the credit exceeds the revenue gain producing the negative revenue effect legislative issues current legislative interest focuses on altering the tax treatment of state and local debt to provide even greater financ ial support for variety of public projects such as education infrastructure healthcare facilities and rapid transit there are several ways the federal government can increase the federal subsidy to state and local governments that issue taxexempt bonds for these targeted purposes one arbitrage rules could be loosened to allow the state or local government to earn more investment income on unused bond proceeds less stringent arbitrage rules may also reduce the compliance burden of some smaller government entities freeing more funds for the project two the federal gove rnment can change the rules for private activities that qualify for taxexempt financing if more activities qualified to use taxexempt debt finance by virtue of any proposed rules changes previous congressional efforts to limit the use of taxexempt debt for nongovernmental projects would be mitigated third cong ress could introduce new type of tax favored instrument such as tax cred it bonds for broader range of activities in addition to the three options highlig hted above many other methods can be employed to enhance the federal subsidy for state and local government capital formation the desire to subsidize stat and local capital formation which in many cases may be justified must be weighed against the federal revenue loss and the potential for misallocation of federal tax revenuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30638crs18 suggested
