affairs defense and trade division nepal background and us relations summary the threeway contest for control of nepal among king gyanendra coalition of seven parties seeking democracy for the country and the maoists ended with the king relinquishing power to the democrats in april 2006 after large scale popular demonstrations against him king gyanendras inability to subdue the maoist insurgency and his repression of prodemocratic elements in the country undermined his legitimacy and led to his fall from power the united states sought to assist the government of nepal in its struggle against the maoist armed insurgency and has promoted the democratic development of nepal it has also sought to promote stability in nepal to keep it from becoming destabilizing element in the region this shift of power from monarchy to democracy was followed in november 2006 by peace agreement between the maoists and the new government which led to the laying down of arms parliament that includes maoists and the scheduling of elections for constituent assembly the constituent assembly is to address the question of whether the king is to have place in the future government of nepal and if so to what extent the constituent assembly is also expected to act on calls for nepal to become republic and redraw constituencies to more equitably represent the nepali people particularly in the terai in southern nepal which experienced much unrest in 2007 landlocked himalayan kingdom between india and china nepal ranks among the worlds poorest countries in 1990 following democratization movement it became parliamentary democracy under constitutional monarch although this led to process of economic restructuring and market liberalization the countrys economic growth and reform effort was undercut by political instability and years of increasingly dire internal security challenges brought on by the civil war with the maoists compounding the countrys difficulties was the june 2001 tragedy in which ten members of the royal family including king birendra were killed in an assassinationsuicide reportedly carried out by crown prince dipendra nepal has long way to go before its democratic gains can be effectively consolidated the need to more fully integrate the maoists into the political process and ensure that they or any splinter groups do not resort to the force of arms or coercion in the leadup to the constituent assembly elections remains key challenge in addition mounting political tension over madhesi calls for greater representation in the political process will demand attention the madhesis are an indigenous ethnic group that inhabit the lowlands of nepal who feel they have not been fairly represented some madhesi demonstrations have turned violent the need to develop the economy and bring prosperity to the people will remain whatever the outcome of the constituent assembly election contents overview 1 recent developments 1 new unrest 4 the united nations

thirdlargest party in parliament did not oppose the kings direct rule and is outside the government according to one source the maoists appear to be the most organized political force in the country and the seven party alliance has history of bickering among themselves weakness that both the maoists and the royalists would be quick to crs3 exploit4 for these reasons as well as mounting protests in the south nepal has yet to consolidate the significant moves towards peace and democracy that have transpired over the past year there is also growing concern that the constituent assembly election be held as soon as possible poor security situation particularly in rural areas has hindered voter registration which was to have been completed by may 2007 for the scheduled june election unrest in the terai including demands for greater political representation in parliament remains unresolved the maoists have stated that the failure to hold the constituent assembly election in june ended the basis for their participation in the government commission looking into the delineation of constituencies has also recommended the expansion of the number of constituencies from the planned 425 in the interim constitution to total of 4965 on january 15 2007 83 maoist parliamentarians out of total of 330 members of parliament assumed their seats in accordance with the terms of the november peace agreement the nepali congress has 85 seats while the cpn uml has 83 seats6 this led to further hope that the maoists are serious in their decision to set aside their armed struggle for power and will now seek power through democratic means7 maoist leader prachanda who has not taken seat in parliament addressed maoist rally in february 2007 and called for nepal to become republic he also expressed concern that the constituent assembly elections may be delayed if the elections are delayed beyond the deadline we should straight away declare nepal federal democratic republic8 under the previously negotiated agreement it is up to the constituent assembly to decide the fate of the king and disposition of the government in poll released in february 2007 432 of nepalis surveyed believed there was place for the monarchy in nepal while nearly 45 said there should be place for the monarchy9 under the comprehensive peace agreement of november 2006 the political parties and the maoists agreed that

stability of nepal stems from number of groups representing madhesis of the terai region in southern nepal madhesis are culturally and ethnically close to peoples of northern india there have been allegations from inside nepal that hindu radicals may have had role in the violence in the terai14 two maoist splinter groups are thought to be fomenting violence in the terai by attacking police stations and sponsoring strikes while other groups unrelated to the maoists have also been using violent means such as blockade of customs stations and transport strikes to attract attention to their cause and put pressure on the government to address their concerns madhesis have complained about their under representation in parliament the government police and army as well as economic discrimination against them15 the madhesis or plains folk seek autonomy to free themselves from what they feel is domination by pahadis from the more mountainous parts of northern nepal the united

nepal appears to be emerging from political struggle between monarchists the political parties and maoists all of whom have been vying for control of the country the madhesis of the terai have added new dimension to nepals struggle for political stability the maoists have set aside the military path to power at least for the time being and are now seeking to gain power through constituent assembly in this way they seek to achieve politically what they have been unable to gain on the battlefield19 the kings takeover after seizing direct power in february 2005 king gyanendra exerted control over democratic elements but made little progress in the struggle against the maoists the king reportedly thought he could take advantage of split in the maoist leadership and disarray amongst democrats to seize control and use the royal nepal army to defeat the maoists20 the seizure of power by the king appears to have been aimed as much if not more so at asserting the kings control over democrats many observers felt that military solution to the conflict with the maoists was not achievable and that concerted effort by the king and the democrats was needed to establish unified front to defeat the maoists21 when the king assumed power he stated that he would take steps to reinstate constitutional democracy within 100 days which he then failed to do while some political prisoners were released by the king hundreds of others remained under arrest and restrictions on civil liberties such as public assembly and freedom of the press remained in place office of the high

democrats who under different circumstances could have worked with the king against the maoists the king strengthened the position of the maoists by some estimates almost half of the rna was occupied with palace security civil administration and efforts to restrict communications and civil rights23 the kings legitimacy with the people was weakened due to the circumstances under which he assumed the throne the way he seized direct rule and due to poor popular perceptions of his prince paras shah24 maoist reaction from february 1327 2005 the maoists reacted to the kings actions by blockading major highways linking the countrys 75 districts as well as international road links to india and china25 this led to clashes between maoists and the rna and reportedly brought trade by road to standstill the army organized armed convoys which allowed limited trade to continue26 the maoists had earlier cut off land routes to kathmandu in august 200427 during the weeklong blockade in 2004 prices of some basic foods more than doubled and fuel was rationed28 this increase in food prices reportedly recurred in the 2005 blockade by blockading kathmandu the maoists successfully increased pressure on the kings government the context of the kings takeover the security situation in nepal deteriorated after the collapse of the ceasefire between the maoists and the government on august 27 2003 the maoists favored drafting new constitution that would abolish the monarchy the king opposed such move and wanted the maoists to relinquish their weapons accommodation between the king and democratic elements had been thought to be key to creating the unified front necessary to defeat the maoists with his direct assumption of powers and arrest of opposition democratic elements the king

americans and americanaffiliated organizations from maoist insurgents31 key country issues governance nepal the worlds only officially hindu country has been an independent kingdom since 1768 never colonized the country was almost totally isolated from outside influence until the early 1950s transition from strict rule by the king to constitutional monarchy began in 1959 when thenking mahendra issued new constitution and held the countrys first democratic elections in 1960 however the king declared the parliamentary system failure dismissed the fledgling government suspended the constitution and established partyless system of rule under the monarchy although officially banned political parties continued to exist and to agitate for return to constitutional democracy in february 1990 student groups and the major political parties launched the movement for the restoration of democracy the centrist nepali congress nc party joined with the leftist parties to hold peaceful demonstrations in nepals few urban centers in april 1990 after more than 50 people were killed when police fired on crowd of demonstrators thenking birendra turned power over to an interim government this government drafted constitution in november 1990 establishing nepal as parliamentary democracy with constitutional monarch as head of state the king at that time retained limited powers including the right to declare state of emergency with the approval of twothirds majority of parliament the kathmandu government faced additional turmoil in june 2001 when crown prince dipendra reportedly shot and killed his parents king birendra and queen aishwarya seven other members of the royal family and himself after disagreement over whom he should marry king gyanendra the former kings brother was crowned on june 4 and he appointed commission to investigate the assassination by midjune the country began returning to normal following rioting and widespread refusal to believe

instability and his governments failure to deal with the growing maoist insurgency he was replaced by nc leader sher bahadur deuba who then became the head of nepals eleventh government in as many years constitutional crisis during the summer of 2002 the government of nepal was thrown into constitutional crisis that many argue interfered with its ability to effectively combat the maoist insurgency the crisis began in late may when king gyanendra at the request of the prime minister dissolved parliament and unilaterally declared threemonth extension of emergency rule which had expired on may 24 the prime minister who also scheduled early elections for november 2002 reportedly took such action after his centrist nepali congress party refused to support his plan to extend emergency rule following the prime ministers actions 56 former members of parliament filed lawsuit against him claiming there was constitutional precedent for the dissolution of parliament during emergency rule in august the supreme court rejected this lawsuit although opponents of the prime minister agreed to accept the verdict they emphasized the difficulty of holding free and fair elections two years ahead of schedule when much of the country was under either rebel or army control32 meanwhile these events effectively split the nepali congress into two factions first the nepali congress party nc led by former prime minister koirala expelled deuba from the party for three years for his unilateral actions then in midjune prime minister deuba called an nc convention that overturned his expulsion and elected him rather than koirala as nc president supporters of koirala however argued that the nc convention led by deuba who was an expelled party member at the time was invalid in september nepals election commission ruled that koirala was the president of the nc and therefore his faction was authorized to use the partys name and emblems in the november elections in accordance with the election commissions ruling that allowed it one week to apply under new party name the deubaled faction registered as the nepali congress democratic party on september 2333 given that almost 60 of nepal is illiterate use of the nc emblems could be significant advantage for the koirala faction in future elections on the other hand some observers speculate that the ruling party split may benefit the nepal communist partyunited marxist and leninist ncp uml party the countrys second largest34 although the prime minister pledged that there would be emergency rule during the scheduled november

which urged the government to open dialogue with the maoists argued that by curbing civil liberties emergency rule would inhibit free and fair elections as an alternative the government announced in september that it would hold the elections in six stages over two months starting in midnovember so that government troops could be transferred around the country to protect voters and candidates35 after further deliberation however nepals cabinet concluded that the security situation was too risky to hold elections on october 3 the cabinet asked king gyanendra to postpone the national elections for one year36 the next day the king dismissed the prime minister disbanded his cabinet and assumed executive powers maoist insurgency in february 1996 the leaders of the underground communist party of nepal maoist launched peoples war in the midwestern region of nepal with the aim of replacing the constitutional monarchy with oneparty communist regime the uprising appears to have been fueled by widespread perceptions of government corruption and failure to improve the quality of life of citizens including providing access to cultivable land the maoists have run parallel government setting up their own tax system burning land records and redistributing seized property and food to the poor in 45 districts37 the insurgency was waged in part through torture killings and bombings targeting police and public officials string of bank robberies combined with revolutionary tax revenue made the nepali maoists among the wealthiest rebel groups in asia with up to 128 million in net receipts38 shortly after prime minister deuba took office in july 2001 the nepali government and the maoists announced truce and began peace talks the following month after three rounds of promising discussions talks broke down over the maoists demand that the monarchy be eliminated on november 23 2001 the maoists broke the ceasefire with coordinated attacks on army and police posts three days later king gyanendra declared state of emergency which allowed the royal nepal army rna then at strength of 53000 to join the police in fighting the insurgents the poorly trained largely ceremonial rna however was unable to stem the increasing maoist violence the state of emergency was extended for three months in february and again in may 2002 the government also passed the terrorist and disruptive

nepal was plunging deeper into massive human rights crisis with arbitrary arrests censorship and general repression with suspended fundamental constitutional rights including the freedom of assembly political developments since the kings handover of power have raised hopes that the human rights situation in nepal will improve the economy nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world up to 90 of its inhabitants earn living through agriculture which accounts for significant percentage of the countrys gross domestic product only 20 of the land is arable major crops include rice wheat maize jute sugarcane and potatoes continued reliance on subsistence farming could keep nepal poor for many years to come though the industrial base is small nepal produces carpets garments and increasingly textiles which now account for majority of merchandise exports other major revenue sources are tourism and remittances from nepals famed gurkha soldiers serving in the british and indian armies government efforts to increase foreign trade and investment have been impeded by political instability the resistance of vested interests the small size of the economy and its remoteness the lack of infrastructure and technological development and frequent natural disasters including floods and landslides hydroelectric potential may be nepals most attractive asset in the eyes of investors nepal and india have completed several joint irrigationhydroelectric projects and in 2001 the kathmandu government implemented hydropower policy that opened the entire sector to private investment number of factors including lack of capital high transportation costs environmental and social impact concerns and political impediments continue to hamper nepals hydropower potential leaving only 15 of the

although nepal has sought to maintain friendly relations with both neighbors its cultural linguistic religious and economic ties with india historically have been much closer than those with china despite this recent moves by the king have strained relations with new delhi and opened the prospect of closer relations with china nepal is heavily dependent on india as the primary source of imports the main market for exports and for access to the sea through the major port of calcutta moreover the himalayan mountain range along nepals northern border limits access to china whereas the 500mile

new delhi has viewed nepali instability as potential catalyst for the destabilization of indias own troubled northeastern states47 maoist success in nepal may also have negative impact on indias maoist problem48 at the same time the nepali leadership has long resented indian economic influence and has sought to establish more independent foreign policy kathmandu has at times played the china card in seeking to counterbalance what it considers undue pressure from india in recent years beijing has contributed significant economic aid to nepal and has pledged political and moral support for nepals fight against the maoist insurgency which it denounces as misusing the ideas of chairman mao zedong some observers have noted that nepals stability is important to china given that it serves as
