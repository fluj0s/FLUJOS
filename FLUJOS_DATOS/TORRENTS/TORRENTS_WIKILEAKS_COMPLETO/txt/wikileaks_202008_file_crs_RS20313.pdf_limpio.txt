legislative process government and finance division special rules and the amending process special rule is house resolution intende d to regulate floor consideration of specific legislative measure named in the re solution when adopted by the house the requirements prescribed by special rule can supersede the standing rules of the house as well as rulemaking provisions in statutes such as the congressional budget act but only in application to the measure named sp ecial rules serve two key functions 1 to enable the house to consider specified measure and 2 to establish terms for considering it including any modifications of the amending process this report concerns one specific set of modifications commonly referred to as queenofthehill rule the amending process normally does not llow for amendments that would amend text that has already been amended as result once substitute for the full text of measure has been adopted further amendmen ts are in order since any would constitute attempts to reamend amended text however special rules occasionally provide that an amendment be in order notw ithstanding the adoption of previous amendment such structure can be used to afford the house the opportunity to vote in succession on each of several competing alternatives for the same text for more information on legislative process see httpwwwcrsgov productsguidesguidehomeshtml typically when queenofthehill structure has been used any substitutes made in order are not themselves subject to further amendment in some instances however such as with the hres 442 for considering hr 2183 the campaign finance reform bill in the 105th congress amendments in the nature of substitutes to bill that are made in order as part of queenofthehill structure may be subject to amendment as well kingofthehill predecessor to queenofthehill beginning in 1981 the house rules committee developed standard form for special rules that would provide structure for the house to consider series of alternative amendments to the same text these rules were called kingofthehill rules because they provided that if more than one alternative were dopted the last one that secured majority vote would be the one cons idered as finally adopted initially kingof thehill rules were used infrequently only three times in the 97th congress and twice inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs203131 one additional kingofthehill rule was adopted in the 103rd congress but the measure made in order was not considered by the house in some cases although special rule allowed for kingofthehill structure one or more of the alternatives made in order were not offered 2 in two of these cases the last alternative adopted was also the one that received the most votes in one other instance motion to recommit allowed for amendment language which had been adopted and superseded under kingofthehill provision to be readoptedthe 98th congress and many often associated them with considering amendments in the nature of substitute for the concurrent resolution on the budget however over time kingofthehill rules came to be used somewhat more frequently peaking at 19 kingof thehill structures in 15 special rules in the 101st congress out of total of 115 special rules adopted for the consideration of bills and resolutions and for wider variety of measures special rules could also incorporate one or more kingofthehill structures for considering alternatives for portions of meas ure such as single title or section for example hres 435 and hres 436 100th congress incorporated 10 separate kingof thehill structures for considering alternativ to different provisions in hr 4264 the department of defense aut horization in all betw een 1981 and 1994 88 kingofthehill structures were provided in 63 special rules1 because kingofthehill rules provided that only the last alternative to secure major ity vote would be considered as adopted the perception developed that the order in wh ich amendments could be offered had significant effect on outcomes however mo re than one alternativ was adopted in only small number of instances in 81 of the 88 kingofthehill structures identified one or none of the alterna tives were adopted2 queenofthehill beginning in 1995 the rules committee has ccasionally used m odified form for special rules allowing multiple alternatives to be voted on regardless of the results of any previous votes in this modification if more than one alternative obtains majority the one that is considered as finally adopted is the one that receives the greatest number of votes these rules have been termed queenofthehill or most votes wins rules in all other respects the queenofthehill structure works in the same manner as its predecessor the rules committee has reported queenofthehill rules infrequently on three occasions in the 104th congress twice in the 105th congress and once in the 107th congress queenofthehill rules have been reported since the 107th congress table 1 queenofthehill rules congressspecial rulemeasurenumber of alternatives 104thhres 44 hjres 1 balanced budget constitutional amendment 6a 104thhres
