relationshipnato and th european union euwere created in the aftermath of world war ii to deter the soviet threat and to promote prosperity security and stability in europe the us congress and successive us administrations have strongly supported both organizations as means to foster democratic states reliable military allies and strong trading partners many observers stress that the security and prosperity of the united states and europe remain inextricably linked even after the end of the cold war both sides of the atlantic face common set of challenges from countering terrorism and weapons proliferation to ensuring the stability of global financial markets and have few other comparable partners proponents of close us european ties argue that neither the united states nor europe can adequately address such diverse concerns alone and the track record shows that they can accomplish much more when they work together us and european military forces are promoting stability in the balkans afghanistan and iraq us and european law enforcement authorities have sought to intensify police and judicial cooperation since september 11 to root out terrorist cells in europe and elsewhere the united states and the eu also share mutually beneficial increasingly interdependent trade and investment relationship and useu cooperation has been critical in making the world trading system more open and efficient g3g151g561g7g159g152g149g159g146g151g144g561g20g142g149g138g157g146g152g151g156g145g146g153g561 despite common interests and close economic ties the transatlantic partnership has been challenged in recent years by number of trade and foreign policy disputes the 2003 crisis over iraq is most notable but the list of disagreement s has been wide and varied although europeans are not monolithic in their views many european allies have objected to at least some elements of us policy on issues ranging from the middle east to climate change to aircraft subsidies key point of contention running through many recent disputes relates to the role of multilateral institutions and the use of force while many european allies shy away from the use of force and prefer to manage international crises through multilateral institutions the united states views this approach as only one option especially in the postseptember 11 world others also attribute recent tensions to the eus evolution from primarily an economic actor to player in the foreign policy security and defense fields eu members are increasingly assessing foreign policy decisions with an eye toward establishing larger role for europe on the world stage and consult with each other on foreign policy concerns to greater degree than ever before as result washington may not hold quite the same influence over the allies as it once did and eu members are perhaps quicker to challenge us policies with which they do not agree since 2003 however both the united states and eu rope have sought to emphasize areas of cooperation and partnership observers point out that useuropean differences on issues such as iran and the israelipalestinian conflict have narrowed some europeans believe that the united states has come to recognize the limitations of super power and may now increasingly favor

operation in afghanistan isaf is to provide security for the reconstruction of the country but isaf has been increasingly challenged to combat resurgent taliban and remnant qaeda forces key sticking point between the unit ed states and some european allies has been the use of national caveatsrestrictions that some governments have placed on their troops to prevent them from being used in combat operations while some caveats have been reduced others remain and while the united states recently decided to increase its force strength in afghanistan us and nato officials say that some allies are not meeting their troop and equipment commitments some europeans counter that the united states has not devoted sufficient attention or resources to afghanistan since the usled invasion of iraq in 2003 others suggest that nato cannot do both security and reconstruction and are urging the eu to take bigger role in rebuilding afghanistan the eu has established small police training mission of 190 officials in afghanistan but us officials assert that more trainers are needed natoeu cooperation in afghanistan has also been stymied by several disputes between turkey and the eu 1 g11g155g138g154g561 useuropean tensions over iraq have abated but still linger many european leaders claim that failure in iraq is not an option but have been reluctant to engage robustly in reconstruction efforts some european troop contributors have withdrawn or reduced their military forces due to domestic pressure amid ongoing violence in iraq the united states however has had some success in gaining european support to train ir aqi security forces and the eu has launched small mission to train iraqi police administrators and judges primarily outside of iraq the eu and member states have pledged combined total of more than 125 billion for iraqs reconstruction 2 g11g155g138g151g561 over the last few years the bush administration has intensified cooperation with the eu3

its nuclear work despite the release in december 2007 of us national intelligence estimate nie concluding that iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 us and european officials contend that iran remains threat given that it continues to enrich uranium in early march 2008 the united states and the eu3 successfully pressed for another resolution that tightens the monitoring of iranian financial institutions and extends travel bans and asset freezes against iranian individuals and companies involved in the suspected nuclear program analysts assert however that the new resolution is much weaker than original useu3 plans in light of the nie in june 2008 eu leaders agreed to impose additional eu sanctions on iran these include prohibiting irans largest bank from operating in europe and imposing financial and travel restrictions on more iranian experts and companies believed connected to irans nuclear work some eu officials continue to worry that certain provisions in proposed us sanctions legislation aimed at iran such as hr 1400 which passed the house on september 25 2007 could harm european energy companies provoke trade dispute and undermine transatlantic unity on irans

of the israelipalestinian conflict is vital to promoting stability in the region and diminishing the terrorist threat european officials have long urged the bush administration to do more to get israelipalestinian negotiations back on track as such europeans welcomed president bushs decision to hold an international conference in november 2007 aimed at renewing the peace process the annapolis conference resulted in pledge by both sides to work toward final peace agreement by the end of 2008 talks began in december 2007 but press reports speculate that progress has been slow president bush continues to reiterate his commitment to promote political solution by the end of the year the peace process has been complicated by hamas victory in the january 2006 palestinian legislative elections and its takeover of the gaza strip by force in june 2007 following the collapse of the hamasfatah coalition government both the united states and the eu consider hamas terrorist organization and have sought to isolate the group in part by str ongly backing the fatahled palestinian authority emergency government in the west bank headed by moderate president mahmoud abbas however some experts argue that useu efforts to isolate hamas have not worked and some in europe view engagement as better way to try to moderate the group and generate progress in the peace process the eu is the largest donor of foreign aid to the palestinians both the united states and the eu are providing direct aid to the abbasled government in the west bank and humanitarian aid indirectly to the palestinian people in

the absence of hezbollahwhich is backed by syria and iranfrom the eus common terrorist list some eu countries argue that some lebanese consider hezbollah legitimate political force it has members in the lebanese parliament and that adding hezbollah to the eus list would only serve to intensify lebanons political turmoil like the united states the eu has called on syria to end interference in internal lebanese affairs and has largely sought to isolate syrian since the 2005 assassination of former lebanese prime minister in which syrian involvement is suspected both the united states and the eu stress that improved relations are contingent on more constructive syrian role in the region 5 g5g152g158g151g157g142g155g146g151g144g561g22g142g155g155g152g155g146g156g150g561 european countries and the eu have been active partners with the united states in the fight against terrorism in the years since september 2001 several new useu agreements have been concluded on police informationsharing extradition mutual legal assistance container security and exchanging airline passenger data nevertheless some challenges remain for example european opposition to the us death penalty may still impede extradition of terrorist suspects european concerns about us data and privacy protections also persist and at times have complicated useu informationsharing arrang ements many europeans also fear that the united states is losing the battle for muslim hearts and minds as result of the war with iraq and some us practices in combating terrorism for example eu officials believe the detention center at guantánamo bay degrades shared values regarding human rights and disregards international accords on the treatment of prisoners in addition many europeans are concerned about us rendition policy and cia program to detain and question suspected terrorists outside of the united states meanwhile us officials worry that allegations of us wrongdoing and criminal proceedings against cia officials in some eu states may put vital counterterrorism cooperation between us and european intelligence agencies at risk 6

united states from certain countries to be applied to all eu members currently 12 eu members mostly newer ones from central and eastern europe are excluded from the vwp due to problems meeting the programs statutory requirements the united states prefers to address this issue on bilateral basis although some members of congress have expressed skepticism about the vwp in general because of security concerns noting that terrorists with european citizenship have entered the united states on the vwp other members have been more supportive of extending the vwp to new eu members given their roles as us allies in nato and in the fight against terrorism in july 2007 congress passed legislation pl 11053 that includes vwp reforms aimed at strengthening the programs security components and allowing new eu members and other interested states to qualify eu officials remained disappointed noting that some vwp requirements were still set too high to allow all new eu members to qualify in the near term and that new electronic travel authorization system mandated in the legislation could infringe on eu privacy and data protection rights in early 2008 us officials began concluding
