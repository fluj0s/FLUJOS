assessing integrating and managing threats vulnerabilities and consequences summary the homeland security act of 2002 p l 107296 and other administration documents have assigned the department of homeland security specific duties associated with coordinating the nations efforts to protect its critical infrastructure including using risk management approach to set priorities many of these duties have been delegated to what is now called the national pr otection and programs directorate risk assessment involves the integr ation of threat vulnerability and consequence information ri sk management involves deci ding which risk reduction measures to take based on an agre ed upon risk reduction strategy many modelsmethodologies have been developed by which threats vulnerabilities and consequences are integrated to determine ri sks and then used to inform the allocation of resources to reduce those risks for the most part these methodologies consist of the following elements performed more or less in the following order identify assets and identify which are most critical identify characterize and assess threats assess the vulnerability of critical assets to specific threats determine the risk ie the expected consequences of specific types of attacks on specific assets identify ways to reduce those risks prioritize risk reduction measures based on strategy beginning in 2003 the department of homeland security has been accumulating list of infrastructure assets specific sites and facilities from this list the department selects highpriority assets that it judges to be critical from national point of view based on the potentia l consequences associated with their loss the department intends to assess the vulnerability of all the highpriority assets it has identified department officials have described in very general terms that these vulnerability and conse quence assessments are used to determine the risk each asset poses to the nation this risk assessm ent is then used to prioritize subsequent additional protection activities while these statements allude to some of the steps mentioned above they do so only in most general way with its release of the national infrastructure protection plan in june 2006 the departme nt has laid out much more detailed discussion of the risk management methodolog it intends to use or is using the departments efforts to date still raise several questions ranging from the process and criteria used to populat its lists of assets its prioritization strategy and the extent to which the department is coordinating its efforts with the intelligence community and other agencies both internal and external to the department this repor t will be updated as neededhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561contents

costeffective protective measures this report is meant to support congressi onal oversight by discussing in more detail what this task entails and issues that need to be addresse d in particular the report defines terms eg threat vulnerability and risk discusses how they fit together in systematic analysis descri bes processes and tec hniques that have been used to assess them and di scusses how the results of that analysis can inform resource allocation and policy while the directorate was given this task as one of its primary missions similar activities are being undertaken by other ag

should be based strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities later in the next paragraph it stated the allocation of funds s hould be based on an assessment of threats and vulnerabilities in the next paragraph it stated that resources must be allocated according to vulnerabilities the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission report ww norton and

homeland security presidential directive number 7 hspd77 stated that the secretary of homeland secur ity was responsible for coor dinating the overall national effort to identify prioritize and protect critical infrastructure and key resources the directive assigned sector specific agencies8 the responsibility of conducting or facilitating vulnerability assessments of their sector and encouraging the use of risk management strategies to protect against or mitigate the effects of attacks against critical infrastructures or key resources it also required the secretary to produce comprehensive integrated national plan for critical infrastructure and key resources protection9 that national plan was to include strategy and summary of activities to be undertaken to define and prior itize reduce the vulnerability of and coordinate the protec tion of critical infrastru cture and key resources the terms vulnerabilities threats risk integrated and prioritize are used repeatedly in the documents cite d above however none of the documents defined these terms or discussed how they we re to be integrated and used also in hearings articles in the pre ss and other public discourse these terms are used loosely clouding the intent of what is being proposed or discussed10 what might seem trivial differences in definitions can make bi g difference in policy and implementation the following section provides definitions and generic model for integrating them in systematic way httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs4 11 these models and methodologies as does the or iginal version of this report predate the national infrastructure protection plan as is discussed later in this report the national plan incorporates many of the processes and addresses many of the issues identified and discussed in this report some of these thodologies may have been superceded since the original writing of this report 12 carl roper risk management for security professionals butterworthheinemann 1999 generic model for assessi ng and integrating threat vulnerability and risk many modelsmethodologie s have been develope d by which threats vulnerabilities and consequences are assessed and then used to inform the cost effective allocation of resources to redu ce risks for this report crs reviewed vulnerability and risk assessment mode ls or methodologies including some developed and used to varyin g degrees in certain selected sectors electric power ports oil and gas11 these are listed in the reference section of this report in addition this report draws upon informati on contained in book by carl roper entitled risk management for s ecurity professionals 12 essential elements of these modelsmethods have been distilled and ar presented below they may provide some guidance in overseeing dhss methodol ogy as it is developed and employed for the most part each of the met hodologies reviewed consist of certain elements these elements can be divided into asse ssments per and the use of the assessments to make decisions the elements are performed more or less in the following sequence assessments identify assets and identify which are most critical identify characterize and assess threats assess the vulnerability of critical assets to specific threats determine the risk ie the expected consequences of specific types of attacks on specific assets using assessments to identify and prioritize risk reduction activities identify and characterize ways to reduce those risks prioritize risk reduction activities based on risk reduction strategy assessments identifying assets and determining criticality the infrastructure of facility company or an economic sector c onsists of an array of assets which are necessary for the production andor deliver of good or service similarly the infrastructure of city state or nation consis ts of an array of assets necessary for the economic and social activity of the city nd region and the public health and welfare of its citizens the first step in the process is to determine which infrastructure assets to include in the study the american ch emistry council the chlorine institute and the synthetic organic chemical ma nufacturers association in their site security guidelines for the us chemistry industry broadly define assets as people property and information ropers risk management for s ecurity professionals and doeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs5 13 american petroleum institute and the nati onal petrochemical and refiners association security vulnerability assessment methodology for the petroleum and petrochemical industries may 2003 p 4energy infrastructure risk management checklists for small and medium sized energy facilities broadly define assets as people activities and operations information facilities i nstallations and equi pment and materials the methodologies reviewed do not provide definitive list of such assets but suggest which ones might be considered for example people assets may include employees customers andor the surroundi ng community property usually includes long list of physical assets like buildin gs vehicles production equipment storage tanks control equipment raw material s power water communication systems information systems office equipment s upplies etc information could include product designs formulae process data operational data bus iness strategies financial data employee data etc ropers examples of activities and operations assets include such things as intelligence gathering and special training programs many methodologies suggest considering in itially as broad t of assets as is reasonable however not every asset is as importa nt as another in order to focus assessment resources all of the methodologies reviewed suggest that the assessment should focus on those assets judged to be most critical criticality is typically defined as measure of the consequences associated with the loss or degradation of particular asset the more the loss of an asset threatens the survival or viability of its owners of those located nearby or of others who depend on it including the nation as whole the more critical it becomes consequences can be categorized in number of ways economic financial environmental health and safety technological operational and time for example process control center may be essential for the safe production of particular product its loss or inability to func tion properly could result not only in disruption of production with its concomitant loss of re venue and additional costs associated with replacing the lost capability but it might also result in the loss of life property damage or nvironmental damage if th process being controlled involves hazardous materials the loss of an asset might also reduce firms competitive advantage not only because of the financial costs associated with its loss but also because of the loss of technological advantage or loss of unique knowledge or information that would be di fficult to replace or reproduce individual firms too have to worry about loss of re putation the american petroleum institute and the national petrochemical and refiners association apinpra in their security vulnerability assessment methodol ogy for the petroleum and petrochemical industries also suggested considering the possibility of excessive media exposure and resulting public hysteria th at may affect people that may be far removed from the actual event location13 while the immediate impact is important so too is the amount of time and resources required to replace the lost capability if losing the asset results in large immediate disruption but the asset can be re placed quickly and cheaply or there arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs6 14 american petroleum institute op cit p 5 costeffective substitutes the total consequence may not be so great alternatively the loss of an asset resulting in small immediate consequence but which continues for long period of time because of the di fficulty in reconstituting the lost capability may result in much greater total loss another issue which decision makers may c onsider is if the loss of particular asset could lead to cascading effects not only within the facility or the company but also cascading effects that might affect other infrastructures for example the loss of electric power can lead to problems in the supply of safe drinking water the loss of key communications node can imp air the function of atm machines the initial set of assets are categorized by their degree of criticality typically the degree of criticality is assessed qualitatively as high medium or low or some variation of this type of measure however even if assessed qualitatively number of methodologies suggest being specific bout what kind of consequence qualifies an asset to be placed in each category for example the electric utility sector methodology suggests that highly critical asset might be one whose loss would require an immediate response by compan ys board of directors or whose loss carries with it the possibility of offsite fatalities property dama ge in excess of specified amount of dollars or the inte rruption of operations for more than specified amount of time alternatively an asset whose loss results in injuries or shuts down operations for only few da ys may be designated as having low criticality for those sectors not vertically integr ated ownership of infrastructure assets may span number of firms or industries whoever is doing the analysis may feel constrained to consider only those asse ts owned and operated by the analyst or analysts client for example transmission assets whether pipeline electric or communication may not be ow ned or operated by the same firms that produce the commodity being transmitted both the production assets nd the transmission assets however are key elements of the overall infrastructure also firm may rely on the output from specific asset owned nd operated by someone else the user may consider that asset critical but the owner and operator may not some of the methodologies reviewed encourage the analys t to also consider or at least account for the vulnerability of those assets owned or operated by someone else that provide critical input into the system being analyz ed these interdependency problems are often characterized in terms of intersector dependencies eg th reliance of water systems on electric power but they may also exist intrasector the interdependency issue is both technical one ie identifying them and politicallegal one ie how can entity induce entity b to protect an asset identify characterize and assess threat roper and the apinpra define threat as any indica tion circumstance or event with the potential to cause loss or damage to an asset14 roper includes an additional finition the intention andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs7 15 roper op cit p 43 16 this quote is taken from the government accountability office testimony homeland security key elements of risk management approach gao02150t before the subcommittee on national security veterans ffairs and international relations house committee on government reform october 21 2001 it is used in several of the other methodologies reviewed capability of an adversary to undertake acti ons that would be detrimental to us interests15 to be helpful in assessing vulnerability and risk threats need to be characterized in some detail important characteristics include type eg insider terrorist military or environmental eg hurricane tornado intent or motivation triggers ie events that might in itiate an ttack capability eg skills specific knowledge access to materials or equipment thods eg use of individual suicide bombers truck bombs assault cyber and tr ends what techniques have groups used in the past or have experimented with etc information useful to characterizing the threat can come from the intelligence community law enforcement specialists news reports analysis and investigations of past incidents received threats or red teams whose purpose is to think like terrorist threat assessment typically also involves assumptions and speculation since information on specific threats may be scant incomplete or vague once potential threats have been identif ied both generically eg terrorists and specifically eg qaeda and characterized threat assessment estimates the likelihood of adversary ac tivity against given sset or group of assets16 the likelihood of an attack is function of at l east two parameters whether or not the asset represents tempting target based on the goals and motivation of the adversary ie would successful attack on that asse t further the goals and objectives of the attacker and b whether the adversary has the capability to attack the asset by various methods other parame ters to consider include pa st history of such attacks against such targets by the same adversary or by others the availability of the asset as target eg is the location of the ta rget fixed or does it change and how would the adversary know of the targets existe nce or movement etc the assets vulnerability to various met hods of attack determined in the next step may also affect the attractiveness of the asset as target as an example of threat assessment technique the us coast guard using an expert panel made up of coast guard subject matter and risk experts evaluated the likelihood of 12 different attack modes agai nst 50 different potential targets ie 600 scenarios attack modes included boa t loaded with explosives exploding along side docked tank vessel or tank vessel being co mmandeered and intentionally damaged the coast guard also considered scenarios where port assets could be stolen or commandeered and used as w eapon or used to transport terrorists or terrorism materials potential targets in cluded various types of vessels including ferries container facilities water intakes utility pipe lines hazardous materials barges etc the panel of experts judg ed the credibility of each scenario for example using military vessel for transporting terrorists or terrorism materials washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs8 17 roper op cit p 63 18 american petroleum institute op cit p 5 19 federal register department of homeland security coast guard implementation of national maritime security initiatives vol 68 126 july 1 2003 p 39245judged not to be credible given the inherent security measures in place but an external attack on military target was considered credible each credible scenario was assigned one of 5 threat levels repr esenting the perceived probability likelihood of it occurring after considering the hostile groups intent its capabilities prior incidents and any existing intelligence the electricity sectors methodology used checklist which asks for the specific attack mode such as the use of explosives truck bomb or cyber attack and whether it is likely that such an attack w ould be carried out by an individual or b by an assault team of up to five members in this case the analyst is to identify likely targets for each type of attack scenario and the objective that the adversary would achieve by such an attack likelihood can be measured quantitatively by assigning it probability eg an 85 chance of occurring or qualitatively such as very high threat level which might mean there is credible threat with demonstrated capability and it has happened before as with critica lity number of met hodologies suggested specific criteria be used to define what would constitute varying threat levels threat assessment need not be static in time threats ie the likelihood that an adversary may attack may rise and fall over time depending on events anniversary dates an increase in capability or the need for the adversary to reassert itself intelligence may detect activity that indicates preattack activity or lull in such activity or an explicit threat may be made assess vulnerability roper defines vulnerability as weakness that can be exploited to gain access to given asset17 the apinpra expands this definition to include nd subsequent destruction or theft of the asset18 the coast guard defines vulnerability as the conditional probability of success given that threat scenario occurs19 weaknesses like criticality can be categorized in number of ways physical accessibility relative locations visibility toughness strength etc technical susceptible to cyber attack energy rges contamination eavesdropping etc operational policies procedures personal habits or ganizational eg would taking out headquarters severely disrupt operations etc existing countermeasures may already ex ist to address these weaknesses vulnerability assessment must evaluate the reliability and effectiveness of those existing countermeasures in detail for example security guards may provide certain degree of deterrence against unauthorized access to certain asset however to assess their effectiveness number of additional questions ma need to be asked for example how many security guards ar on duty do they patrol or monitorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs9 20 roper op cit p 73 21 federal register op cit p 39245 22 american petroleum institute op cit p 3 23 ibidsurveillance equipment how equipped or well trained are they to delay or repulse an attempt to gain access have they successfully repulsed any attempt to gain unauthorized access vulnerabilities are assessed by the analyst against specific attacks apinpra identifies three steps to assessing vulnerabilities 1 determine how an adversary could carry out specific kind of attack against specifi c asset or group of assets 2 evaluate existing counter measures for their reliability and their effectiveness to deter detect or delay the specific attack and 3 estimate current state of vulnerability and assign it value specific types of attacks can be informed by the preceding threat assessment the coast guard measured vulnerability of potential targets for each attack scenario in four areas 1 is the target available ie is it present andor predictable as it relates to the adversarys ability to plan and operate 2 is it accessible ie how easily can the adversary get to or near the target 3 what are the organic countermeasures in place ie what is the existing security plan communication capabilities intrusion detection systems guard force etc and 4 is the target hard ie based on the targets design complexity and material construction characteristics how effectively can it withstand the attack each of these four vectors were evaluated on level of 1 to 5 with each level corresponding to assigned probability of succe ssful attack by comparis on the electricity sector process measured vulnerability as proba bility that existing countermeasures can mitigate specific attack scenarios eg probability of surviving attack 80 alternatively the analyst can value vulnerability qualitatively for example highly vulnerable asset might be one that is highly attractive as target for which countermeasures currently exist against highly credible threat an asset with low vulnerability might be one that s multiple effective countermeasures assess risk risk implies uncertain consequen ces roper defines risk as the probability of loss or damage and its impact20 the coast guard refers to risk assessment as essentia lly an estimate of the expected losses should specific targetattack scenario occur21 expected loss is determined by multiplying the estimated adverse impact caused by succe ssful threatattack scenario by the probabilities associated with threat and vulnerability apinpra defines risk as function of consequences of successful attack agains t an asset and likelihood of successful attack against an asset22 likelihood is define d as function of the attractiveness of the target to the adversar based on the adversarys intent and the targets perceived value to the adversary degree of threat based on adversarys capabilities and degree of vulnerability of the asset23 an important point is that risk as defined here is discounted measure of conseque nce ie discounted by the uncertainty of what might happe n see the example given belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs10 24 consequences too could be uncertain for example it may be determined that in the above scenario successful attack may cause distribution of possibl deaths between zero and 500 people 25 this formulation assumes that the uncerta inties in this case are independent which in many cases is not accurate the attractiveness of target an element in determining threat may very much depend on its vulnerability likewise the consequence of an attack may also depend on targets vulnerability this complicates the calculation 26 note the risk in this scenario is not 500 people dead but 56 expected deaths that is not to say that if an attack were actually succ essfully carried out only 56 people might die in fact in this scenario it has been judged th at 500 people would likely die choosing to use the 500 potential deaths in subsequent decisions essentially assuming an attack will occur and be successful would be called risk averse in this construct taking risk averse continuedas noted in the first step impact can be categorized in number of ways impact or consequences may be measured mo re precisely at this point in the process however to better inform the prioritization of risk reduction steps that follows the coast guard considered six categories of impact deathinjury economic environmental nationa l defense symbolic effect and secondary national security issues each targetattack scenario meas ured the potential impact in each of these categories on severity scale from 1 to 5 from low to catastrophic the assigned scale value was based on benchmarks the apinpra which used similar construct suggested the following benchmar ks for its severity scale the severity of death and injury varied from high to low depending on whether they occurred off site or onsite and whether they were certain or possible the severity of environmental damage again varied from high to low depending on whether it was large scale spreading offsite or small s cale staying onsite the severity of financial losses or economic disruptions were valued on threshold dollar amounts and timeframes the analyst can also try to measure risk quantitatively for example for specific targetattack scenario the analysis may determine that there is 5050 chance ie we dont know that the adve rsary will try to attack particular government building but if they did th ere is 75 chance that they would use truck bomb ie we are pretty sure that if they attack they would try to use truck bomb if they try use truck bomb the vulnerability assessment determined that they would have 30 chance of succeeding i if they try there is good chance that the current protective measures will prevent them from getting close enough to the building to bring it down the conseque nces of successful attack bringing the building down could be 500 people k illed and 300 million in property damage24 the risk associated with this scenario would be expected loss consequence x proba bility that an attack will occur x conditional probability that the attacker uses truck bomb x the conditional probability that they would be successful25 or 500 people killed 300 million in da mage x 5 x 75 x 3 or risk 56 expected deaths and 338 million in expected damages26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs11 26 continued position is legitimate policy option see further discussion on risk aversion below 27 again dependencies between threat risk nd consequences need to be considered risk is often measured qualitatively eg high medium low since consequences may be measured along numbe r of different vectors and threat and vulnerability have been measured separately qualitative measure of risk must have some criteria for integrating the number of different qualitative measures for example how should the assessm ent decide what risk ratin g to give medium threat against highly vulnerable target that would have low deathinjury impact medium environmental impact but high shortterm financial impact does this scenario equal high medi um or low level of risk using assessments to identify and prioritize risk reduction activities identify ways to reduce risk risks can be reduced in number of ways by reducing threats eg through eliminating or intercepting the adversary before he strikes by reducing vulnerabilities eg harden or toughen the asset to withstand the attack or by reducing the impact or cons equences eg build backups systems or isolate facilities from major populations for each potential countermeasure the benefit in risk reduction s hould also be determined27 more than one countermeasure may exist for particular asset or one countermeasure may re duce the risk for number of assets multiple countermeasures should be assessed together to determine their net effects the analys t should also assess the feasibility of the countermeasure the cost of each counterm easure must also be determined costs too are multidimensional there may be upfront fi nancial costs with ssociated materials equipment installation and training ther are also longer term operational costs of the new protective measures including main tenance and repair there may also be operational costs associated with changes to overall operations costs also include time and impact on staff customers nd vendors etc expenditures on the protection of assets also results in opport unity costs ie costs associated with not being able to invest those resources in something else prioritize and decide in what to invest once set of countermeasures have been assessed and characterized by their impact on risk feasibility and cost priorities may be set decision makers would have to come to consensus on which risk reduction strategy to use to set priorities most of the methods reviewed suggest costeffective selection process ie implementation of the riskre duction methods should not co st more than the benefit derived by the reduced risk costeffec tiveness could also imply that the country invest in risk reduction to the point where the marginal cost to society equals the marginal benefit alterna tively given fixed budget costeffectiveness might imply investing in protections that maximize the benefits for that investment countermeasures that lower ri sk to number of assets ma prove to be most costhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs12 28 roper op cit p 88effective also focusing attention on those assets associated with the highest risks may yield the greatest risk reduction and be one way to implement costeffective approach while costeffectiveness is usually the recommended measure for setting priorities decision makers may use others for example decision makers may be risk averse in other words even if the ch ance of an attack is small or the potential target is not particularly vulnerable the consequen ces may be too adverse to contemplate in this case decision makers may wish to bear the costs of additional protection that exceed the expected reduction in risk roper notes however that in general protection costs should not ex ceed reasonable percentage of the total value of the asset28 another measure by which to select protective actions might be to favor maximizing the number or geographical distribution of assets for which risks are reduced alternatively decision makers might want to focus efforts on reducing specific threat scenario eg dirty bombs or protecting specific targets eg events where large numbers of people attend the electric utility checklist states that the ultimate goal of risk management is to select and implement security improvements to achieve an acceptable level of risk at an acceptable cost the concept of acceptable risk is mentioned in number of methodologies and it needs to be determined by decision makers after selecting which protective measur to pursue programs responsibilities and mechanisms for implementing them must be established many of the reviewed methodologies conclude with the recommendation to revi sit the analysis on regular basis status of directorates risk management efforts following september 11 2001 ownersope rators of critical infrastructure assets to varying degrees began identif ying critical assets assessing their vulnerabilities to attack and developing security plans or increased protections for example the federal transit authority assessed the vulnerabilities of the nations largest mass transit systems the freight rail companies developed additional security measures to coincide with the level of threat identified by dhss color coded national alert system the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness act pl 107188 required drinking wa ter authorities to conduct vulnerability assessments and to develop security plans based on those assessments the maritime transportation security ac t pl 107295 require d port facilities and maritime vessels to do the same the american petroleum institute the north american electric reliability council nd other industry associations offered guidance to their respective members on how to conduct vulne rability assessments and how to manage their risk from possible attack dhss ability to coordinate this activity developed more slowly it only r ecently released its national infrastructure protection plan in june 2006 which details uniform ri sk management methodologyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs13 29 operation liberty shield was comprehens ive national plan to protect the homeland

national asset database oig0604 june 2006 31 the directorate in its fy2007 budget reque st stated that 200 site assistance visits were made in fy2005 and that 150 more were expected to be made each year in fy2006 and fy2007 according to the directorate s performance budget overview for fy2007 which matches specific programs with sp ecific performance measures vulnerability assessments had been conducted at 14 of dhss high priority sites in fy2005 in addition the directorate conducted had set go of assessing vulnerabilities at 25 of its highpriority sites and to have at least tw suitable protective actions implemented at 20 of its highpriority sites by fy2007 it is not clear if this refers to the 600 or more sites mentioned by the assistant secretarythat could allow dhs to generate set of national priorities across all sectors see below directorates internal activity while it has been developing the nipp the directorate has been engaged in its own risk management activities shortly before the beginning of operation iraqi freedom in 2003 as part of operation liberty shield29 the directorate identified list of 160 ssets or sites including chemical and hazardous materials s

time this list grew in testimony before the house appropr iations committee on april 1 2004 then undersecretary for information analysis and infrastructure protection frank libutti stated that dhs had identified 1700 s ites as being high priority sites30 according to the testimony dhs intended to visit each of these sites these site assistance visits s avs are conducted with ow ners and operators on voluntary basis to discuss vulnerabilities and protective measures that can be taken inside the fence in addition dhs m eets with law enforcement officials of jurisdiction to assist them in developi ng buffer zone protection plans bzpps bzpps focus on protections that can be ta ken outside the fence including how to identify threatening surveillance patrolling techniques and how to assert command and control if an incident should occur dhs has provided training and technical assistance to help state and local law enforcement entities develop their own bzpps it is not clear how many sites dhs officials have visited how many vulnerability assessments have been conducted how many security plans have been developed and how many have been implemented31 nor has the directorate been transparent about the processe s or methodology that it uses to identify and prioritize these highpriority sites or for selecting the recommended protective measures it is not clear even how many

percent of the urban areas security initiative grants go toward infrastructure protection conversation with assi stant secretary stephan july 12 2007 36 the formulae have generated some debate am ong states for discussion of this issues and the debate that took place within congress in 2005 see crs report rl33050 risk based funding in homeland security legislation issues for the 109th congress by shawn reese the formulae remains an issue for the 110th congressdepartments inspector ge neral dhs itself found its original list unreliable32 the assistant secretary for infra structure protection robert stephan in july 2006 wrote that dhs had list of more than 600 highpriority sites that it uses to focus its efforts33 what if any relationship this list of 600 has to the original list of 1700 was not explained in more recent statement relating to the process used to allocate federal grants in the urban area security initiative program see below secretary chertoff said that dhs has list of appr oximately 2000 sites or assets that it considered to be of nati onal or regional importance34 how these sites relate to the 600 mentioned by the assistant secretary or to the original 1700 sites was not mentioned supporting state and local efforts in addition to the activity discussed above dhs also has been supporting state nd local efforts to protect assets critical to them and the nation dhs grants s upport wide range of counterterrorism activities these include funds for law enforcement fire fighters emergency response and management medi cal providers citizen corps etc some also include funding for critical infrast ructure protection for ex ample the state homeland security grant program and the urban areas security initiative grants while primarily focused on the needs of first responders also allow funding for critical infrastructure protection such as the purchase of surve illance equipment detectors fences cybersecurity hardware and software etc35 dhs also funds grants more specific to critical infrastructure protecti on these include port rail mass transit trucking and intercity bus security grants allocation of funds through the stat homeland security grant program is based partially on formul determined by congress36 initial allocation of funds for the urban areas security initiative grants and the more specific port and transportationrelated gran ts

and theme parksfiscal year cities on this list with shar ed boundaries were combined into single candidate urban area 10mile buffer wa s then drawn around the candidate area or city to define geographic area in which data was evaluated this could transcend state boundaries leading to regional approach all candidate areas with combined population greater than 200000 we re then considered for the final analysis the fy2006 guidance made distinction between assetbased risk and geographicallybased risk both of which were considered when making the final selection of those urban areas eligible for the fy2006 grants assetbased risk as described in the guidance basically follows the processes discussed in this report it considered specific types of attacks against potential targets within the urban area combining the risks for an overall risk estimate consequences included human health economic strategic mission and psychological impact but focused on human and economic impact threat was defined as the likelihood that an attack might be attempted and included specific types of attacks as well as strategic intent chatter attractiveness of the targets within the urban area and capabilities vulnerability was defined as the likelihood that an att ack might succeed although succeed was not defined nor were the paramete rs that were considered geographicallybased risk expanded upon this by considering certain pr evailing attributes intrinsic to the area that may further contribute to the level of risk for example proximity to national boundaries population density and the number of visitors and commuters that pass through the urban area threat calculations included such things as total number of fbi investigations in the area number of suspicious incidents that have occurred within the area and the total number of vi sitors that come from countries of special interest grants and training considered the pr ocess described above as more rigorous than previous analyses the increased rigor is due in part to the more quantitative nature of the data being used and its specificity in terms of specific assets specific attack scenarios etc the analysis included over 120000 specific assets in 38 different asset types37 following this new methodolog not all of the urban areas that received funding in previous years were considered eligible for fy2006 funds to receive grant urban areas also mu st have developed an urban area security strategy needs assessment tied to that strategy and an investment plan that addresses those needs the needs assessment considers set of capabilities that dhshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs16 has determined are necessary to prevent protect and respond to various types of events urban areas assessed their current capabilities against these to determine where they fell short this defined their needs grants were made to fund programs that dhs determined would yield the highest rate of return in meeting those needs in the past urban areas were allocated priori certain amount of funding for which it could apply in fy2006 allocati ons were made comp etitively based on the investment programs submitted number of urban areas saw their fy2006 grant awards decline from the previous years while other saw theirs in crease those whose allocations declined including new york city and washingt on dc adamantly voiced their concern that dhss methodology or its data were flawed dhs at the time defended its allocations saying they were based not just on risk but on need and the alignment of the investment strategies with identified needs since then secretary chertoff has stated that the fy2007 process has introduced some common sense into the process for the first time urban areas have been divided into two tiers six ur ban areas categorized as tier 1 ie areas associated with the highest risks will receive 55 of the urban areas security initiative funds the remaining 39 urban areas will receive the balance also the number and types of infrastructure assets that figure into the analysis has been reduced from over 120000 to approximately 2000 only those assets whose loss would have national or regional economic impact or impact military readiness are being considered assets such as ffice buildings monuments and presumably stadiums casinos theme park s etc which were considered specifically in fy2006 will not be considered specifically in fy 2007 the rationale for not including these assets is that concerns about them in th past were primarily casualty related which will be captured instead by criteria rela ted to population to tal population population density and numbers of commute rs and tourists even with these changes however the allocation of funds within each tier w ill still be competitive based again on the ability of urban areas to align their propos als with identified needs and return on investment the national infrastruct ure protection plan the national infrastructure protection plan nipp is meant to provide unifying structure for integrating critical infrastructure protection efforts includi ng those already underway and to guide protection investments both within each sector and among sectors the nipp plans to use sectorlevel plans to be developed c ooperatively by sector specific agencies and representatives of their sector as its foundation the nipp outlines what would become common framework by which each sector could identify critical assets conduct risk assessments by integrating threat vulnerab ility and consequences and then use the results to help direct resources toward those activities that can most reduce the risks for given investment the risk management process desc ribed in the national infrastructure protection plan nipp contains all of the elements descri bed above it calls for the setting of specific goals in terms of the security and recovery posture that the sectors wish to attain it calls for the iden tification of assets that constitute each infrastructure and to screen these for criticality based on potential consequenceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs17 factors to consider include the assets function proximity to significant populations or other critical assets and relative importance to the national economy the nipp defines risk as being function of consequences vulnerability and threat it defines consequences as the negative effects on public health and safety the economy public confidence and the f unctioning of government that can be expected if an asset is damaged destroyed or disrupted by terrorist attack or natural disaster consequences include impacts on human life and physical wellbeing both direct and indirect economic impact eg the cost to respond cost to rebuild downstream costs resulting from disruption of product or service and long term environmental costs impact on public confidence and impact on governments ability to maintain order and provide minimum essential services it states that consequences should consider th worstreasonabl ecase scenario vulnerability is defined as the likelihood th at characteristic of or flaw in an assets design location secu rity posture process or ope ration renders it susceptible to destruction incapacitation or exploita tion vulnerability assessments are to be scenario based including specific att ack tactics and weapons vulnerability assessments should consider operational people cyber as well as physical issues the nipp defines threat as the likelihood that particular asset will suffer an attack or incident based on the intent and capability of an adversary or the probability of natural event threat s hould consider methods and tactics including physical and cyber and should also consider insider threats as well as external threats the nipp calls for the assessment of these elements to be measured quantitatively if possible or on numer ic scale if necessary and combined mathematically to calculate numerical risk score consideration of risk reduction measures is to follow twostep process the first step is to focus on those assets which have the highest risk scores th second step is to identify protective measures expected to result in the greates t reduction of risk for any given investment in these high priority assets protectiv measures should include actions that can prevent deter or mitigate threat reduce vulnerability minimize the consequences or enable time ly and efficient response and recovery according to the nipp some issues to consider when estimating costeffectiveness are lowering of coordination costs long leadtime investments appropriate roles for stakeholders existing market incentives and public interests finally metrics should be developed that can track the performance of the protective measures being implemented and which can be used to provide feedback to the risk management process questions and issues while the statements and documents refe renced above allude to many of the steps outlined in the first part of this report many questions still remain regarding process methodology criteria etchttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs18 38 for more detailed discussion of the debate associated with the national asset database see crs report rl33648 critical infrastructure the national asset database by john moteffidentifying assets according the dhs inspector general the list of highpriority sites begun by dhs as part of operation liberty shield eventually morphed into much larger and broader list of infrastructure assets now called the national asset database according to the inspector general as of january 2006 the da tabase included over 77000 entries covering all the critical in frastructure sectors dhs continues to refine and populate the database the database has generate d considerable debate38 primary concern is that it includes thousands of entrie s that many consider not to be of national significance also the inspector general opined that it so did not include assets that many might consider to be of national significance other concerns include the accuracy and quality of the data included on each entry nd an inconsistency of data from state to state locality to locality for example some regional mass transit system assets were characterized masse while others were characterized stationbystation while ceding that quality and consistency of data were problem early in the development of the database dhs has taken number of steps to correct these problems however in response to concerns about the database including assets that are hard to imagine being nationally significant dhs asserts that the database is an inventory of assets and not list of critical assets in other words it represents list of assets supplied by states and localities commercial and private databases and other sources from which critical assets can be identified this would appear to correspond with the initial step of risk management process identifying assets even so critics feel that the database shoul d be purged of those assets that are found not to be of national significan ce dhs has rejected this idea selecting high pr iority assets on what basis did or does the directorate select the 1700 or 600 or approximately 2000 high prior ity assets according to the undersecretary in his testimony referenced above the 1700 assets were ones with credible potential for loss of life and loss of citizen confidence and that these impacts would be felt nationally he descri bed these assets as ones we cannot afford to lose roper and other methodologies review ed for this report recommended the criteria for assessing the level of criticality be specific for example at what point is the impact of an attack felt nationally versus one felt primarily locally or regionally how many casualties rise to the level of having national impact what level of economic impact or what measure of reduced confidence would rank an asset as nationally critical again the answers to these questions would probably require consensus among decision makershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs19 an example of an analysis that provides more detail as to what might be considered nationally critical can be found in white paper entitled interagency paper on sound practices to strengthen the resilience of the us financial system the authors of the white paper the fede ral reserve board us security exchange commission and office of the comptroller of the currency determined that disruption in the services of certain core clearing and settlement organizations could by virtue of their market share present systemic risk to the smooth operations of the financial ma rkets they service the pa per defined systemic risk as the risk that failure of one participant to meet its required obligations will cause other participants to be unable to meet th eir obligations when due causing significant liquidity or credit problems and threatening the stability of financial markets the white paper identified threshold market share above which firms plans associated with backup capacity geographi c location and recovery would be subject to review by the appropriate agency according to the dhs inspector general in second more detailed request to states for data to populate the national sset database dhs ffered more specific guidance for identifying national level critical infrastructure for example producers with herd of more than 20000 bovine 30000 swine 500000 poultry or distribution to more than 10 states or production of 50001250000 bushels of crops chemical sites that could cause death or serious injury in the eventof chemical release and have greater than 300000 persons within 25mile radius of the facility major power generation facilities that exceed 2000mw and ifsuccessfully attacked would disrupt the regional electric grid refineries with refining capacity in excess of 225000 barrels per day cruise portsterminals located with in urban centers with population of greater than 500000 or servic ing greater than 10000 passengers daily seaports and facilities that service the strategic petroleum reserve these criteria are similar but not necessar ily the same as those offered in the guidelines for the state homeland security grants and the urban areas security initiative grants it is not known if the di rectorates internal activity uses these criteria assessing threat the homeland security act assigned to the directorate the responsibility of integrating allsource information in order to identify and assess the nature and scope of terrorist threats against the homeland and to detect and identify threats of terrorism against the united states however s hortly after the act was passed the bush administration in january 2003 established the terrorist threat integration center ttic and placed it within the central intelligence agency many observers felt that the ttic assumed many of the same responsibilities of the information analysis ia function of the directorate the homeland security act designated dhs member of the intelligence community and and as such was given seat at the ttic issues and concerns associated w ith the division of labor between ttic andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs20 39

definitions and approaches by todd m masse 41 united states government accountability office risk management further refinements needed to assess risks and prioritize protective measures at ports and other critical infrastructure gao0691 december 2005the directorate expressed at the time are beyond the scope of this report39 passage of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act pl 108458 which created the position of director of national intelligence and created national counterterrorism center within his ffice has raised additional questions40 the 2005 reorganization of dhs moved the ia function out of the new preparedness directorate and put it dir ectly under the secretary regardless of the organizational changes that have occurred there are two key questions that are relevant to this report is there consistent characterization of the threat used throughout the intelligence community and made available to the directorate and beyond to other stakehol ders is that characterization used consistently to inform the teams sent out to do vulnerability assessments or those agencies and other stakeholders tasked with assessing the vulnerabilities of the sectors for which they are responsible according to the national infrastructure protection plan nipp the homeland infrastructure threat and risk analysis center hitrac will develop three types of threat analysis that can be used by each sector in their risk assessments these products are common threat scenarios ge neral threat environment and specific threat information the common threat scenarios are descri ptions detailed vignettes of potential terrorist att ack methods based on known or desired capabilities of specific terrorist groups th general threat environment analysis will be more sector and subsector specifi c according to the nipp each potential attack method will be crossreferenced w ith each potential set of targets across all sectors based on the whether that attack scenario could achieve the goals and objectives of the attack the resulting terrorist strategic target selection matrix will help sectors narrow the range of threats they need to consider in their subsequent vulnerability consequence and risk assessments in other words blank cell in the matrix indicates that the intelligence analysts do not think that particular attack scenario would likely be used or be successf ul against particular target set the specific threat information is based on realtime intelligence information of explicit threats that could cause the nations or sectors alert level to rise the general threat environment will be updated as need ed based on specific threat information it is unlikely that earlier risk management activities benefitted from this analysis another issue is whether the directorate values all threats equally for example qaeda has demonstrated capabilities in number of attack modes eg bombs hijacking and piloting planes but their capability in other attack modes are not necessarily as well developed how does the directorate consider this in their threat assessments according to gove rnment accountability office gao41 the directorate has developed what are called benchmark scenarios but was not yethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs21 42 however the matrix may only suggest or when deciding which attack scenarios to consider the gao report may be referring to the ability to assess relative likelihood within the set of releva nt scenarios for given target 43 for example the coast guard considered six categories of consequences including deathinjury economic environmental and symbolic impacts all equally weighted and continuedable to assess the relative lik elihood of one over the other the matrix referred to in the nipp to the extent it exists could suggest that this may longer be an issue42 assessing vulnerabilities the testimony and statements of the di rectorate officials cited above implied that the directorate will either perform or lead vulnerability assessments in the field however many of the early efforts were performed by contractors or details from other agencies until the directorate was more fully staffed also it is not clear if the directorate used the vulnerability assessments performed by other agencies or stakeholders in lieu of doing their own key question is whethe r or not contractors details or other agencies and stakeholders follow similar protocol in doing their vulnerability assessments the nipp is s uppose to supply that standardization dhs will accept vulnerability assessm ents made with alterna tive methodologies if they meet certain baseline criteria identified in the nipp see appendix 3a for example as minimum s ectors vulnerability assessmen t should consider not only physical security but also personnel cybe r and operational secu rity dependencies and interdependencies are suppos ed to be considered so current abilities to deter detect and delay attacks ar to be considered howe ver congress might want to ensure that certain general considerations are included assessing consequences what consequences does the directorate consider when assessing risk the testimony of the then undersecretary mentioned that the criticality of an asset was measured in part by loss of life and loss of citizen confidence and the directorates budget justification alludes to forecas ting national security economic and public safety implications hspd7 lists the types of attacks that animate national critical infrastructure policy these are attacks that could cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties impair federal agencies ability to perform essentia l missions undermine the ability of state and local governments to maintain order and provide essential services damage the orderly function of the economy or undermine the publics morale or confidence one could assume that the directorate has considered these factors in the internal assessments of risk the nipp states that at minimum assessments should focus on the two most fundamental impacts the human and the most relevant direct econo mic impacts eg cost to rebuild cost to respond and recover clearly identified costs resu lting from the unavaila bility of product or service long term environmental costs but are they all considered together how are different consequences integrated into an overall risk rating for given scenario43 does the directorate weigh each category of consequence equallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs22 43 continued assigned value of 1 to 5 to each of these based on severity an overall level of risk was determined by the sum total value 44 the senate appropriation committee in its fy2005 appropriations bills report recommended continued funding for risk analys is activities that include evaluating second and thirdorder cascade effects associat ed with market interdependencies 45 see office of homeland security the national strategy for the physical protection of critical infrastructures and key assets february 2003 p 1hspd7 stated that the secretary of homeland security when identifying prioritizing and coordina ting the protection of critical infrastructures s hould emphasis those infrastructures that could be exploited to cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties comparable to those from the use of weapon of mass destruction in this case might prev enting an attack on the super bowl take precedent over an attack on one of those financial core clearing and settlement facilities mentioned above the destruction of whic h might significantly disrupt national financial market s but not necessarily lead to loss of life to what extent if any is the directorate risk averse another question is how are these c onsequences measured are potential deaths based on experiential data or models or best estimates how is confidence or morale and the impact on morale measured are economic models used to determine economic impact how are cascading effects due to interdependencies determined how far down the chain of reactions does the directorate consider44 recognizing the complexity of estimating some of these consequences the nipp states that assessment methodologies ar required and that some standards for estimating consequences need to be developed however aside from referencing the modeling capabilities developed at the national infrastructure simulation and analysis center the nipp offers little in way of setting standards for what measures to use and the assumptions that need to be made risk reduction the risk associated with specific attack on an asset can be reduced by reducing the level of threat to it by reducing its vulnerability to that threat or by reducing the consequences or impact of an attack should it happen this parallels the bush administrations overall strategy for homeland security 1 prevent terrorist attacks 2 reduce americas vulnerability to terrorism and 3 minimize the damage and recover from attacks that do occur45 the department of defense the central intelligence agency the federal bureau of investigations elements of dhss border and transportation directorate and other law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the primary role of reducing threat by disrupting finding detaining or eliminating individuals that threaten the united states dhss emergency preparedness and response activities address mitigating the consequences of an attack through rapid response and quick recovery the directorates critical infrastructure protection activities primarily address reducing an assets vulnerability as discussed above it is doing so mainly by hardening the asset against attack byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs23 46 notwithstanding the national infrastructure pr otection plans inclusion of measures that reduce the consequences of an attack as options to consider in reducing risk some believe that the directorates critical infrastructure protection activities could be more resilience oriented see homeland security advisory council report of the critical infrastructure task force january 2006 see httpwwwdhsgovxlibraryasse tshsac_citf_report_v2pdf last viewed july 17 2007 47 the 2005 reorganization of dhs which estab lished the position of under secretary for policy might be place to address this issue improving the ability of those protecting th asset to deny access to the asset and to improve their ability to repulse an attack46 this raises the question however of wh ether or not and by what mechanism are the various efforts to reduce threat prevent vulnerability protect and consequences prepare c oordinated both within dhs and between dhs and other agencies and to what extent and by what mechanism are the allocation of federal resources to these three areas influenced at all by comparing the risk reduction achieved by each for example effective screening of people entering the country likely contributes greatly to reducing the risks associated with an attack on critical infrastructure to what extent is the marginal risk reduction associated with an additional investment in the departments border screening effort balanced against the marginal risk reduction associated with an additional investment in hardening assets this would likely re quire level of risk mana gement currently beyond the directorates mandate47 prioritizing protection activities according to the nipp prioritizing pr otection activities should be two step process first those critical assets that pose the greatest risks are addressed first protective measures for these assets are identified and their potential for reducing risk determined second the am ount of resources available is divided among these measures in way that maximizes the re duction in risk presumably according to the nipp dhs will use similar approach in recommending budget levels for these and other federal programs th at address infrastructure security needs as part of national critical infrastruct ure and key resources prot ection annual report to the office of management and budget in allocating funds in its homeland secu rity grants its urban areas security initiative and some of its more infrastructurespecific grants dhs has resorted to ranking assets or geographic areas into tiers based on the level or risk or at least potential consequences associated with them funds are then allocated to each tier and entities within each tier compete for those funds dhs then ranks proposals based on variety of factors including th proposals contribution to risk reduction or the degree to which identified needs or vulnerabilities are addressed while allocating resources primarily on riskoriented costeffectiveness seems relatively straightforward it may not be easy to implement or may it lead to distribution of resources that is politically unpalatable for example depending onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs24 48 the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission report ww norton and company 2004 p 392the budget and the protective measures proposed and their expected degree of effectiveness in lowering risk it is concei vable that most of given budget could go to few areas or assets or that some areas or assets do not receive any funding alternatively if proposals ar only partially funded it may be difficult to prorate the associated risk reduction as secretary chertoff suggeste d such strategy may have to be modified by common sense some thing less than objective and probably in need of explanation if not consensus conclusion dhs and the directorate have been tasked with very complex problem security oriented risk management is typica lly done at the site or facility level or at the corporate level the directorate is being asked to do this at the national level assessing and comparing perhaps thousands of disparate site s and facilities it has judged as being nationally important the directorate is to consider not only economic impacts and loss of life but also the possible impact on national morale and the ability of state and local governments to maintain order and deliver essential services none of these are easy to measure and all are difficult to trade ff one against the other should the analysis come down to that to determine the economic impact of the loss of an asset is more difficult than determining the effect on companys bottom line the directorate has been instructed to determine economic impact s two to three levels through the supply chain it is not clear how the directorate can or intends to measure the impact on national morale associated with the loss of an asset especially cultural icon comparing the potential loss of life in one scenario with the potential loss of life in another scenario while sensitive presents direct comparison however comparing the importance of an asset whose loss may re sult in relatively small loss of life with another asset the loss of which might result in large economic impact is much harder the exercise will be less than perfect and probably less than objective the bush administration and congress are allocating resources in any event so these choices are getting made implicitly if such processes were more transparent congress could better oversee them and offer guidance if necessary the 911 commission in discussing need for layered security system for public transportation systems stated that the transportation security administration should be able to identify for congress the array of potential terrorist attacks the layers of security in place and the reliability provided by each layer48 expanding on this the directorate should be able to tell congress what criteria it has used to select assets of national importance the basic strategy it uses to determine which assets warrant additional protective measures by how much these measures could reduce the risk to the nation and how much these additional measures might costhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32561crs25 49 the department released the first

information to inform costeffective allocation of resources to protective action especially in its early efforts the nipp appears to provide framework for written protocol that outlines specifically the steps taken in the risk assessment and risk management process and the assumptions criteria and tradeoffs that are made while the nipp lays out clear process it is not clear how transparent the implementation of the plan will be dhs has stated that section specific plans and their integration into set of national priorities could be classified49 finally congress may choose to offer its
