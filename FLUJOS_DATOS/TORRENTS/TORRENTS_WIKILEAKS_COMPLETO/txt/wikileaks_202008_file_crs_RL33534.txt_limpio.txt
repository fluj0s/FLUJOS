finance foreign affairs defense and trade division chinas economic conditions summary since the initiation of economic reforms 30 years ago china has become one of the worlds fastestgrowing economies from 1979 to 2007 chinas real gross domestic product gdp grew at an average annual rate of 98 real gdp grew 114 in 2007 the fastest annual growth since 1994 however china faces number of challenges including the fallout from the global financial crisis widespread government corruption an inefficient banking system overdependence on exports and fixed investment for growth pollution widening income disparities growing inflationary pressures and the current global financial crisis the chinese government has indicated that it intends over the coming years to create harmonious society that would promote more balanced economic growth and address number of economic and social issues trade and foreign investment continues to play major role in chinas booming economy from 2004 to 2007 the value of total chinese merchandise trade nearly doubled in 2007 chinas exports at 1218 billion exceeded us exports 1162 billion for the first time chinas imports were 956 billion and its trade surplus was 262 billion historic high well over half of chinas trade is conducted by foreign firms operating in china the combination of large trade surpluses foreign direct investment flows and largescale purchases of foreign currency have helped make china the worlds largest holder of foreign exchange reserves at 19 trillion at the end september 2008 chinas economy continues to be concern to many us policymakers on the one hand us consumers exporters and investors have greatly benefitted from chinas rapid economic and trade growth on the other hand the surge in chinese exports to the united states has put competitive pressures on various us industries many us policymakers have argued that china often does not play by the rules when it comes to trade and they have called for greater efforts to pressure china to fully implement its world trade organization wto commitments and to change various economic policies deemed harmful to us economic interests such as its currency policy its use of subsidies to support stateowned firms trade and investment barriers to us goods and services and failure to ensure the safety of its exports to the united states concerns have also been raised over chinas rising demand for energy and raw materials its impact on world prices for such commodities increased pollution levels and efforts china has made to invest in energy and raw materials around the world including countries such as iran and sudan where the united states has political and human rights concerns the current global financial crisis has raised number of questions over how china might respond in terms of stimulating its own economy and possibly assisting troubled economies around the world this report provides an overview of chinas economic development

chinas economic conditions the rapid rise of china as major economic power within time span of about 30 years is often described by analysts as one of the greatest economic success stories in modern times from 1979 when economic reforms began to 2007 chinas real gross domestic product gdp grew at an average annual rate of over 98 in 2007 it rose by 114 the chinese economy in 2007 in real terms was nearly 14 times larger than it was in 1979 and real per capita gdp was more than 10 times larger by some measurements china is now the worlds second largest economy and some analysts predict it could become the largest within few decades chinas economic rise has led to substantial increase in uschina economic relations total trade between the two countries surged from 5 billion in 1980 to 387 billion in 2007 us data in 2007 china was the united states second largest trading partner its third largest export market and its largest source of imports many us companies have extensive manufacturing operations in china in order to sell their products in the booming chinese market and to take advantage of low cost labor for manufacturing products for export these operations have helped us firms remain internationally competitive and have supplied us consumers with variety of low cost goods chinas largescale purchases of us treasury securities have enabled the federal government to fund its budget deficits and help keep us interest rates relatively low however the emergence of china as major economic superpower has raised concern among many us policymakers some express concern over the large and growing us trade deficits with china which rose from 104 billion in 1990 to 256 billion in 2007 and are viewed by many members as an indicator that us chinese commercial relations are imbalanced or unfair others claim that china uses unfair trade practices such as an undervalued currency and subsidies to domestic producers to flood us markets with low cost goods and that such practices threaten american jobs wages and living standards numerous bills have been introduced in the 110th congress to address various chinese economic trade practices deemed to be unfair such as its currency policy china faces number of significant economic challenges including the fallout from the global financial crisis which could slow its exports and hence economic growth weak banking system widening income gaps growing pollution unbalanced economic growth through overreliance on exports and widespread economic efficiencies resulting from nonmarket policies the chinese government views growing economy as vital to maintaining social stability this report provides background on chinas economic rise and current economic structure and the challenges china faces to keep its economy growing strong and describes chinese economic policies that are of concern to us policymakers crs2 most recent developments on november 20 2008 the bank of china reported that the exchange rate between the chinese renminbi and the us dollar stood at 683 an appreciation of 187 since chinas currency was reformed in july 2005 on november 15 2008 chinese president hu jintao attended the summit meeting of the group of 20 g20 countries in washington dc to discuss the current global financial crisis hu stated that steady and relatively fast growth in china is in itself an important contribution to international financial stability and world economic growth on november 9 2008 the chinese government announced it would implement twoyear 586 billion stimulus package mainly dedicated to infrastructure projects on october 24 2008 the chinese government reported that approved foreign direct investment over the first nine months of 2008 had fallen by 26 over the same period in 2007 on october 8 2008 chinas central bank announced plans to cut interest rates and the reserverequirement ratio in order to help stimulate the economy the announcement coincided with announcements by the us federal reserve and other central banks of major economies around the world to lower their benchmark interest rates china cut its rates again on october 29 on june 13 2008 the netherlands environmental assessment agency announced that according to its estimates china in 2007 became the worlds largest emitter of co2 surpassing the united states by 14 and accounting for twothirds of last years global carbon dioxide increase on may 12 2008 chinas sichuan province was struck by strong earthquake the chinese government estimated that as of june 23 2008 69181 people were killed 374171 injured and 18498 were missing an overview of chinas economic development chinas economy prior to reforms prior to 1979 china maintained centrally planned or command economy large share of the countrys economic output was directed and controlled by the state which set production goals controlled prices and allocated resources throughout most of the economy during the 1950s all of chinas individual crs3 household farms were collectivized into large communes to support rapid industrialization the central government undertook largescale investments in physical and human capital during the 1960s and 1970s as result by 1978 nearly threefourths of industrial production was produced by centrally controlled state owned enterprises according to centrally planned output targets private enterprises and foreigninvested firms were nearly nonexistent central goal of the chinese government was to make chinas economy relatively selfsufficient foreign trade was generally limited to obtaining only those goods that could not be made or obtained in china government policies kept the chinese economy relatively stagnant and inefficient mainly because there were few profit incentives for firms and farmers competition was virtually nonexistent and price and production controls caused widespread distortions in the economy chinese living standards were substantially lower than those of many other developing countries the chinese government hoped that gradual reform would significantly increase economic growth and raise living standards the introduction of economic reforms beginning in 1979 china launched several economic reforms the central government initiated price and ownership incentives for farmers which enabled them to sell portion of their crops on the free market in addition the government established four special economic zones along the coast for the purpose of attracting foreign investment boosting exports and importing high technology products into china additional reforms which followed in stages sought to decentralize economic policymaking in several sectors especially trade economic control of various enterprises was given to provincial and local governments which were generally allowed to operate and compete on free market principles rather than under the direction and guidance of state planning additional coastal regions and cities were designated as open cities and development zones which allowed them to experiment with free market reforms and to offer tax and trade incentives to attract foreign investment in addition state price controls on wide range of products were gradually eliminated chinas economic growth since reforms 1979present since the introduction of economic reforms chinas economy has grown substantially faster than during the prereform period see table 1 from 1960 to 1978 real annual gdp growth was estimated at 53 figure many analysts claim is overestimated based on several economic disasters that befell the country during this time such as the great leap forward from 19581960 and the cultural revolution from 19661976 during the reform period 1979the present chinas average annual real gdp grew by 98 it grew by an estimated 114 in 2007 over the previous year since economic reforms were begun the size of the economy in crs4 real terms has increased 14fold and real per capita gdp common measurement of living standards has gone up 10fold1 table 1 chinas average annual real gdp growth 19602008 time average annual period growth 19601978 prereform 53 19792007 postreform 98 1990 38 1991

and economist intelligence unit causes of chinas economic growth economists generally attribute much of chinas rapid economic growth to two main factors largescale capital investment financed by large domestic savings and foreign investment and rapid productivity growth these two factors appear to have gone together hand in hand economic reforms led to higher efficiency in the economy which boosted output and increased resources for additional investment in the economy china has historically maintained high rate of savings when reforms were initiated in 1979 domestic savings as percentage of gdp stood at 32 however most chinese savings during this period were generated by the profits of stateowned enterprises soes which were used by the central government for domestic 1 calculated by crs from data in global insights country intelligence on chinas economy detailed quarterly forecast january 2 2008 crs5 investment economic reforms which included the decentralization of economic production led to substantial growth in chinese household savings these now account for half of chinese domestic savings as result savings as percentage of gdp has steadily risen it reached nearly 50 in 2005 among the highest savings rates in the world several economists have concluded that productivity gains ie increases in efficiency in which inputs are used were another major factor in chinas rapid economic growth the improvements to productivity were caused largely by reallocation of resources to more productive uses especially in sectors that were formerly heavily controlled by the central government such as agriculture trade and services for example agricultural reforms boosted production freeing workers to pursue employment in the more productive manufacturing sector chinas decentralization of the economy led to the rise of nonstate enterprises which tended to pursue more productive activities than the centrally controlled soes additionally greater share of the economy mainly the export sector was exposed to competitive forces local and provincial governments were allowed to establish and operate various enterprises on market principles without interference from the central government in addition foreign direct investment fdi in china brought with it new technology and processes that boosted efficiency measuring the size of chinas economy the actual size of the chinas economy has been subject of extensive debate among economists measured in us dollars using nominal exchange rates chinas gdp in 2007 was 32 trillion its per capita gdp commonly used livingstandards measurement was 2450 such data would indicate that chinas economy and living standards are significantly lower than those of the united states and japan respectively considered to be the numberone and numbertwo largest economies see table 2 many economists however contend that using nominal exchange rates to convert chinese data into us dollars substantially underestimates the size of chinas economy this is because prices in china for many goods and services are significantly lower than those in the united states and other developed countries economists have attempted to factor in these price differentials by using purchasing power parity ppp measurement which attempts to convert foreign currencies into us dollars on the basis of the actual purchasing power of such currency based on surveys of the prices of various goods and services in each respective country this ppp exchange rate is then used to convert foreign economic data in national currencies into us dollars because prices for many goods and services are significantly lower in china than in the united states and other developed countries while prices in japan are higher the ppp exchange rate raises the estimated size of chinese economy from 32 trillion nominal dollars to 73 trillion ppp dollars significantly larger than japans gdp in ppps 43 trillion and little over half the size of the us economy ppp data also raise chinas per capita gdp from 2450 nominal to crs6 5380 the ppp figures indicate that while the size of chinas economy is substantial its living standards fall far below those of the us and japan chinas per capita gdp on ppp basis was only 117 of us levels thus even if chinas gdp were to overtake that of the united states in the next few decades its living standards would likely remain substantially below those of the united states for many years to come2 table 2 comparisons of us japanese and chinese gdp and per capita gdp in nominal us dollars and ppp 2007

economist intelligence unit estimated based on world bank data foreign direct investment in china chinas trade and investment reforms and incentives led to surge in foreign direct investment fdi which has been major source of chinas capital growth annual utilized fdi in china excluding the financial sector grew from 636 million in 1983 to 75 billion in 20073 the cumulative level of fdi in china at the end of 2007 stood at nearly 760 billion making china one of the worlds largest destinations of fdi based on cumulative fdi for 19792007 about 40 of fdi in china has come from hong kong 97 from the british virgin islands4 81 from japan and 74 from the united states see table 35 the united states was chinas fifth largest 2 in december 2007 the world bank lowered its previous estimate of chinas 2005 gdp on ppp basis by 40 to 53 trillion based on price survey data supplied by the chinese government for the first time the new ppp estimates are believed to be more accurate than those made previously see crs report rs22808 how large is chinas economy does it matter by wayne m morrison and michael f martin 3 in 2005 china announced that previous years fdi data excluded investment in the banking insurance and securities sectors it henceforth began to report two overall fdi figures one that includes the financial sector and one that excludes it chinas fdi including the financial sector totaled 724 billion in 2005 695 billion in 2006 and 827 billion in 2007 china does not include the financial sector in its country breakdown of fdi 4 the british virgin islands is large source of fdi because of its status as tax haven 5 much of the fdi originating from the british virgin islands and hong kong may originate from other foreign investors for example taiwanese businesses are believed to invest in china through other countries in order to circumvent government restrictions in addition continued crs7 source of us fdi in 2007 accounting for 35 of total6 us fdi flows to china peaked at 54 billion in 2002 but have declined every year since us fdi in china in 2007 fell by nearly 13 over the previous year the largest sector for fdi flows to china in 2007 was manufacturing which accounted for about 55 of total see table 47 the chinese government estimates that through june 2007 it had approved over 610000 foreign funded companies and that 28 million people were employed by

to shift funds overseas in order to re invest in china to take advantage of preferential investment policies this practice is often referred to as roundtipping thus the actual level of fdi in china

china to accumulate the worlds largest foreign exchange reserves chinas accumulation of foreign exchange reserves has been particularly acute over the past few years china total reserves reached 19 trillion at the end september 19 trillion making it the worlds largest holder chinas major trading partners chinas trade data often differ significantly from those of its major trading partners especially with the united states this is largely due to the large share of chinas trade both exports and imports passing through hong kong which reverted back to chinese rule in july 1997 but is treated as separate customs area by most countries including china and the united states china treats large share of its exports through hong kong as chinese exports to hong kong for statistical purposes while many countries that import chinese products through hong kong generally attribute their origin to china for statistical purposes according to chinese trade data its top five trading partners in 2007 were the european union eu japan the united states the 10 nations that constitute the association of southeast asian nations asean and hong kong see table 6 chinas largest export markets were the eu the united states and hong kong while its top sources for imports were the japan the eu and asean the united states ranked sixth china maintained substantial trade surpluses with the united states the eu and hong kong but had deficits with japan and asean china reported that it had 163 billion trade surplus with the united states us data show that it had 256 billion deficit with china us trade data indicate that the importance of the us market to chinas export sector is likely to be much higher than is reflected in chinese trade data based on us data on chinese exports to the united states and chinese data on total chinese exports it is estimated that chinese exports to the united states as share of total chinese exports totaled 336 in 2007 growing level of chinese exports is from foreignfunded enterprises ffes in china according to chinese data ffes were responsible for 57 of chinese exports in 2007 compared with 41 in 1996 large share of these ffes are owned by hong kong and taiwan investors many of whom have shifted their laborintensive exportoriented firms to china to take advantage of lowcost labor large share of the products made by such firms is

figure 1 chinas net oil imports 19972007 source us energy administration chinas growing overseas direct investment key aspect of chinas economic growth strategy has been to attract foreign investment into china however in 2000 chinas leaders initiated new go global strategy which sought to encourage firms especially stateowned enterprises to invest overseas the chinese government generally refers to these activities as overseas direct investment odi there appears to be several factors driving this investment chinas massive accumulation of foreign exchange reserves has led government officials to seek more profitable ways of investing these holdings which traditionally have mainly been put into relatively safe low yield assets such as us treasury securities on 11 international energy agency 2007 world energy outlook p 168 estimates are based on reference scenario projections which assume new government policies and measures or technological breakthroughs crs14 september 29 2007 the chinese government officially launched the china investment corporation under the direction of the state council in an effort to better manage its foreign exchange reserves it reportedly will initially manage over 200 billion making it one of the worlds largest sovereign wealth funds some analysts believe that china will increasingly use its reserves to purchase foreign firms or shares of foreign firms that are perceived to be profitable as developing country china has traditionally sought to attract fdi into the country in order to through joint ventures gain access to foreign technology and management skills to help domestic firms become more efficient and internationally competitive now the chinese government is attempting to promote the development of internationally recognized chinese brands one strategy has been to purchase or attempt to purchase existing companies and their internationallyrecognized brand names as well as to obtain technology and management skills for example in april 2005 lenovo group limited chinese computer company purchased ibm corporations personal computer division for 175 billion12 on june 20 2005 haier group major chinese home appliances manufacturer made 128 billion bid to take over maytag corporation although the bid was later withdrawn acquisition of energy and raw materials has been major priority of chinas overseas investment strategy as such china has sought to either purchase or invest in foreign energy and raw material companies infrastructure projects such as oil and gas pipelines oil refineries and mines and joint ventures13 for example in june 2005 the china national offshore oil corporation cnooc through its hong kong subsidiary cnooc ltd made bid to buy us energy company unocal for 185 billion although cnooc later withdrew its bid due to opposition by several congressional members in august 2005 the china national petroleum corporation cnpc chinas largest oil company purchased

will enjoy fairly healthy growth in the near future however economists caution that these projections are likely to occur only if china continues to make major reforms to its economy failure to implement such reforms could endanger future growth the global financial crisis this crisis currently poses the biggest overall threat to chinas economic growth china is highly dependent on foreign trade and investment for its economic growth and thus an economic slowdown among chinas major trading partners could have big impact on chinas future growth discussed in more detail below an inflexible currency policy china does not allow its currency to float and therefore must make largescale purchases of dollars to keep the exchange rate within certain target levels although the yuan has appreciated someone since reforms were introduced in july 2005 analysts contend that it remains highly undervalued against the dollar economists warn that chinas currency policy has made the economy overly dependent on exports and fixed investment for growth and has promoted easy credit policies by the banks these policies may undermine longterm economic stability by causing overproduction in various sectors increasing the level of non performing loans held by the banks and boosting inflationary pressures19 stateowned enterprises soes which account for about one third of chinese industrial production put heavy strain on chinas economy over half are believed to lose money and must be supported by subsidies mainly through state banks government support of unprofitable soes diverts resources away from potentially more efficient and profitable enterprises in addition the poor financial condition of many soes makes it difficult for the government to reduce trade barriers out of fear that doing so would lead to widespread bankruptcies among many soes the banking system faces several major difficulties due to its financial support of soes and its failure to operate solely on market based principles chinas banking system is regulated and controlled by the central government which sets interest rates and attempts to allocate credit to certain chinese firms the central 19 for further information on the economic consequences of chinas currency policy see crs report rl32165 chinas currency economic issues and options for us trade policy by wayne m morrison and marc labonte crs17 government has used the banking system to keep afloat money losing soes by pressuring state banks to provide low interest loans without which large number of the soes would likely go bankrupt currently over 50 of stateowned bank loans now go to the soes even though large share of loans are not likely to be repaid the precarious financial state of the chinese banking system has made chinese reformers reluctant to open the banking sector to foreign competition corruption poses another problem for chinas banking system because loans are often made on the basis of political connections this system promotes widespread inefficiency in the economy because savings are generally not allocated on the basis of obtaining the highest possible returns growing public unrest the chinese government reported that there were over 87000 protests many of which became violent in 2005 compared with 53000 protests in 2003 over such issues as pollution government corruption and land seizures20 number of protests in china have stemmed in part from frustrations among many chinese especially peasants that they are not benefitting from chinas economic reforms and rapid growth and perceptions that those who are getting rich are doing so because they have connections with government officials protests have broken out over government land seizures and plant shutdowns in large part due to perceptions that these actions benefitted select group with connections 2005 united nations report stated that the income gap between the urban and rural areas was among the highest in the world and warned that this gap threatens social stability the report urged china to take greater steps to improve conditions for the rural poor and bolster education health care and the social security system21 the global financial crisis could lead to widespread lay offs in china which could prompt worker unrest the lack of the rule of law in china has led to widespread government corruption financial speculation and misallocation of investment funds in many cases government connections not market forces are the main determinant of successful firms in china many us firms find it difficult to do business in china because rules and regulations are generally not consistent or transparent contracts are not easily enforced and intellectual property rights are not protected due to the lack of an independent judicial system the lack of the rule of law in china limits competition and undermines the efficient allocation of goods and services in the economy recent reports of slave labor in northern china has also raised public anger over the lack of enforcement of labor laws 20 see crs report rl33416 social unrest in china by thomas lum 21 chinas human development report 2005 crs18 poor government regulatory environment china maintains weak and relatively decentralized government structure to regulate economic activity in china laws and regulations often go unenforced or are ignored by local government officials as result many firms cut corners in order to maximize profits this has lead to proliferation of unsafe food and consumer products being sold in china or exported abroad22 growing concerns over the health and safety of chinese products such as fish petfood tires and toys in the united states and other countries could lead consumers to reduce their purchases of chinese products and could undermine chinas efforts to develop and promote internationally recognized chinese brands growing pollution the level of pollution in china continues to worsen posing series health risks to the population the chinese government often disregards its own environmental laws in order to promote rapid economic growth according to the world bank 20 out of 30 of the worlds most polluted cities are in china with significant costs to the economy such as health problems crop failures and water shortages according to one government estimate environmental damage costs the country 226 billion or 10 of the countrys gdp each year the chinese government estimates that there are over 300 million people living in rural areas that drink unsafe water caused by chemicals and other contaminants toxic spills in 2005 and 2006 threatened the water supply of millions of people china is the largest producer and consumer of coal which accounts for about 70 of chinas energy use although growing environmental degradation has been recognized as serious problem by chinas central government it has found it difficult to induce local governments to comply with environmental laws especially when such officials feel doing so will come at the expense of economic growth in october 2006 the chinese government formally outlined its goal of building harmonious socialist society by taking steps by 2020 to lessen income inequality improve the rule of law beef up environmental protection reduce corruption and improve the countrys social safety net such as expanding health care and pension coverage to rural areas in march 2007 the chinese national peoples congress npc passed law to strengthen property laws to help prevent local governments from unfairly seizing land from farmers and in june 2007 it passed new labor contract law to enhance labor rights in addition the government has scrambled to improve health and safety laws and regulations 22 see crs report rs22713 health and safety concerns over us imports of chinese products an overview by wayne m morrison crs19 fallout from the current global financial crisis23 although chinese financial institutions are not believed to have invested heavily in us subprime securities it is likely that chinas economy will likely be indirectly impacted mainly through economic slowdowns by its major trading partners the united states europe and japan which could significantly reduce chinas exports to these partners as well as diminished levels of fdi global insight an international forecasting firm projected in october 2008 that chinas gdp growth would slow from 119 in 2007 to 98 in 2008 to 84 in 200924 in addition there have been numerous indicators of slowdown in the economy even before the severity of the current global financial crisis became apparent chinese real gdp for january through september 2008 grew by 99 which was 23 percentage points lower than growth in same period in 200725 in march 2008 chinas labor and social security minister tian chengping warned that the employment situation in china in 2008 was expected to be very severe noting that towns and cities would be able to provide only 12 million new jobs out of 20 million new job seekers more than half of chinas toy exporters reportedly shut down in the first seven months of 2008 and toy exports from january to august 2008 were 208 lower than they were during the same period in 200726 the real estate market in several chinese cities has exhibited signs of bursting bubble including slow down in construction falling prices and growing levels of unoccupied buildings in addition the value of chinas largest stock market the shanghai stock exchange composite index has fallen by twothirds from january 1 to september november 4 2008 china has taken number of steps to stimulate its economy on november 9 2008 it announce that it would implement twoyear 586 billion stimulus package mainly dedicated to infrastructure projects interest rates were cut twice in october and real estate taxes were cut the government also pledged to cut export targets and boost subsidies to small and mediumsized firms analysts debate what role china might play in responding to the global financial crisis given its huge foreign exchange reserves but its relative reluctance to become major player in global economic affairs and its tendency to be cautious with its reserves some have speculated that china in order to help stabilize its most important trading partner the united states would boost purchases of us securities especially treasury securities27 this would help the us government fund the 23 for additional information see crs report rs22984 china and the global financial crisis implications for the united states by wayne m morrison 24 global insight china october 8 2008 25 in addition year on year gdp growth in the third quarter was 9 exports grew by 223 drop of 48 percentage points over the same period in 2007 26 china xinhua news agency october 14 2008 27 in september 2008 china overtook japan to become the largest foreign holder of us continued crs20 purchases of troubled assets and programs stimulate the economy28 additionally china might try to shore up the us economy by buying us stocks on september 21 2008 the white house indicated that president bush had called chinese president hu jintao about the financial crisis and steps the administration was planning to take an unnamed chinese trade official was reported by inside us trade as stating that the purpose of that call was to ask for chinas help to deal with this financial crisis by urging china to hold even more us treasury bonds and us assets the official was further quoted as saying that china recognized that it has stake in the health of the us economy both as major market for chinese exports and in terms of preserving the value of usbased assets held by china and that stabilized us economy was in chinas own interest29 some contend that taking an active role to help the united states and other troubled economies would boost chinas image as positive contributor to the world economic order similar to what occurred during the 19971998 asian financial crisis when it offered financial assistance to thailand and pledged not to devalue its currency even though other east asian economies had done so move that was highly praised by us officials at the time on the other hand there are number of reasons why china would be reluctant to significantly increase its purchases of us investments one concern would be whether increased chinese investments in the us economy would produce long term economic benefits for china some chinese investments in us financial companies have fared poorly and chinese officials would be reluctant to put additional money into investments that were deemed to be too risky30 secondly sharp economic downturn of the chinese economy would likely increase pressure on the government to invest money at home rather than overseas many analysts including some in china have questioned the wisdom of chinas policy of investing large volume of foreign exchange reserves in us government securities which offer relatively low rate of return when china has such huge development needs at home many chinese officials contend that maintaining strong economic growth in china is the most effective action china can take to promote global growth several economists in the west have suggested for years that china should boost domestic spending and appreciate its currency to promote more balanced growth greater economic efficiency and improve the countrys living standards 27 continued treasury securities see crs report rl34314 chinas holdings of us securities implications for the us economy by wayne m morrison marc labonte 28 such move would help keep us interest rates relatively low likewise if china decided not to sharply increase its purchases of us securities us interest rates could go up 29 inside us trade china trade extra september 24 2008 30 for example in june 2007 chinas sovereign wealth fund bought 3 billion worth of shares from
