through an omnibus multiyear farm bill the farm security and rural investme nt act of 2002 pl 107171 was the most recent omnibus farm bill and many of its provisions expire in 2007 so reauthorization is expected to be addressed in the first session of the 110th congress the heart of every omnibus farm bill is farm income and commodity price support policy namely the methods nd levels of support that the federal government provides to agricultural producers however farm bills typically include titles on agricultural trade and foreign food aid conservati on and environment forestry domestic food assistance primarily food stamps agricultural credit rural development agricultural research and ducation and marketin grelated programs often such miscellaneous provisions as food safety marketing orders animal health and welfare and energy are added this omnibus nature of the farm bill creates broad coalition of support am ong sometimes conflic ting interests for policies that individually might not survive the legislative process the scope and direction of new farm bill may be shaped by such factors as financial conditions in the agricult ural economy competition among various interests international trade obligations and possibly most important tight limit on federal funds among the thorniest i ssues may be future farm income and commodity price support questions of equity who should get aid and how much program cost conformance with wt trade obligations effects on us competitiveness in the global marketplace and the unintended impacts of agricultural activities on the environment are among the considerations the economic prosperity of the us farm sector is heavily dependent upon exports so the provisions of new bill r eauthorizing farm export and foreign food aid programs also will be of keen interest moreover the agricultural credit research conservation domes tic nutrition assistance nd rural development titles bring an array of interests into the debate and their issues and concerns could prove equally contentious several farm groups have strongly endorsed conti nuation of current policies and programs however agriculture and ru ral interests not receiving much benefit from current programs oppose simple ex tension and would like some of the spending to be aimed at solving their problems furthermore the secretary of agriculture has repeatedly stated that farm programs need to be made equitable predictable and beyond challenge in the wto this report will be updated as re lated developments

is expected to consider major agriculture and food legislation in an omnibus multiy ear authorizing bill commonly called the farm bill federal commodity support conservati on food assistance agricultural trade marketing and rural development policies are governed by variety of separate laws however many of these laws periodica lly are evaluated revised and renewed through an omnibus multiyear farm bill these policies can be and sometimes are modified or overhauled as freestanding aut horizing legislation or as part of other laws however periodic farm bills have provided congress the administration and interest groups with an opportunity to r eexamine agriculture and food issues more carefully and address them more comprehensively the most recent omnibus farm bill the fa rm security and ru ral investment act of 2002 pl 107171 and many of its provisions expire in 20071 without new legislation notably in the area of farm commodity and income support programs permanent statutes will take effect most of these statutes were enacted decades ago and are longer compatible with cu rrent national economic objectives global trading rules and federal budg etary or regulatory policies these largely outdated permanent laws have been kept on th books by congress in part to compel increasingly urban and suburban future c ongresses to pay attention to national agricultural policy for most other topics addressed in the farm bill the authority to appropriate funds would nd and in some cases all program authority could terminate the heart of every omnibus farm bill is farm income and commodity price support policy namely the methods and levels of support that the federal government provides to agricultural producers however farm bills typically include titles on agricultural trade and foreign food aid conservation and environment forestry domestic food assistance primarily food stamps agricultural credit rural development agricultural research and ducation and marketin grelated programs often such miscellaneous provisions as food safety marketing orders animal health and welfare and energy are added this omnibus nature of the farm bill creates broad coalition of support among sometimes conflicting interests for policies that individually might not survive thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs2 2 information about the farm bill forums is available at httpwwwusdagovfarmbilllegislative process among the groups lobbying congress will be farm and commodity organizations input supplie rs commodity handlers processors exporters retailers foreign customers and competitors universities and scientific organizations domestic consumers and food assistance advocates environmentalists and rural communities so for example farm state lawmakers may seek urban legislators backing for commodity price supports in exchange for votes on domestic food aid and vice versa farm bills and the programs they encompass are complex and intensely interactive changes to one program ofte n have intended and mo re often unintended consequences for others for example legislative change that raises corn prices is typically examined for how it might change the planting decisions of those who grow other crops such as soybeans and in turn the cost of the support program for soybeans likewise change in the corn program can have major implications for producers who feed corn to dairy cows beef cattle and other animals for sugar producers and food manufacturers who can use corn syrup in place of sugar for many products for consumers including thos on limited food budgets and for exporters and foreign competitors the level and type of support provided also can affect farm equipment companies agricultural investors and rural financial institutions fertilizer and pesticide suppliers and farmdependent rural communities farm bill titles also are growing increasingly integrated the conservation title for example includes provisi ons that affect commodity programs and some of the commodity provisions likewise affect conser vation this integration means that one cannot simply look in single title for all pr ovisions that affect the topic of the title major external pressures on this farm bill including efforts to encourage domestic energy independence and to respond to tr eaty obligations concerning agricultural trade are likely to foster further integration of po licies and topics congressional and administration action although farm bills are considered only periodically federal farm policy is an ongoing issue for many lawmakers the 1996 farm bill was intended to guide agricultural support through 2002 but an unanticipated drop in commodity prices prompted congress to begin the next fa rm bill debate in 1998 when it considered and passed the first of series of ad hoc emergency assistance measures that pumped 20 billion in supplemental payments calle d market loss payments to farmers over three years fy1999fy2001 and ultima tely led to the adoption of c ountercyclical payments in the 2002 farm bill in july 2005 secretary of agriculture ke johanns began series of farm bill forums held throughout the country the public was invited to provide comments on six specific questions2 1 how should farm policy be designed to maximize us competitiveness and our countrys ability to effectively compete in global marketshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs3 3 the organizations cited here and their pr oposals are found at their respective websites continued2 how should farm policy address any unintended consequences and ensure that such consequences do not discourage new farmers and the next generation of farmers from entering production agriculture 3 how should farm policy be designed to effectively and fairly distribute assistance to producers 4 how can farm policy best achieve conservation and environmental goals 5 how can federal rural and farm pr ograms provide effective assistance in rural areas 6 how should agricultural product development marketing and researchrelated issues be addressed in the next farm bill following the forum series secretary j ohanns has repeatedly stated the usdas goal for new farm bill is that it be quitable predictable and beyond challengein the wto equitable relates to the dist ribution of benefits among farmers and commodities predictable relates to dependably providing assistance particularly disaster assistance which has been ad hoc over the past 20 years beyond challenge relates to full compliance with the world trade organization wto rules agreed to by the united states and the entire 149c ountry membership of the organization on january 23 2006 then house agricu lture chairman bob goodlatte and ranking minority member co llin peterson announced the be ginning of series of field hearings to review the 2002 farm bill w ith an eye to designing the next farm bill with the 110th congress the house and senate agriculture committees face the challenge of enacting 2007 farm bill before the years end the change in partisan control of the house and senate has put representative collin peterson of minnesota and senator tom harkin of iowa in char ge of the house and senate agriculture committees see appendix b the democratic party leadership has talked about adopting paygo budget policy requiring any areas of increased spending to be offset by reduced spending in other areas adding to the committees budget challenges is the likelihood of some what lower spending baseline as the congressional budget office cbo estimates the future cost of current commodity programs under the scenario of current and projected high commodity prices several interest groups ve already taken public pos itions on farm bill topics especially related to commodity provisi ons and conservation both the american farm bureau federation and national fa rmers union have strongly endorsed continuation into the future of current co mmodity support programs in contrast the national corn growers association wa nts to replace some commodity support provisions and crop insurance with crop re venue insurance plans the american farmland trust put itself in highprofile position with proposal addressing risk protection and conservation endorsed by three former secretaries of agriculture from both political parties additional pr oposals can be expected and congress faces the need to adjudicate among inte rest groups competing for parts of an increasingly tight spending package that c ould be less than under current law and will certainly be less than what the stakeholders in combination would like to receive3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs4 3 continued american farm bureau federation http wwwfbor g national farmers union httpwwwnfuorg

httpwwwfasusdagovcmpoutlook2006nov06aes11222006pdfgeneral policy considerations4 economic situation for the last four years including the forecast for 2006 crop and livestock marketing receipts generally have been strong and in cases where prices have declined government paymen ts have largely made up the difference examples include large milk and cotton payments in fy2004 and large corn and cotton payments in fy2005 the result has been reco rd high levels of net farm income and record low levels of farm debt compared to assets5 contributing substantially to the strong domestic farm sector was rapid rise in the value of agricultural exports from 53 billion in fy2002 to forecast 77 billion in fy2007 record high6 the trade outlook is important to fa rmers because exports account for about 25 of the value of agricultural production and about onethird of harvested acreage is exported farm income also is affect ed by other factors not least government subsidies usda forecast data show 2006 net cash farm income of 666 billion though cash receipts in 2006 from the sale of crops increase livestock receipts decline and all production expenses increase this leaves total net cash farm income 18 lower in 2006 than in 2005 included in 2006 net cash income is 165 billion in direct government payments these payments help to undergird the value of agricultural land and other assets keep fa rm debt at favorably low levels and stabilize farm operator incomes while usda has not published farm income forecast for 2007 it will be influenced by expected high prices for several of the major commodities changes in farm revenues have impacts on rural communities and businesses that depend on the agricultural sector similarly rural nonfarm employment is important to the household income of many farms particularly smaller farms food stamp program spending is rgely related to general em ployment and competes with agriculture programs in the allocation of funds available to the agriculture committees for the farm bill hence f ood stamps could be prominent in the next farm bill especially if there is threat to commodity program spending under tight budget rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs5 7 the budget resolution is congressional blueprint for all federal spending it does not require presidential signature 8 the food stamp program accounts for bout 348 billion of the 53658 billion food and nutrition category farm and foreign agri culture outlays amount to about 26847 billion with commodity credit corporation ccc spending tota ling to 2126 billionagriculture budget as with all areas of the federal budget agriculture faces spending constraints in fy2006 budget reconciliation trimmed 27 billion over five years fy2006fy2010 from usda mandatory progra ms for the 2007 farm bill these constraints will begin to ta ke shape with the start of the annual congressional budget process when the house and senate budget co mmittees recommend spending levels for broad functional categories recent fe deral deficits have raised concern over the ability or willingness of congress to fund farm programs at vels being requested by stakeholders or even at levels approved in the last farm bill once the limits are approved by congress via the annual budget resolution program spending cannot be increased to levels that will breach these limits unless either 1 they are offset by increased revenue or cuts in other prog rams tradeoff process known as paygo short for payasyougo or 2 congress and the president declare the extra spending to be an emergency t hus precluding the need for offsets7 budget categories the usda carries out wi array of responsibilities through about 30 separate internal agen cies and offices staffed by some 100000 employees for fy2006 usda spent about 978 billion for its varied mandatory and discretionary programs figure 1 shows how this is divided among the major budget categories8 usda is responsible for many activitie s outside of the agriculture budget function therefore spending by usda is not synonymous with spending for farmers with the farm bill or with agriculture appropriations bills most of the major programs that assist production ag riculture including commodity price and income supports crop insurance farm cred it marketing and agricultural research fall within function 350 the agriculture func tion of the federal budget some other functional areas of spending administered by usda include food stamps in function 600 income security conservation prog rams function 300 the natural resources and environment category foreign food ai d function 150 the inte rnational affairs category meat inspection function 550 h ealth rural electri c and communication loans function 270 energy rural comm unity and business grants and loans function 450 community and regional velopment and rural housing loans function 370 commerce and housing credit so although most of these programs are addressed by the agriculture committees in an omnibus farm bill they are scattered throughout the federal budget for scorekeeping purposeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs6 9 limits on mandatory programs usually have been achieved by using language such as none of the funds appropriated or otherwise ma available by this or any other act shall be used to pay the salaries and expenses of pe rsonnel to carry out section of public law continuedmandatory vs discretionary spending mandatory and discretionary spending are treated differently in the budg et process congress generally controls spending on mandatory programs by setting rules for eligibility benefit formulas and other parameters rather th an approving specific dolla r amounts for these programs each year funding for mandatory progra ms is determined indirectly in the agriculture committees when they write directly into the authorizing laws the eligibility standards and benefits for these programs any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law examples of mandatory spending are the major farm commodity price support programs and the food stamp program the appropriations committees generally are expected to provide the necessary yeartoyear funding in the annual usda appropriation to maintain these programs however for certain mandatory programs in the 2002 farm bill such as conservation rural development and research appropriators have limited authorized mandatory outlays the savings achieved by limiting mandatory programs has been used to boost discretionary programs in fy2006 about 15 billion in mandatory prog rams was prohibited from being spent9dollars in billions 97813 billion total food and nutrition 549 53658farm foreign ag 274

justed for changes in program rules funding sought by the administration 11 these figures refer to farm spending by the commodity credit corporation ccc the usda entity created specifically to finance operations of the departments farm price income support and related programswhile discretionary programs also are signed and authorized in the house and senate agriculture committees their annual funding levels are determined by the agriculture subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees as part of the annual agriculture appropriations bill examples of discretionary spending are agricultural research and extension ag ricultural credit animal and plant health protection farm marketing rvices and most rural velopment programs of course both mandatory and discretionary program authorizations and spending still ultimately must be approved by the full house and senate after they are reported by the relevant committees before either the agriculture committees or the appropriations committees make these decisions by drafting the appr opriate measure whether it is new farm bill an annual usda appropr iation or some other meas ure the panels must know how much spending room they have b een allocated under the congressional budget resolution the baseline the opening stages of debate over new farm bill usually occur in the house and senate budget committees the debate focuses on whether the multiyear baseline projection which assumes the current farm bill continues under expected economic conditions is appr opriate or whether more or possibly less spending should be built into the baseline each year the congressional budget ffice cbo issues baseline budget for all federal spending under curre nt law over 10year period10 projected spending in the baseline budget represents cbos estima at particular point in time of what federal spending and revenues would likely be under cu rrent law if policy changes were made over the projected period the cbo baseline serves as benchmar k or starting point for future budget analyses whenever any new legislation is introduced that affects federal mandatory spending such as farm bill its impact is measured by cbo as difference from the baseline for farm commodity and income suppor t and related prog rams cbo estimated in august 2006 that under current law total spending would average about 12 billion annually over the fy2006 through fy2016 period11 due to rapid increases in the futures market price of corn nd other commodities since the summer of 2006 the baseline of government spending for th commodity programs is decreasing the cbo baseline published in early 2007 in conjunction with the fy2008 budget resolution largely will determine the si ze of the pie to be divided amonghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs8 commodities and competing interest gr oups policymakers may craft changes in farm policy and score budgetary savings or cost s to fit the new farm bill within its allocated budget international trade agreements disputes and negotiations international trade agreements and dis putes arising under them could shape the direction of future us agricultural policy continuing multilateral trade negotiations on agriculture if they result in new trade agreement also could have an influence on us farm policy as expre ssed in the next farm bill although the united states is party to number of trade agreements it is primarily the agricultural agreement in the world trade organization wto with rules governing the use of agricultural subsidies both domestic and export that constrains domestic policy choices membership in the wto opens the united states to three avenues of influence that could change the direction of future domestic agricultural policy 1 existing trade commitments 2 trade disputes and 3 trade negotiations existing trade commitments under the most recently completed round of wto trade negotiations the 1995 ur uguay round the united states agreed to abide by set of disciplines that govern not only export subsidies and import tariffs and quotas for agricultural products but also domestic farm program design and spending under the wto domestic farm support programs are categorized into boxes amber blue or green according to their re lative likelihood to distort trade amber box policies the most tradedistorting are subject to total annual spending limits the united states like virtually all other c ountries has been reporting that its amber box spending has been below its allowa ble annual level of 191 billion farm bill programs that generally are included in th amber box include dairy and sugar price supports crop marketing loans loan defici ency payments and other direct payments linked to perunit levels of production countercyclical payments storage payments and crop insurance and loan interest subsid ies among others in contrast blue box policies are narrowly defined to include only specific subset of productionlimiting programs that have spending limit the united states has not used the blue box exemption since 1995 finally green box po licies ie the least tradedistorting policies are exempt from spending limits green box programs include conservation and environmental activities such as the conservation reserve program crp or the conservation security progra m csp farm disaster relief payments domestic food aid such as food stamps nd income supports not linked to current production or prices such as the direct payments enacted in the 2002 farm bill final wto agricultural subsidy category th at is exempt from spending limits under certain conditions is known as minimis exempted outlays minimis exemptions encompass domestic support outlays that do not exceed 5 of the value of production calculated both on productsp ecific and non productspecific basis countries report to the wto on their domes tic farm spending by category for each year the wtos system of policy categoriz ation has provided latitude to us policymakers in developing domestic support measures that can provide significant aid to producers but at the same time comply with wto obligations for examplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs9 on average during 19992001 the united states provided 50 billion in green box payments and 16 billion in amber box or re stricted spending during that period us amber box spending was about 85 of its permitted wto ceiling narrowing gap between the ceiling and spending c ould limit us flexibility in choosing ways to support farmers as new farm bill is considered furthermore because us amber box payments are geared to price variations when prices decline amber box outlays rise the united states risk s exceeding its 191 billion amber box ceiling these factors could encourage policy shift to green box programs such as conservation rural devel opment andor resource re tirement payments or to payments to producers that are not li nked to current production or prices conversely when commodity prices are high as they are currently amber box outlays decline even in situations like this some farm groups advocate shift to green box programs to make up for forgone subsidy payments trade litigation in addition to trade negotiations litigation of disputes in the wto dispute settlement body dsb can be means of achieving trade policy objectives the usbrazil cotton dispute recently litigated in the wto illustrates the impact that litigation could have on us farm programs on march 3 2005 wto dispute appeals panel ruled against the united states in dispute brought by brazil against certain aspects of the us cotton program as result usda announ ced that it would make number of administrative changes in its export credit guarantee programs to comply with the wto ruling including removal of 1 cap on fees charged under the gsm102 short term export credit guarantee program and termination of the gsm103 intermediate term gu arantee

farm size and the distribution of commod ity program payments amber waves economic research service usda february 2005farm income and commodity price support13 the economic argument for federal suppor t of farms in contrast to nonfarm businesses is that markets do not efficiently balance commodity supply with demand imbalances in agricultural ma rkets develop because consumers do not respond to price changes by buying propor tionally smaller or larger quantities demand is priceinelastic and similarly farmers do not respond to price changes by proportionally reducing or increasing pr oduction supply is price inelastic the imbalances then often result in inadequate or exaggerated resource adjustments by farmers the imbalances ar further exacerbated by the long time lag between crop planting or livestock breeding and harvest during which economic and yield conditions may dramatically change the objectives of federal commodity pr ograms are to stabilize and support farm incomes by shifting some of the risks of short term market price instability and longerterm capacity adjustments to the federal government the goals are to maintain the economic health of the farm sector so that it can utilize the nations comparative advantages in natural infra structure and technology resources to be globally competitive the law mandates federal s upport for specific list of commodities for most of these commodities support began during 1930s depression era efforts to generally raise farm household income when commodity prices were low because of prolonged weak consumer demand wh ile initially intended to be temporary effort the commodity support programs survived but have been modified away from supply control and commodity stoc ks management to direct income support payments critics of commodity programs agree on the underlying fundamental economic conditions that make stability more difficult to achieve for agriculture than for some other sectors however they argue that 1 current programs are highly distorting of world production and trade 2 the levels of subsidies are high and have become capitalized into land prices and rents that raise the cost of pr oduction and make the united states less competitive in global markets14 and 3 the benefits are concentrated among comparatively sm all number of commodities produced on small number of large farms15 supporters of

reshape domestic s upport policy these include 1 the movement from federal budget surplus to r ecord annual deficits and the expectation of continuing large deficits for the foreseeable future and 2 the wto dispute settlement ruling against the united states in case brought by brazil concerning us cotton subsidies the federal deficit situation likely will constrain farm bill legislation more than was the case for the 2002 farm bill furthe rmore even if current law is extended intact forecast for high commodity pr ices likely will result in cbo budget baseline for commodity support that is lowe

3 2005 that certa in aspects of us cotton support step 2 marketing provisions and export credit guarantees functioned as illegal subsidies and must be removed as re sult of these developments key question likely to be asked of virtually every ne w us farm policy proposal is how it will affect us trade commitments to the wto in addition to the existing commitments the doha round negotiations before they co llapsed in july 2006 anticipated that the domestic amber box spending ceiling would be subject to new 20 initial cut from its current 191 billion level with further cu ts to follow the entire tenor of the doha round with the united states in the lead anticipated major reduction in production and tradedistortin g subsidies as well as the elimination of import barriers this gave impetus to serious examination of opport unities to make us farm subsidies greener19 while the doha round has b een indefinitely supsended the greening of farm support re mains serious consideration the policy trend across member count ries engendered by wto commitments and dispute settlement rulings has been to shift domestic support away from programs that are most marketdistorting ie amber box programs such as direct farm income and price supports linked to production and market prices and toward green box programs that cause minimal market distortion and are exempted from wto spending limits exempted from amber box limits ar decoupled farm subsidy payments these are payments not linked to current production decisions direct payments for the covered commodities fit into the exempt category the most notable exempted programs include such activities as agricultural research and extension conservation and the environment rural velopment food security stocks domestic food aid eg food stamps farm disaster payments and structural adjustment programs prospective issues and options payment limits questions of whether ther should be farmlevel limits on commodity payments and what those levels should be have been controversial for many years some argue that very large farms should not receive subsidies at all buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs16 20 the 2002 farm bill created commission on the application of payment limits for agriculture to examine the issues and its fi nal report is available at httpwwwusdagov ocereportspayment_limits 21 data are based upon the economic research service usda agricultural resource management survey arms available at httpwwwersusdagovbriefingfarmincome datagovpmtarms05salesclassxlsthat if they do at least there should be limits others argue that farm commodity programs should not discriminate based on fa rm size or any other income or wealth consideration because the goal is to stab ilize and s upport the entire sector not particular households in fact limits have been imposed on direct farm payments since the early 1970s when target price ficiency payments were first enacted20 the debate has intensified in recent years because payment money is increasingly going to comparatively small number of large farms for example in 2005 about 55000 farms with sales over 500000 received 57 billion 62 of the payment farms received 36 of the payments21 this concentration of payments has raised questions of equity and has been charged with contributing to the absorption of smaller farms by large farms tightening the payment limits also has been proposed as way to reduce the cost of the commodity programs when th ere are budget pressures in the fy2006 budget request to congress the usda in cluded proposal to save 12 billion over 10 years by tightening payment limits fro m the current level of 360000 per person to 250000 as well as counting commodity forfeitures and certificate gains toward the limits and applying the limits to dairy payments among commodities rice and cotton two southern crops have greater concentration of payments than do the other payment crops this has created largely regional split among some members of congress on the issue with many northerners favoring tighter limits and many southerners opposing any change supply controls and import quotas sugar and milk are the only two commodities currently supported by maintaining farm prices above what the market might otherwise dictate sugar utilizes nonrecourse loans and system of import tariff rate quotas and domes tic marketing allotments to limit supplies and support prices farm milk prices are indir ectly supported through usda purchases of surplus dairy products from dair processors at specified prices also dairy farms benefit from direct payments when market prices fall below mandated target price under the milk income loss contract m ilc program from established minimum farm prices for fluidgrade milk under fede ral milk marketing or ders and from dairy export subsidies through the dairy export incentives program deip at issue for congress is whether to continue programs that potentially raise market prices which critics contend are the most marketdistorting because they encourage excess production periodic efforts in the past to significantly alter or phase out these programs have not succeed ed supporters contend that the support mechanisms are necessary to protect farms from foreign competition while the importlim iting programs im pose little cost on the federal budget the producerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs17 subsidy reported to the wto for 2001 the most recent year reported by the united states amounted to 45 billion for milk and 11 billion for sugar some consideration has been given to direct payments as an alternative to supply controls however cost is majo r deterring factor target prices and deficiency payments were added to the milk support framework in the 2002 farm bill with projected cost estimate of 2 billion for fy2003 through fy2005 however change was made to the support price fo r milk consequently after its first two years of operation the milc program paid out over 2 bi llion and ccc dairy acquisitions cost 600700 million in fy2002 and fy2003 high milk prices in 2004 and 2005 kept surplus dairy product purchases to minimum another policy option possibly for sugar is buyout of the supply control features of price support the 2002 farm bill included buyout of peanut marketing quotas the supply control feature of the p eanut price support program the peanut quota buyout paid about 1221 billion to about 8600 farms averaging 142000 per farm as compensation for the loss in value associated with termination of peanut marketing quotas p eanut producers now r eceive the benefit of direct payments countercyclical payments and marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments tobacco marketing quotas on some 57000 farms were terminated after the 2004 crop and 96 billion will be paid out over 10 years as buyout compensation the equivalent of lump sum paym ent of 102000 per farm using 5 discount rate in contrast to peanuts tob acco buyout funds come from tobacco product manufacturers and future tobacco production is not set to bene fit from any federal support program green payments some contend that comm odity support programs should be replaced with incentive payments to prot ect natural resources such as land water air andor wildlife or possibly to nhance scenic recreational or open space amenities this concept has been tagged as green payments policy in the united states while in the european union eu it is called agrienvironmentalism while the term green reflects the environmental enhancing character of these programs such payments also typically qualify as green box under wto agriculture subsidy rules the 2002 farm bill included new conser vation security program csp that was

development policy in addition to meeting desirable social goals eu policymakers view shifting funds from commodity support to rural deve lopment including agrienvironmental programs as more compatible with multilateral efforts in the wto to curb domestic support while maintaining support that is not or is at most minimally trade distorting buyout of commodity programs the buyout of peanut and tobacco marketing quotas has stimulated thought about buyout of all commodity support programs agricultural economist david or den launched this di scussion at usdas 2005 agricultural outlook forum he suggested that buyout of the 2002 farm programs could focus on direct payments c ountercyclical payments andor loan rate price guarantees his analysis determin ed that buying out farm support payments would substantially raise s hortterm budget costs but would reduce expenditures in the long run22 other presenters at the forum asserted that buyout would only be effective if future congresses did not re enact support payments especially during the next downturn in the farm economy wh there likely would be pressure for additional assistance devolving commodity programs to the states economists at the usdas economic research service have examined the concept of shifting farm program funds to states ca lled devolution the argume nt is made that the wide diversity of us farms commodities land and water resources and problems argue for statedesigned responses that meet local objectives rather than national programs would devolution undermine national farm policy goals such as income stability for farmers and the econom or food security economists at ers respond probably not given the re latively small number of us farmers and the relatively small share of farming in the national economy stabilization of farmers incomes can be addressed through federal programs but also by private means such as forward pricing crop yield or revenue insurance futures and options and in contrast to the 1930s when the programs were initiated commodity programs have little redistributive effect as the bulk of payments goes to farm households with incomes above the us nonfarm average food security for the us longer depends exclusively on domestic production which means that national commodity policies are not the only determinant of whether americans have enough to eat23 decision to devolve all or most of the expected 10 to 15 billion in annual commodity payments to the states would involve difficult choices such as how to divide it among the states further the st ates could not be allowed to use the fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs19 in ways that violate international trad agreements however devolution could enable the states to change the objectives and mix of programs being delivered to their farmers and rural communities disadvantage of devolution policy is that the current recipients of farm subsidies likely would lose some or all of the benefits of future spending the expected consequence would be decline in land values and re duction in land rental rates to the extent that subsidies ve not been decoupled from production there could be some shifting of production between commodities and the lower land prices and lower rental rates could result in increased production if the lower costs of land make us producers more competitive in the global marketplace an advantage for the nation revenue insurance farmers now benefit from combination of income support payments to offset low prices nd indemnity payments to offset production losses this suggests an implicit target revenue goal on the part of the federal government supporting reve nue is reasonable because farmers pay their expenses with revenue however the various farm subsidy programs currently are designed and operated independen tly consequently the programs may fail to effectively support farm revenue for example genera lly poor weather such as widespread drought may drive crop prices up and mark eting loan and countercyclical payments down at the same time yiel d losses may not be sufficiently catastrophic to trigger crop insurance indemnity payments or to prompt congressional adoption of disaster payments similarly there are years when low prices are offset by high yields so that farm income is adequate to cover expenses yet on top of that there are substantial pricelinked support payments to further boost income for about the last decade several fe derally subsidized revenue insurance products have been offered to producers as part of the federal crop insurance program these policies indemnify for diminished revenue whether from reduced yield or from low market prices by 2004 revenue insurance was purchased on 126 million acres 60 of all eligible crop land in the crop insurance program possible option for the next farm bill is to expand current pilot programs so that producer can insure the revenue of the entire farm possibly including livestock rather than individual crops several ears of recent experience with federally subsidized revenue insurance now provi empirical information from which to evaluate universal farm reve nue insurance as farm suppor t alternative analysis at iowa state university indicates that modi fications can be made to current revenue insurance products that make them ideally suited to hit congressional revenue targets either low prices or low yields can trigger payment but low prices by themselves will not trigger payment if yields are high enough to raise revenue above the 90 percent level and low yields will not trigger payment if prices are strong enough in addition if payments arrive when aggregate market revenue exceeds its target level then at least the payments would flow to those regions that experienced inadequate revenue because of low yields rationalizing commodity disaster and crop insurance programs by replacing them with singlepayment program would increase program

linked with the major program crops in several ways for example according to november 2006 report by ers 80 of the nd planted to vegetables for processing sweet corn tomatoes dry beans and potatoes is located on farms that likely also receive direct and countercyc lical payments because they rotate the vegetable crops with program crops28 on the other hand some specialty crop pr oducers have testifie d strongly in favor of extending 2002 farm bill provision originating in the 1996 farm bill that restricts producers of the major commodities from planting fruits and vegetables on program acreage if they do not have hist ory of doing so these producers argue that allowing program crop producers to sw itch even small numbers of acres to fruits or vegetables would negatively aff ect existing growers annual income29 t h november 2006 ers report suggests that number of constraints likely would prevent largescale switchovers from program to specialty crops if the restriction were lifted but states that some individua l producers could be significantly affected finally some stakeholders and policymakers are calling for specialty crop issues to occupy larger role in farm bill policy discussions than in the past they assert that the traditional farm commodity s upport programs are under pressure from constraints on the federal budget from velopments related to existing

participate in livestock revenue insurance programs being administered by usdas risk management agency rma which provides protection from revenue losses whether due to natural causes or ec onomic conditions also congress or the administration periodically has made animal producers in declared disaster areas eligible for ad hoc federal payments mainly to help defray the cost of purchasing off farm feed following disaster affec ting onfarm feed production or permitted producers to use conservation lands for hayi ng and grazing whether the federal government should assume mo re of livestock

concentration the past several decades have seen rapid changes in the structure and business methods of animal agriculture production and ma rketing have been moving toward fewer and larger operations although the pace of these change s has varied widely across the sector for example smaller ie fewer than 100head cowcalf operations where beef cows are bred and born represent major ity of such

country of origin labeling cool for retail sales of red meats among other agricultural commodities supporters of the title cited statistics bout the growing proportion of cattle and hogs being slaughtered and processed by the top four firms which they believe limit their opportunities for selling animals and expressed concerns about increased livestock and meat imports pponents who argued that the title would stifle us competitiveness and undermine the business re lationships that producers willingly enter won deletion of the title during committee mark up however cool was added

meats including hr 2068 s 1300 and s 1333 still others eg s 135 s 1331 would have expanded cool requirements andor accelerated its current implementation date the contrasting intents of these bills reflected the continuing divergence of opinion among lawmakers over whether federallymandated labeling program is needed some contend that mandatory cool will provide us products with competitive advantage over foreign products because us consumers if offered clear choice prefer fresh foods of domestic origin thereby strengthening demand and prices for them moreover proponents argu that us consumers have right to know the origin of their food particularly at time when us food imports are increasing and whenever particular health and safety problems arise they cite as one prominent example concerns about the sa fety of some foreign beef arising from the discoveries of bovine spongiform ence phalopathy bse or mad cow disease in number of canadianborn cows and two us cows since 2003 supporters of the cool law argue that it is unfair to exempt meats and produce from the longstanding country labeling already requi red of almost all other imported consumer products from automobiles to most other foods th ey also note that many foreign countries already impose their own countryoforigin labeling opponents of mandatory cool counter that studies do not provide evidence that consumers want such labeling they believe cool is thinly disguised trade barrier intended to increase importers co sts and to foster the unfounded perception that imports may be inhere ntly less safe or of lowe r quality than us products food safety problems can as likely originat in domestic supplies as in imports as evidenced by the more than 30 recalls of us meat and poultry products announced by usda in 2006 alone these opponents point out opponents argue that all food imports already must meet equivalent us safety standards which are enforced by us officials at the border and overseas scientific principles not geography must be the arbiter of safety industry implementation and r ecordkeeping costs estimated by usda to be as high as 39 billion in the first year and 458 million per year after that would far outweigh any economic benefits critics dd cool proponents assert that these cost timates were grossly exaggera ted while some in industry claim they were too low animal identification for disease control one aspect of the cool debate was whether animal pr oducers would have to keep detailed records on their animals identity and whereabouts so that th government or reta ilers could properly verify country of origin many producer s do not believe that usdas agricultural marketing service should extend such require ments to the farm level because they are intrusive costly and unnecessary in meeting the intent of the law at the same time growing number of producers do seem to agree that some type of universal animal identification id prog ram would be beneficial tool in addressing animal disease problems outbreaks of animal diseases like avian influenza ai foot and mouth disease fmd brucellosis and tuberculosis are s een as perhaps the

about pr emium reduction plan prp currently being offered by usda the prp allows crop insurance companies that can demonstrate cost savings in their delivery of insurance to sell policies to their customers at discount for example one eligible company has reduced its costs by selling its policies directly to customers online independent agents who sell insurance on behalf of the crop insurance companies are concerned that the prp reduces their total commissions and damage s their profitability some farm groups contend that the plan encourages cherry picking of the best customers and might leave smaller farmers uninsured the fy 2006 agriculture appropriations act pl 10997 prohibited rma from using any of its funds to administer the prp for the 2007 crop year insurable yields an issue that was addressed in the agriculture risk protection act arpa of 2000 pl 106224 but continues to be of interest involves the concerns of farmers with multiple years of significant crop losses since the level of insurance cove rage is determined by an individual producers actual production history producers w ith multiple years of crop losses tend to have lower average historical crop yields and hence are assigned insurable crop yields that are reduced by these losses although pl 106224 placed limits on how low producers insurable yield could fall some producers still maintain that their assigned yields are below their potential production some groups also are concerned that participating producers hist orical crop yields underestima current yields being achieved with new technologies critics say that recent crop loss experience is more indicative of the current level of risk hence to assign higher yields might encourage production in high risk areas and increase government costs some even argue that certain areas simply may be unsuitable for crops that farmers have b ecame accustomed to planting to support their case critics point to usda data showing that some 21000 disaster

address emergency needs when major disaster strikes and that usda should have at its dis posal permanent source of disaster funds in the same manner as the federal emergency management administration

fore the credit crisis of the 1980s overall usda data show that debtto asset ratios for the farm sector have been stable or slightly declining over the past decade indicating that the sector is not highly leveraged with debt recent strength in farm income has given farmers more capacity to repay their loans or borrow ne w funds farm equity has been rising because increases in debt typically have been more than offset by larger gains in land values nonetheless despite the relatively strong farm economy in recent years some farmers continue to experi ence financial stress due to individual circumstances and may be unable to qualify for loans agriculture is also prone to business cycles thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs46 may pose financial difficulties thus many interests in

include four broad conservation topics land retirement funding levels green paymen ts and measuring accomplishments these topics could be integrated with each other or they could be addressed largely independently of each other other topics could include invasive species eradication encouraging the production of energy crops on conserved land and creating programs that apply to specified place such as designated watershed land retirement authorization to enter into new contracts under all of the land retirement programs conservation reserve and its subprograms wetlands reserve and grasslands reserve w ill expire at the end of fy2007 hence reauthorizing these programs and adjustin g them to respond to changing needs may be high priorities land retirement programs have been attractive to some producers in recent years because they have received rental payments at acceptable levels also conservationists and environmen talists have been pleased with the significant natural resource improvements to the agricultural landscape that have appeared on these lands these programs currently retire almost 40 million acres approaching 10 of the countrys cropland and their annual cost accounted for more than 40 of conservation spending in fy2005 the cons ervation reserve program is the largest retiring more than 35 million acres and is currently the most expensive conservation program as well however with the ex ploding market for ethanol driving higher prices especially for corn producer interest in land retirement may be declining some forecasts are that th higher commodity price levels may last for multiple years thus shrinking farmer interest in land retirement for some time in this changed setting there may be interest in retiring less land in the future and in giving some currently retired nd the opportunity to return to production one proposal for example would allow early withdrawal of certain lands from the crp without penalty if the land will be used to produce energy crops commodity users including those who need corn as feedstock for ethanol those who use corn for livestock feed and those who supply fo reign export markets want to make sure that cropland is not retired if it can be cropped and managed to protect the environment some analysts currently estimate that between 5 and 10 million additional acres of corn will need to be planted in 2007 to meet growing demand production agriculture and environmen tal interest groups likely will take opposing sides on some aspects of the polic debate for example wildlife groups may seek the continued benef its provided by large tracts of retired lands that provide natural habitat there may be opportunities to satisfy mu ltiple objectives by retiring small acreages or parts of fields that provide more concentrated environmental benefits eg stream buffers by creating more sitespecific or resourcespecific intensive treatments such as the current program to enroll isolated small wetlands or by prioritizing land retirement to achie ve such goals as habitat protection for endangered species or protecti on of wildlife migratory paths funding levels total funding for conserva tion has

farmers through the conservation reserve program c actual appropriations were close to 52 billion because congress limited mandatory funding in several programs by total of more than 400 million below the authorized amount the demand to participate in some c onservation programs also continues to grow major justification for the large increases in funding in the 2002 farm bill was to reduce or eliminate large and growing backlog of applications however participation and unfunded back logs remain large cong ress has options for dealing with the backlog by again increasing funding for these programs or by setting higherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs57 eligibility standards which likely would reduce applications and approvals it also may consider whether the relative funding for the current mix of approaches and programs between the land retirement and working lands programs remains appropriate green payments the term green payments refers to providing financial rewards to producers based on the extent of their conservation activities aside from any environmental benefits shift from commodity subsidies to green payments is seen by some as way to support farm income forge stronger link between conservation and farm income objectives and still comply with world trade organization wto obligations by qualifyi ng as green box if the program does not increase production and is not tradedistorting the conservation security program csp enacted in the 2002 farm bill is one model for translating the concept of green payments into program the csp was enacted as the first true entitlement pr ogram for conservation meaning that all producers who met eligibility qua lifications could receive payments some of its supporters thought it might become one of the largest conservation programs in terms of spending within few years however implementa tion has moved slowly and congress has tightly limited the funding each year congress likely will debate whether the csp based on what has been learned from the limited experience remains the preferred vehicle for providing green payments or whether other designs might be preferred some would like to use green payments as an additional way to support farmer income by replacing or supplementing some of the traditional commodity programs they view green payments as way to transfer funds to producers who provide environmental services such an approach has the potential to reach many more farms than now participate in federal c onservation programs based on analysis by the economic research service

the us agricultural sector most notably the escalating demand for corn as feedstock in ethanol production s driven grain and oilseed prices sharply higher since september 200652 prices for oilseeds

strong commodity prices have been greeted in some quarters as the longawaited economic breakthrough for the agricultural producer s and small towns but many market watchers policymakers nd producers from other agricultural sectors question the potential consequences of continued rapid growth of us biofuel production biofuels are liquid fuels produced from bi omass the major us biofuels are ethanol 98 from corn and biodiesel 90 from soybean oil fuel ethanol is generally blended in gasoline to redu ce emissions increase octane and extend gasoline stocks biodiesel is used directly as an

capacity currently in operation and another 44 billion gallons of capacity under construction and potentially online by early 200853 based on conversion rate of 275 gallons per bushel the rapid expa

biofuel concerns emerge the rapid growth in agriculture based biofuel producti on has generated sharp runup in corn and other grain and oilseed prices since september 2006 wh ile higher crop prices suggest higher incomes for crop producers the prospect of sustained higher livestock feed costs coupled with the likelihood of substantial expansion in corn planting have led many economists and market participants to question the unintended consequences of continued large federal incentives in suppor t of what has been very profitable ethanol sector in 2005 cerns include the following dedicating an increasing share of the us corn harvest to ethanol production will lead to higher prices for all grains and oilseeds that compete for the same land resulting in higher livestock feed costs potentially higher food costs and likely lower us agricultural exports54 potential large expansion in us corn planting whether due toexpansion onto more marginal so il environments or alteration of traditional cornsoybean rotation that dominates corn belt agriculture is likely to lead to increased soil tillage and the potential for higher levels of soil erosion increased applications of nitrogen fertilizer herbicides and other chemicals and the potential for run off or leeching and increased use of diminishing aquifers to irrigate production in the central plains in addition to the increased liv estock production costs associated with corn feeding proteinmeal markets are likely to experience further distortions associated w ith expanded production of the main ethanol byproduct

poultry and pork as result dairy and cattle operations located in reasonable proximity to an ethanol plant can substitute ddg for higher cost corn and soybean meal poultr and pork operations on the other hand are likely to see their feed costs increase with rising corn prices because of their limited ability to switch to the less expensive ddg expanding the national ethanol use mandate based on midwestern ethanol production implies increas ed pressure on the nations transportation infrastructure to ssist in delivering ethanol to non producing regions or to assist in livering corn to ethanol

increased significantly since the 1980s see figure 7 growth in funding since 1996 has brought the level back to about where it was in the early 1 990s when measured in inflationadjusted dollars scientists also point out that as in medical science the cost of new high tech equipment for cuttingedge agricultu ral research traditionally exceeds the inflation rate by significant percentage meaning that incremental increases often result in only level or even ne gative effective funding rates the rise in nominal dollars partic ularly from 1996 through 2001 was largely due to reduced

agencies in allocating the majority of its annual research appropriation to intramural research to projects designated by individual members and to block grants to the state land grant universities for their distribution among research areas in contrast the national institutes of health and the national science foundati on distribute the majority of their annual funding through competitive grants despite criticisms that the task of writing applications for competitive grants is costly use of researchers time the scientific community has used this method for decades and ma intains that peerreviewed competitive grants have proven to be the best means of eliciting the most qualified proposals and supporting the best research63 on the other hand it also has been argued that

of agriculture were initially established under grant to each state authorized by the morrill act of 1862 for th purpose of providing support for colleges of agriculture and mechanical artsreview may favor research that uses traditional approaches and focuses on more established subjects and may stifle more innovative proposals as expected proposals to distribut greater portion of usda research appropriations competitively cause concerns for both federal and state scientists given the historically flat budget for research scientists and administrators currently receiving funds tend to perceive proposed ch anges in funding mechanisms as threat proposal for national instit ute for food and agriculture policymakers and stakeholders have become increasingly interested in the idea of national institute for agricultural research partly to avoid controversy over reforming funding distribution methods within the curre nt system and also as way to separate the funding needs of the trad itional research programs from those of an institute having similar structure standing and purpose to the national institutes of health in the 2002 farm bill congress required usda to create task force to evaluate the merits of establishing national institutes focused on disciplines important to the progress of food and agriculture sciences hrept 107424 the task forces report delivered to th secretary of agriculture in july 2004 recommended the creation of national in stitute for food and agriculture nifa as separate and independent entity within usda64 the nifa would support basic research through competitively awarded peerreviewed grants and be under the direction of distinguished scientist the task force indicated that nifas annual budget provided through nnual appropriations

many farming and rural areas is compelling policymakers and rural areas to consider new sources of competitive advantage innovative ways of providing pub lic services to sparse populations and new ways of integrating agriculture into changing rural economies economic development efforts in some areas have targeted entrepreneurial strategies these approaches attempt to capitalize on particular areas social economic and environmental assets to build endogenously on existing strengths they seem to depend on development of local entrepreneurial culture linking public and private sources to build business incubators is common strategy as is developing ties with area colleges and universities communities also apply entrepreneurial energy to making their local governments schools and hospitals more efficient for example th rough telecommunication innovations currently widely touted rural devel opment strategy is the production of fuel ethanol from corn especially and also wheat and barley while ethanol is the most visible product other byproducts and cop roducts also may have rural development potential wet milling of corn for ethanol can also produce starches corn oil amino

longterm potential of rural or smaller communities development emphasis on quality growth eg income growth and higher per capita communityregional income can contribute to maintaining capital assets

income support may diminish in communities and regions that are illequipped to take on such burdens greater multijurisdictional planning and coordination among local and regional entities could be an effective strategy to achieve the scale efficiencies that too many communities will find difficult to achieve federal assistance may be needed catalyst evaluation and investment in infrastructure the evidence for the importance of infrastructure in rural economies is significant it increases the base of public capital it contributes to increased productivity and it increases direct employment eg

the current farm bill the administration tried unsuccessfully to use the annual appropriati ons process to make number of administrative and substantive changes in the food aid programs for example in fy2003 the presidents budget proposed that congre ss streamline impleme ntation responsibility for food aid programs by reducing the number of food aid programs and giving usaid responsibility for all development components of us food aid programs this would have meant that usaid would use title ii funding to carry out the kinds of development assistance provided unde r food for progress or section

by usaid for use in purchasing non us commodities for distribution in em ergency food aid programs farmers agribusinesses and private organizations that use food aid to finance development projects opposed this proposal which was s ubsequently rejected by both house and senate appropriators similar proposal in the fy2007 budget submission also was rejected by the appropriations committees us food aid issues raised in appropria tions debates may be considered during farm bill debate the idea of substituting cash for commodities for emergency relief could reemerge as c ongress debates food aid prog ram reauthorization it is argued that disaster response would be less expensive more efficient and more timely if cash were used to purchase em ergency food aid in countries where the emergency is happening or in regions nearby emergency commodity shipments from the united states for emergencies can take three to five months to arrive and often are longer needed when they do rrive also transportation costs currently account for about half the money appr opriated to finance pl 480 commodityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs82 donations for humanitarian re sponse to emergencies opponents argue that using cash to purchase emergency food aid w ould reduce us food aid because the coalition that supports commodity food aid farm groups and private voluntary organizations would not support cash program another issue that frequently arises dur ing appropriations bates concerns the allocation of food aid commodities be tween humanitarian emergencies and development projects although the 2002 fa rm bill mandates that threefourths of commodity donations be allocated to deve lopment projects unless waived by the president rarely has that level been met as demand for emergency food aid has burgeoned as result more commodities have been allocated to emergencies than to development activities in recent years organizations that use food aid to finance development projects along with their suppor ters in congress may seek ways to make food aid more reliable and dependable source of finan ce for development activities committee reports accompanying appr opriations bills since fy2003 have emphasized that pl 480 title ii was in tended primarily to support development activities and stressed the role of the bill emerson humanitarian trust as source of emergency food assistance the beht could become the subject of renewed interest as vehicle for pr oviding emergency food assistan ce leaving more scope for pl 480 title ii to be used for developmen t

schools are involved these program areas normally are dealt with through periodic child nutrition reauthorization laws and the next reauthorization is scheduled for 2009domestic nutrition assistance72 the nutrition title accounts for approximate ly 62 of all farm bill spending the lions share of this nutrition spending is for the food stamp program which is widely viewed as the federal government s primary response to the food needs of lowincome americans nutrition assistance programs all administered by usda also play role in federal support for the agricultural sector through direct commodity purchases and increased demand omnibus farm bills have become the legislative vehicle for reauthorizing expiring authorities and appropriations especially for food stamps and severa l smaller domestic food programs most recently the 2002 farm bill reauthorized ex piring nutrition program authorities and appropriations authoriz ations through fy2007 congress uses farm bills as an opport unity to review the administration effectiveness eligibility nd benefit rules and funding levels of some nutrition programs and as place for new initiativ in addition the nutrition title serves the political objective of bringing urban members into the farm bill process occasionally the large budget for nutrition pr ograms also serves as tempting target for other agriculture committee priorities when spending is constrained the usda oversees almost 20 domestic nutrition assistance programs spending some 54 billion in fy2006 over half of usdas outlays virtually all the programs are administered by states sc hools or local grantees under federally prescribed rules federal oversight of these programs eg regulations governing program operations is the responsibility of the usdas food and nutrition

outlays and are estima ted at 35 billion or more for fy2006 number of issues for the 2007 farm bill have emerged however as with the 2002 bill action on most of them will pend heavily on budgetary considerations major programs and issue areas are outlined below food stamps74 the food stamp program is the largest of all the nutrition assistance programs and accounts for 95 of the spending in the nut rition title of the farm bill it is the foundation for the federal effort to give lowincome households the chance to obtain at least minimally adequate diet and is major factor in overall federal policy of support for the poor the purpose and structure of the program has evolved over time it is meant to play role in three ar eas of federal public policy first food stamps originated as way of providing an outlet for surplus agricultural production with the notable side benefit of supporting poor familie s however its goals and role in the countrys support system for the wincome population have shifted and expanded greatly it continue s to pay for significant new food purchasing power thereby helping the agriculture sector second it now also is seen as th governments primary response to important concerns about the overa ll food security status of the lowincome population although onl an estimated 60 of eligible individuals choose to participate by the most recent count 2004 2006 usda economic research serv ice ers study reports that in 2005 11 of us households were food insecure and that the prevalence of very low food secu rity previously denominated as food insecure with hunger was 39 third the food stamp program has be come an integral part of the overall safety net for the needy it now ranks as the fourth largest needstested program and is the only nationally standard program aiding lowincome households acco rding to ers when its benefits are added to other income food stamps are estimated to move almost 10 of recipients out of poverty and for typical low income recipient family with children food stamps can provide some 25 of their purchasing powerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs85 75 to put these participation figures into persp ective it should be noted that the alltime high in food stamp participation was reached shortly before enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law 275 million persons month in fy1994 the alltime low for the modern program was in fy2000 172 million persons monthprogram design and operation the regular food stamp program provides inflationindexed monthly bene fits to lowincome households that supplement their own spending on food benefits vary by income household expenses like shelter costs and household size but generally not by state or region they are delivered through electronic benefit transfer ebt cards that are used like debit cards eligibility for food stamps is primarily based on households financial status monthly gross income must be be low 130 of the infla tionindexed federal poverty income guideline for the househol ds size eg 1800 for threeperson household and liquid assets must be under 2000 3000 for those households with elderlydisabled members howeve r some households can be categorically eligible if they participate in another incometested program like cash welfare and certain categories are barred irrespective of their financial need eg many noncitizens ablebodied adults without dependents not meeting work test program costs are shared with the st ates which administer the program under generally uniform federal rules the federal government pa ys the full cost of benefits and about half the cost of administra tion operating worktraining programs for recipients and outreach and nutrition educa tion efforts states pay the remainder the level of food stamp spending varies with participation which is closely linked to economic conditions and eligibility rules and benefit levels which are indexed to food costs and also reflect recipients income and nonfood expenses since the 2002 farm b ill participation has increased substantially from some 19 million persons per month in fy2002 to 261 million august 2006 and the average monthly benefit level has jumped fro m 80 person in fy 2002 to 94 in august 200575 costs have grown from 206 billion in fy2002 to more than 33 billion estimated for fy2006 finally the food stamp program has quality control system that measures the degree to which eligibility and benefit decisions are erroneously made the most recent national quality control statistics for 2005 show hist orically low error rates eg 45 of benefits overissued states with persistently high error rates can be assessed financial sanctions those with very low rates can receive bonus payments prospective issues and options the 2002 farm b ill greatly expanded eligibility for noncitizens raised benefits modestly for rger households by counting less of their income and allowed states to provide transitional food stamps for families leaving the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program in addition the 2002 bill set up number of stat options to ease access to the program and administrative burdens on applicants recipients and program operators and revamped the quality control system to reduce the number of states subject to financial sanctions and gran t bonus payments to states demonstrating exemplary administrative performance virtually program cuts were madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs86 preliminary list of major potential issue areas that have emerged at this time includes the following eligibility proposals to both loosen and tighten current rules governing the eligibility of noncitizens are likely the house version of the bill implementing spending reductions to comply with the fy2006 budget reconciliation m easure would have further limited eligibility for noncitizens moreover any changes made in immigration law may call for revision of food stamp eligibility rules currently states may make house holds participating in states temporary assistance for needy families tanf programs categorically eligible automatica lly eligible for food stamps the administration contends that states have taken advantage of this rule to make those with financial resources well bove normal food stamp standards eligible simply by providing some minimal tanf linked services various limits on categorical eligibility have been advanced opponents of the current restrictions on participation by ablebodied adults without children abawds which bar eligibility after three months unless the individual meets work related test contend that they s hould either be abolished as too punitive and administratively complex or eased these restrictions were put in place in the 1996 welfare reform law assets current policy excludes most but not all retirement savings from consideration as assets when testing for food stamp eligibility the administration and others have supported disregarding all retirement savings to avoid pena lizing those who have saved for retirement but are temporarily in need the food stamp programs dollar asset limits have not been significantly changed in over 25 years number of critics argue that they should be raised or abolished to encourage saving and simplify administration use of benefits food stamp benefits can be used for virtually any food purchase they cannot be used for alcohol tobacco hot prepared food or dietary supplem ents food choice has been recurring theme in food stamp po licy debates critics argue that nutritionrelated limits should be pl aced on the types of food that can be bought with food stamps or that incentives be provided to purchase nutritional food items in addition another group of critics has proposed an ex pansion to allow food stamps to be used for dietary supplements as in the nate version of the 2002 farm bill benefit levels food stamp benefits are increased for those with high shelter costs in relation to their income but there are significant limits to this rule as in earlier farm bill debates program advocates would like to see these limits removed again as in earlier farm bills there are longstanding calls to increase or index the minimum benefit it has not been changed since the 1970s and is seen as so low that it discourages participati on arguing that the value of food stamp benefits has been eroded some advocates would ask thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs87 76 authorized under 1 section 27 of the food stamp act 7 usc 2036 and 2 the emergency food assistance act 7 usc 75017516either the maximum bene fit be raised or that the standard amount of income disregarded for all househol ds be increased effectively providing an acrossthe board benefit increase administration number of states ve taken or are taking major steps to revamp the way they administer food stamps medicaid and the tanf program while food stamp law requires that final eligibilitybenefit decisions be made by government employees these initiatives can invol ve privatizing contracting out many backoffice administrative tasks and modernizingstreamlining administration through efforts like performing program intake by computer application in both cases resulting in cost savings from fewer staff and offices and it is hope d better client service there are federal standards for these types of initiatives eg with respect to client serviceaccess pilot testing and many of those watching the current initiatives argue that some minimum standards should be set legislatively as the result of experiences related to hurricane katrina some have proposed allowing or requiring the federal government to incr ease its share of food stamp administrative costs above the normal 50 in the case of major disasters program access although the participation rate among food stamp eligibles has increased noticeably since 2002 when number of changes were put in place to encourage this it still is only 60 and program advocates argue that further steps need to be taken procedural rules governing how applicants and recipients are treated as well as rules relating to eligibility for applicants participating in other public assistance programs could be changed to ease access to food stamp benefits fo r eligible households the emergency food assistance program tefap76 tefap was begun in 19811982 as tempor ary expedient designed at least initially to dispose of huge stocks of governmentheld food commodities and to address legislatively manda ted reductions in food assi stance programs an economic recession and concern over hunger and homelessness among the needy the 1983 emergency food assistance act gave the pr ogram official status and authorized funding for administrative and distribution costs in the early years through fy1988 th only significant federal expenditures involved were appropriations for administra tivedistribution costs the commodities provided were socalled bonus commodities those acquired for farmsupport reasons and held in excess of what was needed to fulfill other federal commitments eg to school meal programs the blishment of tefap helped reduce federal commodity stocks and storage costs associated with them provided an alternativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs88 77 authorized under sections 4 and 5 of the agriculture and consumer protection act of 1973 7 usc 612c notesource of f ood assistance for the n eedy and was instrumental in supporting and expanding network of em ergency food aid providers in 1988 responding to the lack of bonus commodity inventories congress began the practice of mandating funding for tefap commodities thereby creating minimum entitlement to certain level of commodity assistance this entitlement component was wr itten into in permanent law by the 1996 welfare reform act pl 104193 which guaranteed the program 100 million year increased to 140 million in the 2002 farm bill additi onal bonus commodities continued to be made available differing each ear according to usda acquisitions program design and operation under tefap the federal government provides food commodities to states along with grants for administrative and distribution costs this ssistance supplements other s ources of food aid for needy persons and often is provi ded in concert with food bank and homeless shelter projects eligibility decisions for tefap as both to recipients and participating emergency food providers are made by states in addition to their allocation of the 140 million in entitlement commodities each state receives share of the 50 milli on year appropriate d as discretionary money to fund expenses associated with administration and distribution storage transportation of the commodities states entitlements to tefap commodities are supplemented with bonus commodities about 150 million in fy2005 that the usda has acquired in its ag riculture support programs prospective issues and options the 2002 farm bill increased the level of entitlement commodities to 140 million year since the 2002 farm bill bonus commodity donations from usda stocks to tefap have droppe d dramatically from over 240 million in fy2003 to about 150 million in fy2005 with estimates of less than 100 million for fy2006 because usda commodities provide an important underpinning to emergency f ood assistance providers activities and they have come to rely on them there are ca lls from providers and others for the 2007 farm bill to substantially increase the level of entitlement commodity assistance above the current 140 million year commodity supplemental food program csfp77 the csfp was originally established in the late 1960s under the authority of series of appropriations ws to provide aid to lowincome women pregnant and postpartum infants and children who at that time had other food assistance program to turn to for aid specific to their needs since then the special supplemental nutrition program for wome n infants and children the wic program has largely taken ove r this role however the csfp continues to operate and now serves mostly elderly lowincome individuals who either need extra help beyond food stamp benefits or are re luctant to apply for food stampshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs89 program design and operation the csfp provides supplemental foods to lowincome elderly persons and some lowincome pregnant postpartum and breastfeeding women infants and children through over 140 projects in 32 states the district of columbia and on two indian reservations eligibility is limited to those with income below 130 of the federal poverty income guidelines about 13000 year for one person the foods are purchased by the usda and distributed through local grantees and food packages receive d and distributed by csfp projects are designed with the nutr itional needs of recipients in mind csfp grantees also receive signif icant funding for administrative costs the program is discretionary program pending on annual appropr iations decisions and commodities and administrative funding ge nerally are apportioned by the number of persons served in the prior year if new money is appropriated or allocated slots are not used new projects can be added the commodities provided by usda are of two types 1 entitlement commodities bought with annually appropriated funds and included in the food packages nd 2 bonus commodities donated from usda stocks and provided in addition t or as part of food packages in fy2005 the csfp served over 500000 persons month 90 of whom were elderly some 82 million in entitle ment commodities and 38 million worth of bonus commodities were distributed food pack ages were valued at between 18 and 21 per person per month adminis trative cost support was 29 million prospective issues and options the 2002 farm bill increased the proportion of appropria tions earmarked for administrative costs in its fy2007 appropriations request th administration proposed terminating the csfp as duplicative of other programs the wic pr ogram and food stamps however neither the house nor the senate fy2007 agriculture appropriations measures adopted this position csfp advocates have for number of years called for change in rules that would boost the income eligibility limit from 130 of the federal poverty guidelines to 185 and are likely to ra ise the issue again in the 2007 farm bill fresh fruit and vegetables the 2002 farm bill addressed for the first time the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables in schools because of grow ing concerns over childhood obesity and the types of foods offered through school meal programs it also provided support for seniors farmers market nutrition program sfmnp program design and operation pilot project was established under which small number of schools in limited number of states and indian reservations received funding to offer free fre sh fruit and vegetables to students the project was expanded given mandatory annua l funding and made permanent through the 2004 child nutrition reauthorization w pl 108265 and further expanded and given added money in pl 10997 in fy2006 about 400 schools in 14 states and three indian reservations received suppor t for this project with funding of 15 million the 2002 law also required that minimum of 50 million year be spent on fresh fruit and vegetables to be acquire d for school meal programs through the department of defense fre sh program dod freshhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs90 finally the 2002 bill provided statutory authority and mandatory funding for the sfmnp under which lowincome senior s receive vouchers that they may redeem at farmers markets and roadside stands for fresh fruit and vegetables like similar program for wic recipients prospective issues and options the fresh fruit and vegetable program set up by the 2002 farm bill has prove d popular and both the house and senate appropriations bills for fy2007 included si gnificant expansion in funding and the number of states covered it is possible that various proposals for further growth in the program would be advanced for th 2007 farm bill recommendations for continuation of and added support for the dod fresh setaside or similar initiatives also can be expected proposed change in the sfmnp is likely to be provision barring the use of sfmnp funds to pay sales ta xes coupled with rule disregarding the value of sfmnp benefits as fi nancial resources for tax and public assistance purposes this has been proposed by the administrati on was included in the house and senate fy2007 appropriations measures and mirrors what is now done for the wic farmers market programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33037crs91
