focal point for disabled service members and their families to resolve pay and promotion problems receive assistance through the medical evaluation and retirement process and aid in the seamless transition to the depa rtment of veterans affairs the fy2006 national defense authorization act further requires dod to prescribe comprehensive policies and procedures for these programs that will be uniform across the services to the extent practicable although each program appears successful there may be some aspects of these programs that could be nefit from further refinement 1 guidance these support programs appear to be reflection of the genuine concern by civilian and military leaders w ho place high priority on caring for wounded military personnel however these programs were established independently by different authorities and at differe nt times during 2004 and 2005 th ere is dodcoordinated directive or instruction that established complementary service roles delineated responsibilities set eligibility criteria or mandated standa rdized metrics for program evaluation this lack of coordinated guidan ce could result in inefficient or inequitable care among the various services 2 eligibility dod and each of the services established their own program eligibility criteria so there is little consistency across the pr ograms for example dods msi program will assist anyone who contacts them while the army is relatively rigid and requires participants to be classified as special category and hold 30 army disability rating to be eligible potential dup lication of effort also exists because the dod program will assist any service member while the other programs are service specific httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22366crs6 7 pl 109163 january 6 2006 119
