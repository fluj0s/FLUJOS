diallo united nations nations unies office of internal oversight services unhcr audit service audit of unhcr operations in chad ar200411106 executive summary in november and december 2004 oios conducted an au dit of unhcr operations in chad the audit covered activities with total expenditure f us 23 million in 2004 audit observations were shared with the representative in december 2004 on which comments were received by january 2005 the representative has accepted most of the recomm endations made and is in the process of implementing them overall assessment oios assessed the unhcr operations in chad as below average while oios noted significant improvements compared to the previous audit there were still weaknesses which taken together or individually impaired the overall system of int ernal control in particular in the areas of procurement warehousing fleet management and with respect to implementing partners additional efforts by management are required to si gnificantly improve the application of key controls the problems identified could to large extent be attributed to the lack of continuity of professional staff in all areas programme financ human resources and logistics there was still too heavy reliance on staff on shortterm mission s as the staffing situation stabilizes and more and more staff are assigned oios expects the situa tion to improve programme management for two of the four partners reviewed reasonable ssurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accord ance with the subagreements for secadev and crt that were entrusted unhcr funds totalling n early us 12 million the accounting and internal control systems established were found to be deficient and weaknesses identified in oios previous audit still persisted the representation proposes to discontinue partners hip with crt in the south and will monitor secadevs activities clo sely project financial and performance monitoring was sa tisfactorily performed though oios suggested closer monitoring of those partners with less than adequate systems and procedures and those allocated large budgets secadev was incorrectly paid us 32000 as overhead support costs the representation stated that overhead costs paid to secadev earlier were re moved from the revised budgets and the amounts incorrectly paid recovered also though not authorized to do so secadev ch arged unhcr some us 73000 as rental cost for use of t heir own vehicles in the subproject and an additional us 19500 as repair costs for the same vehicles the representation disallowed portion of the inadmissible charges and recovered t hese amounts from the partner gtz spent more than us 3 million on transport serv ices without proper competitive bidding and without signing formal contracts the partner did not economically manage the large logistical operation involving prolonged reliance on large f leet of privately rented trucks with very high rental rates the representation informed oios that with the arrival of unhcrs fleet of trucks including tankers the need for renting private tru cks on such large scale should not arise in the future unhcrs five per cent contribution to international ngo support costs was paid without partners contributing at least comparable amount to the project also the failure to exclude major local procurement budgets from the calculation resulted i n the overpayment of support costs of some us 93000 to partners the representation stated that strict application f the unhcr rules was not possible as large number of ngos were engage d in the operations at very short notice this was rectified to some extent during the decemb er 2004 revisions and the rule would be carefully applied in 2005 supply management procurement was identified by oios as an area of co ncern with instances of inefficient and uneconomic purchasing due to lack of advance planni ng and nonobservance of prescribed procedures the representation has submitted their procurement plans for 2005 warehouse management and controls in place were wea k and required significant improvement shortages observed by oios were attributed to theft and the matter referred to the inspector generals office as staff members were involved in the pilfering of computers valued at us 18000 the representation pointed to the lack of qualifi ed local staff and absence of trained professionals and added that action has been taken to address the situation asset management had improved albeit work was stil l required to update assettrak records correct inaccurate entries and to convene the local asset management board regularly security and safety security issues identified during oios previous au dit have been satisfactorily addressed some additional measures still remained to be implemente d as the security phase had been raised administration in some areas in administration and finance the hcr offices in chad were not fully complying with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures oios found overpayments of solar and dsa totalling some us 22000 of which some us 14000 has already been recovered by the repres entation the representation agreed to recover the remaining amounts for staff provided with accommodation in the soa nly us 10 per day was charged instead of the prescribed 25 per cent deduction of the solar r ate us 25 per day the representation stated that recovery at 25 per cent would cause fru stration among staff due to the present difficult living conditions in the field this

november 2004 to 10 december 2004 oios conducted an audit of unhcrs operations in chad the audit was conducted in acc ordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing oi reviewed the activities of the unhcr representation in chad and its suboffice so in beche and of four of its implementing partners 2 oios previous audit of unhcr operations in chad was conducted between march and june 2004 and focused on 2003 activities covering xpenditure of us 64 million the operation was assessed as seriously deficient due t the lack of sound and proper internal controls and as partners performance was marked by an absen ce of accountability oios accordingly recommended implementation of immediate corrective measures 3 following the massive influx of refugees from the d arfur region of sudan in 2003 an equally large protection and care and maintenance p rogramme was established mainly in the east although the initial emergency phase is stabilizing many refugees still live in precarious situations facing the constant danger of incursion s across the border unhcr has reestablished its presence in the east and provides assistance to refugees through number of implementing partners 4 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the audited activities du ring the exit conference held on 10 december 2004 audit observations detailing the audit findi ngs and recommendations were shared with the representative in december 2004 the detailed comm ents which were received in january 2005 are reflected in this report the representation has accepted most of the audit recommendations made and is in the process of imple menting them ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to ev aluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets and compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subagreements iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on 2004 programme activit ies up to october 2004 under projects 04abchdls403 and 04sbchdcm230 with expendit ure of us 144 million our review concentrated on the activities implemented by secou rs catholique et developpement secadev expenditure of us 623000 intersos expenditure of us 904000 gtz expenditure of us 47 million and croix rouge tcha dienne crt expenditure of us 2 543000 oios also reviewed activities directly im plemented by unhcr with expenditure of us 26 million 7 the audit reviewed the administration of th representation at ndjamena and suboffice abeche with administrative budgets totalling us 8 9 million for 2004 and assets with an acquisition value of us 77 million and current value of us 66 million the number of staff working for the unhcr operation in 2004 was 268 t his included staff on regular posts united nations volunteers and staff on mission 8 the audit also followed up on findings and recommen dations made in the 2004 oios audit report regarding the serious deficiencies ide ntified in administrative expenditure supply chain activities as well as the weak controls estab lished by implementing partners 9 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data physical verification of stock and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners 10 for intersos and gtz reasonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subagreements however for secadev and crt oios assessed that the accounting and internal control systems established for the unhcr subprojects were deficient impr ovement had been made since the previous audit and in oios view these persistent weakness significantly undermined the ability of the partners to account for expenditures and report on programme implementation audit certificates for 2004 were not yet due at the time of our audit secadev accounting system 11 secadev was assigned responsibility under the subproject for camp management and the distribution of food and nonfood items secad ev had computerized general ledger accounting system called saari which allowed the t racking of disbursements by budget line and by donor this system was used by secadev for its own internal accounting requirements but not for unhcrs subprojects instead expenditu re was recorded and controlled on excel spreadsheets by simply listing the invoices an alysis of the expenditure by budget line was made in the absence of budgetary control system numerous budgetary overruns were noted most significantly under transport contracts and sa laries the representation stated that budgetary overrun under transport contracts was att ributed to very high rental rates prevailing due to heavy demand of vehicles locally as compare d to the budget estimates an oios audit of secadev in 2001 had revealed the same weaknesses ios regrets that three years later improvement was visible oios reiterated its recomm endation regarding the installation of an effective accounting system for tracking and report ing on unhcr expenditures the representation and secadev accepted the recommendat ion and also proposed to engage an accountant to manage the system 3 overhead charges 12 as local ngo secadev is not eligible fo r headquarters support costs nonetheless budget provision was made totalling some fcfa 21 1 million us 41000 as well as fcfa 11 million us 2000 for institutional cost as at 30 september 2004 secadev had charged some fcfa 165 million us 32000 against these budget lines the representation acknowledged the error and stated that overhead cos ts paid to secadev earlier were removed from the revised budgets and that unhcr did not cov er these costs the amounts already charged us 32000 were recovered by adjustment f rom subsequent instalments paid to the partner procurement 13 oios noted that there was budgetary ove rrun of some fcfa 51 million us 98000 against transport costs this resulted as secadev was charging rental cost to unhcr for the use of vehicles owned by them from oios review f two internally generated invoices dated 1 june 2004 and 9 august 2004 the amount charged was fcfa 378 million us 73000 these costs could not be substantiated had not been budg eted for nor subsequently authorized by unhcr oios accordingly recommended for recovery f the amounts charged to unhcr for such rentals secadev stated that as unhcr had only provided them with only one vehicle for the management of three camps they decided to rent their own vehicles to unhcr using the same rental rate negotiated by unhcr with private t ransport companies us 135 per day after discussions with the ngo and taking into cons ideration that secadevs contribution of vehicles at the outset of the emergency was useful the representation deducted an amount of fcfa 189 million us 36400 from the final payme nts representing 50 per cent of the rental costs charged by secadev to unhcr towards use of th eir own vehicles for operations under the subproject the remaining charges were consid ered as legitimate operational costs for fuel drivers maintenance wear and tear and other oper ational costs which were not covered by gtz or unhcr 14 in addition to the rental charges secadev charged fcfa 102 million us 19500 to unhcr for the repair costs of the rented vehicles oios highlighted that for similar vehicles directly rented by unhcr from private transporters at daily cost of us 135 the cost of repair was included in the flat rate paid the representation stated that the vehicle repair c harges of us 19500 were also left out from the revised budg et and the supplementary agreement signed in december 2004 did not cover these costs the am ounts already charged us 19500 were recovered from the partner b gtz 15 gtz was the principal implementing partner for unhcr operations in the east of the country logistical operations constituted the mai n activity undertaken by gtz this included rental and management of private trucks maintenanc and repair of unhcr vehicles and storage of nonfood items significant procurement activit ies were undertaken totalling some us 54 million and representing over 90 per cent of the an nual budget most of this money was spent on transport services over us 3 million and fuel ver us 755000 4 transport contracts 16 oios review showed that gtz had formal procurement procedures at ndjamena and abeche despite the sizeable levels of procurement proper competitive bidding was carried out and proper approval procedures such as the establishment of committee on contracts were in place also although more than us 3 mill ion was disbursed on transport services formal contracts were signed and the criteria for t he selection of the transport companies were not documented gtz stated that the tender for the transport cts had been jointly processed with unhcr documents substantiating this claim were provide d to oios gtz only recently october 2004 introduced contracts but there was still evidence that the companies were selected competitively 17 oios observed several deficiencies in the management and monitoring of the transport contracts earlier the senior emergency officer in his mission report dated 27 july 2004 had also warned of numerous logistical problems at the time of the audit many of the issues raised had still not been addressed gtzs operation was not c osteffective as the rental rates applied which generally included fuel and drivers were on the high side eg us 770 per day for 60 seater bus us 576 per day for 20t truck and us 430 per day for water tanker oios understands that reasonable rental rate for wat er tanker in other operations would be some us 200 per day only the representation stated that the fact that chad i s landlocked country makes the costs of most goods and services extremel high and that the rates obtained by gtz compared well with the general market situation in chad transport invoices for nfis for significant sums were paid even though there was indication on the payment voucher or in the supporting documentation of the tonnage and distanc carried certification that the services were satisfactorily rendered or delivered was also not vailable the value of the transport contracts was significant but there were central records on the value and quantity of goods or the number refugees transported 18 fleet management involving the monitoring and control of the privately rented trucks was deficient and according to reports the badly maint ained vehicles suffered from frequent breakdowns resulting in substantial idle time while conceding poor fleet management gtz attributed this to the lack of proper planning by u nhcr field offices also road conditions were poor as were the condition of the vehicles gtz dded that on numerous occasions the transport contractors had been requested at unhcrs instance to prefinance activities sometimes to the extent of us 1 million in such circumstances the quality of service would naturally decline the representation stated that with the augmentatio n of its own fleet reliance on rented vehicles would reduce fuel management 19 oios confirmed the findings of the senior emergency officer whereby gtz continued to procure fuel through an unsatisfactory contract arr angement from local supplier it had been recommended that unhcr negotiate contract for bul k supplies to the east of the country however appropriate action had not been taken and gtz continued to rely on the local supplier 20 fuel was supplied in drums which resulted in spillage and inaccurate measurement so abeche reported that fuel shortages and stock outs had been experienced in 2004 gtz claimed that fuel procurement had been done in costeffec tive manner and that the fuel shortages could be attributed to inadequate release of instalments by unhcr controls over the issuance of fuel 5 were found to be inadequate they consisted of hand written slips which were not issued in sequential order and were not countersigned by the driver confirming receipt of the fuel in the absence of any additional checks assurance coul d be obtained that the quantity of fuel paid for was indeed drawn and used for legitimate purpo ses gtz informed oios that it was the contractors who had prepared the handwritten invoic but that for its part gtz only used pre numbered fuel vouchers other additional controls such as the introduction of the fuel management system have also been initiated 21 distribution networks had not been set up in the east of the country with none of the 14 fuel bladders rubber fuel tanks installed in the various field locations established gtz informed that the fuel bladders would be in place b january 2005 at abeche goz beida and iriba the representation stated that during 2005 procurement of fuel would be done by unhcr with gtz retaining responsibility for its ma nagement and distribution unhcr have also requested that gtz provide fuel distribution r eports for 2004 as well as monthly reports in 2005 c croix rouge tchadienne 22 oios noted that serious shortcomings conti nued to persist crt had not set in place proper books of account and internal controls were still absent the project control staff at the representation had noted similar deficiencies and h ad made recommendations for improvement including the hiring of qualified accountant action had been taken by crt to improve systems and procedures and strengthen internal cont rols in oios view these recurrent weaknesses significantly undermined the partners bility to account for unhcrs funds the representation concurred with oios and stated that they would discontinue the partnership with crt in the south while the association in the east would continue only if the ifrc agreed to jointly implement the subprojects through tripar tite agreement d intersos 23 oios observed that expenditures were often not adequately supported especially for cash payments where there was receipt or any other p roof of payment in the majority of the cases only an invoice was available to justify the disbur sement and often there was neither purchase order nor any evidence of delivery of the goodsser vices significant improvement is necessary to strengthen internal controls 24 moreover intersos did not apply unhcr ip procurement guidelines and transport companies had not been selected after competitive b idding the reasons for the selection of companies were not documented corrective action will be taken under the supervisi on of sub office abeche b other programme issues financial and performance monitoring 25 oios assessed that project financial and p erformance monitoring was satisfactorily performed oios reviewed available verification rep orts prepared at ndjamena and abeche and were satisfied with the coverage and analysis f the reviews oios suggested that the verification reports include comments on the perfor mance aspects of the subprojects for 6 large partners and partners assessed as weak the f requency of monitoring visits should be increased the representation will take appropriate remedial ction minimum standards in camps 26 vital parameters such as for water availab ility number of latrines medical facilities and education are far below the acceptable levels at mo st of the camps as outlined in internal monitoring reports prepared by so abeche at amnab ak some 16000 inhabitants and mile some 14000 inhabitants camps the daily per capi ta of water availability was merely 74 and 98 litres respectively against the norm of minimum of 15 litres per day the global per capita availability for all camps was some 125 litres per day the situation of latrines at these camps was grave at both the above camps with 428 amnabak and 100 mile persons sharing one toilet against the norm of less than 20 persons pe r toilet evidently considerable work is still required by unhcr to meet minimum standards and to improve the present precarious situation the representation is aware of the situation and ex pects matters to improve in 2005 headquarters support costs 27 oios found that partners were receiving th five per cent headquarter overhead cost without contributing comparable amount to the ind ividual project or the country operation also the amount budgeted and subsequently charged by partners was not reduced when significant portion 30 per cent of the subprojec t budget related to local procurement oios estimated that partners were overpaid by some us 9 3000 for headquarter support costs the representation stated that strict application of th unhcr rules was not possible as many ngos were engaged in the operations at very short notice this was rectified to some extent during the december revisions and the rule would b carefully applied in 2005 c supply management procurement 28 procurement was identified by oios as an rea of concern for both unhcr and implementing partners numerous instances were fou nd where efficient and costeffective procurement was not done nonadherence to procure ment procedures was particularly marked in so abeche in part this was attributable to th emergency nature of the situation the lack of advance planning and in the eastern region to c ertain extent as result of restricted market environment which did not foster open competition oios recognized however that once training was provided to staff the adherence to pro curement procedures had improved considerably the representation acknowledged that procurement pr ocedures were not always observed due to urgency and lack of trained logisti cs personnel to promote adherence to prescribed procurement procedures by partners unhc r has distributed ip procurement procedures to all partners and training is also env isaged 29 competitive bidding was waived for several large contracts entered into in 2004 since the emergency situation has now stabilized oios ggested that whenever feasible contracts are concluded following competitive bidding procedures 30 purchasing plans were not prepared in mely manner procurement lists were still not available for 2004 and the logistics unit was unabl to indicate the quantity and value of 7 purchases undertaken during the year the representation attributed the situation to the high turnover of staff and the lack of suitable trained personnel and has since prepared the procurement plan for 2005 and will also ensure that procurement lists are routinely prepared and updated warehouse management 31 oios review of the ndjamena warehouse sh owed that adequate segregation of duties was not in place for the receiving recording safe guarding and despatching goods the supply clerkstorekeeper was entrusted with several incomp atible functions the warehouse issue and receiving records did not consistently show the po number and the waybill number numerous erasures and corrections were made to the bin cards and the storekeeper did not initial the outgoingincoming goods goods were issued from st ock without following the correct authorization procedures the binstock cards were not up to date which was vital considering the high movement of stocks the physical security over the entrance and exit of the warehouse was lacking and needed to be improved 32 oios identified discrepancies while physic ally verifying the stock of computers and recommended that review be conducted following inventory verification by the representation it was discovered that 11 computers valued at some us 18000 had been stolen from the warehouse the representation further reported that the two st aff members had been arrested and were under police investigation oios has referred the matter to the inspector generals office for further investigation goods lost in transit 33 consignment of tents valued at us 2250 0 was despatched to the field in april 2004 and of these some 80 tents valued at us 10000 wer lost the circumstances of the loss were unclear the contract with the responsible transpo rter was terminated for poor performance prior to resolving the issue of the lost consignment followup action had been initiated by the representation and it is not clear due to the abs ence of information at the representation whether the loss could be recovered under an insura nce claim the representation stated that this case remained unresolved due to pressure of wo rk and the absence of trained staff it was added that the dismissed contractor had complained to the chamber of commerce and that unhcr submitted an appropriate response given the circumstances of the case however the representation deemed it proper not to further purs ue the case in order to save on legal fees and time asset management 34 there was noticeable improvement in this area the assettrak was installed both at the representation at ndjamena and at so abeche most of the assets had been recorded and records were generally accurate at the representati on at ndjamena for so abeche inaccuracies were observed and the current value of certain item s was overstated eg toyota 4x4 with purchase price of us 20000 was shown with net b ook value of us 344000 oios estimated that the total value of assets was overstated by ab out us 2 million according to the logistics unit the overstatement arose as the us dollar pur chase price was incorrectly expressed in fcfa oios recommended that physical inventory b carried out especially for assets with implementing partners to ascertainconfirm the val idity of the entries in assettrak 8 35 lamb was established in april 2004 and recently renewed september 2004 but it was not being regularly convened although several sset issues needed to be dealt with although the appropriate documentation policy reports gs4 5s had not been prepared the representation indicated that they would take remed ial action to update assettrak correct wrong entries and to convene the lamb regularly in 2005 fleet managementprivate use of vehicles 36 the selection of garages for the repairma intenance of unhcr vehicles was until recently made on the basis of three pro forma invoices fro m december 2004 the logistics unit decided on sms advice that vehicles should exclusively be taken to the local toyota dealer even though this was an expensive option considering that in 2004 some us 50000 was paid for the repair and maintenance of the vehicles in ndjamena oios recommended that competitive bidding exercise be carried out and the approval of the sel ection of the garage be made by the lcc and not by the logistics unit similarly competitive bidding exercise should be undertaken for vehicle insurance as the current provider had not been selected competitively and in 2004 some us 20000 had been paid for insurance the representation stated that there was major shortfall in the quality and availability of garage s in chad since the current providers future was uncertain it was being considered whether gtz could be vested with the responsibility for maintenance and repair of unhcr vehicles competiti ve bidding would be carried out to select the insurance provider d security and safety 37 many of the security issues identified dur ing oios previous audit have been satisfactorily addressed there is still need h owever to implement some other requirements for instance the field security handbooks had s till not been distributed to the staff official vehicles have not been registered with local author ities first aid kits were not available in all vehicles and plastic film had not been installed on glass windows in the office premises to make them shatterproof in recent development since late 2004 the security phase in ndjamena has been raised from i to ii iii in the rest of the co untry this implies additional security measures such as security alarm systems at staff residences etc administration 38 in the areas of administration and finance oios noted improvements since the last audit of march and april 2004 although shortcomings were seen with respect to solar payments settlement of travel claims vari and few other m atters solar payments incorrect payment of living allowance 39 certain discrepancies and inaccuracies wer noted in the application of the solar instructions for example living allowance is n ot payable to solar recipients while undertaking mental health travel the representati on erroneously paid this to 15 staff members resulting in an overpayment of some us 10500 oios was pleased to note that the representation very promptly reviewed all of the ca ses and has so far recovered some us 6300 and that the balance will be recovered shortly 9 b erroneous determination of eligibility to solar 40 staff members on travel status to the spec ial operations area soa are entitled to dsa at the applicable rate for the first 60 days spent in and to solar from the 61 st night spent in the soa in two cases the eligibility to solar was inc orrectly determined resulting in overpayment of some us 3374 further review by the representation identified one more case and total recovery of some us 3584 has been mad also payments relating to solar will in future be centrally regulated at ndjamena c solar nonrecovery of rental deductions 41 international staff members in receipt of solar who live in houses provided by the organisation are subject to deduction from solar at prescribed rates depending on the standard of accommodation for substandard accommodation as categorised at abeche deduction of 25 per cent should be made however this was not implemented and instead deductions for accommodation were made at daily rates of only fcfa 5000 us 10 for single room and fcfa 3000 us 6 for shared room applying the 25 per cent would equate to us 25 per day whereas the rate applied corresponded to only about 10 per cent of solar the financial implications of the reduced rates of deductions are considerable oios estimated that the recovery at the lower rates could result in short r ecovery of more than us 100000 per year in oios view the january 2004 instructions on solar deductions are quite clear and do not leave any room for different interpretation by field of fices oios wishes to emphasize that solar is not salary element nor an allowance to compens ate for hardship but an allowance to cover accommodation and other living costs in the soa 42 the representation agreed in principle with the oio s recommendation but stated that many unhcr offices in soa locations were using the same procedure of charging fixed rate instead of the 25 per cent deduction from solar t hey added that the deduction at the prescribed rate of 25 per cent for accommodation as sessed as below acceptable standards would cause frustration among staff but they will r eview the rates periodically to ensure the recovery of the amounts spent by the office for foo d and accommodation of staff as conditions improve unhcr chad is currently engaged in improving the li ving and working conditions in abeche and in all field offices any further decisi on on an increase of costrecovery from staff will be reviewed together with dhrm on the basis of reassessment of the conditions on the ground oios takes note of the representations position b ut would highlight that it is not only contrary to unhcrs policy instructions but also s ets wrong precedent for adoption of divergent practices and interpretations across unhc r global operations recommendation head2right the unhcr division of human resources management sh ould review the rental deductions for housing provided by unhcr to staff in receipt of solar in chad and direct the unhcr representation i n chad to make deductions at 25 per cent of the solar rate as per unhcrs policy rec 01 10 travel claim overpayments 43 there was significant mission travel withi n chad and oios noted some overpayments in travel claims the incidence of such mistakes highl ighted weakness in internal controls whereby payments were not adequately checked the cases det ected by oios involved the application of incorrect dsa rates nondeduction of travel advanc and nonreduction of dsa after 60120 days oios detected three cases of overpayments tot alling close to us 5000 further review by the representation disclosed one more overpayment f about us 800 the representation has recovered some us 4300 and the balance will be re covered shortly extended assignment grant 44 an international staff member who arrived at ndjamena in april 2004 was paid extended assignment grant totalling fcfa 468 million us 8 747 the payment was calculated at 60 per cent of the standard dsa rate and not restricted to the actual hotel cost fcfa 3 million us 5607 which should have been applied in this case while the approval of the extended assignment was retroactively requested and obtained from undp the original hotel receipts were not attached to the payment vouchers the representation agreed with staff member to reco ver us 3140 from his march april and may solar payme nts oios requests confirmation that the recovery has been made mental health travelvari 45 vari claims were not accompanied by adequa proof of travel or certification that travel had been completed in some cases even though the qualifying service between two travels was inadequate the staff member was permitted to proce ed on vari the representation agreed to enforce compliance with instructions on mental heal th travel and to monitor such travel closely medical evacuation 46 proper procedures were not followed for th medevac of local staff member from adre to ndjamena in july 2004 dsa entitlements w ere also not correctly determined the unhcr medical service authorized over the telephone the staff members evacuation email other written authorization was subsequently filed or other essential documentation which is required for medevac for local staff members unde rgoing medevac within the country of recruitment the entitlement is only for reimbursem ent of the actual hotel charges up to 50 per cent of the standard dsa on provision of hotel rece ipts however the staff member was paid 75 per cent of the standard dsa totalling some fcfa 79 0200 us 1520 and hotel receipts were placed on file in the absence of hotel receip ts the staff member was not eligible to receive dsa and oios recommended that the dsa paid be recov ered the representation have since agreed to recover the amounts overpaid to the sm and will also inform all local staff members about the need for compliance with medevac instruct ions outstanding receivables and communications 47 oios acknowledges the representations eff orts in updating the receivables account since april 2004 the representation will also issue additional gui dance for the speedy adjustment of operational advances observe the maximum limit for authorized payment on single cheque and adhere to the instructions governing reimbursement of hospitality expenditure recovery of costs 11 for private use of telephone has been initiated th ough it was noted that internal controls were not fully established to ensure private calls are adequ ately tracked medical insurance plan 48 the representation has commenced the proce ssing of mip claims but only 10 claims have been processed fifteen claims submitted in octobe r and november 2004 were still to be processed the number of mip claims is likely to i ncrease as the operation grows and new staff joins mip deductions were being made from the staf f members salaries lists of selected hospitals or standard prices were however not avail able and these lists should be prepared in consultation with the clinic additional traini ng for the staff member handling mip would be useful so that entries are correctly made into the system and appropriate reports generated staffing situation 49 operations are still heavily dependent on missions unvs consultants and staff deployed on mission only 20 out of 75 professional staff an d 50 out of 193 of the gs staff have been appointed through appbappc and many staff members are on ftas of short duration even though fast track system was in place there was marked gap between the initial deployment of ert staff and the appointment of staff under fas t track procedures some 29 staff members are on mission varying in duration and 26 unvs were posted at various locations besides nine consultants staff on short missions has very litt overlap with the new incumbents and valuable experience could be lost high turnover of interna tional staff should be kept in check and whenever there is change of incumbent debriefing nd handover should be done properly 50 at the time of the audit due to the excep tionally high turnover of staff crucial posts at ndjamena
