6110c24 shspec70 clearing auditing is third dynamic activity most aberration stems from group mores because there was an agreement agreement is high on the reality scale as an individual agrees to something then disagrees to it he runs contradiction on his own postulates when thetan becomes member of group he agrees to certain things then finds he cant uphold them and disagrees with those things this activity is high on the reality scale having agreed to something then disagreed with it the thetan doesnt normally asis his original agreement thus he finds himself in disagreement with himself since it was originally his own agreement this is apparently the first and foremost invalidation of thetan he invalidates himself by first agreeing then disagreeing with his own agreements in between the agreement and disagreement we get further set of agreements and activities all of which are lesser in value but which bring about complexity so you get an area of mutual motion with the group and even confusion of ownership of motion you get whole series of problems from this this gets us back to something that has been question since 1948 if the thetan was making his pictures why did he create the particular ones hes got why his proclivity for morbidity we find the answer in the fact that he cant differentiate between his own actions and other peoples hes not sure who caused these communication lines and actions all motions are of course caused individually there is such thing as collectively caused motion governments err by thinking that theres some entity called the people when in fact there are just individuals but in his third dynamics the pc got into this confusion of mutual motion he then defends himself by backing out of it he says well it was all bad here i am outside of it at least i am still an identity thetan has gone through this over and over the dynamics give us an excellent picture of the confusion of mutual motion the sixth dynamic is exclusively comotion an undifferentiated one all the collective undifferentiated comotions of the past become matter energy space and time the sixth dynamic nobody can say what he did thetan in this universe can only say that was our activity this is ok until you get failure for instance its we built this bridge until it collapses at which point it becomes they built this bridge when mutual comotion comes cropper people deny their part in it at any given time an individual is member of at least two or three groups he has been on the track for 200 trillion years which makes lot of groups so it is impractical to run out his coaction with all his groups for instance every time he died he left group but we are assisted by automaticity all overts and withholds are preceded by coaction you can straighten out the people involved by running ow or you can free the effect of the ow by differentiating the coaction this is basic discovery that you can knock out the coaction preceding the ow he cant face the coaction sometimes until you get off some of the withholds and overts body of agreement has been violated and thereafter will remain aberrative thats where you get the packaged nowimsupposedtos the packaged postulates valences enforced by group mores someone who is withholding himself from his former group cant even tell you what really went on in it until he his gotten off some of the ow his withholding is not only in the physical universe but in the mind also you could have group whose mutual action is all mutually destructive at first glance when you process the pc you are just asking him to stop withholding himself mentally just because he is withholding himself physically hell resist because it feels like being asked to return to it physically the reason you have to have ruds in in order to find goal or terminal is that you are asking the individual to walk very closely to the fact of an identity from which he is withholding himself while being the identity hes not executing the goal while executing the goal you are asking him to look at something that he is in the middle of when you run groups you are asking him what group comotion are you still in the middle of that youre now having nothing to do with this confuses him but it works out very well you go back through his ows to coaction eventually you could even get the mutual agreements each step asks him to confront little more than he would be comfortable confronting so youll find his goal and find his terminal fine thats oriented towards the future and away from the unpleasant past but then you ask him to go back over the past and suddenly you get all the reasons why he doesnt want to go clear facing all those prior groups and people and activities is something else yesterday should remain buried this is the most critical period of processing for one thing if you have the wrong goal and the wrong terminal you will throw the pc in over his head and it will take experts to bail him out its not light thing to attempt the pc doesnt want to face what he has left so you had better be prepared for evasions ducks and dodges arc breaks etc even if hes aberrated now he knows hes alive hes not so sure he will be alive if he confronts this he died last time didnt he pc can also slide out from under the terminal up into degradation this is an alarming fact of running terminals the pc looks very pitiful as he comes through the degradation and may not feel at all like going on but all his escape mechanisms are reactive by keeping rudiments in and carrying on straight ahead you will succeed because the pc himself is really with you all the way the objections are all reactive you may have smooth trip through it too not all pcs go through degradation degradation is lower harmonic of apathy and is the first emotion the pc encounters on the road up even if hes below it he goes through the band of death on the way to apathy then on up the tone scale theres sort of hurdygurdy that goes on theres the pc and the valence and the pc is as overwhelmed as the valence is high toned during processing the positions reverse at one point they are level at this point the nowimsupposedtos dont work well and the pc still doesnt decide well what to do then the valence goes down and the pc up the pc andor the valence may hit the boredom band it is important not to leave it there but to continue see fig 5 figure 5 tone level of valence and pc graphics inserted
