analysts argue that current public policies including ﬁnancial incentives that divert corn from feed uses into ethanol production exacerbated if not caused these higher costs other factors which some believe to be at least as signiﬁcant include crop production declines due to weather and higher global demand for commodities proposed options aimed at easing the impacts of higher feed costs include

economic situation1 production costs through the first half of 2008 climbed in every segment of animal agriculture the main driver was feed wh ich may account for 6070 of total livestock production costs in any given year overall total us feed expenses were forecast to reach recordhigh 48 billion in 2008 jump of nearly 10 billion or 26 over 2007 year that was 67 billion higher than 2006 corn accounts for about 90 of feed grains used for feed and soybean meal is the principal oil crop product used as feed according to the us department of agricu ltures usdas econom ic research service ers

from 726 per head in 2005 to 1131 in 2008 or by 564 dairy producers have experienced cost pr essures although farm milk prices have remained relatively firm in 2008 due to st rong exportfueled demand milk industry analysts also noted that feed costs have moderated somewhat from earlier levels and that cost impacts may have been muted because large share of dairy feed in 2008 seems to have either been grown on the dairy or contracted in advance5 shortterm effect when grain prices sp ike can be more production of red meat and poultry as herd sizes are reduced andor as more animals and milk are sold to maintain cash flow to cover higher prices this can depress farm and wholesale prices at least temporarily further exacerbating the costpri ce squeeze if current market conditions persist meat supplies will decline and pr ices rise through producer attrition and reduced capacity retail prices too will eventually adjust accordingly6 to date rising costs have largely been absorbed by livestock and poultry producers often with significant financ ial loss however higher costs of producti on will ultimately have to be reflected in higher prices for meat milk and eggs at retail counters in the united states and elsewhere this adjustment process is complex lengthy painful and not without unintended consequences lawrence and others wrote in choices see footnote 1 they added that speed of adju stment will vary signif icantly as industries with shorter production cycles such as poultry are able to respond in matter of monthshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22908crs3 7 adapted in

in confluence of factors some with shortterm impacts but others longerterm an example of the latter is steadily increasing world population boosted by robust growth in purch asing power especially in developing countries such as china and india analysts believe this trend could mean sustained increase in global demand for more and differe nt kinds of food including as household incomes improve

approximately 1 billion bushels below the previous year among the reasons cited were spring rains nd flooding followed by dry august in the corn belt8 surging us exports since january 2002 the us dollar has declined in value relative to the currency of us export competitors eg canada australia or the eu and grain importing nations eg ja pan taiwan etc effectivel making us grain exports cheaper and therefore more competitive despite the rise in perbushel prices in terms of yeartoyear export volumes us corn exports are projected up nearly 18 to record of almost 25 billion bushels in the 20072008 marketing year other contributing factors former usda chief economist keith collins cited number of other factors that have contributed to feed and other food price increases these include higher demand for feed caused by increasing numbers of fed animals in the united states twoyear ri in corn production costs from 186 per acre in 2005 to nearly 230 in 2007 due mainly to higher energyrelated fertilizer and fuel costs and actions by number of foreign g overnments to insulate their own markets from high commodity prices such as limiting exports of their own agricultural commodities and subsidizing domestic pr oduction andor consumption9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22908crs4 10 source renewable fuels association june 19 2008 at http wwwethanol rfaorg 11 figures reveal how

current u s biofuel production is almost entirely cornbased ethanol nearly 65 billion gall ons of cornethanol were produced in 2007 compared with an estimated 450 million gallons of primarily soybeanbased biodiesel the energy independence and security ac t of 2007 eisa pl 110140 extended and substantially expanded the existing renewable fuel standard rfs usage requirement mandating that an increasing volume of biofuels be blended with conve ntional fuels the rfs mandates the use of at least 9 billion gall ons of biofuel in us fuel supplies in 2009 more than doubling to 205 billion gallons by 2015 and to 36 billion gallons by 2022 the us biofuels sector is also supported by tax credit of 51 cents for every gallon of corn based ethanol blended in the us fuel suppl to drop to 45

crop ear 20072008 about 23 of the us corn crop will have been used to produce ethano l this share is projected to grow to more than 33 in 20082009 although high corn prices have slowed plans for expanded capacity plants already on line are expected to operate so long as they can cover their variable costs the runup in corn demand wh ich is expected to be longlasting has directly sparked substantially higher corn prices to bid av ailable supplies away from other uses like livestock feed according to number of agricultural economists corn ethanol byproducts now mainly distillers grains from drymill ethanol plants but also corn gluten feed and corn gl uten meal can be fed by livestock producers to help offset higher feed corn prices according to the national corn growers association the equivalent of an additional 1 billion bushels of feed will be available in the coming year through ethanol byproducts11 because of the cost and difficulty of drying and shipping distillers grains are best utilized by feeders closest to ethanol plants research indicates that distille rs grains should constitute more than 3540 of feedlot cattle rations 1020 of dairy cow rations and 10 for hogs broiler chickens and turkeys according to anderson reviewing several different studies and economic models collins concluded that implied changes in the price of corn due to its use in ethanol might range from 25 to 60 2008 study by the food and agricultural policy research institute fapri attempts to measure the pure and joint price ffects of the us biofuels rfs and the tax credits suggesting that joint implementati on of both the rfs and the tax credit supports corn prices by about 20 substantia l portion of corn price effects are likely transmitted to the soybean market via comp etition

producers who have long been wary of any government policies that can raise feed prices congressi onal committees in 2008 have held number of hearings on the causes and impacts of rising commodity costs the house agriculture committee convened six hearings between midmay and midseptember 2008 on commodity futures trading nd related matters including proposals to increase oversight by the commodity futures trading commission of futures markets where some critics argue excessive speculation added significantly to the 2008 price spikes in oil and other commodities others counter that futures tr aders simply react to market conditions economists seem to agree that us government initiatives are unlikely to have much impact on such price drivers as foreign popul ation and income gr owth and concurrent demand for commodities weathe rrelated production s hortfalls and infl ation generally at least in the short term however numbe r of options have been offered to address other perceived reasons for high feed prices reduce domestic ethanol incentives several bills propose to reduce ethanol production incentives by repealing lowering or freezing the rfs the biofuels tax credit andor the ethanol import tariff such as hr 5911 hr 5986 hr 6137 hr 6183 hr 6324 s 3031 and s 3080 outside of c ongress attention focused on an april 25 2008 letter to the us environmental prot ection agency epa from texas governor rick perry requesting waiver of 50 of the 2008 rfs for grainderived ethanol now at 9 billion gallons the letter cited epas authority under sec 211o of the clean air act to approve such waiver if the rfs requirement would seve rely harm the economy of state region or the country the epa in august denied the request stating that its analysis found compelling evidence that th rfs mandate is cau sing severe economic harm during the time period specified by texas12 opponents have argued that an epa waiver or reductions in the financial incentives proposed in the various bills would not have much of an immediate impact on corn prices see fapri and card studies above at any rate other factors such as global grai n shortfalls strong us exports and higher oil prices played much larger role in high feed costs some have continued to assert use conservation land some have argued that as much as onethird of the nearly 35 million acres april 2008 in us das conservation rese rve program crp could be returned to agricultural producti on without environmental harm the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 caps nationa l enrollment in the crp which is intended to keep environmentally sensitive nds out of production for 1015 years at 32 million acres what about incentives like easing producer pena lties who want to end their crp contracts early discouraging reenrollment or renewal of existing contracts permitting temporary use of more crp acres for grazing cutting andor raising other feedstuffs opponents of opening conservati on land assert that the loss

haying and grazing must be completed by november 10 for subsequent approvals haying and grazing must end by septembe r 30 and october 15 respectively13 financial assistance for livestock producers over the past decade alone many of the nearly annual s upplemental appropriations meas ures containing emergency agricultural aid have included money for an imal agriculture amounting to at least 32 billion in total often to cover the cost of high feed prices or lost pasture use14 separately section 32 of the act of august 24 1935 is permanent appropriation available to usda for variety of purposes and it has been ta pped not only to pay for disaster losses but also to address economic and market problems15 thus some argue there is policy precedent for providing direct payments to livestock and poultry producers to help them cope with sharply rising feed costs on the other hand both the 2008 farm bill pl 110 246 and the fy2008 usda appropriation par t of pl 110161 contain language seeking to constrain section 32 spending or at least the secretarys flexibility to use it other options some have urged us officials to push harder for the elimination of various foreign barriers that obstruct international trade and distort market price signals to producers including tariffs unjustified t echnical and phytosanitary standards export controls and various domestic agricultural subs idies further it is argued investments should be increased particular ly in developing countries in agricultural research and education to increase productivity in transpor tation and marketing in frastructure and in other types of alternative ergy production here and globally these efforts could all help to ease the upward pressure on feed grain and other commodity prices others counter that regardless of their merits thes types of solutions would offer little if any shortterm relief to the financial probl ems currently facing livestock producers
