by his cousin colonel jeanbedel bokassa in 1966 bokassa dissolved the legislature and rescinded the constitution in 1972 bokassa became life president and later named himself marshall of the republic in december 1976 bokassa renamed the car the central african empire and later had himself crowned emperor in lavish ceremony attended by thousands of guests human rights violations and rumors of bizarre practices helped prepare the way for bokassas 1979 ouster by david dacko in coup backed by french troops dacko in turn was overthrown in 1981 by general andré kolingba whose authoritarian regime lasted until 1993 when elections were held this democratic transition followed long period of unrest including recurrent strikes and opposition protests sparked in part by the countrys economic stagnation the election was won by ange patassé who had once served bokassa as prime minister but later became leading opponent of the former emperor

president patassé in power while the mutineers returned to base the rebellion was by means crushed and further outbreak occurred in november the mutinies resulted in part from the dissatisfaction of soldiers over salary delays but there was an ethnic dimension as well since most of the soldiers were from former president kolingbas yakoma ethnic group while patassé is from another ethnic group the sara regional mediation effort followed the november 1996 clashes but in january 1997 two french soldiers were assassinated and heavy fighting broke out between french troops and the mutineers nonetheless mediation efforts undertaken by the heads of state of gabon burkina faso chad and mali continued leading to the convening of an allparty conference in bangui the capital at the end of the
