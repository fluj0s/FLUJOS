states constitutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97736congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congressreceived through the crs web97736 updated january 12 2001 victims rights amendment in the 106th congress overview of suggestions to amend the constitution charles doyle senior specialist american law division summary thirtythree states have added victims rights amen dment to their state constitutions both the house and senate judiciary committees held hearings on similar proposals in the 106th congress to amend the united states constitution sjres 3 introduced by senator kyl for himself and senator feinstein and hjres 64 introduced by representative chabot the senate committee initially reported out an amended version of sjres 3 without written report but issued report prior to floor consideration of the reported proposal srept 106254 neither sjres 3 nor hjres 64 were ever brought to vote on the floor this is an overview of those proposals and is an abbreviated form of victims rights amendment proposals to amend the united states constitution in the 106th congress crs report rl30525 authorities identified there have been omitted here in the interests of brevity pro and arguments put forward in support of an amendment include assertions that the criminal justice system is badly tilted in favor of criminal defendants and against victims interests and more appropriate balance should be restored the shabby treatment afforded victims has chilled their participation in the criminal justice system to the detriment of all society has an obligation to compensate victims existing statutory and state constitutional provisions are wildly dispara in their coverage resulting in uneven treatment and harmful confusion throughout the criminal justice system and httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97736crs2 existing state and federal law is inadequate and likely to remain inadequate critics argue to the contrary that the criminal justice system is not out of balance the purpose of criminal trial is to determine the guilt of an accused by allowing an impartial jury to weigh the governments evidence that crime has been committed and that the accused committed it against any evidence offered by the defendant the interests of victims do not fit in the equation their interests are protected by the right to bring civil suit against the accused by courtorder restitution if the accused is convic ted and by victim compensation provisions if efficacious victims rights amendment would generate considerable uncertainty in the law and flood the federal courts with litigation could be very costly and would either jeopardize the rights of the accused probably in discriminatory manner or undermine the governments ability to prosecute if the mischief possible through victims rights amendment is avoided the proposal becomes purely hortator the constitution is place for commemorative decorations it is inconsistent with the basic notions of federalism each of the states through its legislatures and electorate has decided how victims rights should be accommodated within its criminal justice system these decisions would be made subservient to uniform standard that in all likelihood jurisdiction would have chosen particulars sjres 3 and hjres 64 would have followed the general format favored in the state constitutions they would have guaranteed victims right to notice to attend andor to be heard at various stages of the criminal justice process who is victim the impact of any victims rights amendment depends upon who is considered victim for purposes of the amendment sjres 3 would have covered victims of crime of violence as these terms may be defined by law hjres 64 would have applied to each individual who is victim of crime for which the defendant can be imprisoned for period of longer than one year or any other crime that involves violence the obvious difference between the two was that the house resolution would have covered nonviolent felonies while the senate proposal would nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97736crs3 when must victim be notified be allowed to attend or be heard bail at least in theory victims rights might attach upon commission of the offense under the proposals in the 106th and most of the state provisions the rights attach upon commencement of proceedings involving the crime of which the individual is the victim the most significant of these early proceedings for the victim would likely be the bail hearing for the accused only few states grant the victim the right to be heard at the defendants bail hearing few more permit consultation with the prosecutor prior to the bail hearing most allow victims to attend and virtually all provide either that victims shou ld be notified of bail hearings or that victims should be notified of the defendants release on bail under existing federal law victims of alleged acts of interstate domestic violence or interstate violations of protective order have right to be heard at federal bail proceedings concerning any danger posed by the defendant in other federal cases victims prerogatives seem to be limited to the right to confer with the prosecutor and notification of and attendance at all public court proceedings the proposals in the 106th would have given victims the right to be heard if present and to submit written statement at all such proceedings to determine conditional relea from custody and to consideration for their safety in determinatio n any conditional release from custody plea bargains negotiated guilty pleas account for over 90 of the criminal convictions obtained for the victim plea bargain may come as an unpleasant surprise one that may jeopardize the victims prospects for restitution one that may result in sentence the victim finds insufficient andor one that changes the legal playing field so that the victim has become the principal target of prosecution some states victims rights provisions are limited to notification of the courts acceptance of plea bargain more often however the states permit the victim to address the court prior to the acceptance of negotiated guilty plea or to confer with the prosecutor concerning plea bargain sjres3 and hjres 64 would have required that victims be allowed to address the court before plea bargain could be accepted in any state or federal criminal or juvenile proceeding speedy trial the united states constitution guarantees those accused of federal crime speedy trial the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment makes the right binding upon the states whose constitutions often have companion provision the constitutional right is reenforced by statute and rule in the form of speedy trial laws in both the state and federal realms until recently victims had comparable rights although their advocates contended they had very real interest in prompt disposition most of the states have enacted statutory or constitutional provisions establishing victims right to prompt or timely disposition of the case in one form or another many have also made efforts to minimize the adverse impact of the delays that do occur by either providing for employer intercession services andor by prohibiting employers from penalizing victimwitnesses forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97736crs4 attending court proceedings and most call for the prompt return of victims property taken for evidentiary purposes as soon as it is longer needed sjres 3 and hjres 64 would have entitled victims to consideration of their interests that any trial be free from unreasonable delay courts might well have used the same test for this standard that they have used when testing for unacceptable delay under the speedy trial and due process clauses length of delay reasons for the delay defendants assertion of his right and prejudice to the defendant trial the sixth amendment promises the accused public trial by an impartial jury it promises victims little their status is at best better than that of any other member of the general public for sixth amendment purposes and in fact the constitution screens the accuseds right to an impartial jury trial from the over exuberance of members of the public moreover victims who are also witnesses are even more likely to be barred from the courtroom during trial than members of the general public about third of the states now permit victims to attend all court proceedings regardless of whether the victim is scheduled to testify another group allows witnesses who are victims to attend subject to showing as to why they should be excluded few leave the matter in the discretion of the trial court and some have maintained the traditional rule witnesses are sequestered whether they are victims or not sjres 3 and hres 64 would have invested victims with the right to notice of and not to be excluded from all public proceedings relating to the crime state and federal juvenile and adult they made explicit provision for instances where the victim is also witness nor did they indicate how unavoidable conflicts between the rights they conveyed and the constitutional rights of the accused at least as they exist until ratification were to be resolved sentencing the most prevalent of victims rights among the states is the right to have victim impact information presented to sentencing authorities there is however tremendous diversity of method among the states many call for inclusion in presentencing report prepared for the court in one way or another often supplemented by right to make some form of subsequent presentation as federal law permits some are specific as to the informat ion that may be included some permit the victim to address the court directly others do not sjres 3 and hjres 6 would have afforded victims the right to be heard and to submit written statement at all such proceedings to determine sentence they proposal did not address the question of whether relevancy repetition or any other limitation might have been imposed upon exercise of the right enforcement experience among the states suggests that enforcement may be the stumbling block for any proposed amen dment since there seem to be few palatable alternatives it is possible to draft the amendment to the united states constitution so that victims rightshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97736crs5 enforcement is paramount legal proceedings conducted without honoring victims rights would be rendered null sentencing hearings rescheduled and conducted anew plea bargains rejected trials begun again unfaithful public servants exposed to civil and criminal liability inattentive governmental entities made subject to claims and court orders few proponents suggest that enforcement should be limited to the equitable powers of the courts this would appear to have been the intent with respect to sjres 3 and hjres 64 which would have denied victims cause of action or grounds to interrupt criminal trial and otherwise leaves crafting of enforcement mechanisms to congress and the state legislatures legislative powers sjres 3 and hjres 64 would have conferred legislative authority in two ways first they would have empowered congress to define the class of victims entitled to claim rights under the amendment second they would have vested congress with the authority enforce their provisions through legislation but subject to the caveat that in doing so congress craft exceptions to the rights created by the amendment only when necessary to achieve compelling interest earlier proposals explicitly recognized greater state legislative role conflicts with other constitutional provisions or with state law the question of the states legislative powers to implement the victims rights amendment suggests another question how much if any of existing victims rights law would survive an amendment under the present state of the law statutory and state constitutional provisions are confined by the united states constitution usconst art vi cl2 when their advocates have said nothing in them imperils defendants rights under the united states constitution they are right nothing could but an amendment to the united states constitution stands on different footing it amends the constitution its very purpose is to make constitutional that which would otherwise not have been constitutionally permissible it may uniformly subordinate defendants rights to victims rights it may require any conflicting law or constitution precipe state or federal to yield even in the absence of conflict it may preempt the field sweeping away all laws ordinances precedents and decisions compatible and incompatible alike on any matter touching upon the same subject it may have none or some of these consequences depending upon its language and the intent behind its language few advocates have explicitly called for kingofthehill victims rights amendment but the thought seems imbedded in the complaint that existing law lacks uniformity how else can universal symmetry be accomplished but by implementation of single standard that fills in where preexisting law comes up short and shaves off where its generosity exceeds the standard proponents of sjres 3 and hjres 64 spoke of both the need to establish minimum victims rights standard and the need for uniformityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97736crs6 the principles of construction called into play in the case of conflict between victims rights amendment and rights established elsewhere in the constitution are similar those used to resolve federalstate conflicts intent of the drafters is paramount the courts will make every effort to reconcile apparent conflicts between constitu tional provisions but in the face of an unavoidable conflict between right granted by an adopted victims rights amendment and some other portion of the constitution the most recently adopted provision will prevail the proposals in the 106th congress were designed to eliminate the unfair treatment that results because the criminal justice system permits the defendants constitutional rights always to trump the protections given to victims yet to do so in manner that would not deny or infringe any constitutional right of any person accused or convicted of crime in instances of unavoidable conflict between victim and defendant rights this seemed to mean the prosecution must yield the text of the two hardly defeated this interpretation with the assurance that the only the victim or the victims lawful representative shall have standing to assert the rights created by the amendment since the rights of the accused come not from the victims rights amendment but from the sixth amendment or some other source within the constitution
