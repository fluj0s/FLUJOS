either vehicle assembly or part making must be located in the united states specific projects must result in the production of vehicles that achieve at least 25 higher fuel economy than model year 2005 models with similar size and performance further applicants must be able to demonstrate their financial viability over the life of the loan 25 years this last requirement may prove to be

vehicl manufacturing incentive program interim final ru request for comment november 5 2008 3 washington post october 22 2008 p a1federal loans to the auto industry under the energy independence and security act introduction congress has approved and th president has signed into law two legislative provisions that authorize and fund prog ram to provide as much as 25 billion in direct loans to automotive manufacturers in the united states and their suppliers these measures are in 136 of the energy independence and security act eisa of 2007 pl 110140 which became law on december 19 2007 and 129 of the consolidated security disaster assistance and continuing appropriations act pl 110329 signed into law on september 30 2008 the first measure authorizes the loan program at the level stated and blishes the purposes for which such loans may be used the second measure appropria tes 751 billion to cover the subsidy and administrative costs of the program and dir ects that the loans should be made by the federal financing bank it further establis hes an expedited timetable so that the department of energy doe should write an interim fi nal rule for administering the program within 60 days after enactment1 on november 5 2008 doe announced its interim final ru implementing the program although the rule has not yet been published in the federal register 2 this program has been widely misinterpre ted as broad bailout of usbased domestic motor vehicle manufacturers alr eady losing money when the authorizing legislation was passed in late 2007 the usowned big three nameplate companies based in detroit henceforth the detroit 3 general motors gm ford motor company and chrysler llc have seen substantial increases in losses since then many commentators noted that this increased the urgency for congress to approve appropria tions legislation to fund pr ogram to assist the domestic companies for example the washington post headlined an article reporting on possible delays in administering the eisa loans lifeline for automakers dangles just out of reach3 while automakers and thei r supporters in congress have reportedly called for larger program with broader rang of possible industry uses the language in these laws indicates the intent of congress that the loans are for the purpose of enabling the us auto industry to produce more fuel efficient vehicles one of the major provisions in eisa mandated an increase in corporate average fuel economy cafe standards t itle i of the law is labeled energy securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34743crs2 4 pl 110140 101 5 pl

1 2007 through improved vehicle fuel economy it s first subtitle is increased corporate average fuel economy standards and th short title is the teninten fuel economy act label used by supporters of dramatic increase in us cafe standards4 the new law established cor porate average fuel economy cafe target of 35 miles per gallon mpg by model year my 2020 for the combined passenger automobile and light truck fleet as opposed to my2008 standards of 275 mpg for cars and lower standard 225 mpg for light trucks the law further requires maximum feasible increases from 2021 through 20305 compliance costs may fall most heavily on detroit 3 during the debate on this legislation re presentatives of the us motor vehicle manufacturing industry including ions representing production workers emphasized that these would be very diffi cult targets for the industry to achieve they pointed to an earlier estimate by the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa of the department of transportation dot that to increase fuel economy standards by four percent per year as had been suggested by the bush administration would cost motor vehi cle manufacturers 114 billion the bulk of this cost about 85 billion according to the nhtsa estimate would be borne by the detroit 36 these companies are still responsib for the majority of the motor vehicles manufactured in the united states despite high levels of us investment in recent decades by many foreignowned producers moreover since at least the 1980s the troit 3 have tended to specialize more in larger consumer vehicles such as pi ckup trucks and sport utility vehicles suvs which have relatively low fuel economy ratin gs thus it was anticipated that the requirement to achieve substantial improvements in cafe for these manufacturers would be more difficult than for most foreignbased manufact urers whose domestic markets have historically featured smaller more fuelefficient vehicles which they are then able to import into the us market however it should be noted that propos ed car and light truck standards for model years 2011 through 2015 shift the bur den from straightline average where all automakers must meet the same numerical average to sizebased standard where each automaker will have different fuel economy target and those automakers that produce smaller ve hicles will face higher target in nhtsas

in the united states to achievement of higher fuel economy these provisions include section 132 which amends section 712 of the energy policy act of 2005 epact 2005 42 usc 16062 to require the department of energy doe to create grant program to encourage domestic production and sales of fficient hybrid and adva nced diesel vehicles and components section 134 which authorizes loan guarantees

principal subject of this report in addition 112 under subtitle of the law requires that 50 of the fines paid by companies that fail to meet cafe standards be set aside to carry out grant prog ram to manufacturers for producing advanced technology ve hicles and components these newly authorized or expanded pr ograms join other efforts which have been embarked on in the past by the u s government to promote advanced or alternative vehicle technolog development from these eisa initiatives only the direct loan program under 136d has so far received any funding at level significant enough to make difference in the competitive and highly expensive world of motor vehicle manufacturing9 thus while this report will further review other new and existing programs to deve lop advanced vehicle

systemic concerns facing the industry the major detroitbased au to manufacturers were formerly known as the big 3 they are not any more because by 2007 one japanese company toyota outsold two of the detroit companies ford and chrysler in the united states their own home market in addition by the first nine months of 2008 honda had roughly equaled chrysler in domestic us motor vehicle sales this has not been merely loss of some companies competitive position to others normal shift in the marketplace the loss of market shares combined with the cyclical decline in the market and the sudden change in consumer preferences from trucks back to cars has led to huge losses for the former big 3 it has put their entire business model based on co llective bargaining relationship between management and labor at risk as consequence the issue faced by congress when it authorized and funded the direct an program was that the unionized domestically owned motor vehicle industry might not be in position to contribute to the national goal of reducing rates of petroleum demand by veloping alternative technology vehicles along with other unf avorable conditions for the detroit 3 some conclude that the mandate to improve fuel economy at the levels required could force one or more of the detro it 3 out of the business the major market shifts did not happen overnight as reported earlier by crs10 foreign brands both imported and produced at us plants have been gaining market share for decades as illustrated in figure 3 this trend has continued since 2000 however the slope through 2005 was rather gentle from twothirds of the total us market for passenger cars and light truc ks in 2000 the detroit 3 share declined gradually to 582 in 2005 some of this decline represented aggressive us manufacturing and expansion plans by fo reignowned companie s toyota honda nissan and hyundai have all opened new assemb ly plants in the united states since 2000 and more are on the way however after losing eight points of market share in 20002005 the detroit 3 saw their losses accelerate by an additional 10 points to an annual level of just over 48 market share between then and the first three quarters of 2008 this occurred while the total market itself was declining the us automotive market is notoriously cyclical auto manufacturers have gross sales of more than halftrillion

to establish these and other eligibility criteria loans may cover full costs of project32 because the direct loan program was inserted into section of eisa originally intended to include only the grant program there is some confusion resulting from the crossreferences within 136 most notably this confusion has ccurred over whether or not loans are for full costs of projects or whether they ar limited to 30 of project costs this is because subsection d1 defines the loans to cover the costs of activities described in subsection b the introduction to s ubsection b states that doe shall provide facility funding awards emphasis added under this s ection to recipients to pay not more than 30 of the cost however subsection d only refers back to the earlier subsection for the purpose of

about the terms of the loans as the provision creating the loan program references the activities that are the subject of grant program also authoriz ed in the same section of eisa the grant program is limited to 30 percent of the costs of facility this is fairly typical cost share for grant programs some have raised the question as to whether this 30 percent cap should also appl to the loan program that is not the way i read the language of the law and was certainly not our intent in writing the provision moreover i would argue that it would dramatically limit the effectiveness of the program as it would require companies to go to tight credit markets for 70 percent of their financing precisely the problem we were seeking to remedy with the creation of the loan program33 subsequent

unionorganized automakers as the wall street journal wrote in critical editorial were told the lowinterest loan proposal would give priority to the oldest plants which is another way of saying those plants organized by the united auto workers34 there are two important qualifications that should be stated about this provision however first subsection g applies onl to doe in making awards or loans to those manufacturers that have existing facilities this is an important qualification because subsection b1 in defining eligible activities includes reequipping expanding or establishing emphasis added manufacturing facility facility to be established cannot by definition be 20 years old furthermore subsection g only requires priority not an absolute limitation or prohibition based on the age

difference estimated by the congressional budget office cbo between the interest rate available in the financial market and the interest rate charged by the federa l government to the borrower another interpretation of this gap is the likelihood of default as the market rate builds in an assumption of risk during the congressional debates and discussions on eisa an informal estimate of 375 billion

small midsize and large wagons truck classes are based on function and weight and include small and standard pickups passenger cargo and minivans and sport utility vehicles suvs further most passenger cars are divided into standard and performance vehicles with different average fuel economy ratings does rationale for separating out performance cars is that they are substantially different from nonperformance vehicles performance vehicles generally have lower fuel economy ratings than nonperformance vehicles in the same ep class also different fuel economy technologies may be applicable to

priority will be given to those facilities that are ol dest or have been in existence for at least 20 years even if such facilities are idle at the time of application53 among other considerations the
