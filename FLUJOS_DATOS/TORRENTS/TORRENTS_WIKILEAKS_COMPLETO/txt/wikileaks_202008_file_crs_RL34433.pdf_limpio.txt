reductions on elderly poverty in 2042 the ﬁrst full year of projected trust fund insolvency the options are compared to payable baseline which assumes currentlaw beneﬁts would need to be cut across

elderly poor and mitigation options april 4 2008 kathleen romig analyst in income security domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34433social security reform possible effects on the elderly poor and mitigation options summary social security has significantly redu ced elderly poverty the elderly poverty rate has fallen from 35 in 1959 to an lltime low of 9 in 2006 in large part because of social security if social s ecurity benefits did not exist an estimated 44 of the elderly would be poor today assuming changes in behavior the supplemental security income ssi progra m also provides benefits to the poorest elderly many of whom do not qualify for so cial security benef its however despite these programs about 34 million elderly i ndividuals remained in poverty in 2006 the social security system faces longterm financing problem the social security trustees project cashflow deficits beginning in 2017 and trust fund insolvency in 2041 many recent pr oposals to improve system solvency would reduce social security benefits in the futu re benefit reductions could affect the low income elderly many of whom rely on social security benefits for almost all of their income such potential benefit reductions c ould lead to higher rates of poverty among the elderly compared to t hose projected under the current benefit formula because the lowincome elderly are especially vulnerable to benefit reductions many recent social security reform proposals have in cluded minimum benefits or other provisions that would mitigate the effect of benefit cuts on the elderly poor this report analyzes the projected effects of four possible approaches to mitigating the effects of social security benefit reductions on elderly poverty in 2042 the first full year of projected trust fund insolvency the options are compared to payable baseline which assumes currentlaw bene fits would need to be cut across the board to balance social security s annual income and spending at the point of insolvency the four options examin ed are 1 povertyline social security minimum benefit 2 slidingscale social security minimum benefit 3 poverty line ssi benefit and 4 povertyline ssi benefit with liber alized eligibility major findings include the following each of the four options would reduce elderly poverty compared to the payable baseline ranging from negligible reduction in the elderly poverty rate for the option to create slidingscale social security minimum benefit to reduction of three percentage points for the povertyline ssi benefit with liberalized eligibility the elderly poverty rate under all of the options would be higher than under the current law scheduled baseline which assumes the current benefit formula can be maintained with reductions the ssi options examined would target the additional spending more efficiently toward the poor elderly than would the social security options the social security options examined would reduce the incomes ofsome elderly because of interaction effects the ssi options would not create such interactionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34433contents background 1 h i s t r i c l d c l i n s i n l d r l p v r t u n c r t i

declines in elderl poverty uncertain future elderly poverty has declined over time elderly poverty in the united states has declined dramatically over time ultimately reachi ng an alltime low in 2006 in 1959 when the census bureau began to measure poverty more than third 35 of the elderly those age 65 or ol der were in poverty by 2006 less than onetenth 9 of the elderly were in poverty1 this reduction in elderly poverty was primarily due to two factors legislative ch anges that made social security benefits ie oldage survivors and disability insurance or oasdi more generous and strong wage growth that led to higher initial benefits if social security benefits did not exist an estimated 44 of the derly would be poor today assuming behavioral changes such as saving more or working longer2 elderly poverty is lower than child or workingage adult poverty the poverty rate among the elderly is lower than that for children or for the working age population3 in 2006 9 of the elderly were poor compared to 17 of children and 11 of workingage adults ie ages 18 to 64 in 1969 the poverty rate among the elderly was more than double th rate among workingage adults4 by the early 1990s the elderly poverty rate had fallen below the rate for workingage adults and has remained lower since within each age group poverty rates vary dramatically depending on race sex education levels and other demographic characteristics5 elderly poverty is projected to decline under the scheduled benefit formula elderly poverty is projected to continue to decrease over time under social securitys

exhaustion in 2041 benefits would need to be reduced by about 25 in 2041 rising to 30 by 2081 in order to balance annual income and spending tax increases could also be used to achieve cashflow balance if the changes were undertaken immediately the benefit reductions would only need to be half the size of the projected 2041 cuts social security administration 2007 annual report of the board

reform current issues and legislation by dawn nuschlerwill increase at the rate of wages while th poverty thresholds will rise with prices since wage growth is expected to outp ace price growth the rate of poverty should decline among social security beneficiaries all else being equal6 the elderly poverty rate is projected to fa ll to about 5 by 2042 under the scheduled baseline which assumes changes in the social security benefit formula7 lack of action could reverse historic declines in elderly poverty social securitys scheduled benefit formul is unsustainable with current revenues lawmakers could restore longterm system solvency by increasing revenue eg raising taxes cutting benefits or some co mbination of the two according to the social security administration if change s are made to social security and the trust funds are allowed to become insolv ent scheduled benef its would be reduced and elderly poverty rates could double8 under the payable baseline which assumes action until projected trust fund insolven cy in 2041 an acrosstheboard benefit cut to achieve annual balance is projected to result in an 11 elderly poverty rate9 this figure is more than twice as high as the rate projected under the scheduled baseline and higher than th elderly poverty rate today future solvency changes could also increase elderly poverty many recent proposals to improve system solvency would reduce social security benefits in the future10 if social security benefits were cut across the board the poverty rate among elderly am ericans could be significantly higher than under the currentlaw benefit formula some of the most commonly discussed options to improve solvency could increase the elderly poverty rate to levels almost as high as doing nothing until the trust funds run out during the 2005 debate over social secu rity reform one fre quently mentioned solvency option was the price indexing provision from model 2 of the 2001httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34433crs3

2042 assuming other changes12 this figure is twice the poverty rate projected under the sche duled benefit formula which would require additional fundi ng to be sustainable in addition the 10 elderly poverty rate projected under price indexing in 2042 is almost as high as the 11 rate projected under the payable baseline another frequently mentioned option wa s developed by robert pozen one of the cochairs of the 2001 commission and ndorsed by president george w bush13 dubbed progressive price indexing this option would implement the priceindexing formula from commission model 2 but would protect some low earners from benefit cuts14 however unlike price indexing progre ssive price indexing would not restore solvency to the system it could reduce the solvency gap by about 7015 i f progressive price indexing were implemented in 2008 the dynasim model estimates that elderly poverty rate would be 8 by 2042 assuming other changes16 this is higher than the 5 poverty rate project ed under the current law scheduled baseline which assumes benefit cuts but lowe r than the 11 rate projected under the payable baseline17 the social security and ssi programs workers and in some cases their families r eceive social security benefits based on their contributions into the system the supplemental security income ssi program in contrast is meanstest ed program that does not have work

frame law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of job and against povertyridden old age emphasis addedsocial security receipt am ong the elderly has increased about 92 of the elderly currently receive social security18 more people qualify for social security now than in the past because of legislative changes that expanded eligibility and increased workforce participation19 reliance on social security benefits is also increasing in 2006 about onequarter of th elderly relied on soci security for all of their income20 ssi receipt among the derly has declined in contrast to social security only about 5 of the elderly currently r eceive ssi many poor elderly individuals do not receive ssi either because they do not meet ssis strict asset and income restrictions or because they are eligible but have not enrolled in the program the academic literature estima tes that about onehalf to twothirds of qualifying elderly participate in ssi21 substantially fewer peopl qualify for ssi now than in the past because ssis income limits rise with inflati on while many potential ssi applicants receive social security benefits which rise with wages this means that all other things being equal for each year in which wages rise faster than prices fewer social security beneficiaries qualify for ssi ssis resource limits and income disregards are not indexed and thus do not rise at all as result ssis eligibility criteria become stricter over time issues and options related to elderly poverty poverty reduction under current law social security although social security s substantially reduced poverty among the elderly its primary purpose is to replace earnings lost when worker of any income level retires dies or b ecomes disabled not to reduce poverty22 the social security benefit formula is progre ssive so lower earners benefits represent greater proportion of their average lif etime earnings than do higher earners benefits however not all of the elderly r eceive social security benefits and those who do receive benefits do not necessarily receive enough to stay out of poverty

at their full retirement ages 26 annual earnings must be at least 15 of the oldlaw contribution wage base to count toward special minimum pia eligibility in 2008 this level is 11385 which is higher

nonbeneficiaries were poor23 some longterm low earners receive social security benefits that are less than the elderly poverty threshold for exam ple person born in 1943 who earned the minimum wage every year for 40 years and then retired at his or her full retirement age 66 would receive social security benefit that is slightly less than the official poverty threshold for an elderly individual24 at age 62 the age at which most individuals take up retirement benefits the benefit for ch worker would be about threequarters of the elderly povert threshold individuals with limited working histories for example women who take time out of the labor force also frequently receive social security bene fits that are below poverty social securitys special minimum one provision of the social security benefit formula that was in tended to benefit poor individuals is the special minimum primary insurance amount pia25 the special minimum pia was enacted in 1972 to increase benefits for longterm low wage earners and their families to qualify worker must have at least 11 years of social securitycovered earnings above specified threshold26 the amount of the special minimum pia rises each year with inflation and varies depending on the numbe r of years person works in 2008 the amounts range from 34 90 per month for workers with 11 years of qualifying earnings to 72140 for workers with 30 years initial social security benefits rise at the rate of wage growth while the special minimum pia rises at the generally slower rate of price growth thus the amount of the special minimum pia has gradually become smaller relative to minimum pia pe rson could receive under the ordinary social security rules as result the special minimum is paid to small and rapidly dwindling population27 ssas actuaries project that it will be impossible for anyone who becomes eligible for benef its in 2013 or later to receive the special minimum pia28 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34433crs7 29 some beneficiaries receive the special mini mum because they are subject to the windfall elimination provision wep which reduces so cial security benefits for those who also receive noncovered pensions an estimated 12 of beneficiaries who received the special minimum in 2000 also had noncovered pension income ssa special minimum benefit 30 social security administration annual statistical

poor the blind nd the disabled and this bill will move that concern to higher ground by providing better and more equitable benefits 32 estimate for 2006 produced using march 2007 current population survey 33 the 2007 federal benefit rate was 623 for individuals and 934 for couples while the monthly poverty threshold was 829 for elderl individuals and 1044 for elderly couples 34 the scheduled baseline assumes the current benefit formula is maintained with reductions the payable baseline assumes current law benefits are cut across the board to balance social securitys annual income nd spending at the point of insolvency the current law special minimum pia affects very few social security beneficiaries and does not necessarily bring these people out of poverty29 in 2005 approximately 100000 social security bene ficiaries less than 025 received special minimum pia30 among these beneficiaries the average social security benefit amount 710 per month was less than the poverty threshold for an elderly individual 781 per month in 2005 supplemental security income ssi the supplemental security income ssi program was designed ex plicitly to benefit the elde rly poor in addition to the lowincome blind and disabled31 its strict income and asset thresholds ensure that ssi benefits go only to the extremely poor unlike social security ssi benefits and eligibility are not based on work so ssi reaches many individuals with limited work histories who do not qualify for social security ssi benefits are typically not high enough to lift recipients out of poverty about four in ten 39 of ssi beneficiaries are poor32 the maximum federal benefit rates for ssi are less than the poverty thres holds for elderly indi viduals and couples and ssi recipients may only receive limited income other than their ssi benefits33 many poor elderly individuals do not recei ve ssi either because they do not meet ssis strict asset and income restrictions or because they are eligible but have not enrolled in the program some basic considerations poverty under the baselines when discussing policy options to address elderly poverty it is instructive to take closer look at the poor elderly figure 1 provides projected elderly poverty rate s under both the scheduled and payable baselines in 2042 the first full year of projected trust fund insolvency34 these projections were produced by crs using the urban institutes dynasim microsimulation model for more details on the dynasim model and its use in this analysis please see the appendix httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34433crs8 the projected elderly poverty rate is 11 under the payable baseline and 5 under the scheduled baseline under the pa yable baseline few groups stand out as having poverty rates that are substantially above average for example racial and ethnic minority groups have higherthanav erage projected poverty rates 19 for black and hispanic elderly and 21 for asian and native american elderly labeled as other in figure 1 elderly individuals with low levels of education are projected to have three times the overa ll poverty rate 33 unmarried elderly individuals are projected to have high rates of poverty 21 for never married individuals 17 for divorced individuals and 13 for widowed elderly individuals finally women are projected to have high er poverty rates than men 13 compared to 9 respectively source crs projections produced using the urban institutes dynasim microsimulation model benefit receipt among poor elderly when considering policy change it is also useful to consider what kinds of benefits if any the poor elderly receive social security about 70 of the poor elde rly are projected to receive social security benefits under the payabl baseline in 2042 compared to 97 of the nonpoor elderly the poverty rate among elderly individuals who receive social security benefits is projected to be 8 under the payable baseline in 2042 compared to 58 among individuals who do not receive social security benefits thus even after accounting for potential acrosstheboard cuts social security is projected to keep many elderly out of poverty and to pr ovide income to most of those who remain poor4 5 10 7 4 10 5 2 4 2 7 9 1311 9 13 6 1919 21 33 13 8 3 10 11 13 6 13 17 215 6 7 6 70 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 all men women white black hispanic other less than 12 years high

szymenderassi fewer of the elderly poor receive ssi than social security however ssi recipients are much more likely to be poor than are social s ecurity beneficiaries about 22 of the poor elderly are projected to receive ssi benefits under the payable baseline in 2042 compared to 1 of the nonpoor elderly the poverty rate among elderly individuals who receive ssi is pr ojected to be about 75 under the payable baseline in 2042 compared to about 9 among elderly individuals who do not receive ssi benefits interactions between policy op tions and lowincome programs when discussing changes to public policy it is important to keep in mind the possible unintended consequen ces of potential change one of the advantages of microsimulation model such as dynasim is that it brings unexpected interactions between policy options and existing program rules to light social security is complex program and changes to its structure could lead to unexpected results both within the social security program and in the relationship of social security to ssi and other meanstested programs th results presented here show only the interactions that occur within and between social security and ssi as dynasim does not model other lowincome programs so since the offici poverty thresholds are based only on money income policy inte ractions with inkind or quasicash benefits such as medicaid or food stamps would not affect peoples poverty status changes to social security could potentially affect eligibility and benefit levels for various government assistance programs any change to social security benefits could affect ssi eligibility and benefit levels in turn any change to ssi eligibility direct or indirect could affect eligibility for number of lowincome programs including medicaid food stamps and the lowincome home energy assistance program liheap in the most extreme cases an increase in social security benefits could actually make some lowincome beneficiaries worse off because they would lose eligibility for other programs as result ssi changes to social security could affect ssi since ssi eligibility and benefit levels are determined in part using applicants income which includes social security benefits35 the ssi rules stipulate that an individuals countable income cannot exceed the federal benefit amount plus the federallyadministered state supplements if applicable in additi on the rules stipulate that the first 20 of unearned income including social security benefits can be excluded from the ssi benefit calculation after that each additi onal dollar of social security benefits results in one dollar reduction in fede ral ssi benefits once state supplement payments are factored in an additional dolla r of social security benefits could result in reduction of more than one dollar in to tal ssi benefits thus an increase in social security benefits could cause some people to lose ssi eligibility and cause others to receive less in ssi benefits

separate application even other states have the option to impose medicaid eligibility requirements that are more restrictive than ssi criteria food stamps ssi recipients living alone or in household where all members receive ssi benefits are automatically eligible for food stamps liheap households with member receiving ssi are categorically eligible for liheap so changes to ssi eligibility would also affect liheap eligibility37 effects of policy interactions on the cost of policy options the interactions between changes to social security or ssi and lowincome programs affect not just beneficiaries but the total cost of an option as well for example increased ssi enrollment could lead to higher expenses not just for ssi but also for medicaid the food stamp program and lihe ap this is because greater number of ssi recipients would mean greater number of people who are categorically eligible for these programs increasing their cost similarly an increase in social security benefits could lead to higher expenses for social security but lower expenses for ssi medicaid the food stamp program and liheap this is because higher social security benefits would increase the total income of some people enough so that they would lose eligibility for ssi and other meanstested programs minimizing the effects of policy interactions if one wanted to increase social security benefits while minimizing effects on ssi eligibility and benefit levels one option would be raising ssis 20 earned income exclusion which has not changed since 1981 this change would allo w greater proportion of social securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34433crs11 38 on several occasions in the past when changes to social security benefits would have made some beneficiaries ineligible for ssi congress has deemed such individuals eligible for ssi for the purpose of receiving medicaid benefits 39 to be insured for retirement benefit an individual needs to have at least 40 credits or 10 years of covered work an individual would not have to be eligible for the current law special minimum to qualify for this alternative minimum benefit benefit increases to be pa ssed on to ssi recipients and allow greater number of recipients to maintain ssi eligibility raising the unearned income exclusion would also allow policymakers to increase social security benefits with fewer effects on beneficiaries eligibility for dicaid food stamps and liheap it would also be possible to raise soci security benefits while preserving currentlaw eligibility for medicaid f ood stamps andor liheap for some ssi recipients without increasing ssis unearne d income exclusion legislation could deem current ssi recipients eligible fo r ssi for the purposes of qualifying for medicaid food stamps andor liheap wit hout actually paying them ssi benefits38 this way ssi recipients who lost ssi eligibility after change to social security would not lose their eligibility to the aff ected programs such deeming provision would only affect individuals who were already receiving ssi when the policy was implemented not necessarily individuals in the future who could have received ssi under the old rules policy options and their projected effects on benefit levels and elderly poverty the following section describes each of the four options crs modeled it also provides the projected effects of the options on social security and ssi bene fit levels and eligibility in 2042 and th interaction between the two programs these four options were chosen to illustrate differe nt approaches to mitigating poverty in benefit cut scenario allowing policymaker s to see the potential pros and cons of generic options the details of each option could be modified or combined with other provisions this analysis does not c over potential transition issues nor the cost of the options modeled option 1 povertyline minimum social security benefit the first option would create new minimum social security benefit equal to the elderly poverty line under this op tion any individual who was insured for social security ie who had enough credits to qualify for worker benefit would be guaranteed primary insurance amount p ia at least equal to the singleperson elderly poverty threshold39 some social security beneficiaries c ould receive this minimum and still be poor under the option since the pia would be equal to the poverty threshold under this option an individual would onl get povertyleve l benefit if he or she claimedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34433crs12 benefits at the full retirement age at which unreduced benefits are paid most people especially people with low inco mes claim benefits before their full retirement ages and are thus subject to permanent reduction in monthly benefits for example claiming benefits at social securitys earliest eligibility age 62 permanently reduces workers pias by 30 if they were born in 1960 or later finally poverty is family measure not an individual measure so if person receives povertyline benefit but other mbers of hisher fa mily have little or income that person could still be considered poor in addition some benefici aries would not receive minimum benefit under this option because they would not qualify for benefits based on their own work records but would receive benefits based on others work eg spouse benefits in which person receives 50 of hisher spouses pi these auxiliary beneficiaries do not have their own pias and in some cases their benefits would be less than poverty projected change in benefits the mean change in social security benefits among all benefici aries is projected to be about 2 under this option eligibility for social security would not change under the option but the additional income received would disqua lify some individuals from ssi as result about 12 of individuals 307000 who received ssi benefits under the baseline are projected to lose their entire ssi benefit among beneficiaries projected to retain eligibility for ssi about 20 would receive wer benefits this effect on ssi benefits dilutes the options poverty reduction effect projected change in elderly poverty the povertyline social security minimum benefit option is projected to re duce the elderly poverty rate by about one percentage point compared to the current law payable baseline reducing the net number of elderly poor by bout 494000 individuals in 2042 figure 2 shows the projected effect of this option on the poverty status of elderly individuals living in poor familie s in 2042 by demographic characteristics an estimated 7 561000 of the elderly poor would be moved out of poverty the option is projected to have bigger povertyreduction effect on some subgroups within the elderly poor than others for example the option is projected to bring 23 of married poor elderly individuals out of poverty but only 12 of each non married group this result might seem count erintuitive since married individuals are less likely than nonmarried individuals to receive higher social security benefits under the option but it reflects the fact that married people can potentially be brought out of poverty by spouses benefit incr ease about 67000 indivi duals are projected to fall into poverty under this option incr easing the number of elderly poor by about 1 all of these individuals are project ed to lose ssi benefits under the option httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34433crs13 40 in fact creating minimum benefit equal to the poverty line as in option 1 would also disproportionately benefit people with longer work histories for example about 8 of poor elderly with more than 40 years of work are projected to be br ought out of poverty by the option compared to about 4 of poor derly with fewer than 20 years of work 41 s 1878 in the 108th congress for more details see the social security administration memorandum to stephen c goss chief actuar from chris chaplain actuary and alice h

1 compared to payable baseline by demographic characteristics 2042httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34433crs14 42 for example the pia for an individual w ith 35 years of work would be 120 of the monthly single elderly poverty threshold in the year of eligibility the option would not apply to individuals receiving social security disability di benefits however when di beneficiary is converted to retired worker benefits at his or her full retirement age as required by law modified slidingscale minimum benefit formula would apply which would reflect the number of years the disabled individual was able to work the minimum benefit would be 120 of the poverty threshol d for workers with at least 35 times as many social security credits as elapsed years gr adually scaling down to minimum benefit for workers with credits equal to the number of th eir elapsed years this modified scale would also apply to survivor beneficiaries in cases where the worker died before age 62 benefit42 for people with 30 or fewer ears of work the minimum benefit guaranteed under this option would be ss than poverty even individuals who qualify for minimum pia at the poverty line or higher could still be poor under this option for the same reasons described for th previous option they could be subject to benefit reductions or other members of their fa milies might not have enough income for the enhanced benefit to bring the entire unit out of poverty projected change in benefits overall there is projected to be change in the mean amount of social security benefits under this option eligibility for social security would not change but the additional social security benefits some individuals receive would disqualify them for ssi as result about 2 of individuals 60000 who would have recei ved ssi benefits under the baseline are projected to lose eligibility the model estimates that the option would disqualify more people for ssi than it would bring out of poverty after accounting for changes in both social security and ssi benef its among beneficiaries who retained eligibility for ssi projected 6 would have lower ssi bene fits under the option projected change in elderly poverty the slidingscale minimum benefit option is not projected to change the pr ojected elderly poverty rate from the current law payable level of 11 it is projected to have negligible effect on the net number of elderly poor in 2042 figure 3 shows the projected effect of this option on the poverty status of derly individuals living in poor families in 2042 breaking down the results by demographic characteris tics overall about 1 58000 of the poor elderly are projected to come out of poverty compared to the payable baseline the poverty reduction effect of this proposal is not projected to vary dramatically by subgroup each group s hows either change or 1 coming out of poverty almost as many elderly are proj ected to fall into poverty as result of this option as are taken out of it 58000 indi viduals compared to 53000 individuals respectively many of those put in poverty are projected to lose ssi benefits under the option httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34433crs15 43 in 2007 the monthly ssi

inflationource crs projections produced using the urban institutes dynasim microsimulation model option 3 poverty line ssi federal benefit rates under this option ssis fede ral benefit rates would be increased to the elderly poverty thresholds for i ndividuals and couples43 the asset thresholds and income exclusions for ssi would remain the sa as under current law ie would not increase with inflation increasing the federal benefit rate would effectively liberalize eligibility for ssi since ssis income eligibility thresholds are linked to federal benefit rates some ssi beneficiaries could still have benefits that are less than poverty under the option person could for example receive less than the full federal benefit rate because there is dollarfordollar reduction in federal ssi benefits for unearned income above the thresholds in addition since poverty is determined for families and ssi benefits are paid to individuals or couples person could receive povertyline ssi benefit

the number and demographic brea kdown of individuals who are projected to come out of poverty under each of these op tions varies substantially overall the number of elderly poor people brought out of poverty would vary dramatically from 1 for option 2 to 24 for option 4 option 1 is projected to bring 7 of the elderly poor out of poverty compared to 5 for option 3 as far as demographic breakdowns option 1 is projected to bring greater proportion of married individuals out of poverty which reflects the fact that married people can potentially be brought out of poverty by spouses benefit increase the povertyreduction effects of option 2 would not vary much by subgroup probably because the impact of the option would be small overall bo th of the ssi options options 3 and 4 are projected to bring greater proportion of nonmarried individuals and the oldest elderly age 85 out of poverty in part because these groups are more likely to receive ssi program interactions one of the most striking differences between the social security and ssi options is whet her and how they interact with other programs both of the social security options reduce eligibility and benefit levels for ssi which in turn can affect eligibility for other benefit programs for option 2 in particular this inter action would offset the pove rty reduction effect of the policy both of the ssi options are free of similar interaction effects they each increase ssi benefits without affecting eligibility or benefits for social security however increased eligibility for ssi coul d affect participation in the food stamp program and other lowincome programs for which ssi recipients are categorically eligible targeting spending toward the elderly poor if one of the objectives of reforming social security were to mitigate the effect of possible benefit reductions on the elde rly poor targeting spending would become an important consideration one way to m easure such targeting is to compare the estimated effects of potentia l policy options on the elderly poor vs the elderly non poor other ways of analyzing the targe ting of an option include measuring the poverty gap and looking at the proporti on of people who fall below given percentage of the poverty threshold eg 150 or 200 of poverty however this report focuses on elderly people who are officially considered poor figure 7 shows the elderly poor the target group for the modeled policy options for each option it shows the propor tion of individuals projected to gain income labeled winners lose income lab eled losers or stay the same labeled change the income measure shows the projected net change in income under each option including both social security and ssi benefits so these projections reflect the interaction

povertyline minimum social security benefit under option 1 which would create new minimum so cial security benefit at the poverty line about twothirds of the poor elderly 68 are projected to be unaffected there are several reasons poor indi viduals may not be affected because they dont qualify for social security benefits because they receive benefits ba sed on another persons work record or because they began to receive benefits before the option was implemented as shown in figure 7 projected 27 of the poor elderly would be winners but most arent projected to ga in enough income to bring

actuaria l model and thus cannot estimate the solvency effect of proposed policy change the dy nasim model does not contain all of the information required to produce solvency estimates for example dynasim does not calculate childrens benefits and so complete account of benefit payments cannot be calculated in addition dynasim simulates the population between the years 1993 and 2050 the benefits received by individuals outside of this yearly range would not be included in the calculations for these same reasons long term cost estimates cannot be calculated among the nonpoor elderly most 96 are projected not to be affected as shown in figure 8 about 4 are projected gain income under the option none of the nonpoor elderly is projected to lose income summary of results the ssi options analyzed in this report are better targeted toward the elderly poor than are the social security options among the elderly poor the ssi options are projected to create more winners and losers this is because ssi recipients by definition are mostly poor so any changes to ssi would affect mostly poor people among the non poor the ssi options change the incomes of fewer people and cause one to lose income the social security options are projected to cause some people to lose income especially poor people this is primarily because of the interaction between social security and ssi each additional dollar of social security benefits could reduce ssi recipients benefits by one dollar or more after factoring in st ate supplements and could disqualify some recipi ents for ssi altogether other considerations in addition to considerin g benefit levels poverty ra tes and targeting as examined above policymakers examining th potential effects of social security reform on the elderly poor would likely c onsider other criteria when discussing policy changes to either social security or ssi the following section briefly summarizes some of these other criteria one important factor not explicitly addressed in this report is the cost of each option which would vary substantially the dynasim model does not produce cost estimates and current cost estimates for these options are not ava ilable from other sources49 program design and purpose one possible subject for discussion if policy changes are considered is the origin purpose of the programs that could be modified for example ssi was originally designed to benefit the poor and its strict income and asset limits restrict benefits to the poorest derly as such expanding ssi eligibility or benefits would effectively target additional spending toward the elderly poor social security on the othe r hand was not primarily intended to reduce poverty but to replace the lost earnings of contributing workers of all income levels changing the social security benefit formula to mitigate the effects of changes on the elderly poor arguably would not target additional dollars as efficiently it also might complicate the balance between adequacy and equity in the social security program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34433crs24 50 social security administration defined contribution pension plans and the supplemental security income program policy brief 200601 march 2006 at httpwwwssagovpolicydocspolicybriefspb200601pdf 51 see crs report rl31414 baseline budget projections discussion of issues by marc labontepotential scope of changes another possible subject for discussion is the potential scope of policy chan ges factors such as prog ram participation rates and eligibility restrictions social security participation among the elderly is nearly universal ssi has strict eligibility criteria and its participation rates are far lower as result changes to ssi would likely ffect fewer of the elderly poor than would changes to social security some individuals prefer not to receive meanstested assistance and would not participate in ssi regardless of changes other individuals may not qualify even for liberalized ssi pr ogram because of asset restrictions this would be particular problem for peopl with retirement savings as defined contribution retirement plans such as 401ks and individual retirement accounts count toward ssis asset test50 political and fiscal environment finally another potential topic that could be discussed is the pr evailing political and fiscal nvironment in recent years major changes to social security and ssi have been rare for example the last significant amendments to social secur ity were in 1983 ssis income disregards and asset tests have stayed the same since 1981 and 1989 respectively and are not indexed to inflation there ar also fiscal constraints on additional spending the federal budget is currently in deficit and is projected to remain so in the future51 in addition social security faces longterm solvency problems ultimately future elderl poverty rates depend larg ely on how policymakers choose to address social securitys l ooming solvency problems once those decisions are made the tradeoffs between any options to mitigate the effects of potential benefit cuts would be judged based on their effectiveness efficiency cost and on policymakers judgments about myriad of other factors httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34433crs25 52 for more detailed explanation of the dynasim model please see urban institute primer

methodology this paper examines four possible polic options to reduce elderly poverty the projections in the paper were prepared using the urban institutes dynasim microsimulation model52 the dynasim model projects future social security and ssi benefits by using mix of historical data and projections when interpreting the results of dynasim or any other model it is important to note that projections are inherently imprecise the further into th future one looks the wider the range of possible outcomes population the analysis focuses on all noninstitutionalized individuals who will be age 65 or older in 2042 including those who do not recei ve social security andor ssi benefits baseline all of the options in this paper are compared to current law payable baseline which assume s that current law benefits are cut across the board to balance social securitys annual income nd spending at the point of insolvency currently projected to occur in 2041 this baseline illustrates how such options could work in benefitcut scenario some of the most commonly discussed solvency options are projected to result in poverty rates similar to the current law payable baseline in the year of analysis as di scussed above using different baseline or different solvency option woul d lead to different results year of analysis this report focuses on the effects of policy changes in 2042 the first full year of projected trust f und insolvency analyzing this year shows how various povertyreduction options coul d mitigate the effects of an acrossthe board cut to social security benefits at the projected point of insolvency assuming action was taken before th this reduction is ssumed to bring annual cash flow balance to the system cuttin g benefits by about 25 in 204253 the figures and accompanying analysis are essentially snapshot of the projected beneficiary population in this single year focusing on different year would lead to different results it is also important to recall that initial social security benefits rise with wages over time while ssi bene fits and income limits as well as the poverty thresholds rise with prices since wages are projected to rise faster than prices over time this means that in general the projected prevalen ce of ssi receipt decreases each year under current law as does the number of people in poverty start year for options all of the options in this report are assumed to be implemented in 2008 the year 2008 was chosen so that the analysis could rely as much as possible on nearterm projections which are more reliable than longtermhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34433crs26 54 the dynasim model projects nuclear families not households 55 the federal poverty thresholds are an absolu measure of income historically since wages have risen faster than prices the amer ican standard of living has risen over time since the official poverty thresholds are incr eased with inflation they measure the amount of income necessary to maintain constant standard of living not the amount of income needed to keep up with rising standards of liv ing assuming wages continue to grow faster than prices the disparity between rising real incomes and fixed real poverty threshold will lead to decreasing proportion of the population being in poverty 56 the poverty thresholds for the elderly are lower than those for the nonelderly in 2007 the threshold for workingage people was 10787 for an individual and 13884 for couple us census bureau poverty th resholds 2007 at h ttp wwwcensusgovhhes wwwpovertythreshldthresh07html 57 the poverty measure counts most sources of pretax money income eg earnings social security pensions cash public assistance inte rest and dividends alimony and child support among others noncash benefits such as the value of medicare and medicaid public housing or employerprovided health care nd nearcash benefits eg food stamps are not counted as income nor are tax payments subtracted from income nor are tax credits added eg earned income tax credit eitc projections in addition choosing an earlier start year means that almost all of the elderly beneficiaries in the analysis year 2042 will be subject to the options measure of income many of the results presented in this paper focus on changes in income for the purposes of this paper income includes social security benefits ssi benefits pension payments earnings and the annuitized value of financial assets in modeling these options social security benefits were calculated before ssi benefits this sequence is intended to mimic program rules in which ssi applicants must apply for all other benefits for which they may qualify before applying for ssi as result the interactions between social security and ssi benefits can be seen income is calculated on per capita basis which means that for married couples the income of both spous is averaged together however in showing poverty status measure of family in come is used since the official poverty threshold is calculated on family basis54 poverty thresholds in the us poverty is officially defined using the census bureaus poverty thresholds these thresholds reflect rough estimates of the amount of money individuals or families need per year to purchase basket of goods and services deemed minimally adequate according to the living standards of the early 1960s when the poverty thresholds were developed the thresholds are increased at the rate of inflation55 the 2007 annual poverty threshold was 9944 for an elderly individual nd 12533 for an elderly couple56 family is considered poor if its countable money income is less than the poverty threshold for its family type and size57 this report uses the official poverty thresholds appropriate for each individuals family type and size including the thresholds for elderly individuals and couples the thresholds are projected using the inte rmediate assumptions about future inflation from the 2005 soci security trustees reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34433crs27 58 as described above the academic literature estimates that about onehalf to twothirds of qualifying elderly participate in ssi 59 for example see elder powers 2006behavioral changes this analysis assumes that behavioral changes result from the modification of the social s ecurity or ssi benef it rules thus policy changes will not automatically alter an individuals work patterns or age at benefit takeup however its likel that if policy changes we re implemented individuals incentives and behavior could also change the model assumes that roughly two thirds of individuals who qua lify for ssi take up benefits58 for policies with liberalized eligibility criteria such as the ssi options analyzed in this report the same proportion of qualif ying individuals is assumed to take up benefits however it is possible that more generous ssi program would also change the proportion of qualifying individuals taking up benefits which is not captured in these projections59 the analysis also assumes changes in state policy as result of policy changes at the federal level however it is possible that federal policy changes in ssi could result in adjustments to st ate supplements for example
