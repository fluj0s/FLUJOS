possessions are generally us citizens typically the united states taxes its citizens on their worldwide income but residents of the us possessions puerto rico the us virgin islands guam american samoa and the commonwealth of the northern marian islands are generally not required to pay federal income taxes on income whose source is within the possessions similarly federal excise taxes do not apply in the possessions and residents of the possessions may qualify for exemption from fede ral estate and gift taxes for their part corporations that conduct business ope rations in the possessions can also qualify for reduced federal taxes although one federal tax benefit delivered by the possessions tax credit and the puerto rican economic activity tax credit have expired in short the united states generally doe s not apply its taxes to the possessions the precise outlines of the federal tax jurisdiction vary from territory to territory and there are exceptions social security taxes generally apply in the possessions the possessions apply their own tax systems in some cases their territorial tax systems are required to reflect federal ta x provisions exactly some possessions are required to apply socalled mirror tax systems in other cases however the possessions own tax systems depart signif icantly from federal tax rates and rules this report provides background informa tion concerning number of policy issues that have received congressional considerati on analysis of these policy issues is beyond the scope of this report some of these issu involve the political status of the possessions and their relationship with the united states whether the possessions are taxed unfairly or more favor ably than the states taking into account their limited participation in federal spending programs and whether the possessions that use the mirror system of taxation have sufficient fiscal flexibility given the difference between their economies and that of the united states this

background and economic data on the possessions see government accountability office us insular areas economic fiscal and accountability challenges gao report gao07119 washington dc dec 2006federal taxes and the us possessions an overview introduction1 the united states normally taxes its citizens on their worldwide income regardless of the incomes economic source us taxes also apply to the worldwide income of corporations chartered in th united states residents of the us possessions puerto rico pr the us virgin islands usvi guam american samoa as and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands cnmi are generally us citizens2 however they are not subject to us federal taxes on income they earn in the possessions3 in addition to tax deferral opportunities that benefitted many firms operating in the possessions us firms located in the us for time received favored treatment under the federal corporate income tax under the puerto rican economic activities tax credit 26 usc 30a the special tax credit however expired january 1 2006 mo st federal excise taxes do not apply in the possessions although an exception is the tax on petroleum and the other environmental excise taxes and estate and gift taxes generally do not apply to persons who were reside nts of the possessions in short us federal taxes do not for the most part apply to the us possessions there are exceptions resident s of the possessions generally pay social security taxes and the precise extent of federal taxation in the insular areas varies once one moves beyond possessionssource in come earned by possessions residents as we shall see for example in the case of some possessions re sidents of us are subject to federal taxes on possessionssour ce income in other cases they are not the possessions own tax systems likewise vary as does fede ral laws role in defining those systems three of the possessions the virgin islands guam and the cnmi are required to mirror the u s internal revenue code and use federal tax rules and rates as their own albeit in some cases with substantial degree of flexibility pr and american samoa however are permitted to determine their own tax systems prs system does depart in some significant ways from the current federal system while american samoas tax system mirrors the federal code with some modificationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32708crs2 before adding more details cautionary note is in order residents of the possessions are generally exempt from fede ral taxes but one cannot automatically conclude that residents of the possessions are taxed more or less favorably than residents of the 50 states and the district of columbia one reason is that the territorial tax systems are generally imposed at higher level than state income taxes another reason is federal spending par ticipation by the po ssessions in federal spending programs in some cases departs s ubstantially of that of the us states the general framework how the possessions fit into the us tax system first brief overview of how the unite d states defines its tax jurisdiction vis vis the rest of the world the next s ection provides point of comparison for federal tax treatment of th possessions the tax treatme nt of the possessions are somewhat of hybrid of inte rnational and domestic tax law us internationa l tax framework the us bases its tax jurisdiction par tly on residence or income destination as noted above us taxes apply to the worldwide income of us citizens and residents whether the income is earned at home or abroad the us however allows its taxpayers to credit foreign taxes they pay abroad against us taxes they would otherwise owe on foreign income th us thus conced that the country where income is earned has the primary jurisdiction to tax as the source jurisdiction of the income consistent with the source of incom tax principle us residents and nonresident aliens are generally subject to us taxes on income earned in the united states the us thus asserts primary tax jurisdiction over us sourced income regardless of the citizenship status of the earner us treatment of corpora tions parallels that of individuals corporations chartered in the us the business count erparts of us citizens are subject to us taxes on their worldwide income but can claim foreign tax credits for taxes paid on foreign income foreign corporations ar generally taxed on their us income but their foreign earnings are not subject to us taxes under this structure us firms that conduct their foreign operations thr ough subsidiary foreign corporations can with some exceptions postpone us taxe s on foreign income indefinitely this deferral of taxes in some cases constitutes tax benefit for us firms with foreign income us possessions tax framework us tax treatment of the possessions is mostly outside of the international structure separate set of rules governs federal taxati on of the possessions in some respects however us taxation of the i ndividuals who reside in the possessions is like its treatment of foreigners as not ed above possessions residents are exempt from federal taxes on possessionssource inco but are with some exceptions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32708crs3 taxed on income sourced from us state also us residents ar subject to federal taxes on their possessionssource income as if it were foreignsource income however possessions taxes can generally be claimed as foreign tax credits thus as with foreignsource income the united states in sense concedes primary tax jurisdiction to the territory where the income is earned with some exceptions it retains primary tax jurisdiction over us state sourced income earned by possessions residents generally corporations chartered in the possessions are treated like foreign chartered corporations under the internal revenue code in principle they are exempt from federal taxes on possessions income us firms that invest in the possessions through possessions subsidiaries can at least potentially obtain deferral of federal taxes most us firms that operate in the possessions however have traditionally chosen instead to use th possessions tax credit or in the past the puerto rican economic activitie s credit two alternative ta x credits that until recently conveyed larger tax benefit than ferral in 1996 however congress passed legislation phasing out the tax credits and repealing them completely beginning in 2006 thus firms located in the us will choose to operate in the possessions through possessionschartered co rporations so as to avail themselves of the deferral tax benefit but with the deferral of ta x for possessions corporations the federal government in effect grants primary jurisdiction to tax corporate income to the possession where the income is earned puerto rico individuals federal individual income tax treatment of puerto rico pr is largely determined by section 933 of the internal revenue code as noted above the us normally taxes its citizens on their worldwide income regardless of where it is earned and individuals born in pr are us citizens however section 933 exempts individuals who are residents of pr for the entire year from federal taxes on income earned in pr except in the case of income earned as us government employees section 933 applies only to income from puer to rican sources residents of pr are subject to federal taxes on income from the us or foreign countries residents of the us are in principle subject to federal taxes on income from pr income taxes paid to the possessions can generally be claimed as foreign tax credits which means some or all of the federal taxes that would otherwise apply may be offset prs own tax system is distinct from those of the other insular areas in that it does not mirror the federa l internal revenue code the differences between the puerto rican and federal tax rates and th rules governing income and deductions can be significant for example in 2007 pr s tax rates for individuals range from 7 to 33 us federal tax rates ranged from 10 to 35 the personal exemption amount under the pr income tax in 2007 was 3000 for married filers and 1300 for individual filers pr taxpayer s then deduct an additional 1600 for eachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32708crs4 dependent the federal pe rsonal exemption was 3400 for each filer spouse and dependent in 2007 thus for married coupl with two dependents the pr total personal exemption would be 6200 whereas the total federal personal exemption would be 13600 the pr standard deduction in 2007 was 3150 for married couples and 2100 for individuals the federal standa rd deduction was 10700 for couples and 5350 for individuals pr filers like us filers can also choose to itemize deductions rather than use the standard deduction amount corporations in puerto rico as outlined above us firms that operate in the possessions through possessionschartered corporations are not immediately subject to us corporate income tax possessionssource income recei ves deferral of federal taxes as long as it is not repatriated to th us parent in addition however an alternative more generous tax benefit for co rporations had been availa ble in pr and the possessions in the form of the possessions tax credit and an economic activity tax credit in general the possessions tax credit provide d tax exemption for specified portion of firms possessions income the economic activity tax credit provided tax credit whose size was linked to firms wages and depreciation in the possessions the tax credits however expired january 1 2006 in the years following world war ii pr depended on the possessions tax credit and its own set of tax benefits to attract investment to pr from the us most observers agree that the tax benefit and increased investment that the tax preferences initially prompted the tran sformation of the puerto rican economy from one based on agriculture to one based on manufacturing services and trade at the time however the credit was criticized on severa l grounds that it had high revenue cost compared to its employment effect that large share of the benefit did not accrue to residents of pr and that it distorted deliberations over prs political status as result over time the credit was subject to series of modifications designed to limit its revenue cost and tie the credits benefit and effects more tightly to taxpayers activity in pr in 1993 provisions were enacted that capped the possessions tax credit at 40 and that linked the alternative economic activities credit to wages and depreciation claimed on tangible investment the modifications culminated with the small business job creation act of 1996 pl 104188 which phased out the cr edits and repealed them beginning january 1 2006 under the phaseout provisi ons before complete repeal the credit could only be claimed by firms that used the credit before 1996 existing claimants in addition the 1996 act s ubjected both the possessions tax credit and the economic activity credit to an additi onal annual cap that limits business income eligible for the credits to an amount li nked to pre1996 baseperiod increased by specified growth factor the caps were designed to prevent even existing claimants from greatly expanding their use of th credits during the phase out period prs corporate income tax consists of normal tax and surtax whose rates combine to top corporate tax rate of 39 at the same time however certain

fully below in the section on excise taxes most federal excise taxes do not apply in pr or the other possessions an exception however is provided by section 7652 of the internal revenue code which applies special excise tax to items produced in pr or the us virgin islands usvi and shipped to the united states the tax is equal to any excise tax that would apply to an identical item produced in one of the us states or the district of columbia the tax was first imposed to ensure that producers in the possessions would not ve tax advantage over goods produced in the us th at are subject to excise taxes5 for example rum that is produced in either the usvi or pr and that is sold in the states is subject to the same tax as rum produced in the states most of the revenue from the socalled equalization ta x however is returned covered over by the federal government to the treasuries of pr and the usvi6 in addition the caribbean basin initiative of 1983 provides that all reve nue from federal excise taxes on rum imported into the us from any source including any foreign country is remitted to the tr easuries of pr and the usvi7 congress has frequently modified the cover over adminis tration following is brief legislative history the deficit reduction act of 1984 pl 98369 placed cap on the rebate of excise taxes on rum and other distilled sp irits the 1984 act increased the federal tax rate on spirits from 1050 per proofg allon to 1250 subsequent legislation increased the rate to 1350 per proofga llon the 1984 act also provided however that the rebate to pr and the usvi w ould be calculated ba sed on prior laws 1050 rate in imposing the cap congress stated that it did not wish to expand the rebate as would have occurred automatically with the taxrate increase

increased the cap to 1130 per proofgallon effective for shipments of rum and distilled spirits brought into the us during the fiveyear period october 1 1993 through september 30 1998 the increase was enacted in the context of scalingback by the act of the possessions tax credit with the expiration of obra93s temporary increase in the rebates cap the limitation returned to its previous 1050 level the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 pl 106170 and the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 107147 however provided temporary incr eases in the cap to 1325 per proof gallon through december 31 2003 in conjunc tion with the extension of number of other tax provisions not re lated to the possessions the working families tax relief act of 2004 pl108311 extended the 1325 amount through 2005 the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 extended the 1325 amount through 2007 the presidents fy2009 budget proposes to extend the higher amount two years through 2009 as does s 2886 us virgin islands section 932 of the federal tax code c oordinates the usvi and the federal taxation of usvi residents and us stat residents with usvi income under its terms individuals who are residents of the usvi at the close of the tax year are not subject to federal income taxes on their worldwide income be it from the usvi us or foreign sources the exemption is contingent on the person reporting their worldwide income to the usvi identifying its source and paying their usvi tax liability on the income the treatment of usvi residents thus departs somewhat from that of prs residents who are exem pt from federal taxes only on puerto rican source income for us state residents with usvi income section 932 provides that taxes are to be paid to the us and the usvi in proportion to the share of gross income earned in each location the usvi income tax system is generally mirror of the federal system the usvi uses income tax provisions of the federal tax code as its own with the term virgin islands substituted for united states where the latter appears in the code the usvis mirroring of the federal syst em is required by federal law it was established by the naval appropriations act of 1922 within the general mirror framework however the usvi has certain amount of flexibility for example the usvi can impose surtax of up to 10 within the mirror framework it also has the authority to impose local income taxes in addition to mirrored taxes notwithstanding the mirroring requirement the usvi also has the authority to grant tax rebates subject to

numerous areas of ambiguity and problems of interpretation these technical difficulties made administration of the law problematic cr eating climate of uncertainty for investors and raising the

benefits within the mirror system is limited by section 934 of the federal tax code which provides that benefits can only be provided with respect to usvi income and cannot be applied to the usvi tax liability of individuals who are us state residents within the limits of section 934 the usvi has enacted program of tax incentives designed to stimulate economic development under its terms investors can receive tax reduction of up to 90 of their tax liability the program is admin istered by the virgin islands economic development authority9 the mirror systems interaction with federal taxes has produced certain ambiguities in the past and in some cases have led to attempted taxsheltering activity several of these problem areas were addressed by the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 which implemented the cu rrent basic versions of sections 932 and 93410 more recently the american job creation act of 2004 ajca pl 108357 addressed several perceived ambiguities in residence and sourceofincome rules that some taxpayers were apparently using to avoid federal ta x on what was actually income sourced to us state the gal positions taken by the taxpayers and not accepted by the internal revenue servi ce were described in irs notice 200445 issued in june 2004 key to the taxpayer s positions was residence for tax purposes under prior law residence in the usvi fo r tax purposes was determined on the basis of facts and circumstances rather than by bright line test according to the irs taxpayers actually living and working in the us attempted to establish usvi residence with only minimal connection to the usvi under internal revenue code section 932 an individual establishing usvi residence would pay taxes to the usvi rather than to the federal government but purported establishment of usvi residence still left the matter of usvi taxes which under the mirror code genera lly apply at the sa rates applicable under the federal income tax here the taxpayers in ques tion were able to obtain up to 90 reductions in tax using tax incen tives provided by the virgin islands economic development authority as scribed above section 934 prohibits the usvi from providing tax benefits with re spect to income whose source is not thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32708crs8 11 for example tax code section 932c provides that for residents of the usvi the virgin islands is treated as including the united states according to the irs some taxpayers took the position that ussource income was thus usvi income for tax purposes see irs notice 200445 internal revenue bulletin 200428 june 24 2004 12 48 usc 1421usvi thus posing potential obstacle to the taxavoidance strategy the income in question was from the provision of services in the us however the taxpayers used several arguments to maintain that their income from services provided in the us was usvisource income for tax purposes11 section 908 of the ajca established sing multipart test for residence in the possessions that replaces the factsandcircumstances basis of prior law the new test requires that person establishing re sidence in possession must be present in the possession for at least 183 days of the tax year must not have tax home outside the possession and must not have closer connection to us state than to the possession the ajca also applies the fede ral tax codes existin g and general rules for determining the source of income to determining the source of income with respect to the possessions as noted above in the discussion of pr federal excise taxes apply to goods produced in the usvi and shipped to the u s the federal government returns the revenue from the excise taxes to the us vi plus with pr share of revenue collected on rum imported into the united states from foreign countries as with pr however the rebate with respect to tax on rum and distilled spirits is capped at 1325 per proof gallon 025 less than the full federal rate of 1350 the cap reverted to lower amount at the end of 2007 guam federal individual income tax treatment of guam residents is similar to that ofusvi residents under the provisions of section 935 of the us internal revenue code residents of guam are required to file tax returns with guam but not with the us federal government guam residents satisfy their federal tax liability by filing tax return with guam thus as with the usvi residents of guam are completely exempt from federal taxes on income from us based sources and foreign sources as well as income earned within guam itself similarly residents of the us are not required to file tax returns unde r guams territorial tax they satisfy any potential tax liability on guamsource income by filing with the us under the terms of the guam organic act of 1950 guam is required to mirror the income tax provisions of the federal internal revenue c ode as its own tax system 12 the tax reform act of 1986 tra86 pl 99514 contained provisions giving guam the authority to devise its own tax system implementation of the acts provisions however was made contingent on the signing of an agreement between guam and the federal government regardin g rules for the prevention of tax evasion rules

perspective of an individual guam taxpayer with income from nonguam sources new section 931would make difference he or she would have to pay tax to the federal government because of the cover ov er however there would be fiscal impact on guam 14 50 usc appendix 501593 15 according to federal budget documents th total amount of cover overs to guam of withheld taxes is currently 42 million per year us office of management and budget budget of the united states gover nment fiscal year 2005 appendix washington gpo 2004 p 639potential reimposition of the mirror system if the tax system adopted by guam were to fail to produce as much tax revenue as the mirror system at present however this second condition is moot while an imp lementation agreemen t has been drafted it has not gone into effect thus as of this writing guam continues to mirror the income tax provisions of the us internal revenue code the tra86 also repealed section 935 of the internal revenue code although as with repeal of the mirror system sec tion 935 continues to apply pending adoption of the required implementing agreement in place of section 935 the act applied revamped version of tax code section 931 to guam along with the commonwealth of northern mariana islands and american samoa under its terms in manner similar to the treatment of pr residents of the three possessions are exempt from federal taxes only on income from sources within the possessions they are generally subject to federal taxes on income earned outside the possessions at the same time however the new provisions provided for th united states to cover over to guam all tax collected from guam residents13 again however section 931 does not yet apply in guam or the northern mariana islands the tax treatment of us military pers onnel has been of special concern to guam over the years due to the large number of military personnel stationed on guam and the relatively large number of guamanians serving in the us armed forces and stationed outside guam under the soldiers and sailors relief act military personnel generally do not lose their state or territo rial domiciliary status for tax purposes because they are absent from the state or territory in question on military duty14 thus guamanians in the military service in the us or abroad are generally guam residents subject to taxation by guam under section 935 of the tax code by the same logic nongu amanian military personne l stationed on guam would ordinarily not pay taxes to guam however section 7654 of the tax code provides for the us treasury to remit or cover over to guam federal taxes withheld on military personne l stationed on guam also guams organic act provides for taxes withheld by the federal government on guamanian military personnel outside guam to be covered over to guam15 for corporations the possessions tax credit and economic activities credit were available in guam for existing claimants as with pr the credits expired on january 1 2006 but in contrast to pr and the usvi the credits were not subject to the caps that apply during the phase out pe riod in complement to the federal tax benefits guam has enacted tax incen tive program for inbound investment underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32708crs10 16 for description see the website of the guams economic development authority at httpwwwinvestguamcompghomeits territorial income tax the incentives consist of rebates of up to 100 of tax16 recent federal tax legislation relating to guam focused on the operation of guams mirror tax system as it applies to foreign investors in general the united states tax code applies flat withhol ding tax to dividends and similar income earned by foreign portfolio investment in the united states at the same time the united states has entered into numerous b ilateral tax tr eaties with foreign countries that substantially reduce or eliminate th withholding tax the purpose of the reductions is to attract foreign investment to the united states since guams territorial income tax mirrors the federal tax code 30 withhol ding tax applies to foreign nonresidents who invest in guam si nce guam is not considered part of the united states for tax purposes however the treatymandated reductions applicable to foreigners investments in the us do not apply to investment in guam in 2002 congress enacted the guam foreign investment equity act pl 107212 which authorizes guam to apply the treatyma ndated reduced withhol ding tax rate to foreign investors in guam commonwealth of the northern mariana islands federal taxation of commonwealth of northern mariana islands cnmi residents follows the treatment of guam re sidents residents of the cnmi satisfy their federal and cnmi tax liabilities by filing returns with the cnmi and are thus effectively exempt from federal taxes on their worldwide income residents of the us satisfy their cnmi tax liability on any cnmisource income by filing with the united states technically the statutory source for the treatment is section 601 of the northern mariana islands covenant public law 94241 however the covenant generally applies the provisions of sec tion 935 of the internal revenue code to the cnmi the cnmi covenant also provides that the income tax rules of the cnmi are to mirror the internal revenue code in the same manner as those laws are in force in guam the mirror system is thus the starting point for the cnmi at the same time however the covenant provides that the cnmi may impose additional local taxes and can provide rebates of any taxes applied by the mirror system to income from cnmi sources the cnmi has used this flexibility to depart substantially from the mirror system the commonwealth provides substantial rebates of mirrored taxes and imposes its own tax on wa ges and salaries as well as separate tax on certain types of nonwage income eg income from the sale or lease of personal property the cnmi also imposes business gross receipts tax the net result is hybrid tax system that is probably less progressive than the system would be if there were rebates at the same time 2000 general accounting office now the
