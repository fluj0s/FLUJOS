are now in place to ensure the sensitivity of the data is accounted for s bulk ingest capability dti developed an internal selfservice program to ingest large datasets for automated exploitation and enhancement of tide records the selfservice capability allows dti to quickly ingest large datasets into tide in flexible environment where those providing the technical support are fully trained on dtis policies and work closely with those who will process the data the result is fewer policy errors and the ability to quickly make modifications and set priorities based on dtis needs the programs efficiency has enabled dti to ingest multiple dalasets in the time that the previous process would have taken to prioritize the datasets ijfouo database development ilgs data exploitation team developed database which has created multiple efficiencies for internal processes the database allows for automated tracking metrics reporting increased accuracy in deduplication and allows for tracking and identification of ksts for further research the database also aliows for tracking of fisa classified cables this database has saved at least 10 hours of work per week and has streamlined processes for rfis metrics and identity management based on this success this database has been duplicated for other internal dti sections snfj eft of cbp packages to tide after 2plus years of
