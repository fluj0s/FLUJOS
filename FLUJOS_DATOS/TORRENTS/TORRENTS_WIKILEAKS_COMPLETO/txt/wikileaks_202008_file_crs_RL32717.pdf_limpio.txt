january 8 2009 the house and senate will convene in joint session for the purpose of opening the 2008 presidential election electoral votes submitted by state government officials certifying their validity counting them and declaring the official result of the election for president and vice president1 this report describes the steps which precede the joint session and the procedures set in the constitution and statute by which the house and senate jointly certify the results of the electoral vote it also discusses the procedures set in law governing challenges to the validity of an electoral vote and makes reference to the procedures followed during the joint session in 2005 by which the election of george w bush was certified due to the absence of specific and persuasive authority on some issues and in the interest of brevity this report attempts at least to identify and present some of the possible issues and questions which have been raised even when not necessarily resolving them by reference to authoritative source material or decisions the topics presented are arranged in the approximate order of their occurrence much of what follows in this report is based on the united states constitution particularly article ii section 1 and amendment 12 and on federal law enacted in 1887 and amended in 1948 now codified in title 3 of the united states code 2 reference is also made to congressional precedent and practice early congressional precedents on the counting of electoral votes which may be found in hinds and cannon s precedents of the house of representatives are sometimes inconsistent with each other and with more recent practice this record coupled with disputes over the electoral count in 1877 provided the im petus for codifying procedure in the 1887 law precedents which predate the 1887 act may be primarily of historical significance particularly to the extent that they are inconsistent with express provisions of the 1887 act as amended g3g140g157g146g152g151g156g561g14g142g138g141g146g151g144g561g23g153g561g157g152g561g157g145g142g561g12g152g146g151g157g561g21g142g156g156g146g152g151g561

president announced that president ulysses s grant had received majority of the whole number of electoral votes even though he also indicated that not all of those electoral votes had been counted in that case the two houses under procedures similar to those described below had decided not to count the electoral votes from arkansas and louisiana nonetheless the number of electoral votes allocated to arkansas and louisiana evidently were included in the whole number of electoral votes for purposes of determining whether president grant had received the majority required for election 7 it should be noted that president grant was victorious by whichever standard was used he received 286 electoral votes out of the 352 electoral votes counted or out of the potential 364 electoral votes if the contested votes from arkansas and louisiana were included in the whole number in 1865 by contrast only two of the three nevada electors cast their electoral votes in the joint session only two nevada votes were counted and included in the whole number of electoral votes8 similar instances of votes not given by electors not being included in the whole number of electors reported thus reducing the socalled denominator and the majority needed to elect occurred in 1809 1813 and 18179 we are not aware of instances in which this issue has become source of contention or was determinative of which candidate was elected if electoral votes from state or the district of columbia were not available to be counted during the joint session and if the question were raised in timely fashion the joint session might be called upon to address the effect of this situation on what number of votes would constitute the majority of the whole number of electors appointed

to follow in debating and voting on an objection these procedures limit debate on the objection to not more than two hours during which each member may speak only once and for not more than five minutes then it shall be the duty of the presiding officer of each house to put the ma in question without further debate under this provision the presiding officer in each house held in 1969 that motion to table the objection was not in order 14 in the house the speaker announced both in 1969 and 2005 that he would attempt to recognize supporters of the objection and opponents in an alternating fashion for the duration of the two hour period in one instance in 1969 the speaker inquired whether member supported or opposed the challenge before he agreed to recognize him to speak members can yield to each other during debate as they can during fiveminute debate in the committee of the whole and many chose to do so in 2005 the speaker also entertained unanimous consent requests to insert material in the congressional record in 1969 the senate agreed by unanimous consent to different way in which the time for debate was to be controlled and allocated granting one hour each to

general grounds for an objection to the counting of an electoral vote or votes would appear from the federal statute and from historical sources to be that such vote was not regularly given by an elector andor that the elector was not lawfully certified according to state statutory procedures the statutory provision first states in the negative that electoral vote regularly given by electors whose appointment has been lawfully certified from which but one return has been received shall be rejected 3 usc 15 and then reiterates for clarity 16 that both houses concurrently may reject vote when not so regularly given by electors so certified 3 usc 15 it should be noted that the word lawfully was expressly inserted by the house in the senate legislation s 9 49 th cong before the word certified17 such addition arguably provides an indication that congress thought it might as grounds for an objection question and look into the lawfulness of the certification under state law the objection that votes were not regularly given may in practice subsume the objection that the elector was not lawfully certified for vote given by one not lawfully certified may arguably be other than regularly given nevertheless the two objections are not necessarily the same in the case of the socalled faithless elector in 1969 described above the elector was apparently lawfully certified by the state but the objection raised was that the vote was not regularly given by such elector in the abovedescribed 2005 case the objection was also based on the grounds that the electoral votes were not under all of the known circumstances regularly given

its historical experience prior to 1887 congress was particularly concerned in the statute of 1887 with the case of two lists of electors and votes being presented to congress from the same state three different contingencies appear to be provided for in the statute for two lists being presented in the first instance two lists would be proffered but the assumption presented in the law is that only one list would be from electors who were determined to be appointed pursuant to the state election contest statute as provided for in 3 usc 5 and that in such case only those electors should be counted in the second case when two lists were proffered as being from two different state authorities who arguably made determinations provided for under 3 usc 5 state statutory election contest determined at least six days prior to december 18 the winner of the state presidential election the question of which state authority is the lawful tribunal of such state to make the decision and thus the acceptance of those electors votes shall be decided only upon the concurrent agreement of both houses supported by the decision of such state so authorized by its law in the third instance if there is determination by state authority of the question of which slate was lawfully appointed then the two chambers must agree concurrently to accept the votes of one set of electors but the two chambers may also concurrently agree not to accept the votes of electors from that state 15 deschlers precedents ch 10 38 pp 2023 16 see conference report on 1887 legislation congressional record vol

the electors whose appointment was certified by the governor of the state shall be counted it is not precisely clear whether this provision for resolving cases in which the house and senate vote differently applies only to the last two situations that is when either two determinations have allegedly been made under state contest law and procedure or such determination has been made or instead also when only one such determination is present althou gh this section of the statute is not free from doubt its structure and its relationship to 5 and to give effect to 5 seem to indicate that when there is only one determination by the state made in timely fashion under the states election contest law and procedures even when there are two or more lists or slates of electors presented before congress then congress shall accept that state determination 3 usc 15 as conclusive 3 usc by this interpretati on the language providing that if the house and senate split the question shall be decided in favor of the choice certified by the governor may not have been intended to be applicable to cases covered by the first clause in the statute in which only one slate or group has been determined in timely fashion to be the electors through the states procedures for election contests and controversies hinds precedents of the house of representatives suggests that when state has settled the matter in accordance with law of that state six days before the time for the meeting of electors then controversy over the appointment of electors in that state shall not be cause of question in the counting of the electoral vote by congress 18 it should be noted that hinds cites precedent or ruling but merely paraphrases the statute and it seems likely that this issue of the lawfulness of the determination and certification by state could be raised and dealt with in the joint session precedent subsequent to the statutes original enactment in 1887 has been sparse there appears only to have been one example in 1961 when the governor of the state of hawaii first certified the electors of vice president richard m nixon as having been appointed and then due to subsequent recount which determined that senator john f kennedy had won the hawaii vote certified senator kennedy as the winner both slates of electors had met on the prescribed day in december cast their votes for president and vice president and transmitted them according to the federal statute this was the case even though the recount was apparently not completed until later date that is not until december 28 19 the presiding officer that is the president of the senate vice president nixon suggested without the intent of establishing precedent that the latter and more recent certification of senator kennedy be accepted so as not to delay the further count of electoral votes this was agreed to by unanimous consent20
