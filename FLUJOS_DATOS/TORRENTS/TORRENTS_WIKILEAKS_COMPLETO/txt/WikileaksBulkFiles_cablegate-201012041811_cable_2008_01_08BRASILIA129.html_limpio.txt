eair pgov br subject brazilian defense minister on dca trip to france and russia civil aviation ref state 3557 b brasilia 99 c state 3163 classified by ambassador clifford sobel reason 14 b and d 1 c summary brazilian defense minister nelson jobim told the ambassador january 17 that he would like to sign defense cooperation agreement dca ref when he visits washington in march but that he faces stiff opposition in the ministry of external relations mre or itamaraty he briefed the ambassador on his upcoming trip to france and russia and on his continuing work regarding civil aviation matters the internal gob discussion on the merits of dca will likely center on the message the gob thinks it will send regarding the nature of brazils relationship with the united states end summary defense cooperation agreement the battle is joined 2 c in private breakfast on january 17 the ambassador told jobim that his initial approach on dca to mre under secretary for political affairs everton vargas had not been sipdis well received and that vargas had specifically mentioned secretary general vice minister samuel guimaraes when sipdis asking for time to work the issue internally ref b jobim responded that guimaraes posed serious problem not only on the dca but on variety of issues jobim said that guimaraes hates the united states and is actively looking to create problems in the relationship jobim said that he has had to beat back more than one outlandish proposal by guimaraes calculated to upset relations with the us and other industrialized countries 3 c jobim said that he would like to sign the dca when he travels to washington in march guimaraes has told him that cannot happen and is working hard to prevent the dca from being concluded he argued that as jobims predecessor went to the united states in 2007 protocol demands return visit by the us defense secretary comment strictly speaking this is not true as the meeting between the secdef and jobims predecessor was not part of an official counterpart visit end comment he told jobim that his trip would mean nothing compared with the symbolism of visit by the secdef to brazil jobim said he pushed back telling guimaraes that itamaraty is the process not the substance of engagement on his issues but he told the ambassador that he does not want to win the battle and lose the war and expend too much political capital on the dca so will have to proceed carefully in particular he said if guimaraes and fm amorim join forces against dca that could be serious problem submarines in france helos in russia 4 c jobim told the ambassador that the primary purpose of his upcoming trip to france is to discuss design issues for nuclearpowered submarine he also said that he will look at frances rafale airplane in russia jobims primary purpose is to ensure servicing for brazils russian helicopters he noted that russia wants to open jeep facility in porto alegre and that he will travel to russia in an embraer plane in the hope of making sales there civil aviation engaged on latest problems 5 sbu jobim told the ambassador that he believes he has found options for avoiding the proposed draconian increase in landing fees at sao paulos guarulhos airport ref c especially as they can have another apron ready quickly he asked for another few weeks to work the issue discussing brazils airport operator infraero he said that the current management problems are so big that more time will be needed before he can consider opening it up to foreign investors 6 c comment jobims candid comments on guimaraes confirm similar messages from us vargas and longterm planning brasilia 00000129 002 of 002 minister roberto unger ref b regarding the difficult internal battle in the gob that will surround the proposal for dca with the united states as he has since the beginning of his tenure jobim continues to challenge the historic supremacy of itamaraty in all areas of foreign policy president lulas direction to jobim to postpone his visit to washington initially planned for january until he had met with his latin american counterparts was almost certainly provided on the basis of input from itamaraty and presidential foreign policy advisor marco aurelio garcia in the same way the merits of dca are likely to be considered by the gob at least in part in light of the message it will convey regarding the nature of brazils relationship with the united states once again president lula may have to play the deciding role between an unusually activist defense minister interested in developing closer ties with the united states and an mre that is firmly committed to maintaining control over all aspects of foreign policy and to keeping measure of distance between brazil and the united states
