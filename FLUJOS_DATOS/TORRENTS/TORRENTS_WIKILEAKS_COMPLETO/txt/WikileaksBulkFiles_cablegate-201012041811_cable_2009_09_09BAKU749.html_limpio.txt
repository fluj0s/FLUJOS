baku 526 and previous baku 696 and previous f baku 287 classified by charge donald lu reasons 14 b and d 1 snf summary azerbaijans president ilham aliyev utilizes distinctly different approaches to foreign and domestic policies he typically devises the former with pragmatism restraint and helpful bias toward integration with the west yet at home his policies have become increasingly authoritarian and hostile to diversity of political views this divergence of approaches combined with his fathers continuing omnipresence has led some observers to compare the aliyevs with the fictional corleones of godfather fame with the current president described alternately as mix of michael and sonny either way this michaelsonny dichotomy complicates our approach to baku and has the unfortunate effect of framing what should be strategically valuable relationship as choice between us interests and us values end summary 2 snf this striking aspect of president ilham aliyevs governing style was very neatly summed up recently by the witty but somewhat pasthisprime xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx protect commenting on the goajs harsh reaction to the youtube donkey video reftel xxxxxxxxxxxx quipped to the charge that what one must understand about aliyev hes not michael corleone hes sonny to some in baku xxxxxxxxxxxx godfather analogy seems apt capturing essential truths not only about ilham aliyev but his father heydar who becomes by implication the vito corleone of azerbaijan with that in mind this cable attempts to explain who ilham aliyev is and why he does what h does aside from xxxxxxxxxxxx analogy it also owe much to the appraisals of michael and sonny from the godfather doctrine 2008 by john hulsman and wess mitchell thats my family kay its not 3 c ilham aliyev inherited newly independent resourcerich state brought to order in the postsoviet era by this father heydar aliyev scarred by catastrophic war with armenia that resulted in occupation of the nagornokarabakh enclave and seven surrounding azerbaijani regions he assumed the presidency in 2003 concurrent with his fathers death in an election marked by lack of competition and debate at time when azerbaijans redeveloped oil and gas resources were being brought on line for export dogged by widespread doubts about his suitability for leadership based on his age then 41 lack of achievements and playboy image he oversaw the launch of one millionbarrelsperday oil pipeline which has flooded official and unofficial coffers in baku and serves as the financial backbone of the country 4 c the president and his cohorts who largely were carried over from his fathers administration now seek predictability stability and continuity to preserve and protect public and private fortunes ilham aliyevs landslide 2008 reelection was followed by hastilycalled march 2009 referendum which among other things removed term limits for the president aliyevs cabinet has changed very little over the years with few reformers brought in or remaining in power the prime minister position is largely ceremonial and weak because of family connections dynastic succession the strong arming of the opposition and the creation of an elaborate patronageprotection network the aliyev administration has developed an organized crime image in some quarters leading some analysts to see ilham aliyev at times in mafialike role never hate your enemies it affects your judgment baku 00000749 002 of 004 5 c in their short study the godfather doctrine hulsman and mitchell present brothers sonny and michael corleone from the godfather as exemplars of two out of three schools of us foreign policy thought with consigliere tom hagen representing the third however there are important points they raise about the two that apply well to aliyev and his policies abroad and at home michael they write is talented balancer of alliances aware of limitations on his own power who importantly knows when something isnt personal but only business sonny by contrast is brash impulsive and puts blind faith in force to address affronts to the corleone family for him business is personal finally sonny refuses to contemplate present or future in which the corleone family does not dominate new york despite obvious and growing portents to the contrary this is business not personal balanced foreign policy 6 s president aliyev inherited from his father clever realistic foreign policy that he has largely maintained with the overarching goal of maintaining and increasing azerbaijans independence and sovereignty he encourages involvement with nato and euroatlantic security and political structures and supports policy of westward transit of azerbaijani oil and gas through nonrussian channels otherwise though he alternates between assertiveness and appeasement where his powerful neighbors russia and iran are concerned for example azerbaijan routinely accuses russia of supplying armenia with weapons and pointedly absents itself from the collective security treaty organization csto while participating in guam at the same time aliyev constantly plays up his relations with president medvedev with frequent visits and has kept open the channels of negotiation on energy issues concluding small but symbolically important agreement with gazprom to supply gas to dagestan reftel b he is assertive enough to defend azerbaijans prerogative for an independent policy but discreet enough that he is in danger of joining saakashvili on moscows hit list 7 s in foreign policy aliyev has also been able to maintain generally the distinction between business and personal for all his bluster about azerbaijans legal right to liberate the armenianoccupied territories by force aliyev has worked constructively on the minsk groupproposed basic principles and developed reportedly good rapport with armenian president sargsian in contrast to the much more confrontational relationship between the countries foreign ministers similarly even as aliyev regards with horror the prospect of turkeyarmenia rapprochement ahead of nagornokarabakh resolution the president has instructed socar to continue gas transit and supply talks with turkey and one in baku has dared to consider cut in oil exports through the btc pipeline the gas transit talks are hardball affair to be sure but aliyev surely recognizes that azerbaijan cannot really afford total rupture with turkey and certainly is not going to go so far as to foreclose on options out of pique while the turkeyarmenia question remains open you touch my sister again and ill kill you the hardliner 8 s for all of the coolheaded calculation that generally influences aliyevs foreign policy his domestic policies are another matter as aliyev perceives challenge to his authority or affronts to his family dignity even minor ones he and his inner circle are apt to react or overreact much to the detriment of the countrys democratic development and movement toward western alliances the example of the crude retaliation against the young bloggers emin milli and adnan hajizade is the most recent and public example reftel earlier defending his decision to rescind licenses for foreign broadcasters aliyev expressed his anger that radio baku 00000749 003 of 004 liberty had mocked his plan to build the worlds tallest flagpole in the baku port area demonstrating exceedingly thin skin reftel c 9 snf it is examples like these that inspired xxxxxxxxxxxx quip to the charge about sonny and michael xxxxxxxxxxxx elaborated on the point in that conversation recalling times when he was an xxxxxxxxxxxx and similar situations arose heydar would never have allowed himself to be goaded into ridiculous reactions he said note xxxxxxxxxxxx memory on this might be little selective but he has point that the space for opinion was wider under the last president view often echoed by journalists who look back to the 1990s nostalgically end note ilham aliyev in xxxxxxxxxxxx view is not inclined to subtlety or deliberation in his response to these kinds of issues i dont feel i have to wipe everybody out just my enemiesq 10 s aliyev takes the actions he does in order to eliminate even the semblance of risk to his political prominence his goal appears to be political environment in which the aliyev dynasty is unchallenged which was demonstrated by the hastily organized march 2009 constitutional referendum removing presidential term limits this strangled the hopes of any and all pretenders to succession including his wife who in azeri politics is thought of as rival pashayev not an aliyev 11 s the dissonance between aliyevs sensible approach to foreign affairs manifested by the cosmopolitan image he presents to western visitors with his tailored suits and flawless english and the unpleasant reality of his approach to domestic issues raises the obvious question of how these two realities coexist one explanation is that aliyev is insecure in domestic politics and relies heavily on the advice of oldline sovietstyle political figures carried forward from his fathers administration such as presidential chief of staff ramiz mehdiyev alternatively aliyevs domestic actions are free choices made in accordance with his instincts with mehdiyev and others playing the heavy 12 s occasionally aliyevs confident toughguy image gives way to an impression that he is yielding on domestic issues outside pressure does not always fail recent positive example was the outcome of the parliaments initiative to ram through russianstyle law on ngos in the face of domestic outcry including from governmentsupported ngos the presidential administration intervened to prevent the law as drafted from passing reftel d likewise the president recently rejected bill from parliament that would have required foreignbased entities to hire vetted azerbaijanis citizens as deputy directors the business community strongly opposed this bill reftel also the government earlier this year released one of the prominent journalists whose imprisonment was widely believed to have been politically motivated reftel f keep your friends close and your enemies closer 13 s comment it is clear that azerbaijans future development would better suit united states policy goals if aliyev pursued his domestic policies in manner that resembled his foreign policy methods however imperfect they may be fullscale democratic conversion however is an unlikely outcome and the record of presidents in this region leaving office voluntarily is rather thin what is desirable and perhaps achievable however is that aliyev would govern as manager of alliances viewing the political space occupied by dissents as source of ideas and warning system for when policies are hurting the national interest and ceasing to feel that he should strike hard at every criticism that arises or that he can do so without consequences at least this type of evolution would better prepare azerbaijan for the postilham aliyev era whenever baku 00000749 004 of 004 that begins 14 s comment continued here is where the godfather analogy begins to break down in azerbaijan the role of loyal consigliere to the father and the is played by the longtime head of presidential administration ramiz mehdiyev mehdiyev is calm conciliating tom hagen we do not know if president aliyev personally ordered the many ironfisted domestic initiatives although he almost certainly approved them even if afterthefact we do see mehdiyevs fingerprints all over the arrests of journalists the stifling of opposition leaders the closure of mosques the restrictions on the media and the general lawandorder approach to governance is he the puppet or the puppetmaster at age 71 and often seen in frail health this is an increasingly important question while the rule of 47year old ilham aliyev could continue for decades it would be most likely without the benefit of his consigliere without mehdiyev it is not clear whom aliyev will turn to for help in maintaining the same firm grip on the instruments of power 15 u don corleone i need man with powerful friends i need all of those policians you carry around in your pocket like so many nickels and dimes lu
