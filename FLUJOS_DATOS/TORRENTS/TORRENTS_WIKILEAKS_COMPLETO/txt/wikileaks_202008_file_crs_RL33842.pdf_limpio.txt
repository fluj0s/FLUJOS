are criminally and civilly liable for the misconduct of their officers and employees committed within the apparent scope of their authority for the benefit of the corporation corpora tions frequently direct their attorneys to conduct internal investigations to determine if the corpora tion is in compliance with regulatory and other legal requirements much of the information gathered in these investigations is protected by the attorneyclient privile ge and the attorney work product doctrine unless waived once waived the informati on is often available to private civil litigants in addition most corporations advance their officers and employees attorneys fees relating to job related litigation the justice department enjoys prosecutori discretion to bring criminal charges against corporation its culpable officers or employees or both in some instances indictment alone can be cat astrophic if not fatal for corporation the thompson memorandum since revised as the mcnu lty memorandum desc ribed the policy factors to be considered in the exercise of this discretion two of the factors explicitly mentioned were whether corporation had waived its privileges and whether it had cut off the payment of attorneys fees for its officers and employees in united states v stein federal district court in new york determined that implementation of the policies in the thompson

privilege protec tion act of 2007 hr 3013 introduced by representative scott wa s reported out of committee and passed the house under suspension of the rules on november 13 2007 it would bar the federal investigators regulators and prosecutors from demanding that corporations waive their attorney client or attorney work pr oduct protection or from cutting off attorneys fees for their officers

perception has changed however corporate criminal liability is now matter of legislative choice and the view of the courts is much the same as it was over century ago when the supreme court observed we see valid objection in law and every reason in public policy why the corporation which profits by the transaction and can only act through its agents and officers shall be held punishable by fine because of the knowledge and intent of its agents to whom it has intrusted authority to act in the subject matter of making and fixing rates of transportation and whose knowledge and purposes may well be attributed to the corporation for which the agents act while the law should have regard to the righ ts of all and to those of corporations less than to those of individuals it cannot shut its eyes to the fact that the great majority of business transactions in modern times are conducted through those bodies and particularly that intersta commerce is almost entirely in their hands and to give them immunity from all punishment because of the old and exploded doctrine that corporation cannot commit crime would virtually take away the only means of effectually controlling the subjectmatter

1979upjohn claims that the communications to counsel made by all of its employees including regular and middle management employees as well as top management are privileged as confidential communications between client and attorney to the extent that the communications were made by officers and agents not responsible for directing upjohns actions in response to legal advice we disagree for the simple reason that the communications were not the clientsit is available to corporations as well as to individuals18 in the case of corporation it now seems beyond dispute that the privilege applies to the confidential communications from its officers agents and employees to its attorney for the purpose of supplying the corporati on with legal advice or assistance19 at one time however some courts believed the privile ge should be limited to the communications of the control group of the corporation those ultimately responsible for corporate policy the supreme court in upjohn found this reading too limited20 the case began when officials at upj ohn became concerned that some of its officers or employees might have been i nvolved in the busine ssrelated bribery of foreign officials21 upjohns general counsel was instructed to conduct an investigation22 following the internal inves tigation upjohn reported suspicious payments to the securities and exchange commission sec and the internal revenue service irs23 the company also identified which of its officers and employees had been interviewed or had s ubmitted responses to questionnaires as part of the internal investigation24 then the irs issued summons demanding that upjohn turn over all its files on the internal investigation including responses to its general counsels questionnair and memoranda and to not of the investigations interviews conducted under his supervision25 upjohn refused to comply claiming attorneyclient and attorney work produc t privileges and the irs sought judicial enforcement of its summons26 the sixth circuit court of appeals rej ected upjohns attorneyclient claim on the grounds that the communications sought were not those of upjohns control group thus not those of the clie nt and therefore not privileged27 the supreme courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33842crs6 28 upjohn co v united states 449 us 383 39091 1981internal citations omitted such view we think overlooks the fact th at the privilege exists to protect not only the giving of professional advice to those who can act on it but also the giving of information to the lawyer to enable him to give sound nd informed advice the first step in the resolution of any legal problem is ascertaini ng the factual background and sifting through the facts with an eye to the legally relevant in the case of the individual client the provider of information and the person who acts on the lawyers advice are one and the same in the corporate context however it will frequently be employees beyond the control group as defined by the court below officers and agents responsible for directing the companys actions in response to legal ad vice who will possess the information needed by the corporations lawyers middlele vel and indeed lowerlevelemployees can by actions within the scope of their employment embroil the corporation in serious legal difficulties and it is only natural that these em ployees would have the relevant information needed by corporate counsel if he is adequate ly to advise the client with respect to such actual or potential difficulties 29 449 us at 392 1981internal citations omitte d the control group test adopted by the court below thus frustrates the very purpose of the privilege by discouraging the communication of relevant information by employees of the client to attorneys seeking to render legal advice to the client corporation the attorneys advice will also frequently be more significant to noncontrol group members th an to those who officially sanction the advice and the control group test makes it more difficult to convey full and frank legal advice to the employees who will put into effect the client corporations policy 30 id the narrow scope given the attorneyclient privilege by the court below not only makes it difficult for corporate attorneys to form ulate sound advice when their client is faced with specific legal problem but also threaten s to limit the valuable efforts of corporate counsel to ensure their clients compliance w ith the law in light of the vast and complicated array of regulatory legisla tion confronting the modern corporation corporations unlike most individuals constantly go to lawyers to find out how to obey the law particularly since compliance with the law in this area is hardly an instinctive matter 31 otherwise courts have been willing to allow corporate employees to assert personal privilege with respect to conv ersations with corporate counsel despite the fact that the privilege generally belongs to the corporation only by meeting certain requirements first they must show they approached counsel for the purpose of seeking legal advice second they must demonstrate that when they approached counsel they made it clear that they were seeking legal advice in their indi vidual rather than in their representative capacities third they must demonstrate that the c ounsel saw fit to communicate with them in their individual capacities knowing that possible conflict could arise fourth theyfound this control group test insufficiently protective the test failed to recognize the importance of the attorneys fact gathering communications with the corporations employees conducte d in order to provide the co rporate client with legal advice or assistance28 in doing so it frustrated the very purpose of the privilege by discouraging full and frank disclosures by those associated with the company who were in position to expose it to civil nd criminal liability thereby denying counsel the basis for sound legal advice and assistance29 moreover it chilled communications between counsel and co mpany employees designed to ensure company compliance with the law30 in situation like the one in upjohn the attorney represents the corporation the privilege that envelops the communications with the attorney belongs to the corporation31 and may be waived by the corporation32 although disclosurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33842crs7 must prove that their conversations with couns were confidential and fifth they must show that the substance of their conversations with counsel did not

is unnecessary that there be actual litigation in progress for this privilege to apply36 moreover two or more clie nts represented by individual attorneys may agree to work jointly in common defense

occurred during and in connection with theprosecutor may consider the corporations willingness to waive the attorney client and work product privileges53 as the comment that followed explained one factor the prosecutor may weigh in ssessing the adequacy of corporations cooperation is the completeness of its disclosure including if necessary waiver of the attorneyclient and work product protec tions both with respect to its internal investigation and with respect to communica tions between specific officers directors and employees and counsel such waivers permit the government to obtain statements of possible witnesses subjects and target s without having to negotiate individual cooperation or immunity agreements in ddition they are often critical in enabling the government to evaluate the completene ss of corporations voluntary disclosure and cooperation prosecutors may theref ore request waiver in appropriate circumstances this waiver should ordina rily be limited to the factual internal investigation and any contemporaneous advice given to the corporation concerning the conduct at issue except in unusual circ umstances prosecutors should not seek waiver with respect to communications and work product related to advice concerning the governments criminal investigati on the department does not however consider waiver of corporations privile ges an absolute requirement and prosecutor should consider the willingness of corporation to waive the privileges when necessary to provide timely and complete in formation as only one factor in evaluating the corporations cooperation holder morandum vi b memorandums footnote appears in brackets the memorandum also addressed the adve rse weight that might be given corporations participation in joint defense agreement with its officers or employees and its agreement to pay their legal fees another factor to be weighed by the prosecutor is whether the corporation appears to be protecting its culpable employees and agents thus while cases will differ depending on the circumstances corporations promise of support to culpable employees and agents either through the advancing of attorneys fees through retaining the employees without sanction for their misconduct or through providing information to the employees about the governments investigation pursuant to joint defense agreement may be considered by the prosecutor in weighing the extent and value of corporations cooperation by the same token the prosecutor should be wary of attempts to shield corporate officers and employees from liability by willingness of the corporation to plead guilty some states require corporations to pay the legal fees of officers under investigation prior to formal determ ination of their guilt

the nature nd number of charges if any that they will bring against the responsible corporate entity and culpable individuals moreover the manner in which that prosecutorial discretion is exercised is

thompson memorandum vi b yet this is one of the few amendments to the holder memorandum to some the whole scale adoption of language from the earlier memorandum suggested justice department perception that the problem with the holder memorandum was not its content but its application the thompson memorandums description of the changes might be read to confirm this impression the main focus of the revisions is increased emphasis on and scrutiny of the authenticity of corporations cooperati on too often business organizations while purporting to cooperate with depart ment investigation in fact take steps to impede the quick and effective exposure of the complete scope of wrongdoing under investigation the revisions make clear that such conduct should weigh in favor of corporate prosecution moreover where the holder memorandum seemed to bespeak guidance the thompson appeared to sound command the holder memorandums introductory remarks provided that these factors ar however not outcomedeterminative and are only guidelines federal prosecutors are not required to reference these factors in particular case the rema rks might have suggested that prosecutors enjoyed some significant degree of flexibility as to whether and how to apply the standards it announced the thompson memo randum seemed to speak with much more commanding tone its introductory re marks stated

knowin g or reckless government interference94 it also found that the thompson memorandum nd the pressure the prosecutors exerted upon the accounting firm to cut off the paym ent of attorneys fees for the firms former employees impinged upon the right95 while the court conceded that the government had compelling interest in investigating and prosecuting crime and in preventing obstruction of those efforts it felt the means chosen to serve its interests were insufficiently tailored to satisfy strict scrutiny the first difficulty is that the thompson memorandum does not say that payment of legal fees may cut in favor of indictment only if it is used as means to obstruct an investigation indeed the text strongly suggests that advancement of defense costs weighs against an or ganization independent of whether there is any circling of the wagons if the government means to take the payment of legal fees into account in making chargi ng decisions only where the payments are part of an obstruction scheme and thereby narrowly tailor its means to its ends it would be easy enough to say so but that is not what the thompson memorandum says the concerns do not end here the argument that payment of legal fees to employees and former employees is relevant to gauging the extent of companys cooperation also is problematic it simply cannot be said that payment of legal fees for the benefit of employees and former employees necessarily or even usually is indicative of an unwillingness to cooperate fully this is especially unlikely after employees have been indicted and fired as is the situation here id at 36364 emphasis in the original the government faired better w ith its sixth amendment argument assistance of counsel the sixth amendment assures the criminally accused the right to assistance of counsel in all criminal prosecutions it is said the right generally attaches once prosecution has been commenced that is at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings whether by way of formal charge preliminary hearing indictme nt information or arraignment96 once attached the right includes the right to c ounsel of the defendants choosing subject to several limitations97 among those limitations is the fact that an accused has nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33842crs21 relationship with an opposing party even when the opposing party is the

property not that of third party 101 id at 36873 noting the similarity to gonzalezlopez and observing that the thompson memorandum discourages and as practical matter often prevents companies from providing employees and former employees with the financial means to exercise their constitutional rights to defend themselves this is so even where companies obstruct nothing and to the contrary do everything with in their power to make clean breast of the facts to the government and to take re sponsibility for any offenses they may have committed it undermines the proper functioning of the adversary process that the constitution adopted as mode of determining guilt or innocence in criminal cases the actions of prosecutors who implement it can make matters even worse as occurred here see also united states v stein 495 fsupp2d 390 42627 sdny 2007the department of justice in promulgating th aspects of the thompson memorandum here at issue and the usao in the respects discussed bove and in stein i deliberately or callously prevented many of these defendants from obtaining funds for their defense that they lawfully would have had absent the governments inte rference they thereby foreclosed these defendants from presenting the defense they wished to present and in some cases even deprived them of counsel of their choice this is intolerable in society that holds itself out to the world as paragon of justice right to secure counsel of his choice usin g funds subject to confiscation or as the supreme court stated defendant has sixth amendm ent right to spend another persons money for services rendered by an attorney even if those funds are the only way that that defendant will be able to retain the attorney of his choice98 the government contended that its c onduct could not constitute violation of the sixth amendment because 1 it had occu rred before indictment and thus before the right to counsel had attached and 2 the employees had sixth amendment right to pay for their counsel of choice with someone elses money attachment was obstacle replied the court when the motive or at least the clearly foreseeable result was to impede the employees criminal defense after they were indicted99 as for the supreme courts someoneelses money comment it refe rred to defendants using the governments money money to which they had neither right nor expectation here the court said the defe ndants had every reason to expect that the firm would have assumed their lega l expenses but for the governments intervention100 the governments conduct so struck at the heart of the

rather than the rule prosecutors may only request waiver of attorneyclient or work product protections when there is legitimate need for the privileged information to fulfill their law enforcement obligations legitimate need for the information is not established by concluding it is merely desirable or convenient to obtain privileged information the test requires careful balancing of important policy considerations underlying the attorneyclient privilege and work product doctrine and the law enforcement needs of the governments investigation whether there is legitimate need depends upon 1 the likelihood and degree to which the privileged information will benefit the governments investigation 2 whether the information sought can be obtained in timely and complete fashion by using

abuse claims that may deter the prosecution of worthy cases139 even if the memorandum fosters an environment in which employees must waive their fifth amendment privilege or be fired it results in
