law the unemployment compensation uc program funded by both federal and state payroll taxes pays benefits to covered work ers who become involuntarily unemployed for economic reasons and meet stateestablished eligibility rules federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34460crs2 5 for details on the unemployment compensa tion uc program and other unemployment benefits see crs report rl33362 unemployment insurance available unemployment benefits and legislative activity by julie m whittaker 6 the tur is essentially version of the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate published by the bureau of labor statistics that is the ratio of the total number of unemployed persons divided by the total number of employed and unemployed persons the iur is the ratio of all workers currently receiving re gular uc benefits to the total uccovered workforce the iur is based on uc program data collected by the states and compiled by the employment and training administration the iur is substantially different from the tur because it excludes several important groups selfemployed workers unpaid family workers workers in certain notforprofit orga nizations and several categories of workers in addition to those unemployed workers whose last jobs were in excluded employment the iur excludes the following those who have xhausted their uc benefits new entrants or reentrants to the labor force disqualified workers whose unemployment resulted from their own actions rather than from economic conditions and eligible unemployed persons who do not file for benefitsadministration of uc is under the purview of the us department of labor dol federal law sets broad rules that the 53 state programs must follow5 the extended benefit eb program the eb program established by p l 91373 26 usc 3304 may extend uc benefits at the state level if certain economic conditions exist within the state although the eb program is not currently active in any state it like the uc program is permanently authorized the eb program is triggered when states insured unemployment rate iur or total unemployment rate tur reaches certain levels6 all states must pay up to 13 weeks of eb if the iur for the previous 13 weeks is at least 5 and is 120 of the average rate for the same 13week period in each of the previous 2 years there are two other thresholds th at states may choose states may choose one bot h or neither option under these options the state would provide the following option 1 an additional 13 weeks of benefits if the states iur is at least 6 regardless of previous years averages option 2 an additional 13 weeks of benefits if the states tur is at least 65 and is at least 110 of the states average tur for the same 13weeks in either of the prev ious two years or an additional 20 weeks of benefits if the states tur is at least 8 and is at least 110 of the states average tur for the same 13 weeks in either of the previous two years the eb program imposes additional restrictions on individual eligibility for benefits it requires that worker be actively searching and available for work furthermore the worker may not receive benefits if the worker refused an offer of suitable work finally claimants must have recorded least 20 weeks of fulltime insured employment or the equivalent in insured wage s during their base periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34460crs3 methods for determining 20 w eeks of fulltime insured employment states use one two or three different methods for determining an equivalent to 20 weeks of fulltime in sured employment these methods are described in both law section 202a5 of the euca and regulation 20 cfr 6154b in practice states that require any of these three requirements for receipt of regular uc benefits and do not allow for exceptions to those requirements do not need to establish that the worker met the 20 weeks fulltime insured employment the three methods are listed below earnings in the base period equa l to at least 15 times the high quarter wages or earnings in the base period of at least 40 times the most recentweekly benefit amount and if this alternative is dopted it shall use the weekly benefit amount incl uding dependents allowances payable for week of total unemployment before any reduction because of earnings pensions or other requirements that applied to the most recent week of regular benefits or earnings in the base period equal to at least 20 weeks of fulltimeinsured employment and if this alternative is adopted the term fulltime shall have the mean ing provided by the state law the base period may be the re gular base period or if applicable in the state the period may be the alterna tive base period or the ex tended base period if that determined the regular uc benefit the underlying reasoning behind the requi rements seems to be the following because there are 13 weeks in quarter 15 times the highquarter wage is roughly equivalent to 15 times 13 weeks of wages or about 20 weeks of wages many states require high quarterly earnings of under 2000 which is equivalent to less than 4hour under full time assumptions this is less than the federal minimum wage of 585hour similarly because the weekly bene fit amount is roughly equivalent to half the average weekly wage 40 times the weekly benefit amount is roughly equivalent to 20 weeks of wages financing unemployment benefits uc benefits are financed through em ployer taxes the federal taxes on employers are under the authority of the federal unemployment tax act futa and the state taxes are under the authority given by the state unemployment tax acts suta these taxes are deposited in the appropriate accounts within the us treasurys unemployment trust fund utf the federal tax pays for both federal and state administrative costs the federal share of the extended benefit eb program 50 loans to insolvent state uc accounts and state employment services the state tax pays for the regular uc benefit and the state share of the eb program 50 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34460crs4 extending unemployment compensation proposals temporary extension of unemployment benefits in general these proposals would title certain unemployed individuals to temporary extended unemploymen t benefits that are not available under current law and would expire in pproximately one year table 1 provides summary of each of these proposals all proposals would require that workers had exhausted all rights to regular uc benefits all proposals have some type of lookback provision where workers who had exhausted uc benefits generally ar ound one year previous to the proposal may be eligible for the temporar benefit at the program s termination all workers who were currently receiving the extended benefit would receive their full weeks of entitlement those workers who exhausted uc benefits after the termination would not be eligible for th temporary extension the base level of benefit ranges from 13 weeks the senate committee on finance proposal hr 4934 hr 5749 pl 110252hr 2642 to 20 weeks s 2544 an exception is hr 5688 which require s states to select various statelevel triggers and then meet certain economic conditions all proposals with the exception of h r 4934 and the final version of hr 2642 have some type of mechanism to declare certain states to be in period of high unemployment based on certain unemployment statistics workers in those high unemployment states would then be ligible for an additional extension of unemployment benefits how the benefit triggers on the senate committee on finance proposal s 2544 hr 5749 and hr 2642 would all create national entitlement of additional unemployment benefits upon enactment hr 4934 would trigger ne w national entitlement on the first day of the first month where the change in unemplo yed persons as compared to the previous year exceeds one million hr 5688 would trigger solely on state basis as determined by certain unemployment statistics detailed in table 1 financing most proposals would finance the mporary extension of unemployment benefits through the federa l accounts within the utf 100 federally funded hr 5688 would fund 50 up to 100 of the add itional benefits th rough the federal accounts within the utf table 1 details the conditions hr 5688 requires for its funding level
