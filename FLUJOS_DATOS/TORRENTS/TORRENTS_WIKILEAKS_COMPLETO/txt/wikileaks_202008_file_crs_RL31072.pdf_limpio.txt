agreements an analysis of trade related impacts august 3 2001 gary j wells visiting fellow foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31072regional trade agreements an analysis of trade related impacts summary the 107th congress is currently debating regional trade agreements rtas from two important perspectivesdirectly and in connection with granting the administration trade negotiating authority the congress is directly addressing rtas via the usjordan free trade agreement which has been approved in the house and is under consideration in the senate also the bush administration is negotiating agreements with chile and singapore that may be sent to congress for consideration in addition congress is weighing whether to grant the administration trade promotion authority tpa also know as fasttrack authority the administration has indicated it would use tpa to negotiate trade agreements at the multilateral level through the world trade organization and rtas at the regional and bilateral level while economic analysts are in general agreement that multilateral trade agreements yield improved social welfare the picture is more clouded for rtas this report considers numerous factors employed in judging rtas these factors include distinctions between multilateral and regional trade agreements the gains the united states can expect from entering regional trade agreements and the impact of the recent flurry of rta activity on us interests by allowing production to shift from domes tic producers to lower cost foreign producers rtas and multilateral agreements may result in trade creation but rtas may also cause trade diversion as trade shifts from lower cost nonrta members to higher cost members because of the tariff preference extended to members the potential for trade diversion is greater when the trade barriers facing nonrta members are high rta opponents also argue that rtas tend to exclude poor nations and distract attention from multilateral negotiations empirical analyses of rta formation generally find the immediate economic impact on the united states to be small whethe r the united states is in the rta or not at the same time the gains for us rta partners are considerably larger however numerous analysts believe that the united states solidifies foreign relationships and extends its influence over the trade agenda by forming rtas and the gains over an extended period are potentially much larger as the traderestraining impacts of national borders are reduced separate sets of rtas involving the eu and mexico appear to be causing the most concern for the united states eu trade with its rta members including intraeu trade is over three times us trade with its rta members opening the possibility that it will become dominant in setting the trade agenda mexicos trade agreements with the eu and numerous latin american countries raise different concern mexico may be positioning itself as trade hub with agreement members as spokes this hubandspoke setup may encoura ge firms to locate in mexico in order to have tarifffree access to member countries additionally us firms have to compete with firms from the other

of the americas status of negotiations and major policy issues by j f hornbeck crs report rs20864 regional trade agreements an analysis of traderelated impacts introduction since the end of world war ii the united states has championed multilateral trade agreements however as witnessed by the failure of the november 1999 world trade organization wto ministerial in seattle multilateral trade negotiations have become extremely difficult to start and if started they likely will be increasingly difficult to complete due to the expanded scope and complexity of the issues under negotiation in the face of these difficulties numerous countries have turned to regional trade agreements rtas as substitutes for or as prods to encourage multilateral trade talks1 typically regional trade agreements may come before the congress in two basic fashionsdirectly or through request for trade promotion authority individual rtas may be brought before the congress for approval consideration for example the us jordan free trade agreement negotiated during the clinton administration is currently before the congress the house voted to approve the agreement in the senate it was approved by the finance committee but floor vote has not yet been taken in addition the bush administration is currently negotiating bilateral free trade agreements with chile and singapore and multilateral free trade area of the americas ftaa2 depending on the progress of negotiations proposed agreements may be presented to the 107th congress for considerati on regarding trade promotion authority tpaor as it has historically been called fasttrack legislative authoritythe bush administration has asked that the congress grant this authority by extending tpa to the administration congress agrees to limit debate on qualifying trade agreements and to vote on the pending legislation within given time frame without amendments fast track or tpa expired in 1994 and attempts to renew the authority have not been successfu l the bush administration reportedly desires to use tpa to negotiate wide range of rtas as well as possible multilatera l trade agreement via the world trade organization wto opponents

free trade agreement as an example3 this report examines economic factors employed in assessing whether the united states is falling behind by not negotiating multilateral andor regional trade agreements first traderelated strengths and weaknesses of multilateral and regional agreements will be presented second potential gains from the united states negotiating trade agreements will be addressed finally the significance of the united states not being involved in the current flurry of trade agreements will be assessed this report will concentrate on the trade aspects of rtas as consequence two important aspects of the current regional trade agreement and tpa debatesinclusion of environmental and labor standardswill not be explored4 multilateral versus regional trade agreementsstrengths and weaknesses in the context of this discussion multilateral agreement would be negotiated within the framework of the world trade organization wto and involve all wto members currently 142 whereas regional trade agreements rtas would involve limited number of countries two or more5 rta requirements are spelled out in article xxiv of the updated general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt now part of the world trade organization wto or article v of gatts sister agreement which covers services the wtos general agreement on trade in services gats the essential requirement of articleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31072crs3 6 there is third type of trade agreement authorized under wto rules it is described in the gatts enabling clause and typically involves developed countries extending special favorable treatment to developi ng countries the general system of preferences gsp is an example while the developing countries are not asked to reciprocate by lowering their trade barriers qualifying requirements such as meeting internationally accepted core labor standards might be required the enabling clause may also be used between developing countries the united states participation in the gsp program is set to expire this september as result this issue will be before the 107th congress for details of the us program see gener alized system of preferences by william h cooper crs report 97 389 7 the exception to this occurs when customs union forms trade agreement with third party the european unionmexico free trade area which became effective july 1 2000 is an example 8the proposed usvietnam bilateral trade agreement is an example of trade agreement that does not qualify under either gatts article xxiv or gats article v it is not an fta or customs union it is authorized under gatts enabling clause with this agreeme nt the united states and vietnam would agree among other things to extend temporary most favored nation status mfn also know n as normal trade relations to each other mfn reduces tariffs to the current applicable wto levels in this respect the united states is extending to vietnam nonwto member the benefits of wto membership but tariffs between the united states and vietnam are not substantially eliminated as is required of regional trade agreements in gatts article xxiv for description of the vietnam us bilateral trade agreement and the procedures under which it is being considered in congress similar to tpa see the vietnamus bilateral trade agreement by mark manyin crs report rl30416xxiv and v is that rtas drop substantially all trade barriers between the negotiating partners6 there are two basic types of agreements that qualify for notification under these articles they are free trade areas fta and customs unions members of ftas eliminate trade barriers on substantially all trade among members but the members are free to maintain their existing trade policies against nonmembers however the articles require that the trade restrictions against nonmembers not become more restrictive members of customs unions must also substantially reduce barriers among members but they adopt common trade policy regarding nonmembers7 nafta is an example of an fta while the european union eu and mercosur argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay are customs unions the usjordan free trade agreement negotiated by the clinton administration that is pending before congress is also an fta as are the chile singapore and ftaa agreements currently being negotiated by the bush administration the us jordan agreem ent was negotiated without the benefit of tpa and thus far the chile singapore and ftaa agreements are also being negotiated without tpa8 trade creation both multilateral and regional trade agreements may improve the overall economic welfare of society through trade creation upon implementation of trade agreement productive activities begin to realign themselves around the most efficient pattern the new agreement allows for example if trade agreement lowers trade barriers on an item then production may shift from domestic producers to lower cost foreignhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31072crs4 9 see the world bank briefing paper entitled assessing globalization does more international trade openness increase world poverty httpwwwworldbankorghtmlextdrpbglobalization paper2htm 2000 also see the wto annual report 1998 world trade organization p 4246 one such study found that open economies grow 2 to 25 percentage points year faster than closed economies after controlling for other factors p 45 other similar studies found more modest impact 10 see bergsten c fred open regionalism in whither apec the progress to date and agenda for the future ed c fred bergsten special report 9 institute for international economics october 1997 pp 83105producers resulting in substituting the traded item for domestic production this is termed trade creation through this move domestic consumers benefit by being able to acquire the item at lower price or by wider choice or enhanced quality or combination of these at the same time domestic resources are freed for use in other endeavors that latter process often draws opposition from displaced workers and the owners of displaced resources balancing those issues in ways that enhance public welfare is an ongoing challenge to policymakers the full impact of trade creation may take an extended period of time to be realized because the increased trade that accompanies trade liberalization is correlated with income growth over time empirical estimates of the relationship predict that one percent increase in trade relative to gross domestic product ie trade divided by gdp results in national income growing an additional onehalf to 2 percent per year9 trade divers ion in addition to trade creation rtas have potential drawback because rtas are not fully inclusive they may result in trade diversion trade diversion is best described by an example if prior to formation of nafta the united states purchased product from china but subsequently shifted purchases to mexico solely as the resul t of nafta even though china remained the lowercost producer then the regional trade agreement would be responsible for trade diversion in this case the united states shifted prod uct sources not because mexico improved its ability to produce or china lost some of its ability but instead because the united states began giving mexico preferential treatment over china over time the growth factors involved in trade creation may help to offset the adverse impacts of trade diversion additionally the prospect for trade diversion declines as the size of an rta grows and as the trade barriers applied against nonmembers decline extreme situations illustrate these points first if an rta grows to encompass all countries then country is excluded hence there is chance of diverting trade secon d if trade barriers against nonmembers are eliminated then being an rta member may be little different from being nonmember additionally most proponents of rtas argue that the gains from trade creation are very likely to exceed the costs of trade diversion10 hence proponents conclude rtas should be undertaken based on simple benefitcost analysis however recent imf staff paper compared the impact on the growth of nations that either entered into rtas or liberalized trade in nondiscriminatory manner eg within the gattwto frameworkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31072crs5 11 see vamvakidis athanasios regional trade agreements or broad liberalization which path leads to faster growth imf staff papers vol 46 1 march 1999 pp 4268 12 see question of preference the economist august 20 1998 pp 12 httpwwweconomistcom p 2 this aspect can be seen in the debate regarding eu expansion some member countries are not anxious for new members to join the eu some analysts also believe mexico is less than enthusiastic regarding formation of ftaa because of its special relationship with the united states and canada 13 typically the entire product does not have to origina from within the rta for example 50 percent rta content is typical requi rement rules of origin and all the complexities and costs of their implementation are necessary for free trade agreements but customs unions with their common external tariff can avoid this problem of reciprocal trade liberalization or unilaterally between 1960 and 1980 broad nondiscriminatory trade liberalization was found to enhance growth in both the short and longterm on the other hand according to the study participation in rtas resulted in slowed growth11 the author was not able to determine if the poor results for regional trade agreement formation was due to trade diversion and the results do not directly apply to many of the type of agreements that are being considered today because the rtas the imf study consider ed did not include mixture of developed and developing countries nonetheless the issue remain s open until stronger evidence one way or the other can be presented beyond trade diversion numerous economists believe developing countries are illequipped to navigate the maze of rules that accompany many rtas putting these nations at disadvantage that may perpetuate poverty other concerns regarding rtas center on the treatment of nonmembers of course trade diversion is one concern but there is potential that the problem will go beyond trade diversion as an rta becomes larger membership becomes more desirable to gain competitive edge firms in non member countries lobby their governments to seek membership however at the same time competing firms already in the rta may have an incentive to lobby their governments to bar new mem bers in order to keep competition out this raises the concern that regional trade agreements may be prone to capture by protectionist lobbying12 furthermor many contend that the countries that are easiest to keep out are those with high percentage of poor residents thereby slowing their chances of escaping poverty also rtas tend to raise regulatory requirements that may otherwise be unnecessary rules of origin serve as an example to prevent an item produced by firm located in nonmember country from receiving the preference accorded to products produced within the rta system of determining product origin may need to be formulated in nafta for example if product is imported into mexico and then transshipped to the united states it would not be eligible for preferential tariff treatment as it crossed into the united states but without system to track its origin this would not be known13 propon ents of regional trade agreements generally concede that multilateral trade agreement is superior to comparable rta because of the concerns raised abovehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31072crs6 14 for example see hudgins edward l regional and multilateral trade agreements complementary means to open markets the cato journal vol 15 23 fallwinter 199596 wwwcatoorg he further suggests that enhancing economic liberty should be priority in judging rtas 15 see in the next round by pascal lamy and robert b zoellick washington post july continuedhence their line of argument tends to follow two tracks first they argue that rtas should be pursued because the benefits exceed the costs since rtas can go beyond what is feasible with multilateral agreement andor rtas will make multilateral agreements more feasible in the future second proponents provide set of characteristics which will allow an rta to avoid some of its inherent pitfalls to overcome the problems inherent with rtas proponents typically recommend they have certain charact eristics these include leaving the door open for new members this reduces the chance of trade diversion with open rta membership if nation falls victim to trade diversion it can avoid this problem by joining provided of course that the rtas open door commitment does not meet internal road blocks many economic researchers also suggest that steps need to be taken to avoid buildi ng an inefficient regulatory environment into an rta agreement the common agricul tural policy cap of the european union is oftentimes cited as an example of regulatory failure the cap protects european farmers through system of policy measures that requires significant percentage of the eu budget to administer some rta proponents believe the regulatory environment is the most important aspect that rta framers should keep in mind according to that view the regulatory environment sets the stage and ultimately determines the success or failure of an agreement additionally some proponents of regional trade agreements suggest that they contribute to enhancing economic liberty14 another argument in favor of regional trade agreements is that they can go further in reducing nontariff barriers than wtonegotiated multilateral agreements this is the case because the limite d membership focuses attention on the discriminatory actions of fellow members politically rtas are also seen as way to prod countries to liberalize trade in multilateral setting proponents see two avenues to reach multilateral trade liberalization the first is direct route via the world trade organization the second an indirect route is via expansion of the influence of rtas the rta route is sometimes viewed as way to pressure reluctant participants to join in multilateral trade talks in particular developing countries via the implied threat of being left out of rta agreements may be influenced to view multilateral trade agreements in more favorable light pascal lamy eu commissioner for trade and us trade representative robert zoellick in jointly written washington post editorial explained this view by stating developing countries cannot expect to fare as well as the united states and the eu in system of unbridled bilateralism they would do much better under multilateral trade round15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31072crs7 15continued 17 2001 page a17 16see new regional trading arrangements in the asia pacific by robert scollay and john p gilbert institute for inter national economics policy analyses in international economics number 63 may 2001 welfare was measured as percent of gross domestic product for each of the countries involved with regards to the impact of rta formation on the united states empirical studies potentially suffer several modeling shortcomings that may make estimates of the gains experienced by the united states lower bounds that is to say the actual levels are likely to be equal to or greater than the estimates first adequate incorporation of the services sector in trade models is difficult for example the authors of the iie study point out that their study was unable to satisfactorily model services trade liberalization as result the modest welfare gains found for the united states are likely to be augmented by gains in the service sector given the growing importance of the service sector to us trade these gains may be substantial 17figure 1 also shows that us market share grew fastest prior to nafta formation from just over 65 percent in 1987 to about 71 percent in 1993 this growth is likely result of mexicos unilateral reduction in trade barriers mexicos maquiladora program is an example under this program mexico provided tariff preference to imported parts which were either further manufactured or assembled and then exported under the maquiladora program the mexican government did not place tariffs on imported parts and the united continuedthe united states and rtas typically empirical studies of us participation in rtas find only modest immediate or up front economic gains for the unite d states from trade in goods at the same time the gains for our agreement partners are typically found to be considerably larger for example an institute of international economics iie study estimated the static welfare impact of formation of the proposed ftaa to be over four times greater for mexico and argentina than the gain estimated for the united states and for brazil the gain was estimated to be two and half times greater than for the united states16 the united states dominance as trading power going into the agreement is probably responsible for this result the impa ct of nafta on usmexico trade to date illustrates the modest impact on the united states resulting from rta formation between the 1994 beginning of nafta and 2000 us exports to mex ico increased almost 124 percent however at the same time mexican imports from nonus sources increased almost 109 percent and the lower growth from nonus trade sources can be attributed to the first years of nafta when mexico had an economic crisis figure 1 presents the us share of mexican imports from 1985 through 2000 from 1994 until 1996 the share grew from just under 72 percent to just over 75 percent but from 1996 onward the us share steadily fell to about 73 percent in 2000 that is to say since the inception of nafta the united states share of the mexican market has grown only about 1 percent and this growth resulted because of rapid us market share growth during mexicos economic crisis this suggests that much of the increased exports the united states experienced may be the result of increased international economic activity by mexico and not nafta17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31072crs8 17continued states via our harmonized tariff schedule levied tariffs only on the value added in mexico for usmexican trade nafta provisions have replaced this program for information on the maquiladora program see maquiladoras and nafta the economics of us mexico production sharin g and trade by jf hornbeck crs report 9866 january 27 1998 result of the maquiladora program was an increase in the withinindustry trade betwee n the united states and mexico between 1990 and 1994 measure of the within industry trade between the two countries almost doubled figure 1 us share of mexican imports on the other hand looking beyond the shortterm trade impacts of rtas some analysts believe that the closer trade ties that result from participation in trade agreements particularly rtas will provide spirit of cooperation among members that may foster closer bilateral ties and cooperation on range of issues it is also felt that us participation in trade negotiations will enhance us ability to set or influence the international trade agenda the immediate gains discussed above do not allow for adjustments in the underlying economic structures that are likely to be encouraged by formation of an rta models that have attempted to incor porate these dyanmic aspects of trade by allowing for capital investment and changes in productivity tend to predict larger ongoing gains than estimates from static models one consequence of rta formation is reducing the impact of members borders for example the tarifffree access that nafta affords its members reduces the economic impact of the borders that separate mexico the united states and canada part of this impact is captured in the upfron t gains but an extended amount of time may be required to take full advantage of the reduced trade barriers the ultimate impact an rta could be expec ted to have is complete elimination of the borders economic impact while it ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31072crs9 18for discussion see the future course of trade liberalization by gary c hufbauer institute for international economics 1998 studies of uscanadian trade patterns suggest that if all economic border impacts were eliminated trade between the two countries could hypothetically increase by factor of about 18 of course this is an upper bound of the potential trade impact between canada and the united states resulting from nafta formation and analysts do not predict this extreme will be realized 19appendix table a1 lists the trade agreements that are still in force and have been notified to the wto under gatt article xxiv andor gats article v one hundred and thirty three agreements are listed in general sense some of the agreements are duplicated in that they are listed as both gatt and gats agreements nafta is an example appendix table a2 lists additional trade agreements that are not on the wto list it is unlikely that these lists are exhaustiveunlikely that any rta will achieve this ultimate level of economic integration one would expect rta formation to move in this direction however the change may take decades to reach its full potential one reason for this is that infrastructure systems have to adjust from the prerta to postrta environment for example prior to nafta and its forerunner the canadaus free trade agreement much of canadas distribution system eg roads distribution centers and communication systems was geared toward east west trade within cana da as time passes and infrastructure changes are made it is reasonable to expect that the impact of uscanadian trade resulting from nafta will increase18 is the united states being left behind recently concern has been expressed that the united states is being left behind because of the proliferation of rtas that do not include the united states some have argued that united states nonparticipation in trade agreements places us exporters at competitive disadvantage these proponents point out that there are over 130 regional trade agreements in force around the world today and the united states is party to only twothe usisrael free trade agreement and the north american free trade agreement nafta they further point out that there has been recent flurry of regional trade agreement formation since 1990 more than 100 agreements have entered into force nafta falls into this group having entered into force in 1994 but the israel agreement dates to 198519 others point out that many of these agreements involve small perhaps inconsequential amounts of trade and therefore their numbers alone do not measure their impact economic analyses generally find that the aggregate lost us welfare that results from the formation of rtas not involving the united states is very small in many individual cases the welfare change is estimated to be lower than one hundredth of one percent of gdp nonetheless in selected instances the cost to individual us firms from the discrimination that results when the united states is excluded from trade agreements can be significant the nature of an rta is that firms from nonmember countries face tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31072crs10 20for further information see jeffrey j schotts testimony before the subcommittee on trade of the

measure of total intraeu tradebarriers that member firms do not the end result may be reduced or eliminated sales for individual us firms in countries with an rta to which the united states is not party20 rta activity by our major trading partners is of concern to analysts in particular the trade agreement activities of the european union eu and mexico and to lesser extent canada have received scrutiny the eu has reported 30 rtas to the wto most of them since 1990 mexico 4 with many more not reported and canada 3 additionally in continuing push to negotiate rtas these trading partners are reaching out to other countries the eu for example is negotiating trade agreement with mercosur although the pace of negotiation is quite slow and mexico and japan have explored the possibility of beginning talks aiming at bilateral agreement to give some sense of the size of agreements involving the european union trade flows for 1999 are presented in table 1 the total intraeu exports are also provided21 it can be argued that consideration of intraeu trade is appropriate if the concern is that the united states is being left behind by the accelerating trend toward rta formation the eu is an rta with an agenda of expansion while many eu agreements cover relatively small amounts of trade several encompass multibillions of dollars worth of trade and intraeu trade exports is approximately 14 trillion total trade between countries with which the eu has rtas including intraeu trade was over three times us trade with its rta partners ie within nafta and the usisrael free trade agreement these numbers tend to support the argument some analysts make that the eus growing partic ipation in rtas is allowing it to gain more control over the international trade

after us approval the eu has also exerted its influence over another portion of the international trade agendacompetition policy because mexico is mem ber of nafta its rta activity raises another potentially serious concernthe hubandspoke trading bloc in new york times editorial economist robert m dunn jr describes mexico as our biggest trading problem he states it has aggressively pursued agreements with three big marketsnorth america the european union and latin america through individual agreements with many countries including chile colombia venezuela bolivia costa rica uruguay and nicaragua these agreements have allowed mexico to construct unique hubandspoke trading bloc with itself as the hub and its partners as spokes22 the rtas mexico has signed give it preferential access to numerous markets that do not have the same level of access with each other for example most mexican products have tarifffree access to the us market and they will have similar access to the eu market as the eumexico fta is phased in but us products do not have tarifffree access to the eu market and likewise eu products do not have tarifffree access to the us market this creates an incentive to locate production facilities in mexico in order to take advantage of mexicos special position as trading hub in addition to this incentive to divert investment to mexico the hubandspoke phenomenon creates an even more direct problem for us producers according to dunn when us firms try to ship products to mexico they face added competition from the eu and latin american countries that have the same tarifffree access to the mexican market accorded us firms to lesser extent canada is creating the same problem with its fta with chile conclusion economists generally believe that multilateral trade agreements yield net contribution to social welfare but experience has shown that multilateral trade negotiation within the context of the world trade organization is difficult as result many countries have turned to regional trade agreements because rtas involve fewer countries presumably with similar interests completing an agreement seems more plausible multilateral and regional trade agreements may have one aspect in common they may increase societys overall welfare via trade creation with trade creation domestic production is replaced by lower cost foreign production this frees up domestic resources to be utilized for other activities economically the end result is more cost effective utilization of resources and consumers reap the benefits via reduced prices wider choice increased quality or combination of all these httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31072crs13 however regional trade agreements differ from their multilateral counterparts the differences hinge on the fact that some nations by definition are excluded from rtas hence rta members may conclude that they gain by the arrangement but nonmembers may not fare as well the end result may be that while rtas may introduce trade creation they may also cause trade diversion in this case production is switched from nonrta member to member not because of change in ability by the member or nonmember to produce the item but because of the preference accorded members over nonmembers because of the possibility of welfare reducing trade diversion many analysts recommend that rtas have certain characteristics the possibility of trade diversion is reduced when an rta is large not as many nonmembers to discriminate against or the trade barriers against nonmembers are low lower level of discrimination as result proponents of rta formation oftentimes recommend that rtas remain open to new members this reduces the chance of trade diversion because if it exists the nonmembers facing significant discrimination will seek to join to avoid the economic pain of trade diversion of course openness of this sort is political decision and there is guarantee that it will occur rtas also differ from multilateral agreements in that they sometimes require intricate rules to differentiate member country products from nonmember country products these rules are necessary to determine if product is eligible for the preferential treatment an rta affords if the united states is not party to an rta then it not only faces these rules but it also has say in their formulation rta rules may also cover topics such as the application of antidumping and countervailing duties again if the united states is not party to the negotiations then the resulting rules may be inconsistent with current us policy this is particular concern resulting from the eus rta activity it is also concern in that it often runs counter to free trade principles governing organizations such as wto despite long list of potential costs for not participating in rtas the upfront economic benefits to the united states of participating appear to be quite small however the potential for longer term substantial benefits is present if rta formation encourages international crossborder activity to approach domestic activity ie reduce the economic importance of the international border then the increase in us international activity could exceed ten fold while this ambitious level may never be attained empirical estimates typically suggest that the impact of rta formation grows with time less than tangible potential benefit for the united states of rta formation is the possible increased economic stability of members and this benefit exists whether or not the united states is party to the agreements although it may be enhanced by us participation on the other hand rtas also have the potential for promoting friction by creating competitive trading blocs for example as mexico forms trade agreements with numerous of our largest trading partners the incentive exists for investment to shift from the united states to mexico where exported products have tarifffree access to growing number of markets

major competitors gain this same preference friction can be reduced by the united states joining the agreement but again there is guarantee with the complexity of assessing the benefits and costs of regional trade agreements the success of their implementation may hinge on the political determination of participating nations an article from the economist sums it up as follows so the succ ess of global efforts to liberalise trade depends mainly on whether governments wish to move in that direction not on whether they eschew regional deals or seek them23 hence rta formation requires commitment by policy makers to find ways to enhance the benefits of participation while at the same time seeking ways to avoid the pitfalls rta formation may introduce because of the potential problems associated with regional trade agreements many analysts believe they should be viewed as second best alternatives to multilateral agreements according to this view rta use should be restricted to situations where they accomplish more trade liberalization than is feasible with multilateral agreement and if used rtas should be formulated to minimize possible adverse effects in particular trade barriers facing nonmembers should be low and nonmembers should have the opportunity to join an existing rta to avoid the adverse impact of nonmembershiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31072crs15 appendix
