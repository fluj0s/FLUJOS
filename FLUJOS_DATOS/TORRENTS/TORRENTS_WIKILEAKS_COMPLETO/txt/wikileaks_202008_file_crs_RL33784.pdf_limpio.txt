has become part of the policy discussion about lleviating poverty among families supported by lowwage workers it is viewed by some as tool to encourage labor force participation among members of lowincome families by making work more financially rewarding others assert that raising the minimum wage is not the most effective way to assist wincome families with earners in part because many lowwage workers do not live in lowincome families accordingly this report analyzes not only the individua l characteristics of workers by their hourly wage rate but also the characteristics of the families in which they live the report does not address the arguments of proponents or opponents about th advisability of raising the minimum wage compared to the typical worker paid an hourly wage employees who earned below 725 per hour in 2005 were more likel to have been women of hispanic origin young ie ages 16 to 24 or ol d ie age 65 and above lacking high school diploma in service and sales ccupations eg waitr esses and cashiers respectively working part time ie less than 35 hours week and not represented by labor union larger proportion of working women than men young workers than primeage workers ie 25 to 54 years old and parttimers than fulltimers for example may gain from 210anhour increase in the federal minimum wage the families of hourly workers paid ss than 725 an hour in 2005 more often were poor receiving welfare and lacking health insurance coverage from any source individuals who earned less than 725 an hour were more likely than higherpaid persons to be secondary earners in their families but substan tial share of lowwage workers were the sole earners in their families some 29 of hourly workers who earned under 725 an hour in 2005 lived in families with income s of 20000 or less another 26 lived in families with incomes from 20001 to 40000 about one fourth of these lowwage workers were spouses in marriedcouple families with or without children and some 13 were single parents another 12 were teenagers ie 16 to 19 years old at the other end of the spectrum 13 of hourly workers paid below 725 an hour lived in families with nnual incomes of more than 100000 in contrast to the pattern among lowincome families over onehalf of the lowwage workers in these highincome families were teenagers 56 this report may be updated if issues

raised the ba sic federal minimum wage in steps from 515 to 725 an hour1 the minimum wage was increased to 585 in july 20072 it will rise to 655 in july 2008 and to 725 in july 2009 several states

argue that raising the minimum wage is an effective way to alleviate poverty among families supported by lowwa ge workers higher minimum wage may raise their incomes and it may encourage greater labor force participation among members of lowincome families others assert that raising the minimum wage is not an effective way to aid lowincome fa milies because many lowwage workers do not live in

federal minimum wageminimum wage in the two territories is equal to the minimum wage on the us mainland hr 2206 also directed the u s department of labor through the bureau of labor statistics to conduct study of the impact of the increase in the minimum wage and to project the impact on living standards and employment of further increases in the minimum wage in cnmi and american samoa the department of labor must re port the findings of the study later than eight months after the date of enactment of hr 2206 ie january 2008 word about the data this report examines the wages of worker s paid by the hour the data are from the current population survey cps whic h is household survey conducted by the census bureau for the bureau of labor st atistics bls although most workers are covered by the minimum wage requirement s of the flsa the cps does not ask workers if they are covered by the act the congressional research service crs used data from the monthly cps for 2005 and the 2006 annual social and economic asec supplement to the cps to analyze the wages and family incomes of hour ly workers that is employees paid an hourly wage rather than weekly or annua l salary or rate based on the quantity of goods or services produced ie piece rate6 the analysis does not include self employed persons as provided in the flsa the hourly wa ge shown in the tables that follow consists of cash payments only ie the va lue of employmentbased benefits are not included fuller explanation of the da ta and methodology used in this report appears in the appendix in this report hourly workers who ear ned less than 725 an hour in 2005 are sometimes referred to as lowwage workers the phrase is used for the sake of brevity in the private sector in 2005 the average wage of nonmanagement employees was 1611 an hour according to bls survey of employers glimpse of what follows compared to the typical worker paid an hourly wage employees who earned below 725 per hour in 2005 were more likely to have been women of hispanic origin young ie age 1624 or old ie age 65 and above lacking high school degree in service and sales occupations working parttime ie less than 35 hours week and not represented by labor unionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33784crs4 the families of these lowwage workers were more likely than other families in 2005 to have been poor receiving welfare and lacking health insurance coverage from any source individuals who earned less than 725 an hour were more likely than higher paid persons to be secondary earners in their families but substan tial share of lowwage workers were the sole earners in their families whereas lowwage workers in higher income families very often were teenagers lowwage workers in lower income families often were spouses in married couple families with or without children or single parents social economic and demographic characteristics of lowwage workers this section of the report examines selected demographic and labor market characteristics of lowwage workers gender women were overrepresented among lowwage workers in 2005 almost 7 million of the more than 11 million hourly workers who earned under 725 an hour were women 601 in cont rast women accounted for smaller share of all hourly workers 502 see the top and middle panels of table 1 it also appears that relatively more working women than men might gain from higher federal minimum wage as shown in the bottom panel of th table 181 of all female hourly workers earned below 725 per hour in 2005 co mpared to only 121 of men race and hispanic origin minorities particularly hispanics comprised larger shares of workers paid below 725 an hour than they did of all hourly workers in 2005 as can be seen in the middle panel of table 2 hispanics who may be of any race and black non hispanics might benefit more than white nonhispanics from boost in the federal minimum wage almost 25 million out of 125 million hispanics employed on an hourly basis or almost one in five earned less than 725 an hour in 2005 although relatively fewer black nonhispan ics 169 were paid less than the proposed minimum wage level an even smaller proportion of white nonhispanics 137 might have seen their pay increas if the federal minimum wage had been 210 per hour higher in 2005 see the bottom panel of table 2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33784crs5 table 1

because firms reward workers based in part on their skill levels educational attainment usually is positively related to earnings level ie lower wages are associated with less schooling it thus is not surprising that many workers paid below 725 per hour have fairly limited formal educa tion see the middle panel of table 5 almost 7 of every 10 lowwage workers in 2005 either lacked high school diploma or had completed only high school in fact th least educated group was overrepresented in the lowwage workforce while employ ees who did not attend or complete high school comprised fully 381

tables are available from the authors upon request 9 the 302 amount is commonly called tip credit some states allow smaller tip credit others do not allow credit for more information on the tip credit see crs report rl33348 the tip credit provisions of the fair labor standards act by william g whittakerit could be argued that these findings partly reflect the previously discussed overrepresentation of youth among lowwage workers because some of these youngsters probably are still attending school they might only briefly be members of the lowskilled lowwage labor force as shown in the bottom panel of table 5 344 of hourly workers ages 16 and older who lacked high school diploma as of 2005 earned under 725 an hour if instead hourly workers ages 25 and older are examined not shown in table 5 thereby limiting the sample to persons more likely to have completed their schooling the proportion of workers without high school diploma earning below 725 an hour drops to 2168 in other words perhaps one of every five permanently lowskilled dults paid on an hourly basis might gain from the proposed 210 rise in the federal minimum wage occupation most hourly workers employed in jobs that paid less than 725 an hour in 2005 were clustered in two ccupational groups as show n in the middle panel of table 6 the single largest concentration 462 were employed in service occupations eg food preparation building cleaning health care support personal care and protective support another 192 of low wage workers were employed in sales and related occupations eg retail and pers onal services sales workers both these figures were much larger than the ccupational groups presence among all hourly paid workers 222 and 101 respectiv ely although total employment was relatively small an estima ted 623000 hourly workers th only other occupational group considerably overrepresented among lowwage hourly workers were farming fishing and forestry occupations 21 versus 08 for all hourly workers according to crs estimates not shown in table 6 one of every two hourly workers employed in food preparation nd service occupations was paid less than 725 an hour in 2005 half of these worker s may be tipped employees eg waiters waitresses hosts nd hostesses who under the flsa must be paid at least 213 an hour provided they receive at least 302 an hour in tips for total hourly pay of at least 5159 those tipped employees who currently earn less than 725 an hour in wages and tips would likely benefit directly from an increase in the basic minimum wage to 725 an hour tipped employees who currently receive more than 725 an hour in wages and tips may not benefit much aboveaverage share of hourly workers in sales occupations might benefit if the basic federa l minimum wage increased to 725 an hour for example based on crs estimates not shown in table 6 about two in five cashiers and similar share of counter and rental clerks might see their pay increase if the basic minimum wage is raised by 210 an hour an increase of this size also might affecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33784crs10 three in ten retail salespers ons doortodoor sales workers as well as news and street vendors and

they hold jobs similar to fulltime workers ie persons em ployed for 35 or more hours week are paid at lower rate as result part timers should have greater propensity for low wage employment as shown

increase in the federal minimum wage will not raise the incomes of low income families that have earners unless the higher wage standard entices members of these families to enter the labor force and obtain employment14 some argue however that higher minimum wage could harm lowwage workers and their families by causing job loss or reducing the rate of lowskilled job creation15 family income and

derived the data in this report fro m the current population survey cps census bureau survey of households the monthly cps is the source of the monthly national unemployment rate and of other labor market information the cps sample is representative of the ci vilian noninstitutional population ages 16 and older it does not include persons on activ duty in the armed forces or persons in institutions such as nursing homes or correctional facilities in march 2006 about 54000 households were interv iewed for the basic cps20 each month onefourth of the cps samp is asked questions about current earnings hourly wages are wages paid by the employer and do not include tips or fringe benefits21 hourly wages are wages before taxes and other deductions the data in tables 1 through 8 are averages for the twelve months of calendar year 2005 thus the number of hourly workers shown in tables 1 to 8 ie 756 million is monthly average for 2005 each year the annual social and economic asec supplement to the basic cps asks questions about individual and fa mily earnings and income for the previous year thus in the 2006 supplement the rvey collected info rmation on individual and family earnings and income for 2005 tables 9 through 15 provide family information for 2005 for hourly workers in the march 2006 basic survey in march 2006 there were an estimate d 738 million hourly workers limitations the cps has certain limitations for analyzing the impact of an increase in the federal minimum wage first the flsa includes number of exceptions and exemptions from the minimum wage the c ps does not ask respondents if they are covered by the flsa thus some peopl who are paid less than 725 an hour may not be covered by the flsa and may not receive an increase in their hourly wage when the federal minimum wage is raise d second the flsa allows for lower minimum wage rates for tipped employees certain new hires under the age of 20 fulltime students who work parttime handicapped persons and others higher basic minimum wage may not affect these workers22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33784crs21 22 continued population of households is surveyeda limitation of the methodology in this re port pertains to annual earnings and family income in 2005 of hourly work ers in march 2006 in march 2006 hourly workers may have been earning either mo re or less than they earned in 2005 some workers may not have had any earnings in 2005 eg they may have been new to the labor force in march 2006 as result the wages of hourly workers in march 2006 may not be the same as their hourly wage in 2005 similarly some workers who had earnings in 2005 may not have been employed or they were sala ried and not hourly workers in march 2006 therefore they ar not included in the analysis of annual earnings or family income for 2005 another limitation of the methodology is th at in the cps primary family may include what the cps calls related subfamily for example an unmarried mother with dependent child may be living with her parents or married couple may be living with relatives in the cps the income of persons in related subfamily is included in the total income of the primary family this could have tendency to understate the number of lowwage workers living in lowincome families ie because the incomes of rela ted subfamilies are included in the incomes of primary families on the other hand unmarried c ouples who are not living with relatives are treated either as separate individuals or if they have children as primary family and an unrelated individual this could have
