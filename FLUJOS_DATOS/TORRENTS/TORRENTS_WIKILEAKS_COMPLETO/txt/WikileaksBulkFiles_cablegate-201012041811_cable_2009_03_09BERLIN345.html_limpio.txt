the margins of the nato summit berlin 00000345 0012 of 002 classified by charge daffaires john m koenig for reasons 14 b and d 1 snf chancellor merkel will be focused on productive substantive meeting when you visit badenbaden april 3 germany holds the greatest untapped potential in europe for our transatlantic agenda unlocking it will take sustained effort by the administration and the payoff will not be immediate what is most on merkels mind is her political future six months before national elections with her poll numbers wobbling and her coalition increasingly dysfunctional germanys capacity to act is constrained by 1 the shortterm demands of domestic politics about which we can do little 2 the slow pace of change in public support for german leadership role focus of our engagement and 3 the constant demands of the economic crisis your meeting provides an opportunity to map out key priorities with germany for the remainder of merkels current term and beyond merkels own crisis leadership 2 snf merkel is methodical rational and pragmatic qualities that propelled her to stratospheric levels of public support early in her tenure when she presided over recovering economy and successful presidency of the european union the past year has been less kind and the almost exactly equal split in the german electorate between left and right is reemerging as elections approach merkel now faces gordian knot8 of rising unemployment economic crisis and domestic political dissatisfaction at time when she can least afford wrong move the effectiveness of merkels grand coalition8 government is declining as her christian democrats cdu and their social democratic spd partners begin in earnest their campaigns for the september 2009 election the chancellors edge over the rival spd led by foreign minister frankwalter steinmeier is diminishing when cornered merkel can be tenacious but is risk averse and rarely creative this suggests she will remain very circumspect ally until the election 3 cnf the collapse of german exports and industrial activity has shocked chancellor merkel and her advisors they had thought germany would escape the worst of the world recession thanks to its competitive position in emerging markets in the new year merkel and finance minister peer steinbrueck spd rushed relatively robust stimulus program through the bundestag that is timed to counter surge in unemployment just before the september elections like most germans they doubt further deficit spending will generate lasting growth and fear too large stimulus may cause stagflation at home and dangerous new global imbalances merkel and steinbrueck remain bitter at the brushoff they allegedly received during the last administration when they advocated tighter financial oversight tougher regulations they insist are essential to restore confidence in the banking system and get credit flowing again thus creating the preconditions for sustainable recovery 4 cnf hoping to escape responsibility for the economic crisis merkel has issued public critiques of us recovery policy that exaggerate the differences between washington and continental europe in fact germany faces many of the same difficult choices as the us the chancellor is expected to put forward further stimulus package later this year her government has bailed out big banks while holding firm on state aid to ailing firms like opel the conventional wisdom in germany is that opel could be rescued with minimum state aid if only it could be separated from gm but in fact there is viable business plan for the firm to stand on its own the chancellor is surrounded by bad options an interventionist approach would further alienate economic conservatives in her cdu who are already defecting in droves to the freemarket fdp if she does nothing steinmeier and the spd will harvest the goodwill of centrist voters for trying to save opel merkel has not been above shifting responsibility to the usg and general motors which she and berlin 00000345 0022 of 002 the german media unfairly blame for bleeding opel dry in the end merkels government will likely be forced to prop up at least parts of the automaker increasing political caution during campaign 5 snf merkel and steinmeier are pragmatists on foreign policy in particular there is more that unites them than divides them but the centrifugal forces of the election campaign and the growing mistrust between the cdu and spd make it increasingly difficult for them to agree on any big ideas about germanys role in the world or its relations with the united states buffeted by events merkel is struggling to define convincing vision for her8 germany competence8 is the sole component at this point she is blessed that steinmeier her principal competitor faces even greater difficulties his party has lost its bearings in the grand coalition and is plagued by internal divisions steinmeier himself is technocrat and latecomer to electoral politics his shortcomings on stage are significant steinmeier has tried to make up ground on merkel by publicly identifying himself with the new us administration however his ability to deliver on policy initiatives without the chancellors political support is limited 6 cnf afghanistan is an example merkel has been cautious throughout her chancellorship and has doggedly resisted real or perceived pressure for germany to take on larger military role she and steinmeier both have supported the comprehensive approach but the chancellors cdu in the face of public skepticism is reluctant even to consider increasing police or civilian support steinmeier and the spd have been more forwardleaning but they cannot deliver on their own you should emphasize that at the moment the us is not seeking significant additional military forces from germany but that every member of the international community will need to do much more eg training security forces and providing civilian assistance if we are to be successful policy opportunities on russia and iran 7 cnf germany should play central role with the us in defining coordinated western russia policy that resets the relationship without retreating from our values the winter gas crisis made germans rethink russias reliability as supplier but the lack of alternatives and the desirability of gas as clean energy source have left the government resigned to dependency on russia in the neartomedium term on energy as well as georgia neither merkel nor steinmeier has identified areas where german policy steps could help create more persuasive set of incentives for russia to integrate further into rulesbased relationships and institutions meanwhile germany is concerned about threats to economic and social stability in central and eastern europe but prefers eu and imf approaches to limit its share of the bill 8 cnf both merkel and steinmeier welcomed your nowruz address to the iranian people and government they support the us investment in the diplomatic track and agree that germany and the eu need to invest in the economic pressure track germanys close ties to israel include an imperative to defend israels right to exist and to play an active role in international nonproliferation efforts toward iran merkel will be looking to the meeting to gain better understanding of how you see the usg iran policy unfolding and what role we need germany to play 9 u mr president mission germany is honored to support you on your first overseas trip as president and we look forward to welcoming you in badenbaden koenig
