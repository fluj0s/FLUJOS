4 volkskas international in 1976 bernard glazer acquired control of ukregistered company ashbourne investments ltd the acquisition of ashbourne became the subject of uk department of trade investigation that produced sevenvolume report in 1975 the investigation arose as result of technical difficulties with the bid process the takeover of ashbourne investments by bernard glazer attracted much attention from british and south african authorities such as the bank of england dr stals south african reserve bank lord shawcross london takeover panel morgan guaranty trust company ny and carel wet sa ambassador in london after much ado as will be dealt with below glazer acquired control of ashbourne investments and incentive investments became the ultimate holding company the 1982 financials were filed with companies house london two years after the fact on 13 december 1984 the 1983 financials are treated in similar manner and filed on 28 december 1984 during this time it would appear that most of the subsidiaries were being dissolved or disposed of it is also intimated that there was legal claim for damages against former md of chelton inter alia on the basis of misrepresentation made at the time of the sale this issue was settled in december 1988 with settlement amount of 1633500 part of which was satisfied by way of share issue it is not clear what the share issue entailed another interesting book entry appears on the 26 june 1987 when subsidiary made donations to charities under deeds of covenants amounting to 737000 feinstein states it is correct that amarena holdings inc held 75 ordinary shares in incentive investments limited the holding of shares by chase manhattan nominees ltd who held 75 shares making them 50 shareholder of incentive appears to be completely irrelevant incentive was regarded as an unprofitable investment and was disposed of in or about april 1988 to joanna holdings limited and nina bonita sa two companies nominated by the other holders of shares in incentive bearing in mind that the only other holders of shares were chase nominees sam glazer collaborates this in his response which states was beneficially sold by the administrators in or about 1987 to group of investors which included the other shareholders on incentive investments in response to the administrators statements we can only follow the annual returns as submitted to companies house uk which tells different tale julius feinstein and sam glazer did in fact resign as directors on 11 june 1987 j margulies and i pels are appointed as directors on 26 june 1987 and neither holds beneficial interest in the share capital of the company naturally the 1988 financials are missing from the companies house records mr margulies is feeling very charitable and sets up the margulies charitable foundation ltd with various charitable donation made from 1987 onwards the annual return for 1993 states that amarena holdings inc and catton securities swiss bank corp each hold 75 shares on the 10 april 1995 bear in mind that 7 years has elapsed since the administrators sold the shareholding of incentive and 7 months before the first tranche of the trust is paid to the beneficiaries amerana holdings inc transfers the 75 shares to duncan nominees ltd of 1 hobart place london duncan lawrie is small private bank situated at the same address on 1 may 1997 2 weeks prior to an agreement signed between michele and the administrators to oust her from the will swiss bank corp transfer their 75 shares to barclays nominees grove ltd and finally the 150 shares are consolidated on 15 july 1998 and are all held by duncan nominees it is most interesting to note that incentive investments together with all its subsidiary companies have been put into voluntary liquidation in march 2004 the company ashbourne investments ltd was holding company listed on the london stock exchange lse with subsidiaries in the financial industrial and property sectors at the end of april 1973 its shares were valued at 48p each making market capitalisation of about 4 25 million it was mediumsized company with strategically valuable assets first among these was schwab co ltd which ashbourne held through subsidiary coptic finance ltd in 1971 the issued share capital of the bank was 350 000 it was increased to 1 million following an issue by ashbourne of loan stock in 1972 according to the investigation report it had built up sound reputation in the city and good contacts abroad it could make loans it could deal in securities and it held certain permissions to hold currency balances with foreign banks according to the investigation report schwabs business consisted principally of the provision of mortgage and other finance for clients and for ashbourne the underwriting of new issues and advising and acting for clients and ashbourne in takeover bids schwab also invested on its own behalf and on behalf of investment clients and ashbourne in quoted and unquoted companies it had modest deposittaking and lending business schwab also acted as banker for ashbourne it made profit of 211 000 in 1973 the intermediate holding company was coptic finance ltd which had an unusually long list of subsidiaries about which nothing was ever discussed in the financial statements the possibility of bank accounts being held in the names of these companies and used for channelling money needs to be investigated ashbournes industrial holdings included number of subsidiaries which made bathroom and kitchen equipment and fittings john boulding sons surgical supplies and equipment printed circuit boards rivlin group antenna systems chelton group and static discharge devices for civil and military aircraft it seems likely that it held number of patents if the holdings so far look strangely diversified then one company held by ashbourne looks distinctly odd the argentine southern land co ltd asl was quoted english company that together with its whollyowned subsidiary the patagonian sheep farming co 1908 ltd owned vast tracts of land in the argentine and had considerable cash resources in england it traded in the argentine as sheep and cattle breeders and producers of wool and livestock the anglo welsh investment trust continuation was another investment whereby ashbourne held 31 interest the company also held an 11 interest in control securities limited the acquisition of ashbourne was fronted by two young accountants lionel casper and brian simmons who formed company called lc securities properties ltd in 1969 to carry on business as merger and investment advisers one of their clients was bernard glazer who by 1973 had placed 150 000 with lc by 1970 glazer would have earned r16 million from the sale of the properties held by acp investments ltd to urban investments ltd in 1972 he sold land to the botswana government for the development of francistown the investigation report made the nature of their relationship quite clear mr casper usually consulted mr glazer before he carried out transactions on mr glazers behalf but occasionally he acted at his own discretion the investigation report reveals the following based on caspers testimony apart from his 150 000 portfolio in london mr glazer had about 15 million that he wished to invest permanently in the united kingdom he had asked mr casper to find suitable investment for these funds in the form of public company preferably in real estate with good capital growth potential which he could purchase outright and over which he would have complete control in december 1972 casper changed the name of his company to london cavendish securities ltd with the intention of launching it as merchant bank as part of this strategy hed acquired 30 of the shares of quoted investment company called crest international securities ltd through purchases made by lc certain of its investment clients and associates and himself and mr simmons it seems likely that the bulk of the funds for this acquisition came from glazer crest international securities was until 1970 called the siberian syndicate ltd which had mining interests in russia and elsewhere including shares in consolidated gold fields records are missing from the files for the years 19591969 but it appears to have been held 63 by standard bank nominees transvaal ltd and the board was controlled by the lubners of south africa pgsi until this takeover after which casper ended up at the tender age of 31 as chairman and managing director of crest caspers plan as told to the investigation team was to use crest as stock exchange vehicle for acquisitions and takeovers however there was clearly much bigger agenda in the background this company is dealt with in separate chapter casper used share and loan stock issues in crest to acquire properties and quoted investments until by september 1973 crests market capitalisation was about 14 million its investments at that stage included the whole of the share capital of company called london foreign investment trust ltd an investment trust with net asset value of about 735 000 and 50 interest in property development in amsterdam ladbrokes held the other 50 despite his success with crest casper had luck in his attempt to turn london cavendish into bank he was unable to attract sufficient deposits capital or reserves to get the allimportant certificate of recognition that he needed he offered this as the reason why he decided to acquire large enough shareholding say 20 in ashbourne which had schwab as subsidiary to get onto the board by september 1973 crest held 113 of ashbournes issued share capital but didnt have the resources to go further at this point he and his partner simmons teamed up with two chartered accountants stephen barry and stephen ross who managed small investment fund of around 15 million under the banner of corporate guarantee trust ltd corporate acquired 97 of ashbournes equity it accomplished this by means of secured loans through two separate stockbrokers and some spare cash crest and corporate jointly held 21 of ashbournes issued share capital however they couldnt get themselves nominated on the board so to go with caspers version of events he approached glazer to get involved its quite possible however that the pressure was being exerted in the other direction the report puts it like this although mr caspers proposal did not give mr glazer the measure of control which he had previously stipulated he showed immediate interest in it in the first week of november glazer made available 350 000 at the overseas branch of midland bank ltd for the purchase of ashbourne shares casper visited glazer in johannesburg where glazer committed to purchasing 28 of ashbourne but got casper to sign written heads of agreement that casper and his colleagues in england would for period of ten years bind themselves to exercise their respective votes in the manner directed by him mr glazer in this way they would jointly control about 52 of the company at price of about 55p per share required in terms of the city code because of the price that corporate had recently paid to acquire its blocks of shares glazer was in for 1 354 000 on the same day that casper signed the agreement with glazer simmons and barry took their news to the ashbourne board and stated that as required by the city code theyd also be making bid for the remainder of the company at the same price however on 12 november 1973 the uk stock market went into freefall and the consortium found it impossible to secure the 35 million needed to take up the remaining 48 of shares that they were obliged to make an offer for glazer had increased his deposit of funds with midland bank from 350 000 to 1 million during that same day representing his commitment to the deal casper turned to mentor of his william george stern who owned wilstar securities ltd which held industrial and property portfolio worth some 163 million stern was also involved with the crown agents and whole chapter is devoted to him in the report of the justice fay commission into the activities of the crown agents leading up to their collapse in 1974 despite the state of the market and the onerous burden it placed on stern he offered to underwrite the outstanding amount his involvement at this stage suggests that there may have been other background forces at work the consortiums failure to make good the bid for ashbourne due to the collapse in the market was the subject of the department of trade investigation and an orderly selling off of the assets of crest international securities followed see chapter on crest while glazer bought ashbourne through another vehicle topview and its subsidiary incentive investments in fact its possible that glazer bought all or most of the subsidiaries of crest through the back door using nominee shareholders or front companies if this was so however these assets were not declared in his estate case in point is the sale in 1975 of ashbournes 24 interest in argentine southern land co asl to great western societe anonyme luxembourg company with invisible shareholders this needs to be investigated casper sold crests 122 shareholding in ashbourne to topview company ostensibly owned by french property developer leon faust for about 138 000 this represented share price of less than 13p share corporate went into voluntary liquidation and sold its 97 share in ashbourne to topview for 150 000 which represented about 175p share by the end of 1975 following other purchases of ashbourne shares topview held 236 glazer still held 221 of ashbourne directly the takeover panel had ruled that he was restricted from selling these in terms of the failed takeover bid so he used 100 shelf company called incentive investments to take over his share incentive made its bid for ashbourne through county bank ltd and on 23 june 1976 the offer went unconditional with 8097 acceptances in respect of the shares and good portion of the loan stock by the end of 1977 incentive had acquired all the outstanding shares and obtained complete control of ashbourne faust topview and glazer held the entire beneficial interest in incentive with glazer holding 75 of the 100 shares and topview the rest these shares only carried one vote each the heavyweight directors that hed brought on board held 10 b shares between them each of which carried 11 votes but rights to dividends nor participation in liquidation these holders of the b shares had the look and feel of londons team lord mancroft norman henry castle lord fisher of camden and ephraim solomon margulies lord mancroft had been lordinwaiting to the queen from 1952 to 1954 parliamentary secretary for the ministry of defence minister without portfolio during 195758 and chairman of clutch of gamblingrelated boards including horseracing and greyhound racing it should be remembered that glazer was in 5050 partnership with british gaming company ladbrokes in holland lord mancroft was also director of bank leumi bank which is inextricably linked with the history of the zionist movement and the economic development of the state of israel leumi along with bank hapoalim united mizrahi bank and israel discount bank was convicted of fraud for its role in 1983 stock scandal that led to the collapse of israels securities market and 7 billion government bailout lord mancroft was also member of the council of tribunals from 1970 to 1980 he was director of group 4 total security which is the security and services operation company of group 4 falck the worlds secondlargest security and related services company margulies was director of sw berisford co ltd and berisford mocatta co ltd after the takeover glazer and his accountant julius feinstein later one of the administrators of his estate became directors of incentive ashbourne and schwab lord mancroft was appointed chairman of incentive and schwab castle of ashbourne in december 1981 ashbourne sold coptic finance with its subsidiary schwab co 25 share went to glazers panamanian holding company amarena holdings inc the other 75 to company called boohat thirty nine ltd which was shelf company that had been acquired for the purpose by the volkskas group ltd of south africa schwab was renamed volkskas international the reason for this change to foreign ownership structure may be explained by the following statement from the collapse of the franklin national bank by joan edelman spero foreign banks operating in such an important international financial centre as london need not conform to regulation that applies to banks chartered there over the following two years ashbourne sold off all of its subsidiaries and was reduced to virtual shell its turnover went from more than 5 million in 1981 to just 60 000 in 1984 in 1982 it was converted to private company and by july 1983 lord mancroft levison margulies and castle had all resigned lord fisher having passed away in 1979 new directors appointed to the board of schwabvolkskas international as per the 1982 financial statements were lp korsten as chairman pienaar as managing director dr dc cronje and dr pr morkel few alternate directors with names just as distinctively afrikaans were also appointed the new chairman lp laurie korsten would later be charged with stealing more than r30 million from the amk technologies pension fund in case billed as south africas biggest ever pension fraud the judge dismissed the case without requiring he or his coaccused his brother to present their defence wwwmoneywebcoza 19 november 2000 danie cronje had joined volkskas in 1975 and would go on to become the deputy group chief executive of absa until 1997 he is presently chairman of absa and nonexecutive chairman of insurance services group sage see property portfolio and crest international securities dr pr morkel was director of iscor the governmentowned iron and steelproducing corporation whose bond issues were used as front for foreign loans to the south african government via europeanamerican bank while the country was still under economic sanctions the plan for volkskas international according to the directors report for 1982 was to broaden the scope of the companys activities with particular emphasis on international banking business the ultimate holding company was given as volkskas group ltd in south africa its bankers were given as barclays midland national westminster and williams glyns and its foreign correspondent banks were given as banque bruxelles lambert sa of brussels banque populaire suisse zurich credit lyonnais saparis credito italiano milan deutsche bank ag frankfurt hollandsche bank unie nv amsterdam chase manhattan bank new york manufacturers hanovertrust company new york skandinaviska enskilda banken stockholm and torontodominion bank montreal the new auditors for coptic and volkskas international were dearden farrow the authorised share capital for coptic and ashbourne was increased to 10 million each coptic from base of 440 000 volkskas from 1 million in 1982 volkskas internationals issued share capital was increased twice first on 6 april by 16 million and then on 30 june by another 24 million these shares were issued to coptic finance and were paid for by longterm interestfree loans to coptic finance of 1 million by glazer and 3 million by volkskas ltd in south africa which made its loan via boohat thirty nine both parties had made smaller loans the year before and the totals owing were repayable in three tranches in 1987 these loans were reflected in the consolidated accounts of boohat thirty nine the holding entity for coptic finance however while the statements for coptic finance reflect an amount owing to group companies the amount of its loan from volkskas ltd of south africa via boohat of some 35 million the accounts of boohat reflect and amount owing from group companies of 635 million however those same accounts list the only subsidiaries as being coptic finance which was apparently holding company and did not trade during the year volkskas international and ess nominees ltd also listed as nontrading the volkskas international financials for 1983 and 1984 were missing from the companies house files but one would have to assume that boohat made further loan to volkskas international of some 28 million its not clear whether glazer made similar additional loan this would need to be investigated more intriguing is the steep trajectory made by the banks levels of deposits and advances over this period the level of deposits at schwab co had remained well below 1 million until the end of the 1980 financial year then just prior to it being taken over by volkskas the level of deposits suddenly started to climb they reached 29 million in 1981 and jumped again to 42 million the next year after the change of ownership and name by the time of the 1983 financial statements they had rocketed to over 15 million these funds had been loaned out 13 million and placed on shortterm deposit with other banks 4 million up from zero the year before its not clear whether these were local ukoriginated deposits or whether they had emanated from volkskas in south africa but this should make it clear south africa held whitesonly elections in 1983 trilateral parliament was voted into power and came into being in 1984 pw botha made his famous rubicon speech in 1985 the writing was on the wall for white power and the broederbond members of the volkskas board would have been well aware of that while these plans were being drafted the possibility exists that this was the primary channel through which billions of rands were routed out of south africa to foreign banks study of the randdollar and randpound exchange rates see below bears testimony to this the structures were put in place prior to 1984 and the flood began in that year the year in which glazer died the question has to be asked therefore which other banks did volkskas international have accounts with either in its own name or for and on behalf of nominee clients all movements of funds through these accounts would have to be investigated it is known that glazer had fallout with cronje at this time and it may well have been over this plan to use the structures hed set up as vehicle for capital flight on grand scale either way bernard glazer and julius feinstein both resigned as directors of coptic finance and volkskas international in november 1983 the loan from amarena was terminated however the official notification to companies house of their resignation was only registered four months later on 2 april 1984 on 17 july 1984 bernard glazer passed away on 5 october the respective boards approved the next set of financial statements for boohat coptic finance and volkskas international and promptly registered them with companies house this is important process that had sometimes taken up to two years this time took only few months the statements all reflected that volkskas limited incorporated in the republic of south africa had replaced amarena holdings as 25 shareholder with boohat thirty nine still holding the other 75 however closer look reveals that the volkskas limited that took over amarenas shareholding was in fact not the same one that had been incorporated in the republic of south africa in the notes to the boohat thirty nine statements new subsidiary was listed called monkgold which had changed its name to volkskas limited on 25 april 1984 records at companies house reveal that monkgold was in fact incorporated in englandwales by an entity called instant companies ltd of 7 bell yard london in january 1983 its registered address secretary directors and memorandum of association was changed on 5 january 1984 its name to volkskas limited on 25 april 1984 and again one year later to volkskas uk limited cronje ag lewis and pm vivier were appointed directors on 5 october 1984 the notes to the same set of financials stated the following on 30 march 1984 volkskas limited incorporated in the republic of south africa established its branch in london consequently at the close of business on that date volkskas international limited transferred its trade and all the assets and liabilities except for investments in subsidiaries to volkskas limited everything had been shifted and set up under another umbrella an umbrella that had been made to look like it was being taken over by the south african company when in fact it wasnt the eurocurrency market is an international money market for currencies deposited and re lent outside their countries of origin there is eurocurrency market for many currencies wasis there one for the rand but the main one is the dollar the eurocurrency market boomed in the late sixties and early seventies as international banking expanded exponentially it went from 14 billion in 1964 to nearly 380 billion in 1977 collapse of the franklin national bank pp17 22 the major participants in this wholesale market are banks from many countries located in europe especially in london the most important centre of the market because the currencies and banks in the eurocurrency market are outside the country of origin they have been largely exempt from national regulation eurodollar deposits are shortterm deposits placed by central banks or monetary authorities commercial banks large corporations or insurance companies these institutions hold large amounts of dollars which they prefer to deposit outside the country where the owner of the funds resides for variety of reasons higher yields avoidance of national controls including taxation political concerns these deposits are transformed by eurobanks into large credits ranging from tens to hundreds of millions of dollars mainly to prime customers other banks large corporations public entities or governments such loans are used to finance both trade and domestic transactions their terms range from call to ten years and their interest rate in recent years has been floating rate linked to the london interbank offered rate libor governments do not regularly collect statistics on the volume of trading and banks consider their trading activities highly confidential several studies however reveal the huge dimensions of such operations despite all of the above despite the fact that the trade assets and liabilities of volkskas international having been transferred to it and despite south africas position as the worlds primary producer of gold the financial statements of volkskas uk ltd formerly volkskas ltd formerly monkgold stated consistently from 1984 until it was voluntarily wound up and dissolved in 1991 that the company has not traded during the period the financial statements of volkskas international for the 1983 and 1984 financial years appear to have gone missing from the companies house records but the accounts for the year ended 31 march 1985 also state quite simply that the company has not traded during the period and one has to go to the accounts of boohat and coptic finance to find out what happened to its assets which was quite simple they disappeared not trace of deposit or loan anywhere in the consolidated accounts from 1984 onwards the only balances reflected were those relating to loans that had been necessary to create the structure and buy up shares in the first place all of which had been neatly cancelled out and written off and repaid by 1987 the authorised and issued share capital of both coptic finance and volkskas international had also been reduced to 100 following resolution passed at the extraordinary general meeting of 5 october 1984 note stated that 1 176 108 was originally due to amarena holdings inc which was taken over by volkskas ltd pretoria on 23 september 1984 once again was this taken over by volkskas ltd pretoria or volkskas uk ltd formerly monkgold and what were the implications of this for the glazer estate glazers will still had him owning 25 of coptic finance and who held the banking liscence the statements for all these companies from 1984 onwards stated the same thing the company has not traded during the period they were all dissolved in 1991 the year that absa amalgamated banks of south africa was formed through the amalgamation of volkskas and other south african banks allied and united the auditors during this period were dearden farrow who would later merge with bdo binder hamlyn binder hamlyn would merge with arthur andersen in 1994 however they resigned as auditors from all the abovementioned companies in 1989 and kpmg peat marwick took over during the winding up period another noteworthy fact that emerges from the same set of financials is that glazer and feinstein were listed as having resigned but mention was made of glazers passing technically they didnt have to as hed resigned and longer held shares at least according to them the question remains who owns the banking licence when south africa was at its apex of sanctions it would seem probable that bernard glazer fiduciary position with interests in many countries pertaining to strategic minerals provided the necessary infrastructure to meet the trans national flow of resources and capital however this omission dovetails quite conveniently with other apparent efforts by the administrators and others to conceal the fact that hed died for example his continued appearance in the whos who of south africa until 1991 an action that would have required the positive confirmation of his details according to its publishers the origins of this confirmation should be investigated years later bernards daughter michele would query overseas travel expenses by the administrators of his estate she would be told that the trip had been made to finalise the settlement and other matters relating to legal action in the high court in london which the late mr glazer and his coshareholders in incentive investments commenced just prior to his death the details of this court action should be investigated when coptic finance and volkskas international were finally wound up the loans by volkskas were shown to be worth 2 the shares were transferred to absa and new batch of directors were appointed on 20 december 1992 letter from kpmg peat marwick and addressed to volkskas international stated as the company is longer trading we understand that the members wish to take advantage of the provisions of section 2501b exempting the company from the obligation to produce audited accounts we will then cease to hold office volkskas international continued for another seven years without audited accounts while the rand continued to slide on 7 september 1999 it was finally dissolved 5 from russian mining to exhaust fitting crest international securities when ford motor co ran into trouble just as the new millennium dawned it decided to offload some of its unnecessary baggage one of the companies it planned to dispose of was the paneuropean exhaust fitment franchise kwik fit which it had acquired in 1999 for 16 billion 1 billion however when the bidders auditors did quick check they found 5 million 34 million hole in kwikfits books apparently the company had not been accounting for its shortterm creditors properly the effect of this was to overstate its profits and the companys overall value ford finally got rid of the company to cvc capital partners the european private equity arm of americas giant citibank for 500 million 330 million taking knock of over billion dollars at time when it could ill afford it of course the previous owner of kwikfit sir thomas tom farmer pleaded ignorance however one would have to assume that the devious accounting arose during his tenure of ownership not fords the public cried another enron particularly since farmers auditors had been arthur andersen the global auditing firm that was brought to its knees by the accounting scandal that rocked the american power giant however closer look at the history of kwikfit shows that its core business was property ownership and that it used company registered in england with history of involvement in russian and south african mining and later of property ownership in england to reverse list on the london stock exchange in 1981 interestingly enough farmer acquired control of this company it was called crest international securities from our own bernard glazer glazers point of entry into and original involvement in crest is not known at this stage as the records for crest are missing from the companies house file for the years 1959 to 1969 however by the time farmer reversed his three companies into crest glazer held 309 of the issued share capital it was this 309 that farmer initially acquired through holding company called angliana ltd farmers subsidiary companies were called tom farmer ltd tfl and parben ltd the latter had subsidiary called arrowspeed tfls assets consisted of 17 purposebuilt workshop sites spread around england and scotland while parben held 16 more interestingly farmer had acquired these properties in two blocks only year before the 17 sites in tfl were acquired from company called nationwide properties nw ltd the 16 in parben from trucaris nominees ltd share issue immediately after the deal saw company called ridgefield nominees ltd holding almost 50 of the issued share capital information on these companies is given below whether sir tom was simply the most brilliant apprentice mechanic ever to qualify or whether he had another ace up his sleeve is not known but the official version of his history goes like this born in 1940 in edinburgh he left after completing his apprenticeship in 1964 and started his own business tyres accessory supplies he sold this mere four years later for whopping 450 000 after this meteoric success he retired to america where he soaked up all the business skills he possibly could before returning to launch kwikfit in 1971 or so the internet version goes httpwwwgeoedacukscotgazpeoplefamousfirst 595html perhaps his inspiring visit to the us lasted only few weeks or months but the fine print in the contract for the purchase of the shares in crest states that he had been in business with his partner walter alec stenson since 1968 in businesses which have involved the identification and acquisition of suitable retail and wholesale outlets throughout the united kingdom the 33 centres they introduced into crest were all let on 25year full repairing and insuring leases to public listed company called automotive products ltd its not known whether farmer was running his kwikfit franchise through this company but it does state further on that neither tfl nor arrowspeed is engaged in any other activity the suspicion that farmers business was front that absorbed cash from some other kind of operation is heightened by the musical chairs that the directors played during the year that bernard glazer died and the fact that crest emerged from that year with new holding company despite not having recorded with companies house any notices to shareholders nor minutes of meetings nor resolutions passed but before we take that journey it may be more useful to go right back to the beginning crest international securities was incorporated in england in 1913 as the siberian syndicate ltd it took over the undertakings and assets of company that had been registered under the same name in 1905 the reason for this transfer is not known although it may have been for secretarial reasons the memorandum of association granted it the status of an investment holding company with special interest in mining and mineral rights the main asset it took over from its namesake was 50 632 shares in the spassky copper mine ltd which was in russia the same draft extel card that relayed tom farmers history gave crests history as follows the company was incorporated in 1913 in order to pursue mining activities in russia but this object was frustrated by the russian revolution following which the company invested its funds primarily in other mining companies to stay with this period for minute the siberian syndicates address was given as 60 london wall which today is the address for the baring foundation founded in 1969 according to the baring foundations website wwwbvcpru from the 1850s until the russian revolution occurred in 1917 barings was the financial agent in london to the imperial russian government but more important for our story is that arthur later sir arthur fell was the biggest private individual shareholder in the siberian syndicate with some 10 of the issued share capital he was also director fell was simultaneously chairman of the african city properties trust which was at the centre of the glazer property portfolio and which the blue file alleges may have been front for the cash from mineral rights the only shareholder with greater holding than fell in 1913 was the transvaal agency ltd which gave london address and held about 20 of the shares details of crests investments in mining companies are not known given the big chunks that are missing from the files prior to 1970 but the company did emerge in that year with 63 of its shares being held by standard bank nominees ltd of 10 clements lane london there are records of standard bank nominees ltd ever having been registered in england today one of the most prominent shareholders on the jse securities exchange and one that has proved to be particularly prominent in the companies central to the glazer case is standard bank nominees transvaal ltd could the transvaal agency ltd and the two standard bank nominee companies mentioned above ultimately all be the same with the same beneficial shareholders statement in the 1972 financial statements the first on record reveals that the siberian syndicate held shares in consolidated gold fields ltd which it disposed of along with all its other mining interests during that year crest also had cluster of south africans on the board three of which shared the surname lubner the lubner family owned an eponymous furniture retail chain in south africa but their real wealth came through their plate glass manufacturing company plate glass pg today pgsi the company was world leader in the field of auto glass and exported patents and materials to all corners of the globe including america and japan in 1983 pg merged with the uk giant pilkington glass to form glass south africa but pilkington sold off this share in 1992 to south african breweries which ended up with 68 share the brewery offloaded this share in 1999 to two belgian companies dieteren and cobepa the latter is listed investment bank active in the benelux countries and canada today the lubner operation is one of the worlds largest automotive glass suppliers in the form of beltron international its not known who the consolidated gold fields shares were sold to but it was mining finance house and secondary banking activity was at its apex president nixon had closed the gold window in august 1971 debt money system with floating exchange rates had been introduced there was opportunity for profit and everybody wanted piece of the action amidst the stampede small merchant bank called close brothers was bought by an investment trust called london western in 1972 within year this bank would try to buy consolidated gold fieldss export finance subsidiary tennant guaranty instead consolidated gold fields turned around and through its subsidiary c tennant sons co bought the shares of london western which held close brothers for 27 million management buyout in 1978 would sever this link but close brothers would continue to have an intimate relationship with consolidated gold fields throughout the next three decades this relationship continues today with lord denman for many years director of both consolidated gold fields and close brothers still an adviser to the latter the mbo was supported by the keeling family through their issuing house london yorkshire trust and their investment trust called safeguard the directors paid for their share through loans from midland bank which was the bank for crest and other glazer companies close brothers also has strong links to the apparently anomalous bedfellows anglo american and kerzner international these will be explained later the year 1972 was also the year that lionel casper and brian simmons acquired the siberian syndicate through their own investment trust called london cavendish and changed its name to crest international securities ltd as the ashbourne investigation report makes clear their major client at the time was bernard glazer and their target was to form their own merchant bank with crest as the holding entity just like the former samuel montagu employees who formed london western and acquired close brothers casper and simmons went after ashbourne with its merchant banking subsidiary schwab sadly for them though the market turned just as they were about to make their bid for the company and they were forced to stall until the relaxation of exchange control regulations in england in 1979 nonresident of the uk could not control more than 10 of the shares of uk company glazer was south african citizen so his involvement would always have involved fronts according to the ashbourne investigation report by 1972 casper had acquired 30 of the shares of crest through purchases made by london cavendish certain of its investment clients and associates and himself and mr simmons its not known who these clients and associates were nor what percentage of the 30 they held nor what the total value of the holdings were another interesting historical point is that the auditors for crest were annan dexter co which became dearden lord annan morrish and later on dearden farrow who would be the auditors for boohat thirtynine the company that acquired the shares of volkskas international via coptic finance ltd short while before glazer died in 1984 the address for the african city properties trust in johannesburg and one of its main assets was annan house the chairman of consolidated gold fields of south africa ltd from 1944 through 1960 was robert annan ronnie and bertram lubner along with most of the other board members whod been with them resigned from crest following the takeover by casper and simmons gerald lubner remained but he would eventually sue the company for breach of contract when his office was terminated prematurely casper and simmons attacked the market hungrily and by mid1973 just before it collapsed spectacularly they had merged with another investment trust london foreign and held either 50 or 100 interests in ten companies each of which held property or listed securities portfolio crest was planning merger with second investment trust corporate guarantee with which it held along with bernard glazer 43 share in ashbourne the latter company had about ten industrial and landholding subsidiaries of its own plus its own bank the crestcorporateglazer consortium was preparing to make its obligatory offer for the outstanding shares in ashbourne when the uk property and stock markets collapsed in november 1973 financial statements were prepared during 1974 as they tried to sort out the mess and in the financial statements for the 18 months ended 31 march 1975 lionel casper the young 32yearold chairman explained the situation like this the groups financial position has reached critical stage however there is some potential for recovery in the value of the groups retained investments the purpose of reorganisation would be to stabilise the financial position of the group enabling the anticipated potential of these investments to develop to the advantage of shareholders the principal asset upon which the future of the group is considered to be based is the groups major property in prinsengracht amsterdam the proposals and means of effecting viable reconstruction are in the course of being finalised and it is hoped that shareholders will give it their unqualified support in due course our special thanks to mr bernard glazer whose preparedness to capitalise his very substantial unsecured loan to the company 213 322 which itself arose through the repayment by him of one of the companys largest bank borrowings has created real possibility of capital reorganisation an orderly exit followed with bernard glazer not only allowing them to capitalise his loans to the company but also taking up new share issues until he held more than 30 of the company most of the assets were converted to cash and it appears that just as glazer bought ashbourne through the back door using incentive investments ostensibly owned by mr faust who by all appearances was nothing more than company secretary he also bought some of the companies from crest through the back door at the time of the transfer of ownership of crest to tom farmer contract still pending was the sale of the share capital of one of its subsidiaries crest international holland bv to faust nv for cash consideration of dfl19 000 equivalent at that date to about 4 150 an inspection of the files for ridgefield nominees will make for interesting reading and will answer the question did glazer perhaps hang on to crest as well nowhere does it say how or how much he was paid for his 309 share on the face of it there should be grounds for suspicion glazer wanted to recoup his losses in the least disruptive way possible by the time farmer had moved in during early 1981 the company had four subsidiaries all of which were dormant and net asset value of 318 000 mostly in the form of cash after farmer took over it shot up to 28 million and beyond but the movement of directors and the chain of events that took place from late 1983 until early 1985 glazer died in july 1984 deserve further investigation in the financial statements for the period ended 29 february 1984 it says on 22 april 1983 all of the issued share capital of the company was acquired by kwikfit tyres exhausts holdings plc and the company became whollyowned subsidiary of that company kwikfit was the tenant of warehouse and exhaust centre in edinburgh which was the main property asset of parben ltd in effect the tenant had taken over the landlord which is not impossible more importantly the 1984 financial statements were only lodged with companies house in february 1985 almost year after the financial year end there was change of registrars during 1983 from midland bank to ravensbourne registration services ltd and new secretary robert huthersall who was not at this stage appointed to the board replaced brian simmons on 12 april 1984 walter alec stenson the chairman and james brown the property director also resigned prior to july 1984 and were replaced by duncan whyte the new chairman who was also partner in arthur andersen the companys auditors and one david henry ishmael jenkins apart from brown all these movements happened officially on 30 dec 1983 and the forms were lodged with companies house on 12 jan 1984 tom farmer remained on the board throughout ervin landau who had been with the company for number of years and whose legal firm represented the company throughout the period and still does today resigned on 5 october 1984 as did david jenkins who had only been on the board for nine months handwritten date on the form submitted to companies house is dated 101084 but the form is not stamped both were still listed as directors in the 1984 accounts although those accounts were only lodged with companies house on 6 february 1985 its unusual not to list changes of directorship that happen postbalance sheet and the date of submission of the accounts suggests that this should have been possible these irregularities form pattern similar to that which beset the other glazerowned uk companies around this time including ashbourne investments coptic finance incentive investments and volkskas international its worth noting too that at the time of the takeover by tom farmer crest applied for admission to the unlisted securities market usm which was an alternative to listing on the stock exchange that was aimed at the smaller company wishing to expand its business with the assistance of public market in its securities but without being subject to the same degree of regulation as listed companies pertinent as well is the fact that share restructuring took place and yet in the files mention was made of any such plan and explanation was given there were contracts minutes resolutions passed and circular to shareholders the annual return that followed this restructuring was dated 29 june 1984 but was only lodged on 14 january 1985 companies house requires these forms to be submitted within fourteen days of the annual general meeting however mention of such meeting was made in the 1984 accounts the only oblique reference to meeting is one made regarding the presentation of the budget on 13 march 1984 the previous annual return was dated 5 april 1983 and was lodged 10 june 1983 two months after the aforesaid date bulk list over 10 pages of shareholders was submitted with that earlier return made up on 5 april 1983 it would be useful to view this list the 1984 annual return in fact showed one share in the name of kwikfit euro ltd private company and the remainder in the name of kwikfit tyres exhausts holdings plc as aforementioned another quirky fact that may have more relevance than we want to admit is that the name kwikfit was not the genius of tomfarmer kwikfit tyre exhausts holdings plc company 00362333 had been incorporated under that name in england on 12 july 1940 the year tom farmer was born its name was changed on 20 july 1987 to kwikfit holdings ltd at which time it was also changed to private company the simple question is did ridgefield nominees ltd dispense of its shares in crest international securities in exchange for shares in kwikfit tyres exhausts holdings plc once again who was the beneficial owner of these shares ridgefield nominees was incorporated in 1972 and acts as nominee for henry cooke lumsden co stock broking firm with strong presence in the english midlands its auditors from 1976 were thornton baker who in 1986 became grant thornton the first loss since tom farmer had come roaring in was made in the 1984 financial year it amounted to 129 150 the annual accounts looked very different in other ways too in particular fixed assets were reduced from millions to nominal figure investments in subsidiary companies were put at 1 093 060 while amounts owing by subsidiaries climbed from nominal figure to over 7m the company had become an intermediate holding company so there were more consolidated accounts the 1985 annual return was made up on 1 october 1985 and lodged with companies house on 4 october three days later rather more promptly than the 199 days that the 1984 returns had taken while all this was going on parallel show with an interesting twist had taken place on 12 february 1980 beers announced that it had acquired 244 of the shares of consolidated gold fields ltd and had right of first refusal over another 1 it did not however intend to acquire further shares which would require it to make formal offer beers planned to offer half its total holding to anglo american corporation of south africa ltd by the time this announcement was made the secretary of state for trade had on the same day appointed inspectors to investigate this operation which has been referred to as raid on the market department of trade investigation under section 172 of the companies act 1948 report by bryan james welch and michael charles anthony osborne it turned out that all was above board but heres an interesting twist that requires further investigation at the beginning of 1987 caledonia investments the lowprofile investment company controlled by the cayzer family acquired 10 stake in close brothers sir nicholas cayzer it will be remembered from the property portfolio chapter had had close links with the south african government in the 1960s through uksata later that year close brothers advised caledonia on the disposal of its large shareholding in the financial and industrial conglomerate british commonwealth holdings ltd bc for 427 million of which large proportion was deferred over several years some two years later bc collapsed but all of the deferred consideration then outstanding to caledonia was safely received thanks to bank guarantees shrewdly negotiated back in 1987 around the same time in july 1987 close brothers announced simultaneous rights issue and share placing which together raised some 24 million of additional capital for the group the share placing was with caledonia investments which thereby increased its stake in close brothers to around 20 the same history according to the website of caledonia investments wwwcaledoniacom puts it this way proceeds of share buyback undertaken by bc were received just three days before the infamous black monday of october 1987 in move still regarded by commentators as one of the most prescient of its kind in recent history in this same year sol kerzner left south africa to settle in the uk and to focus on european interests sunday times october 2001 as of july 2003 caledonia held 19 of kerzner international and had voting rights on further 10 mr peter buckley chairman and chief executive of caledonia sat on the board of kerzner international and of close brothers the chairman of close brothers was sir david scholey who was also director of anglo american which was due to receive half of the consolidated gold fields shares bought secretly by beers in 1980 another director of close brothers is peter sacheverell wilmotsitwell who was partner of rowe pitman the stockbrokers when beers bought the cgf shares and who gave oral testimony at the investigation that followed following rowe pitmans merger with sg warburg wilmotsitwell became chairman of sg warburg securities and vicechairman of sg warburg group until he retired in 1994 he is currently chairman of mercury world mining trust plc director of caledonia investments which as mentioned holds 19 of close brothers is charles allenjones who was partner for 33 years in the international law firm linklaters who were the solicitors in london for beers and supplied substantial amount of information to the investigation team meanwhile the clues to the true nature of kwikfits operation appear to run dry but in 1995 company called kwikfit insurance services was formed it sold car home travel insurance breakdown cover legal expenses cover term life assurance and payment protection now watch this director of kwikfit insurance services ltd is eric sanderson former chief executive of the british linen bank which tom farmer used to fund his acquisition of crest sanderson was also on the management board of bank of scotland and on the board of company called city group company which provides outsourced regulatory compliance and head office finance services to small listed companies its clients are variously listed on the london luxembourg and johannesburg stock exchanges one of its clients is falcon investment holdings societe anonyme incorporated in luxembourg its activities comprise the function of central supervision and control of the groups mining interests through wholly owned subsidiary falcon mines holdings societe anonyme these interests include the group investment in falcon gold zimbabwe ltd falgold 571 owned subsidiary in olympus gold mines limited 6667 owned subsidiary and in minera falcon chile scm 52 owned subsidiary falcons shares are listed on the luxembourg johannesburg and zimbabwe stock exchanges and are occasionally traded on the london stock exchange another client of city group is monteagle holdings societe anonyme financial holding company incorporated in luxembourg with portfolio of investments in general trading freehold properties commercial agriculture and gold mining the company is listed on the luxembourg johannesburg and london stock exchanges it needs to be investigated whether either of these companies hold or control assets once belonging to bernard glazer and not declared to his beneficiary michele one of the main clues to this suspicion is that another member of the board of city group is bryan myerson who qualified as lawyer in south africa in 1985 and in 1994 established company called active value advisors ltd along with another south african julian treger active value claims to invest in undervalued publicly listed companies in the uk and europe however they are seen as aggressive corporate raiders in the city and in the past few years they have launched attacks on european media company as well as primedia in south africa an april 2003 active value south africa avasa put together consortium which spent r123 million to acquire 20 stake in embattled south african life assuror sage the avasa consortium included several well known south african investors including transnet myerson claimed that the other investors in his consortium could not be disclosed at this stage wwwmoneywebcoza 9 april 2003 alongside the avasa consortium taking up the rest of r350 million recapitalisation of sage were its erstwhile backers absa remgro and the mines pension fund at the time of this announcement sage also announced that it had managed to sell its bermuda operations to old mutual plc for an undisclosed sum myerson and treger sit on reshuffled sage board which is headed by dr danie cronje of absa who was on the board of volkskas international when bernard glazer resigned in 1982 some 18 months before he died under suspicious circumstances another clue that the link between glazer and kwikfit continued after the tom farmer deal comes to us through 100 glazerowned company called ccp crest city properties ltd ccp crest was incorporated in 1977 with the registered address given as barnett house 53 fountain street manchester and ervin landau as director landau was the eponymous partner in the law firm halliwell landau which represented kwikfit he was also director of crest international securities until october 1984 he resigned from that company few months after glazer died during all this time landau held one share in ccp jointly with bernard glazer who also held the other 99 shares in issue glazer would be replaced by his holding company amarena holdings inc in 1980 and landau would be replaced as the joint holder of one share by executors of b glazer deceased in 1984 however he remained on the board of ccp until 1988 when he was replaced by bernards sam and julius feinstein two of the three executors of the estate until this date landau continued to give his address and the address of ccp as barnett house manchester whats interesting is that this became the address of crest international securities in 1984 when it was taken over by kwikfit tyres exhausts holdings ltd even more interesting is that landau had listed kwikfit tyres exhausts holdings as one of his directorships as far back as 1977 when he was appointed as director of ccp we know that this company was registered under the same name in 1940 so once again we ask was kwikfit really tom farmers idea if not what was its true purpose and what was farmers true role and what was landaus role since he was clearly the point man between glazeramarena and kwik fit when landau resigned from ccp in 1988 its address changed to 370386 high rd wembley middlesex which was and still is the address of landau morley the auditors for ccp possible connections to ervin landau and michael morley of close brothers are being investigated at the same time crest international securities moved with halliwell landau to its new address st jamess court 30 brown st manchester it may be sheer coincidence but societe generale has branch at barnett house societe generale was one of the banks involved in secret loans to south africa during the 1970s when apartheid sanctions were in full force other banks involved in loans to south africa which also had presence in manchester include abn amro citibank and hsbc then midland bank the british linen bank which tom farmer used to finance his acquisition in 1980 also had presence in manchester two other banks of interest to our story which also have presence in manchester are bank hapoalim and bank leumi bank hapoalim is israels leading financial group and largest bank with global presence in key markets its name appeared as the banker for crest international securities along with midland bank in 1979 bank leumi meanwhile was founded in 1902 as the anglopalestine company by dr theodore herzl the founder of political zionism who prophesied the birth of the future state of israel according to its website lord mancroft who came onto the board of the merchant bank schwab which became volkskas international after glazer acquired it was also director of bank leumi there is clue in the financial statements of ccp crest city properties as to what its real business was in the valuation of bernard glazers estate by kessel feinstein done in 1984 ccp was dormant with its only asset being sundry debtors the value of its shares was given as being r48 058 the few statements that are available state that the company did not trade during the year and that the expenses of the company were met by the members personally for most of the period until it was dissolved in 1997 the company applied for exemption from producing audited financial statements due to its dormant status this is particularly relevant for the period leading up to the first disbursement in terms of glazers estate which fell due in 1994 audited statements were produced for four years preceding that date company within the same stable that reveals only marginally more of the real picture is crest international holdings ltd this company was subsidiary of crest international securities until glazer bought it out in late 1975 early 1976 crest and later glazer held 80 of the 100 issued shares in this company the other 20 were and still are held by former director of crest called conrad jeffrey morris who appears to be involved in various political lobby groups in israel one such group is the israel centre for social economic progress icsep which was founded in 1983 as an independent promarket public policy think tank wwwicseporgil crest international holdings has 50 share in subsidiary called loncrest holland bv which has two direct subsidiaries of its own bv holland film and beleggingsmaatschappij paragon bv film has subsidiary called exploitatie maatschappij munt bv according to the 1993 financial statements paragon acquired the economic ownership of the offices and shops which form part of the socalled plaza building in the kalverstraat in amsterdam in december 1983 exploitatie held the legal ownership of the same property paragon apparently paid exploitatie nlg71 million for the privilege of economic ownership the other 50 in loncrest holland bv is held by ladbrokes plc the uk betting and gaming arm of the hilton group ladbrokes entered the south african market in 2002 with an internet operation that offered taxfree betting through its london offices to the obvious ire of local bookmakers the bottom line for the companies falling under crest international holdings was their unusual accounting treatment which is perhaps best summed up by forensic accountant brian watson who studied them in 1996 on behalf of michele glazers attorneys at the time hofmeyr attorneys brooks found that crest did not operate bank account and that large amounts of money were lent to its subsidiary loncrest by amarena that these loans were recorded by means of book entries that interest was charged on them and that they were capitalized this activity increased significantly from 1988 the year in which landau was replaced on the board by feinstein and glazer junior as brooks pointed out the administrators coincidentally undertook their first trip to amsterdam during this time the administrators travelled to holland in 1989 in which year glazer bros the holding company for the glazer will trust also began to lend money to crest on the face of it the investment in the building was not good one and was sucking money from amarena the administrators explained that they could not make unilateral decision to sell it as ladbrokes owned half and theyd been advised to hold onto it for better price according to the administrators the price that was finally achieved set new record on the kalverstraat however brooks found it surprising that interest on the loan to crest was accumulated during the period interest accounted for 13 million of the 22 million loans in this was genuine interest charge then the effect would merely be to inflate the figures of amarena one explanation that brooks thought of for capitalizing the loan was that the other 20 shareholder conrad morris had not put in anything toward the loans and the administrators were trying to ensure that morris did not profit unduly by amarenas support of crest however he reckons that it would have been commercially expedient to liquidate crest whilst amarenas exposure was still relatively small this might have saved the trust some r13 million which was written off in 1994 and 1995 just prior to the first disbursement which was delayed until well into 1995 of course brooks did not have the bigger picture he took the declared contents of the estate at face value but he came close to the true state of affairs when he said that the flow of funds between amarena and glazer bros crest and loncrest cannot be positively identified in later point he states that the cash approximately r137 million appears to have disappeared his final conclusion was this there exists real possibility that cash was moved from south africa and b removed from amarena for some other purpose the question that remains is how long is the piece of string crest international securities limited co 130445 corporate structure as at 31
