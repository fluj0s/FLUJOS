6202c20 shspec113 what is withhold the common denominator of withholds is that withhold is something that person believes would endanger his selfpreservation if it were revealed this is the reason why whole track memory is occluded someone with little wholetrack recall considers himself to be in great danger this gives you the exact reason pc gets off withholds which arent withholds such as other peoples withholds all withholds students tend to get off on each other are safe withholds we get into this tacit consent on withholds because of overts on other peoples withholds eg spreading their overts around making them guilty for the overt sort of punishing them for having gotten it off after doing that it seems unsafe to get off withholds the more unsafe you make it to get off withholds the battier it becomes until you get civilization like this one for instance laws against perversion can be used by communists as means of blackmailing people the state lends itself to punishment of withholds which lays it open to undermining by the people in high positions who have those withholds likewise if the auditor makes it unsafe for the pc to get off withholds the pc will only get off safe withholds ie nonwithholds the hyperindividuation of the pc stems only from his withholds the pcs idea that to get it off would injure his survival is in fact aberrated it is the aberrated idea of what they dare to get off that brings about the condition of aberration everyone has some withholds which would in fact bring harm to him if they were revealed these get deeply buried encysted and the others build up on them if someone comes close to these withholds one gets the feeling that all hell will break loose and one will be imprisoned in some dungeon and tortured so naturally the auditor seems dangerous in reality dangerous auditor is one who doesnt pull withholds these auditors will always be involved in arc breaks cause pcs to natter about auditing orgs etc have loses etc the auditor who only gets off safe withholds is dangerous pcs whose withholds have been missed do not make their goals and gains the auditor who cannot get result with prepchecking will simply not audit the definition of withhold makes it not ok to let pcs take items off their lists because those become missed withholds because of the pcs considerations about safety as mentioned above he will want to withhold items from lists but you must not let this happen the items are on the list because they were dangerous at one time and were withheld in the first place prepchecking and 3dxx both are devoted to making the pc realize that it isnt dangerous to reveal himself the pc will mention some hot area then as the auditor starts him looking at it he will feel little reactive regret that he brought it up see page 185 above during the time you are going through this regret band you are still crossing over into the zone of what is unknown you hit should have known on the way up and you have to get through this to know in prepchecking when the pc gives you motivator you know you are an hot ground so you always ask an overt what question criticalness leads you to look for the overt doingness behind it explaining why something happened is milder phenomenon but it too requires new what question if the withhold itself is given it is the what question the withhold is measured by the amount of danger the pc conceives to be present in getting off the withhold if the withhold is not dangerous he will just give it if it is somewhat dangerous he will explain around it if it is rather dangerous he will criticize if it is super dangerous he will give you motivator we are taking about dangerousness in the eyes of the pc this gives you an index to the case case is as bad off as he considers it dangerous to reveal himself the insane person is dramatizing total motivator on the subject of punishment insanity is the last protest against punishment i cannot feel your punishment i dont know about it you have driven out of my mind etc length of time it takes to achieve result in auditing is indexed by danger of revelation from the pcs viewpoint how can you cut down this length of time dont pull safe withholds use prepchecking in 3dxx there is new line something like what identity would it be unsafe for you to reveal relief line could be what identity would it be safe for you to reveal to throw the others into view the pc actually wants the relief of the revelation but doesnt know how to get it safely so he is always hoping for some oneshot button for clearing without revealing anything unsafe to reveal type questions give you good zero prepcheck questions eg is there anything you have done which would be unsafe to reveal gives you what questions old age must be the consideration that it is unsafe to show up with mest body at first you must figure its safe to show up with mest body then you get the idea that it is unsafe so you take it down that must be what old age is the basic trick of this universe is if you withhold it it wont hurt you which is total lie offering fact seems dangerous withholding the fact is apparently not dangerous this is lie the thetan just builds up mass and gets less space this way it makes his withhold himself more and more occupy less and less space permeate less and less etc cant go outside case is someone who has lots of withholds stacked up an one fairly serious one he is the one who is afraid the police are after him phobias fit in here this is most salient in prepchecking some withholds you just let go by the safe withholds which are really red herrings
