on unilateral trade preferences to promote export led development in poor countries congressionally authorized trade preferences give market access to selected developing country goods dutyfree or at tariffs below normal rates without requiring reciprocal trade concessions the caribbean basin has benefitted from multiple preferential trade arrangements the best known being those linked to the caribbean basin initiative cbi first passed by congress in caribbean basin economic recovery act of 1983 and made permanent in 1990 the most effective trade preferences for increasing caribbean exports to the united states focused on textile and apparel trade rules and were provided for limited time in the caribbean basin trade partnership act cbtpa of 2000 since then the growing number of reciprocal us free trade agreements ftas in the region have replaced preferential trade arrangements for many countries signaling shift in us trade policy and raising questions with respect to its effectiveness on us imports from the mostly smaller countries that still rely unilateral trade preferences the caribbean trade preference programs amended tariff schedules and trade rules in ways designed to increase us imports from beneficiary countries trade grew but evaluations of the early programs suggested that their effects were not as robust as originally hoped benefits tended to be concentrated in few countries and products energy and later textiles limiting export promotion and deterring production diversification over time benefits were eroded further by multilateral trade liberalization which reduced the relative value of unilateral preferences bilateral ftas particularly the caftadr actually replaced unilateral preferences with permanent more attractive tariff reductions and trade rules for the dominican republic and central american countries the largest of the now former cbicbtpa beneficiary countries and the main exporters of apparel number of issues and circumstances are converging that will be challenge for us trade policy in the caribbean region the most effective trade preferences have been those provided under the cbtpa because of their apparel provisions although they have been extended through september 30 2010 they are sparsely used by the remaining smaller eastern caribbean countries that have largely servicesbased economies and export only small amounts of manufactured goods there is also reluctance by these countries to make the transition to an fta without some guarantee of development component to the agreement these concerns persist despite the promise of permanent market access and increased investment that an fta holds out the caribbean countries long involved in dependent economic relationships appear content to take cautious path toward any new trade arrangement with the united states for us trade policy any thoughts of achieving broader regional integration are challenged by these circumstances broader integration may be difficult to reconcile with the needs of very small developing countries which are highly vulnerable to the vicissitudes of global economic trends and may require new and creative solutions particularly if us policy is still driven by the historical focus on development and regional security issues in addition to trade liberalization in the context of continuing with trade preferences in similar or altered form or opting for an fta the solution is not immediately obvious this report will be updated for more information on the caribbean economic integration see crs

preferences as an integral part of its foreign economic policy trade preferences give market access to selected developing country goods dutyfree or at tariffs below normal ntr1 rates without requiring reciprocal trade concessions they come in many forms and are intended to promote economic growth and development in poor countries by stimulating export promotion and investment and to encourage the use of us inputs in foreign manufacturing trade preference programs must be authorized by congress and are usually done so for specific periods of time the caribbean basin see figure 1 2

activities motivated by commercial political and security interests at times the us congress has created unilateral trade preference programs that promote developing country exports but are often structured so as to minimize the negative economic effects on us producers and workers over time bilateral regional and multilateral trade agreements have come to eclipse the importance of preference arrangements trend that review of these developments will show has been particularly visible in the caribbean basin

government initiated preferential tariff program based on production sharing production sharing is costreducing business strategy that seeks competitive price advantage by locating manufacturing processes in more than one country us firms specialize in the capital intensive technology driven stages of production and outsource assembly and other lowerskill processing to lowerwage countries under the us productionsharing program foreign firms that import us component parts and assemble or process them into finished or semifinished products may then reexport them back to the united states with duties levied only on the value added abroad tariff on us content 3 us firms benefit from production sharing by the required use of their inputs to receive the tariff exemption and in retaining portion of the globa l market for goods that might otherwise go to lowercost foreign producers that do not use us inputs foreign firms using us inputs benefit from the tariff exemption making their products mo re competitive in the us market relative to those of other producers who face duty on the full value of their exports this type of production arrangement has been commonly used for automobile parts electronics and apparel among other manufactured goods 4 the caribbean basin and mexico were early beneficiaries of the production sharing program with proximity providing major advantage at that time lower transportation costs and quicker turn around times have provided mexican caribbean and central america producers with an additional competitive factor at least for certain niche markets over their more distant but often lower cost asian competitors many caribbean countries developed their export processing zones around this program by the 1970s the concept of preference programs for developing countries shifted whereas production sharing was based on mutually beneficial competitive business strategy developing countries had long advocated unilateral trade preferences as form of development assistance 3 initially defined under item 807 of the us tariff schedule and later in chapter 98 of the us harmonized tariff schedule hts united states international trade commission production sharing use of us components and materials in foreign assembly operations 19951998 washington dc usitc publication 3265 december 1999 pp 11 and 12 4 regional production sharing

the generalized system of preferences gsp was conceived as way for developed countries to respond to this expressed need the gsp permits developed countries to grant unilateral tariff preferences for selected imports from developing countries to promote exportled growth the us program provides limited tariff incentives for many but not all products the caribbean region has availed itself of both the gsp and production sharing incentives for many years the us gsp program requires periodic renewal by congress and was last reauthorized through december 31 2009 5 the tariff preference model as development strategy continued to evolve in the 1980s the next step targeted specific regions of the world for deeper preferences than those accorded under the gsp strategy driven by security as well as economic and political interests of the united states congress enacted the first such geographically targeted program for the caribbean region in 1983 6

impetus to create caribbean trade preference program arose from concern over the regions economic collapse and concomitant political radicalization that materialized in the early 1980s the caribbeans basins proximity vulnerability and instability has long made it of particular strategic interest to the united states notion well established in us political history dating to the monroe doctrine7 in light of this reasoning president reagan and the us congress initially considered comprehensive response to the caribbean basins troubles trade preferences would emerge as the primary economic component of scaled back alternative president reagan unveiled the cbi in speech before the organization of american states on february 24 1982 arguing that ensuring economic and political stability in the caribbean region was vital to us security interests he proposed controversial mix of tax incentives aid and trade preferences the idea was rejected by many however particularly importcompeting firms and workers as consequence the first bill died in the 97 th congress8 in the 98th congress however congress acted promptly on the cari bbean basin economic recovery act cbera9 although it again drew stiff resistance from us textile and labor interests once scaled back to modest dutyfree treatment for only 10 of caribbean imports it passed with overwhelming support in both the house 39212 and the senate 907 10 president reagan signed it into law on august 5 1983 pl 9867 and the trade preferences went into effect on january 1 1984 the cbera permits 27 countries to be designated by the

the united states gal shipments paid duty only on the value added abroad15 following implementation of the sap there was an sudden large increase in apparel imports from cbi countries importantly the increase occurred because of changes in us textile policy not the cbera the increase in demand for caribbean apparel articles at this time was evident nonetheless driven by their relatively low cost production proximity and higher quota restrictions that asian producers still faced tariffs on textile and apparel goods from the cbi countries however remained significant barrier and would not be

greater number of caribbean goods and 2 making the program permanent the legislation as initially proposed would have extended additional tariff benefits to textiles apparel sugar petroleum leather goods and other items left out of the 1983 legislation it also would have repealed the september 30 1995 termination date making the duty preferences permanent as the initiative made its way through the legislative process however many of the preferences that might have had the greatest economic impact on the caribbean like the textiles and apparel provisions were stripped from the bill this change allowed the caribbean basin economic expansion act of 1990 referred to as cbi ii to be passed as title ii of the customs and trade act pl 101382 it made permanent the existing cbi preferences for beneficiary countries but extended them only to few new products changes included limited phasedin tariff reduction for handbags luggage flat goods work gloves and leather goods not eligible for gsp treatment and dutyfree and quotafree treatment for articles other than textiles apparel and petroleum products that are assembled or processed from us components there were also new limited benefits for ethanol imports and few nontrade incentives cbi imports were also given an exception from antidumping ad and countervailing duty cvd cumulation rules making it harder to show that us

rules of origin generally limiting content of traded goods to materials made in the nafta countries thus excluding cbi countries the effects seemed apparent twoway trade in textiles and apparel between the united states and mexico rose 218 from 1993 to 2002 some of it presumably to the detriment of apparel production in the caribbean18 nafta eliminated much of the relative trade advantage that the cbi countries had enjoyed over mexico since 198 4 and gave mexico distinct advantage in apparel production which was dominant export sector for many of the caribbean countries as well mexicos much larger economy and production capacity for textiles and apparel became an immediate threat to income and employment in the cbi countries which began to lobby for us trade preferences equal to those of mexico this became known as the cbinafta parity issue while some in congress were sympathetic to cbi country claims particularly after the regions devastation from hurricanes georges and mitch in 1998 it took years to gather the support to pass legislation the idea was to provide the cbi countries with naftae quivalent preferences until such time that they could either accede to nafta or enter into similar reciprocal fta with the united states because textile and apparel trade was at the heart of the program the legislation had to overcome resistance from importcompeting us

hemispheric opportunity through partnership encouragement act of 2008 hope ii24 the duty preferences are significant because the united states is the main destination for haitian apparel exports its dominant export sector generating as much as 80 of the countrys foreign exchange in 2007 apparel constituted over 80 of haitis total exports and 93 of exports to the united states 81 knit 12 woven articles so the sector provides one potential avenue for employment growth the preferences also support textile firms in the dominican republic which have an expanding coproduction arrangement with haiti because hope i did not result in dramatic growth in haitian textile exports to the united states inhibited by the limited time frame and complicated rules of origin congress passed hope ii which extended tariff preferences for 10 years through september 30 2018 made the rules more flexible and simpler expanded duty free treatment for us apparel imports of knits as well as woven articles and allowed for direct shipment of apparel articles to the united states from either haiti or the dominican republic hope ii also re quires that haiti create new apparel sector monitoring program labor ombudsman to ensure compliance with internationally recognized core labor practices the hope act as amended differs from other us apparel trade arrangements with the caribbean unlike those in the cbtpa of which haiti is beneficiary country and the caftadr which does not include haiti the hope act permits dutyfree treatment for apparel imports in limited quantities assembled or knittoshape in haiti with inputs from thirdparty countries or those outside the region that are not party to either preferential trade arrangement or free trade agreement with the united states the competitive advantage to haitian firms derives from their ability to use less expensive inputs sourced from virtually anywhere in the world and still receive dutyfree treatment to the extent that this advant age is in place for an extended period of time it is intended to encourage increased investment in the apparel assembly business in haiti contributing to growth in output employment and exports critics have argued however that this advantage could come at the expense of other regional producers although the effects have so far been judged to be very small 25

cbera category in 2006 articles entering under the older production sharing program by contrast have fallen sharply there was slight increase in the portion of goods entering ntr dutyfree while those entering under cbtpa grew suddenly at first but declined somewhat in 2006 taken together these trends point first to switch in apparel goods in 2001 that entered under the cbtpa that had previously entered under production sharing preferences and modest increase in the value of new imports eligible for dutyfree treatment by 2006 the decline in dutyfree imports entering under cbtpa due to the effects of caftadr is evident and there was an increase in goods newly entering dutyfree goods under cbera 29 in section three the last two rows of table 1 highlight that the total imports entering under the combined cbera and cbtpa provisions rose from 126 of total cbi imports in 2000 to 385 in 2006 in addition the amount that entere d exclusively from these preferences that is could not have entered under any other program such as gsp rose from 68 of total imports to 31730 this trend suggests that the benefits of these two programs as defined in current law have probably stabilized and again points to the sharp increase in dutyfree imports that occurred after cbtpa was implemented this point reinforces the fact that the original cbera program appeared to have had limited effect whereas the cbtp textile and apparel preferences appeared to have provided more robust response these trends are consistent with the intent expectations and evolution of the preferences programs but demonstrate that for nearly 17 years their effects were less than might have been expected until the cbtpa was implemented the cbtpa trade appeared quickly but stabilized by 2002 variations in trends in 2005 and 2006 point to two overriding factors the large price increase in energyrelated imports and the implementation of caftadr the increase in the 28 usitc the impact of the caribbean basin

development strategies they have combined us trade preferences with their own pr oximitydriven niching strategies in way that has helped them maintain relatively small but important market share in the united states it is strategy that may have led to selective export and economic growth but the effects may have run their course given the proliferation of large lowcost asian producers and increasing substitution by the united states of the reciprocal fta for unilateral preferential trade arrangements in the region in addition many economists are skeptical about the efficacy of trade preferences as development strategy pointing to two areas in particular design and administration of the preference programs and weak trade effects structural design flaws that limit the effectiveness of unilateral trade preferences is common concern trade preferences are paternalistic in nature designed by developed countries to give generous oneway benefits to developing countries but as unilateral concessions they are self limiting often for political reasons for example critics argue that 35 unilateral agreements are nonbinding often subject to renewal and can be denied or suspended and have been on product or country basis which can hinder investors from committing more fully to developing economies eligibility criteria are based on foreign policy and political goals of the developed country often unrelated to enhancing trade performance so they are not costless proposition for recipients and program details are subject to domestic economic pressures that typically seek to exclude importsensitive articles which can cause the developed country to apply higher than average tariffs on these goods for nonbeneficiary countries the cbi programs are not immune to some of these criticisms beneficiary countries have say in the design of the tariff preferences must lobby the us congress and executive branch to make case for their continuance must comp ly with numerous foreign policy and political requirements to maintain eligibility and have not always been able to export key products under preference programs results of the cbera program disappointed some because of its many limitations even with cbi ii making the program permanent and the cbtpa adding many new products to the list of eligible exports including textile and apparel articles success has not been

allowing the programs to expire would likely raise the stakes in the debate over potential bilateral fta with the united states in any case even if the preferences are not widely used eliminating them

in way that might provide more benefit to the caricom countries 38 this option recognizes that while the trade preference programs have not been perfect they have evolved over time in an attempt to become more economically relevant to the countries they were designed to help the evolution from cbera through cbi ii to cbtpa supports this fact even if the current preferences are being eroded by broader trade trends and policies the central problem is that except for the energy and chemical exports which constitute 80 of caricoms merchandise exports to the united stat there is little for the caricom countries to take advantage of in the cbi preference programs apparel goods amount to slightly less than 5 of total cbi exports to the united states and the complexities of us rules of origin and caribbean supply constraints raise doubts about th ability of caricom countries to expand this sector significantly unless apparel rules of origin are relaxed even further those products would not be competitive with those receiving benefits under caftadr or with asian goods it is conceivable that the cbi programs could be amended to target the specific export sectors of the caricom countries and perhaps deepen existing benefits for certain industries the opportunities however may be limited the caricom countries are largely service sector economies eg tourism financial services professional services and do not view enhancing us market access for goods with the same sense of urgency that many other countries in the western hemisphere do even if rules of origin and cumulation could be made more flexible trinidad and tobago the country that benefits the most from cbtpa given its large energy related exports is also most likely to consider an fta of benefit relative to the smaller island economies g3g561g20g142g140g146g153g155g152g140g138g149g561g8g22g3g561g138g151g141g561g5g3g20g11g5g17g15g561 third option is to consider bilateral fta with caricom it could provide some appeal if crafted in way that would benefit the small caribbean nations but the difference in commitments between trade preferences and an fta could be hindrance ftas operate much differently than unilateral trade preferences trade preferences are unilateral concessions of one country to another offering little in the way of recourse to the recipient country if dispute arises ftas by contrast are negotiated agreements with mutual obligations and disputes subject to resolution mechanism defined in the fta preferences are also limited commitments usually focusing on market access ftas are

permanent arrangements codified by each member in domestic law an fta would be consistent with us trade policy in the rest of the region the united states vision for hemispheric integration has revolved around the comprehensive fta model as implemented with mexico canada central america chile and possibly in the near future with peru panama and colombia if the integration path were to emanate from harmonization of these agreements having an fta in place with caricom would appear to further the broader us trade agenda the caricom countries by contrast are diverse group of mostly island countries with vastly different economies and therefore varying perspectives on trade policy and an fta with the united states 39 the more developed economies energyrich trinidad and tobago and tourism driven barbados are far more open to the prospects of an fta than the natural resourcebased countries guyana and jamaica and the micro economies of the eastern caribbean which have fearful reluctance to begin negotiations all of the caricom countries however have expressed some overriding concerns over the limitations of small economies to undertake the obligations of an fta without some type of compensatory mechanism to replace trade preferences among the major concerns are40 questions over the united states willingness to accommodate their need for special and differential

circumstances have converged that point up challenges for us trade policy in the caribbean region among these is the recently renewed but as yet unchanged caribbean basin trade partnership act the benefits of which have been eroded over time by multilateral trade liberalization and new reciprocal bilateral ftas further these programs are little used by the smaller beneficiary countries which also have expressed reluctance to move toward an fta with the united states without some guarantee of development component to the agreement despite the promise of permanent market access and increased investment that an fta holds out the caribbean countries long accustomed to dependent economic relationships appear content to take cautious and leisurely path toward any new trade arrangement with the united states for us trade policy these circumstances present formidable challenge to any further thoughts of expanding hemispheric integration in fact broader integration may be difficult to achieve and still meet the needs of very small developing countries their economies are highly vulnerable to the vicissitudes of global economic trends and weather patterns and may require new and creative solutions to make the adjustment to full reciprocal free trade us trade policy toward the region has also long had historical focus on development and regional security issues in addition to trade liberalization suggesting that trade liberalization likely will not be the only factor to determine policy in the context of deciding whether to continue with trade preferences in similar or altered form or opt for an fta deeper discussion let alone agreement has yet to materialize httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33951g23g495g21g495g561g22g155g138g141g142g561g18g152g149
