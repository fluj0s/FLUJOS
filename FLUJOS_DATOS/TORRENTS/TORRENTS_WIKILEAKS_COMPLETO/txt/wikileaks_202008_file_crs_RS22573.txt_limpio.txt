identifies possible pl 109435 oversight issues for congress pursuit of postal reform number of factors encouraged the movement for postal reform which culminated in the enactment of the postal accountability and enhancement act pl 109435 among these factors perhaps foremost were the financial challenges of the us postal service usps1 use of the mails has declined in recent years as alternatives like email facsimiles and online bill paying have been substituted for hardcopy letters yet usps costs more than 76 of which are labor have risen with the addition of 2 million addresses each year and mounting obligations for retiree health benefits2 additionally usps its board of governors the government accountability office mailers organizations postal labor unions and most recently presidential commission have said that the postal reorganization act of 1970 longer provided viable business model3 the ratesetting process was criticized for preventing usps from responding

critics also argued that longstanding political and statutory restrictions impeded efforts to modernize the mail processing network and close unneeded facilities finally passage of the postal civil service retirement system funding reform act of 2003 pl 10818 117 stat 624 helped sow the seeds for reform by imposing significant costs on usps that would require usps to raise postage rates pl 10818 required usps to set up an escrow account and contribute to it approximately 5 billion each year the law did not though dedicate the escrow fund to any particular use eg worker benefits4 hence it imposed major cost on usps but provided financial or operational benefits pl 10818 also required usps to pay 27 billion to cover the pension benefits for the military service of usps employees major provisions of the new postal law according to crs analysis using cqcoms legislative impact tool pl 109 435 makes more than 150 changes to current federal law5 the laws major changes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22573 include the following definition of the term postal service section 101 of the law defines postal service to mean the delivery of letters printed matter or mailable packages including acceptance collection sorting transportation or other functions ancillary thereto this provision is significant because previously the law did not define postal service an omission critics have contended that permitted usps to undertake nonpostal activities to the detriment of private sector firms6 repeal of the escrow section 804 of the law abolished the escrow account established by pl 10818 the escrow was replaced with postal service retiree health benefits fund to which usps must contribute each year 3 continued government reform the postal services uncertain

military obligations to the treasury section 802 of the law relieves usps of the 27 billion cost of paying postal worker pension costs attributable to military service separation of product types and product pricing title ii of the law divides usps products into marketdominant and competitive classes marketdominant products include those products and services that usps need not compete with the private sector to provide7 market dominant products include 1 firstclass mail letters and sealed parcels 2 firstclass mail cards 3 periodicals 4 standard mail 5 singlepiece parcel post 6 media mail 7 bound printed matter 8 library mail 9 special services and 10 singlepiece international mail competitive products include those for which competitive market exists8 they include 1 priority mail 2 expedited mail 3 bulk parcel post 4 bulk international mail and 5 mailgrams this separation of products into two types is significant because critics have said that usps has used revenues from marketdominant products eg first class mail to crosssubsidize competitive products eg overnight package httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22573 delivery this they contend is unfair competition under pl 109 435 prices of products in the marketdominant class may be increased by usps more than the consumer price index for all urban consumers prices of products in the competitive class must be based on markettype factors such as costs attributable which sec 202 of the statute defines as the direct and indirect postal costs attributable to such products through reliably identified causal relationships stronger regulator title vi of the law replaces the postal rate commission with the postal regulatory commission prc the new regulator has subpoena power and broader scope for the regulation of usps and the examination of usps activities reform of international mail regulation section 407 of the law clarifies the authority of the secretary of state to set international postal policy and enter agreements and would require himher to apply customs laws equally to private shipments and shipments of international mail that are competitive products new qualifications and lengths of terms in office for usps governors section 501 of the law requires that members of the board of governors of usps be chosen solely on the basis of their experience in the field of public service law or accounting or on their demonstrated ability in managing organizations or corporations in either the public or private sector of substantial size of the nine governors at least four would have to be chosen solely on the basis of their demonstrated ability in managing organizations or corporations in either the public or private 7 eg usps possesses legal monopoly over the delivery of firstclass mail 18 usc 1693 1999 and 39 usc 601 8 eg usps must compete with ups and other private firms in the package delivery business crs4 sector that employ at least 50000 employees governors terms are reduced from nine to seven years increased usps transparency section 204 requires usps to release more details on its finances and operations in its financial reporting usps must provide the same information that private firms provide under section 4 of the sarbanesoxley act9 possible pl 109435 oversight issues for congress determining what the law means the inherent complexity of lawmaking and the execution thereof invites interbranch disagreement over what law means should agencies interpret statute based upon the text of the statute alone should they consider congresss intent or try to ascertain the original understanding of the statute10 the legislative and executive to say nothing httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22573 of the judicial branches difficulty in coming to shared understanding of what law requires indicates need for active congressional oversight of agency activities to ensure compliance due to the acts length more than 20000 words and complexity disagreements may arise over just what the various provisions of pl 109435 mean and how they are to be executed new rules and new regulator new rules will have to be produced to define and implement the laws many requirements11 as noted above pl 109435 establishes new regulator the postal regulatory commission which has greater powers than its predecessor the postal rate commission the statute requires the prc to undertake numerous tasks including the following establishing modern system for regulating rates and classes for marketdominant products further defining the term workshare discount which refers to postage discounts provided to mailers for the presorting prebarcoding handling or transportation of mail promulgating regulations toprohibit the subsidization of competitive products by marketdominant products and 9 on section 4 of the sarbanesoxley act see crs report rs22482 section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 management assessment of internal controls current regulation and congressional concerns by michael v seitzinger 10 for just two of the many different views on statutory interpretation see antonin scalia matter of interpretation federal courts and the law princeton princeton university press 1997 and paul brest the misconceived quest for the original understanding 60 boston university law review 1980 pp 204238 11 for an introduction to the rulemaking process see crs report rl32240 the federal rulemaking process an overview by curtis w copeland crs5 by regulation prescribing the content and form of the annual reports usps must issue12 not only are these activities inherently complex and hence open to disagreement but they also are likely to be contested by interested stakeholders because any regulations issued or rules made tend to impose benefits or costs on certain groups for example how the prc defines the term workshare discount may affect uspss freedom to offer discounts to mailers usps has tended to favor giving such discounts because it believes they generate higher mail volumes mailers favor the discounts because they lower per piece postage costs some postal employee unions however have criticized workshare discounts arguing that they outsource work to the private sector that should be done by usps employees executive branch concerns in its efforts to ensure compliance with the law congress also may face direct challenge from the executive branch upon signing the law president george w bush issued signing statement that appears to express concerns about the constitutionality of
