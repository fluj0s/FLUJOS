6111c28 shspec85 havingness havingness doesnt have to go with confront if you are running subjective process on pc that is the confront part havingness is an adjunct to any subjective process it goes out about every six months and comes in again six months or so later why does the meter get stuck one reason is that arc breaks get so furious that nothing reads everything has gone out hes in games condition and wont let anything have any command over him one else is permitted to have anything you can fix it by running havingness the two hundred lie detector operators who can make it operate do so because they can get into arc with the person on the lie detector the emeter likewise wont register in the presence of an operator who has faintest command value over the person on the meter you can err by thinking that if it doesnt read on the meter it doesnt exist this can make one invalidate the meter at that moment you must be able to obnose the pc and see whether he has an arc break the arc broken pc wont confront the auditor looks glum gives short answers gets ta or rising ta that sticks the latter indicator is not diagnostic in itself the ta stays up because the meter is inoperative so you must look at the pc and see his indicators an auditor can make another error lot of people have the idea they can tell better than the emeter what persons terminal is because there is something they can know better than the emeter thats because they do know that the pc is not with the session have asked the pc for an arc break and have gotten read that is the situation where they know more than the meter this doesnt mean they know better which is the pcs terminal so be relaxed but not careless what could stand between you and rapid assessment is an arc broken pc who is not registering on the meter someone who is nattering about how scientology is fraud etc etc can be shut off by asking them why cant you talk to anyone about your difficulties new rudiments question then is could you talk to about your case which combines the elements of insessionness if hes got an arc break he wont answer it positively then youve got another series of questions to get him in session see hcob 30nov61 arc process 1961 the arc break process is the best havingness chewerupper there is next to routine 3d hence the importance of havingness in the first place the thetan doesnt want this mass he has but it is mass and thetans motto is anything is better than nothing but this mass is an introversion mass and the more you run the mass the less hes got the physical universe so even if the mass didnt increase it is introverting him and the more pc introverts the less universe he has so he would get the feeling of losing havingness just by contacting some introverting thing something that introverted him badly would give him the feeling of havingness it has always been there whenever he has gotten sick this mass you are running out caved in on him dont be amazed to find the pc running fever while running 3d just keep on smoothly handling him the formula for getting rid of havingness is whatever the persons attention is on put it on something else for everything he has at the moment tell him hes got to have something else this is more effective than brainwashing its the suddenness of the shift that is unsettling when you are running persons arc break and hes out of arc with you he wants to go out of the session he starts by feeling hes not getting auditing then that he should be thinking about something else then that he will physically leave the session catch him one step back run havingness you will get command value as hes looking around the room and you will heal the arc break almost any pc run long enough on havingness will get all his rudiments in the earliest rudiments process was is it all right to be audited in this room is it all right for to audit you were just about back there havingness is that activity which is run when needed and when it will not violently deflect the pcs attention dont underrun it once started of all processes the right havingness process is the safest process to run on anyone at any time it cannot be overrun if the pc comes into session with bounteous ptps arc breaks ruds wildly out and you are going to straighten them all out wouldnt it be nice to get them all out of the road ask the room question first consult your humanness and decide whether he is in any kind of shape to be audited if not start by running havingness this will start to extrovert him and make it easier for him to run ruds and to audit him on what you want to run dont collide with the ptp at all the terminal is wrong havingness isnt run against can squeeze its run against the pcs ability to have large objects in the room its tested on can squeeze you always run havingness until the pc can have large objects in the room the old rules of havingness applied to running it paired with confront the can squeeze check neednt be done more than two or three times week and the test of enough havingness is when he can have large objects in the room the havingnessconfront system ran large sections of case but havingness isnt residual in this system it was loaned to it pc with reduced havingness is picky and choosey about room objects hes cautious with havingness up the pc is relaxed and unconcerned he is bangy if havingness is working the ta goes up and blows down havingness runs the bank if you run very much of it the reason you dont run lot of havingness along with confront is that the confront runs the bank faster the havingness was to keep the pcs attention flexible havingness processes from the thirtysix presessions are run by themselves you dont need confront when running sec checks terminals 3d etc the depth of reach of the processing is accompanied by reduction of havingness in the extreme so run lot of havingness dont be upset when the pc goes into and out of pt thats the havingness running the bank its signalized by the pc apparently doping off but he isnt actually the pc can see but not look dont stop the process when he has gone blah run the process until he is back amongst us thats the second rule along with the large objects rule keep giving him the command at the same rate even though hes all blah hes still doing the command matter what he is doing with his eyeballs the pc does not have to tell you that he has executed the auditing command the pc can get into trouble with havingness by having things he cant see with his eyes if he looks too much without looking he could be having bank in which case his havingness goes down instead of up become wary pcs do this person can be going around in life his whole lifetime without ever having seen any part of the physical universe its shock to get reality on it the pc puts up picture of the shelf and looks at that he sometimes discovers while running havingness that he is doing this the reason you have different havingness processes is that people have different degrees of perception someone with poor sight ability would do better on some other perceptic if there are thirtysix havingness processes you can be sure that there are more even thirtysix is more than is usually needed however you can run havingness process five times test it then if it loosened the needle run it twelve commands test again to be sure if the needle is looser ok if not look for another one if the needle was tighter dont put in any randomity go immediately to another process dont look dismayed if the needle does tighten in the interest of having standard posture from which to do the can squeeze get the pc to put his hands in his lap having found the pcs havingness process start the session run havingness to the large object rule especially if you had trouble finding the havingness process now run ruds youll have minimized the number of arc breaks you will get the pc is in games condition with you because his havingness is down get his havingness up and the games condition will vanish and his ruds will tend to be in and can easily be checked because your meter registers better if necessary now you can run the arc process it eats havingness so when he cycles into pt or has good cognition acknowledge the hell out of it and run havingness youll get bd of that tight ta and can go on and run the arc process better and longer and faster running havingness helps the pc give up his old havingness of old pictures you are getting him to realize that there is other havingness the common denominator of all goals terminals is games and the common denominator of all games is cant have keep it remedied or you will get games condition
