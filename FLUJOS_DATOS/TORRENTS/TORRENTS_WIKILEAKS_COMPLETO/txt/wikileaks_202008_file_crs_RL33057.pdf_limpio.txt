series of extensions during the reauthorization process certain environmental issues garnered significant attention from both members of congress and interested stakeholders eg state transportation agencies tran sportation constructi on organizations and environmental groups this attention was due to both the impact that surface transportation projects can have on the environment and possibly the costs associated with addressing those impacts and the impact that compliance with environmental requirements can have on project delivery safetea includes variety of envi ronmental provisions generally they authorize funding to eliminate control mitigate or minimize environmental impacts associated with surface transportation progra ms or projects funding was authorized both for broad programs eg the congestion mitigati on and air quality improvement program and for specific type s of projects eg the purchase of clean fuel vehicles and programs to control noxious weeds funding levels for such activities generally increased in act ual dollars compared to tea21 the provisions also specify procedures that are intended to expedite compliance with certain environmental requirements the most attention and debate related to changes in the procedures dot must follo w to comply with the clean air acts conformity requirements with environmental review requirements of the national environmental policy act nepa and with dot requirements regarding the use of publicly owned parks refuges and historic sites known as section 4f requirements in particul ar 180day statute of

the safe accountable flexible and efficient transportation equity act of 2005 legacy for users safetealu or safetea the act reauthorizes federa l highway highway safety and transit programs also referred to generally as surface transportation programs undertaken by the us department of transportations dot federal highway administration fhwa and federal transit administr ation fta for fy20052009 the previous long term authorization f or fy1998 2003 the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 pl 105178 ex pired on september 30 2003 since then surface transportation programs operated as result of 11 extension acts the delay in reauthorization had to do primarily with issues regarding how much money would be authorized and how transportation funds would be distributed among the states1 certain environmental issues also garnered significant attention and debate from both members of congress and interested stakeholders eg state transportation agencies transportation cons truction organizations and environmental groups this attention was due to bot h the impact that surface transportation projects can have on the environment and the impact that compliance with environmental requirements can have on project delivery safetea includes many provi sions regarding the environment generally the provisions do one of two things first they authorize funding to eliminate control mitigate or minimize certain environmen tal impacts associated with surface transportation programs or projects exam ples include authorization of funding for the congestion mitigation and air quality cmaq program authorization of funding for clean fuel buses and authorization of funding for projects that would control noxious weeds2 second they specify procedures that would be required to be undertaken to comply with certain nvironmental requirements for example safetea includes provisions intended to streamline dots compliance with environmental review requi rements of the national environmental policy act nepa 42 usc 4321 et seq and ch ange the process for demonstrating conformity with elements of the cl ean air act 42 usc 7401 et

provisions that will change how dot complies with elements of nepa and the clean air act current requirements of each law sufficient to understand the provi sions of safetea are discussed also included is an overview of selected envir onmental provisions that create new or make changes to existing programs or procedur that are intended to mitigate or minimize the environmental impacts of surface transportation programs issues and legislation regarding environmental streamlining during the tea21 reauthorization pr ocess some state transportation departments and tran sportation construction organiza tions reported to congress that the process required to obtain various fe deral state and local environmental approvals and permits often needed for major highway projects was sometimes inefficiently implemented and overly timeconsuming in particular stakeholders expressed concern about the lack of eff ective interagency c ooperation when multiple federal or state agencies were required to participate in project congress attempted to address these concerns by including environmental streamlining provisions in tea21 although not defined by the statute fh wa defines environm ental streamlining as the timely delivery of fe derally funded tran sportation projects while protecting and enhancing the environment because major transportation projects may be affected by dozens of federal state and local environm ental requirements administered by multiple agencies improve d interagency coopera tion was identified by congress as critical element to the success of environmental streamlining the streamlining provisions of tea21 required the department of transportation dot to develop and implement coordinated environmental review process for highway projects that either do have or may have significant impact on the environment approximately 9 of all highway projects fall into one of these categories3 this coordinated review process encouraged fu ll and early participa tion by all relevant federal and state agencies required to participate in highway project since the passage of tea21 numerous administrative activities have been undertaken to facilitate st reamlining however so members of congress expressed the need for further legislati on to expedite the environmental review process required of highway construction and transit proj ects as result safetea includes provisions intended to further streamline the environmental review process discussed below are selected elements of the environmental revi ew process relevant to provisions in safetea and summary of legislative provisions that may be generally categorized as streamlining the provisions deal primarily with nepa but could also be used to expedite compliance with other environmental requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33057crs3 4 general accounting office highway infrastructure stakeholders views on time to conduct environmental revi ews of highway projects

the federal highway administration fhwa and the federal transit administration fta must demonstrate compliance with all applicable state and federal legal requirements regarding the environment including nepa nepa requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement eis for all major federal actions significantly affecting the environment an eis is full disclosure document that provides description of the proposed pr oject the existing environment and an analysis of the anticipated beneficial and adverse environmental effects of the proposed project and all reas onable alternatives prepara tion is done in two stages resulting in draft and final eis projects for which it is not initially clear whether impacts will be significant require the preparation of an environmenta l assessment ea if it is determined at any time during the ea that projects impacts will be significant an eis must be prepared however if the ea determines that the project creates significant environmental impact finding of significant impact fonsi will be issued by dot the fonsi must briefly present the reasons why the project will not have significant effect on the environment according to fhwa in fy2001 projects requiring an ea and subsequent f onsi accounted for approximately 6 of fhwafunded highway projects represen ting approximately 15 of the 176 billion in federal funding distributed to states in fy2001 approximately 3 of highway projects required an eis accountin g for just under 9 of fy2001 federal funding the remainder were categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare either an ea or an eis4 the council on environmental quality c eq in the executive office of the president promulgated regulations specifying nepa compliance procedures applicable to all federal agencies5 at ceqs direction dot promulgated its own regulations governing the preparation of eiss and rela ted environmental documentation required for fhwa and fta projects6 in addition to formal regulations dot has issued variet of guidance documents and technical advisories to assist decision makers in completing the nepa process for transportation projects7 nepa compliance fits into the overall project delivery process as subset of one or more of the following four major elements generally considered to be part of the full trans portation project delivery process preliminaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33057crs4 8 40 cfr 150816 9 23 cfr 771109c 10 23 cfr 771133engineering final or construction engi neering rightofway acquisition and construction interagency cooperation projects requiring nepa documentation involve the participation of lead agency and c ooperating agencies the lead agency is defined in ceq regulations as the federal agency that has taken responsibility for preparing the nepa documentation8 for federally funded highway and transit projects the lead agency will usually be dot specifically fhwa or fta the project applicant such as state dot w ill likely participate in the nepa process as joint lead agency the project applicant is required to initially develop substantive portions of the environmental document while dot is responsible for its scope and content9 dot requires that the eis demonstrate that appropriate comments and coordination were solicited from relevant federal st ate and local cooperating agencies cooperating agencies are required to participate in the nepa process when requested by the lead agency if they are obligated to provide comments within their agencys jurisdiction expertise or authority this means that an agency with jurisdiction over or expertise regarding any identified envir onmental consequence anticipated from project is required to pr ovide dot with the ppropriate input for example if historical and archeological preservation consequen ces are identified the advisory council on historic preservation or the state hi storic preservation officer will likely be included as cooperating agency during the environmental review process if farmland impacts are identifie d the eis should summarize the results of comments and analyses from the us depa rtment of agriculture usda and as appropriate state and local agriculture agencies for any given transportation project compliance with wide variety of legislative and regulatory requirements requiring the participation of multiple agencies may be required dot regulations require that the final eis or the fonsi document compliance with all applicable environmental laws executive orders and other related requirements10 depending upon the complexity of the project or resources impacted significant number of environmental requirements in addition to nepa may be applicable according to fhwa legal requirements frequently applicable to highway proj ects are contained in the endangered species act of 1973 16 usc 1531 et seq national historic pr eservation act 16 usc 460 et seq clean water act 33 usc 1251 et seq and section 4fof the department of transportation act of 1966 40 usc 303 see section 4f requirements for public parks and historic sites section below httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33057crs5 11 it is dot policy that compliance with all applicable environmental requirements be coordinated under the nepa umbrella this means that for any given transportation project any study review or consultation re quired by law that is related to the environment should be conducted within the framework of the nepa process 12 the task force was established under executive order 13274 environmental stewardship and transportation infrastru cture project review available at httpwwwfhwadotgovstewardshipeoindexhtm as of september 3 2005 13 text of secretary minetas may 6 2003 letter and chairman connaughtons may 12 2003 response are available at http wwwfhwadotgovstewardshipeominetamay6htm as of september 3 2005for the requirements listed above the u s fish and wildlife service the advisory council on historic pr eservation the us army corps of engineers or the environmental protection agency epa may be required to participate in the nepa process as cooperating agency that partic ipation may take such forms as providing comments on dot documentation performing sc ientific analysis issuing permits or providing an assessment of project impacts11 the role of cooperating agency is frequently set out in memorandum of agreement with the lead ag ency that agreement may i nvolve the cooperating agency drafting certain portions of the eis that rela to its jurisdiction or expertise for example if highway project has the potential to impact pr ime farmland usda may agree to provide fhwa with an analysis of those impacts project purpose and need and alternatives as required under both ceq and dot regulations the eis must include statement clarifying the projects purpose and need this section of an eis is the foundation upon which subsequent sections of the eis are built dot requires the discussion to be clear and specific and support the need for the project further it is the purpose and need section that drives the selection of the range of alternatives that will be considered and analyzed for given project ceq regulations re quire agencies to discuss range of alternatives that will include all reasonable alternatives under consideration as well as any other alternatives that were considered but subsequently eliminated from consideration reasonable alternatives include those that are practical or feasible from the technical and economic standpoint and using common sense rather than simply desirable from the standpoint of the agency or potentially affected stakeholder the alternatives must so include action alternative eg shortterm safety and maintenance improvements that may serve as baseline against which build alternatives are compared in his capacity as the chairman of the interagency transportation infrastructure streamlining task force12 transportation secretary norm an mineta sought guidance from ceq chairman james connaughton regard ing the role of lead and cooperating agencies with regard to developing highway projects purpose and need13 secretary mineta referred to the sometimes extended interagency debates over purpose and need statements as reason fo r delay in highway

further chairman connaughton referenced previous federal cour t decisions giving deference to the lead agency in determining projects purpos and need while not addressed in this correspondence ceq regulations also specify the selection of reasonable alternatives as within the authority of the lead agency designation of categor ical exclusions transportation projects that do not individually or cumulatively have significant social economic or environmental effect and which dot s determined from past experience with similar projects have significant impact are excluded from the requirement to prepare an ea or eis such actions are processed as categorical exclusions in fy2001 almost 91 of all fhwa project s were classified as categorical exclusions14 common misconception is that such projects are categorically excluded from compliance with nepa such projects do require certain level of nepa compliance but are excluded from the requirement to prepare an ea or eis unlike eas or eiss categorical exclusions are not type of document but are classes of dot actions that may be in effect pr eapproved for example transportation enhancements often fall into this category of action15 dot regulations specify two groups of cat egorical exclusions whether or what type of documentation may be necessary to demonstrate compliance will depend upon into which of the two groups the proj ect falls the first group includes projects that call for or limited construction16 examples include the construction of bicycle and pedestrian lanes landscaping emergency repairs nd the installation of pavement markings or traffic signals th second group consists of actions with higher potential for impacts than the firs t group but which are generally determined to meet the criteria for categorical exclusion because environmental impacts are minor17 an example of such project is th modernization of highway through resurfacing reconstruction adding shoulders or dding auxiliary lanes since the second group of actions has higher potential for impacts than the first dot may require that the state or local project sponsor provide analyses or documentation to allow dot to determine if the categorical exclusion designation is proper further although categorica lly excluded projects environmental impacts may not be significant as defined unde r nepa requirements of other laws mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33057crs7 18 section 4f of the dot act was originally set forth at 49 usc 1653f and applies to all dot projects similar provision f ound at 23 usc 138 applies specifically to federalaid highways in 1983 as part of ge neral recodification of the dot act 49 usc 1653f was formally repealed and codified in 49 usc 303 with slightly different language this provision longer falls unde r section 4f but dot has continued this reference given that over the years the whol body of provisions policies and case law has been collectively referenced as section 4f 19 for more information on issues related to streamlining see crs report rl32024 background on nepa implementation for highway projects streamlining the process still apply for example the installation of traffic signals is generally considered an action with environmental impacts however if those traffic signals will be installed in historic district complian ce with provisions of the national historic preservation act may apply or if the proposed route of bicycle path borders endangered species habitat biological assessment in compliance with the endangered species act may be required section 4f requirements for public parks and historic sites another requirement that is generally ca rried out within the context of the nepa process is compliance with section 4f of the department of transportation act of 196618 section 4f requirements apply to the use of publicly owned parks and recreation areas wildlife and waterfowl refu ges and to publicly or privately owned historic sites of nati onal state or local significance the law prohibits the use of section 4f resource for transportation project unless there is prudent and feasible alternative to do otherwise nd the project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the resource when project does propose the use of section 4 f resource separate section 4f evaluation must be prepared and included with the appropriate nepa documentation the evaluation must analyze alte rnatives and design shifts that avoid the protected resource if section 4f land is subsequently chosen for use in project the evaluation must demonstrate that the use of other alternatives would have resulted in unique problems unique problems ar present when there are truly unusual factors or when the costs or community disruption reach extraordinary magnitude this test was introduced in citizens to pr eserve overton park v volpe 401 us 402 1971 and subsequently referred to as ove rton park criteria safetea provisions regarding nepa and section 4f unlike tea 21 the term streamlining is not used in safetea however the intended effect is the same to expedite compliance with certain environmental requirements primarily nepa and section 4f with regard to nepa many of the provisions in safetea codify existing regulatory requirements such as specifically designating dot as the lead agency for surface transportation project s specifying the role of the lead and cooperating agencies and allowing deadlines for decisionmaking to be set19 following are key safetea provisions related to streamlining that change existing

process the establishment of dispute resolution process when agencies disagree on elements of the nvironmental review process authorization to allow states to determine whether certain classes of projects may be processed as categorical exclusions and authorization to allow the establishment of state pilot programs to allow participating states to assume certain federal responsib ilities regarding compliance with environmental laws with regard to section 4f the law is amended to allow the use of section 4f resources if it is established that such use results in minimis impacts to the

initial sips and subsequent revisions to epa for approval the attainment of naaqs and the developm ent of sips are relevant to surface transportation issues for variety of r easons for example transportation agencies must consider sip goals in developing long and shortterm transportation plans also whether or not federal funds will be made available for surface transportation project may
