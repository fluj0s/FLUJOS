eg resident salaries teaching supervision and 2 indirect graduate medical education or ime eg higher patient care costs because of additional tests ordered by residents there are federal reporting requirements to document medicaid gme payments by states survey data show that such costs federal and state totaled nearly 32 billion in 2005 representing 7 of medicaid inpatient hospital expenditures nationwide in may 2007 the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms issued proposed rule that would eliminate federal reimbursement for both dgme and ime under medicaid the rule would also change the way in which the medicaid upper payment limit for hospital services is calculated which would further reduce the federal share of medicaid costs for hospitals federal savings from the

following graduation from schools of medicine osteopathy dentistry and podiatry all states require residency training to be licensed most states require three years of such training the residents who are serving form of apprenticeship provide patient care under the supervision of teaching physician primarily in teaching hospitals gme costs are difficult to determine because teaching occurs in the context of patient care and research there are direct gme dgme costs which include residents stipends payments to supervising physicians and direct program administration costs1 there are also indirect gme ime costs associated with the higher patient care costs in teaching hospitals resulting from treating sicker patients using more diagnostic tests and longer patient stays under prospective payment systems pps which do not pay entities for each test or procedure performed 2 an explicit adjustment payment increase for ime is sometimes viewed as necessary medicare and in some states medicaid make explicit payments to teaching hospitals for their gme costs3 federal appropriations under the public health service act support primary care residency programs and other health professional education as well as support for childrens teaching hospitals other sources of funding in clude research grants endowments and foundation grants the department of veterans affairs and department of defense also support residency positions4 the flow of funds among those involved in gme is complex and frequently involves crosssubsidies between medical schools teac hing hospitals and other training sites

medicaid pays for wide variety of health care benefits for certain lowincome populations including inpatient hospital services in addition states have flexibility in designing medicaid service delivery systems and provider payment rates states may for example provide care through what is called the feeforservice ffs delivery system under ffs beneficiaries have unrestricted choice among medicaid participating providers and they are largely responsible for their own medical care management and coordination the state directly or through fiscal intermediary pays each participating provider for covered services received by medicaid beneficiary generally ffs payments to hospitals are based on prospective payment systems as described above medicaid managed care arrangements are significantly different from the ffs delivery system beneficiaries choose or are assigned to primary plan that provides care coordination and management traditional managed care plans such as health maintenance organizations hmos make available specified set of mostly preventive primary and acute care benefits for which 1 these dgme costs may be incurred by multiple entities including the program sponsor the faculty practice plan and the hospitals and ambulatory s ites that provide training 2 payment amounts per day or per case are fixed at the start of year and generally are not subject to retrospective adjustment on the basis of actual costs incurred 3 medicare spent about 6 billion in ime and 24 billion in dgme in 2007 state support for gme may also include appropriations to stateoperated medical schools or residency programs 4 the va maintains approximately 8800 or about 9 of all fulltime residency positions and is the nations largest provider of gme

capitation rate these rates typically reflect the average ffs cost of providing care to specified groups of plan beneficiaries in addition to these methods of paying providers for benefits covered under both the ffs and managed care delivery systems states make other supplemental payments to selected providers for example the medicaid statute requires th at states make disproportionate share dsh adjustments to the payment rates of hospitals treating large numbers of lowincome and medicaid patients federal statute specifies dsh allotments for each state states must define in their state medicaid plan hospitals qualifying as dsh hospitals and dsh payment formulas5 most states also make gme payments under medicaid such pa yments may be made directly to teaching hospitals similar to dsh payments as part of capitation rates under managed care or both

deral and state governments combined was approximately 273 billion almost 35 billion or 128 of total spending was for inpatient hospital services paid for through ffs additional payments related to inpatient hospital care under capitated managed care are not separately identifiable6 while there is formal federal reporting mechanism to document medicaid gme payments by state other survey data7 show that medicaid is major payer of gme for example in 2005 total state and federal medicaid payments for dgmeime were estimated to be nearly 32 billion on average medicaid dgmeime payments nationwide represented 7 of total medicaid inpatient hospital expenditures statespecific dgmeime proportions varied widely from less than 1 to more than 21 of inpatient hospital expenditures states made medicaid dgmeime payments under both the ffs and managed care delivery systems in 2005 for example 47 states made dgme andor ime ffs payments twentytwo states reimbursed for both dgme and ime under the ffs delivery system8 among the 36 states with capitated managed care programs 25 included dgme andor ime payment under such care arrangements states used different methods to distribute gmerelated payments to providers for example under the ffs delivery system 32 states that paid for dgmeime distributed those payments through hospitals per case or per diem reimbursement rates twenty states made separate direct payment to these institutions five states used both methods 5 for more information on dsh under medicaid see crs report 97483 medicaid disproportionate share payments by jean hearne 6 based on analysis of the cms medicaid datamart data downloaded on february 17 2008 data for maine were missing 7 in this report references to 2005 survey data are to information

rule that would make two specific changes affecting gme payments under medicaid 9 first it would eliminate all federal payments for dgme and explicit ime however states may otherwise recognize the higher costs of teaching hospitals through increased base payment rates or supplemental payments second the rule would also remove medicare dgme payments from the calculations that set the medicaid upper payment limit upl for hospital services in general medicaid payments for inpatient hospital services cannot in the aggregate and within three provider categories state government nonstate government and private exceed reasonable estimate of what medicare would pay for the same services medicare excludes dgme costs in the calculation of per discharge payment amounts for hospital services thus cms argued such costs are not appropriate in calculating medicaid payments either the proposed rule does not discuss gme in the context of medicaid waivers 10 the proposed rule retains the inclusion of medicare ime payments in the calculations that set the medicaid upl for hospital services because such ime payments are intended to reflect the higher per patient costs in teaching hospitals eg residents order more tests than experienced physicians the estimated federal savings for all of these changes under the proposed rule would total about 178 billion over the fy2008 through fy2012 period11 the rule would apply to all medicaid providers and must be implemented in the first full state fiscal year following the effective date of the subsequent final rule recent congressional study indicates that this rule would result in the loss of roughly 98 billion over the next five years in 36 states affected by the rule that could provide such estimates12

on medicaid gme payments published in may 2007 for example cms argued that in contrast to the medicare statute gme payments 9 medicaid program graduate medical education 72 federal register 28930 may 23 2007 10states have the flexibility to waive certain medicaid prog ram requirements to for example provide services to individuals not traditionally eligible limit benefit packages for certain groups and provide home and communitybased services to people with longterm care needs among other purposes the two primary provisions states use for these purposes are sections 1115 and 1915c of the social security act 11cbo estimates that the proposed rule on gme will reduce fe deral outlays by 08 billion over five years for such proposed rules cbo generally assigns weight of 50 in its baseline to reflect the uncertainties of the administrative process after regulation becomes final cbo fully incorporates the projected effects into the baseline after any applicable moratorium ends see

of services considered to be medical assistance in section 1905a of the medicaid statute and is not recognized in medicaid statute as component of the cost of medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital services cms noted that while medicaid dsh payments recognize the health service activities of certain hospitals gme is not health service cms also stated that it has statutory authority or other existing mechanism or data to track or monitor the efficiency and economy of gme payments raising concerns about the fiscal integrity of the medicaid program

hospital industry groups and associations have commented on the proposed medicaid gme rule13 these organizations note that this rule represents reversal of longstanding medicaid policy and that gme payments have previously been explicitly recognized by cms in addition concerns have been raised that cuts of this magnitude will jeopardize the financial condition of many teaching hospitals right when there is an impending physician shortage 14 at the winter meeting of the national governors association15 state officials justified gme payments because interns and residents provide great deal of care to medicaid beneficiaries some commenters noted that there are explicit references to gme payments in both medicaid statute and regulations that legitimize such payments under medicaid16 first section 1932b2 stipulates that nonmco providers that deliver emergency care to an mco beneficiary must accept as payment in full up to the maximum amount applicable in the ffs setting minus any gme payments second medicaid regulations 42 cfr 4386c5v indicate that if state makes direct gme payments to hospitals the state must adjust capitation rates for managed care to account for gme payments made on behalf of mco beneficiaries in both cases the provisions were intended to prevent duplicate gme payments under medicaid managed care in addition this regulatory provision which was added by cms in 2002 was intended to mirror requirements in medicare managed care as well as to jointly address state concerns about preventing harm to teaching hospitals and federal concerns about ensuring fiscal accountability for these payments at that time cms also signaled that it planned to study existing medicaid gme payment arrangements and might issue additional policies in the future 17 finally opponents of the proposed gme rule have also noted that for example 1 prior approval by cms of medicaid state plan amendments spa s specifying coverage of gme constitutes an 13see cozen and oconner
