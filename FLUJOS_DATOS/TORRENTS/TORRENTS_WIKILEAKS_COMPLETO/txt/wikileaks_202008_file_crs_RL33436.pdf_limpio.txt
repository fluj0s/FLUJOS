been an anchor of the us security role in east asia the alliance with its access to bases in japan where about 53000 us troops are stationed facilitates the forward deployment of us military forces in the asiapacific thereby undergirding us national security strategy for japan the alliance and the us nuclear umbrella provide maneuvering room in dealing with its neighbors particularly china and north korea the bush administration initially made significant strides in its goals of broadening usjapan strategic cooperation and encouraging japan to assume more active international role following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks japan made its firstever military deployments in noncombat support of us and allied forces in afghanistan in 2004 tokyo sent noncombat troops to iraq despite considerable domestic opposition in 2005 the united states and japan announced sweeping new agreement to strengthen military cooperation the plan calls for us forces to be realigned and japan to take on more active noncombat role in maintaining regional and global security political turmoil in tokyo threatens to slow some of this progress in security relations the ruling partys historic defeat in upper house elections in july 2007 and the abrupt resignations of both shinzo abe and yasuo fukuda from the prime minister post has shaken the traditional power structure in japan new premier taro aso has cl ung to power while watching his approval ratings dip increasingly lower when parliamentary elections are eventually held an emboldened opposition party may take control of the government as result of this uncertainty some of the earlier defense relations platform may be placed on hold if political jockeying weakens tokyos focus on usjapan relations as an aging japanese population demands more attention to domestic economic issues the usjapan relationship may struggle to regain the momentum enjoyed in the early part of the decade japan is one of the united states most important economic partners outside of north america it is the united states second largest export market and secondlargest source of imports japanese firms are the united states secondlargest source of foreign direct investment and japanese investors are the second largest foreign holders of us treasuries helping to finance the us deficit and reduce upward pressure on us interest rates bilateral trade friction has decreased in recent years partly because us concern about the trade deficit with japan has been replaced by concern about much larger deficit with china the exception was us criticism over japans decision in 2003 to ban imports of us beef which have since resumed however the economic problems in japan and united states associated with the credit crisis both countries are now in

parliament and weak premiership continue to hamper japanese policymaking complicating policy coordination with the united states and other countries since july 2007 the two chambers of japans diet have been controlled by different parties the more powerful lower house is controlled by the rulin g liberal democratic party ldp and smaller coalition partner the ldp has ruled japan almost continuously since 1955 the upper house is controlled by coalition led by the opposition democratic party of japan dpj which took over the chamber after its stunning defeat of the ldp in july 2007 upper house elections since then the two rival parties have been unable and or unwilling to form cooperative relationship leading to paralysis on many major policy issues this is the first time in japans modern history that it has experienced divided government current prime minister taro asos political standing has progressively weakened since the ldp chose him to be premier in september 2008 following the sudden resignation of his predecessor yasuo fukuda fukuda left office in the hopes that more popular successor could stabilize the ruling partys fortunes at the time aso was japans most popular politician and there was widespread expectation that he would capitalize on this standing in the early fall by calling snap election for the lower house the more powerful of japans two legislative chambers by law japan must hold lower house election by september 2009 however thus far aso has fared worse than fukuda by the end of december the aso cabinets approval ratings had plunged below 20 confidence in aso has been damaged by series of verbal gaffes and widespread perceptions of policy incoherence particularly on dealing with japans sinking economy which has been hit rd by the global recession for the first time dpj leader ichiro ozawa tops aso in headtohead polls the prospect of losing power for only the second time in 54 years is causing disarray in side the ldp further adding to the turmoil in tokyo

despite the political dysfunction the ruling party managed to extend the special legislation that allows the japanese marine self defense forces to provide refueling support to coalition forces for military operations in afghanistan although the upper house rejected the measure the lower house then overruled the veto and enacted the legislation on december 12 the mission will be extended for another year starting on january 15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33436g12g138g153g138g151g556g23g495g21g495g561g20g142g149g138g157g146g152

beef dispute on security issues members expressed concern that steps taken by the japanese government are harming us interests in east asia by worsening sinojapanese and south koreanjapanese relations former chairman of the house international relations committee henry hyde suggested in an april 2006 letter to speaker dennis hastert that prime minister koizumi should not address joint session of congress unless he pledged to stop visiting yasukuni shrine which enshrines the names of several class war criminals from world war ii and convened hearing on japans history problem in september 2006 the comfort women controversy in the 110 th congress reignited congressional concern about revisionist views of history in japan in september 2007 the house passed hres 121 calling on the government of japan to formally acknowledge apologize and accept historical responsibility in clear and unequivocal manner for its treatment of women forced to serve as prostitutes for the japanese military during its colonization and occupation of asia in the 1930s and 1940s the resolution passed by voice vote and attracted 167 cosponsors reportedly driven in part by june 2007 washington post advertisement signed by several japanese legislators and academics rejecting the historical basis of the resolution few days later the house also passed hres 508 which praised the usjapan alliance and japans contributions to the effort against international terrorism the bill was seen as an attempt to blunt the negative diplomatic impact of the former resolution the question of historical truth and

of september 11 2001 the government of former prime minister junichiro koizumi initiated series of unprecedented measures to protect american facilities in japan and provide non lethal rear area logistical support to us military operations against qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan the latter mainly took the form of atsea replenishment of fuel oil and water to us british french and other allied warships operating in the indian ocean the dispatch of japans maritime self defense forces msdf was the first such deployment since world war ii small flotilla of japanese transport ships oilers and destroyers provided about 30 of the fuel used by us and allied warships and japans air selfdefense force asdf conducted hundreds of airlift support missions for us forces after suspension due to political opposition in 2007 the refueling mission has been renewed twice

resolving the usbritish confrontation with iraq japan nonetheless gave almost unqualified support to the bush administrations position during an open debate in the security council japan was one of only two out of 27 participating countries the other being australia to support the us contention that even if the inspections were strengthened and expanded they were unlikely to lead to the elimination of iraqs weapons of mass destruction since 2003 japan has provided 15 billion in grant assistance to iraq has pledged to provide 35 billion in yen loans and has agreed to phased cancellation of 80 of the approximately 75 billion in debt iraq owed japan in addition in january 2004 the koizumi government deployed about 600 military personnel mainly ground troopsto carry out humanitarian aid and reconstruction activities in iraq the ground troops were withdrawn from the southern area of samawah in junejuly 2006 but the air division of the self defense forces the official name of japans military has expanded its mission of airlifting multinational troops and their supplies from kuwait into iraq the lower house of the diet approved twoyear extensio n of the air force transport mission in may 2007 but subsequently japan ended its participation in iraq in late 2008 as authorization for multinational forces in iraq expired 1 this section was written by emma

reach deal on denuclearization with north korea in the sixparty talks distance has emerged between washington and tokyo former prime minister abe rose to prominence based on his hardline position on pyongyangs responsibility to disclose the fate andor whereabouts of several japanese citizens abducted by north korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s2 japan pledged that it would not provide economic aid to north korea without resolution of the abductees issue us chief negotiator christopher hill and president bush have given rhetorical support for japans position but have also indicated that the

substantially different position from the ldp although some japanese officials and media figures privately acknowledge that japan may need to compromise in order to remain relevant in the ongoing

1990s and in the first few years of this decade changed the general us perception of japan as an economic threat to one of country with problems the rise of china as an economic power has caused us policymakers to shift attention from japan to china as source of concern the increased use by both japan and the united states of the wto as forum for resolving trade disputes has politicized disputes and helped to reduce friction and the emphasis in the bilateral relationship has shifted from economic to security matters however the economic problems in japan and united states associated with the credit crisis both countries are now in recessions and how the two countries deal with those problems will likely dominate the their bilateral economic agenda for the foreseeable future one analysis projects that japan will experience two years of negative growth after having enjoyed six years of economic growth this trend will likely curtail japanese demand for imports in addition the value yen has hit 13year highs in terms of the us dollar which will adversely affect japanese exports to the united states and other countries contributing to the downturn in japanese economic growth the united

japanese officials notified their us counterparts that japan is considering allowing imports of us beef from cattle up to 30 months of age the governments recommendation would have to be approved by

elections but loses its 23 majority 23 majority in the lower house is needed to override an upper house vote dpj victory while signifying the emergence of true twoparty system in japan could usher in period of fundamental adjustment to policies that have remained static for decades under the ldp another possibility is the forma tion of agrand coalition between the ldp and the dpj an idea that

reversal from the dpjs showing in the 2005 lower house elections when the dpj lost more than one third of its strength with this win the dpj hopes to build on its earlier progress in several elections in the early part of the decade the dpj steadily increased its strength in the diet by winning over reformminded ur ban and independent voters in the september 2005 election however many of these

japan shall maintain armed forces for self defense that operate under the prime minister and are subject to the diets approval and direction the explicit mention of military force is designed to rectify the disconnect between the current constitutionwhich says that land sea and air forces as well as other war potential will never be maintainedand the reality that japan possesses self defense
