twopart opinion transformed federal criminal sentencing by restoring to judges much of the discretion that congress took away when it put mandatory sentencing guidelines in place in the first opinion the court held that the current mandatory sentencing guidelines violated defendants sixth amendment right to trial by jury by giving judges the power to make factual findings that increased sentences beyond the maximum that the jurys finding alone would support in the second part different majority concluded that the constitutional deficiency could be remedied if the guidelines were treated as discretionary or advisory rather than mandatory as result of the decisions the court struck down provision in law that made the federal sentencing guidelines mandatory as well as provision that permitted appellate review of departures from the guidelines in essence the high courts ruling gives federal judges discretion in sentencing offenders by not requiring them to adhere to the guidelines rather the guidelines can be used by judges on an advisory basis historically the way in which convicted offenders are sentenced falls under one of two penal policiesindeterminate and determinate sentences indeterminate sentencing practices were predominant for several decades leading up to the major reform efforts undertaken by many states and the federal government in the midto late 1970s and early 1980s the perceived failure of the indeterminate system to cure the criminal coupled with renewed concern about the rising crime rate throughout the nation in the mid1970s resulted in wide experimentation with sentencing systems by many states and the creation of sentencing guidelines at the federal level in 1984 congress passed sentencing reform measure which abolished indeterminate sentencing at the federal level and created determinate sentencing structure through the federal sentencing guidelines the sentencing reform act of 1984 reformed the federal sentencing system by 1 dropping rehabilitation as one of the goals of punishment 2 creating the us sentencing commission and charging it with establishing sentencing guidelines 3 making all federal sentences determinate and 4 authorizing appellate review of sentences in light of the court ruling in booker and subsequent cases the issue for congress is whether to amend current law to require federal judges to follow guided sentences or permit federal judges to use their discretion in sentencing under certain circumstances congressional options include 1 maintain the sentencing guidelines by specifying mandatory minimum sentences and increasing the top of each guideline range to statutory maximum for specified offenses hence codify specified sentencing ranges that are in the guidelines 2 require jury trials for any enhancement factor that would increase the sentence for which the defendant did not waive his or her rights or 3 take action thus permitting judicial discretion in sentencing in cases where congress has not specified mandatory sentences httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32766g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g21g142g151g157g142g151g140g146g151g144g561g9g158g146g141g142g149g146g151g142g156g497

2005 the us supreme court ruled that the sixth amendment right to trial by jury requires that the current federal sentencing guidelines be advisory rather than mandatory1 in doing so the court struck down provision in law that made the federal sentencing guidelines mandatory2 as well as provision that permitted appellate review of departures from the guidelines3 in essence the courts ruling gives federal judges discretion in sentencing offenders by not requiring them to adhere to the guidelines rather the guidelines can be used by judges on an advisory basis4 as result of the ruling judges now have discretion in sentencing defendants unless the offense carries mandatory sentence as specified in law while some may view the ruling as an opportunity for federal judges to take into consideration the circumstances unique to each individual offender thus handing down sentence that better fits the offender others fear that federal sentencing will give way to unwarranted disparity and inconsistencies across jurisdictions 5 the court has begun to clarify some of the lingering questions regarding the amount of weight to be given to the guidelines and what standards appellate courts should use in accessing the reasonableness of particular sentence in light of these rulings the issue for congress is whether to amend current law to require federal judges to follow guided sentences hence codify specified sentencing ranges that are in the guidelines or to continue the status quo and permit federal judges to use their discretion in sentencing under certain circumstances the issue that brought the matter before the court was judges obligation to move from one guideline maximum to higher one based on the judges factual determination the court examined whether the sixth amendment is violated by the imposition of an enhanced sentence under the united states sentencing guidelines ussg based on the sentencing judges determination of fact other than prior conviction that was not found by the jury or admitted by the defendant 6 this report provides legal analysis of the court rulings leading up to and including booker as well as subsequent rulings the report then provides background information on the federal sentencing guidelines in doing so the report provides summary of us penal policy paying particular attention to such policy at the federal level the report then discusses legislation enacted in 1984 that created the current federal sentencing structure next the different types of sentencing guidelines including the one that was approved by congress that was the basis for the recent us supreme court decision are discussed the report then provides an analysis of 1 see united states v booker 543 us 220 2005 2 according to the ruling provision in current law makes the guidelines binding on all judges the provision 18 usc 3553b requires courts to impose sentence within the applicable guidelines range 3 see 18 usc 3742e 4 while the court struck down provision that made the federal sentencing guidelines mandatory the court also noted that current law requi res judges to take acc ount of the guidelines together with other sentencing goals see 18 usc 3553a the court also struck down provision that permitted appellate review of sentences that were imposed as result of judges departure from the guidelines the court noted however that current law continues to provide for appeals from sentencing decisions irrespective of whether the trial judge sentences within or outside the guidelines range see 18 usc 3742ab 5 see for

series of cases the us supreme court has held that given the sixth amendment right to trial by jury judges cannot impose sentences beyond the prescribed statutory maximum unless the facts supporting such an increase are found by jury beyond reasonable doubt7 in apprendi v new jersey apprendi 8 the court held that except in the case of recidivists9 judge could not sentence criminal defendant to term of imprisonment greater than the statutory maximum assigned to the crime for which he had been convicted by the jury most recently in blakely v washington blakely10 the court held that washington states sentencing guidelines violated the sixth amendments guarantee of trial by jury in criminal cases washington state guidelines allowed judges rather than juries to make certain findings of fact that increased an offenders sentence the court found that the statutory maximum for apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant in other words the relevant statutory maximum is not the maximum sentence judge may impose after finding additional facts but the maximum he may impose without any additional facts 11 after blakely federal courts were immediately faced with arguments that the ussg also violated the sixt h amendment the courts were divided sharply on this issue12

sentencing guidelines in united states v booker booker in booker the defendants were each convicted of controlled substances offenses in both cases application of the ussg would require sentencing within ranges beyond those supported by the verdict alone in bookers case 30 years to life rather than 17 to 21 years and in fanfans case 15 to 16 years rather than five to six years the court unanimously agreed on the notion that discretionary sentencing guidelines would not implicate defendants sixth amendment right13 applying its decisions in apprendi and blakely the court14 held that any 7 see ring v arizona 536 us 584 2002holding that an aggravating circumstance that makes defendant eligible for death sentence is the functional equivalent of an element of an offense for purposes of the sixth amendment right to jury trial and therefore must be found by jury 8 520 us 466 2000 9 recidivist is an exoffender who has either committed ne w crime or has violated the terms of his or

sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by plea of guilty or jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to jury beyond reasonable doubt the court reasoned that the sentencing guidelines direct judge in some instances to enhance sentences in manner which violates this principle this violation occurs when judge makes certain factual findings supported by preponderance of the evidence15 to enhance sentence beyond the range otherwise authorized by the jurys verdict or the defendants admissions in rejecting the governments arguments to blakely s applicability to the federal sentencing guidelines guidelines the court found that the guidelines were developed by the united states sentencing commission rather than by congress constitutionally insignificant16 moreover the court found that blakelys application to the guidelines was not precluded or contradicted by recent cases dealing with other issues including perjury17 and the double jeopardy clause18 finally the court noted that separation of powers argument was precluded by its decision in mistretta v united states19 in the first opinion the court sought to restore the jurys significance in its finding of the underlying crime20 however in the remedial portion of the decision the majority gave judges more discretion in sentencing with justice ginsburg joining the four dissenting judges from the first part justices breyer oconnor kennedy and chief justice rehnquist the court held unconstitutional two provisions of the sentencing reform act sra 18 usc 3553b1 which makes the guidelines mandatory and 18 usc 3742e which sets forth standards of review for appeals of departures from the mandatory guidelines 21 to reach this conclusion the majority evaluated the likely effect of the constitutional requirement on the sras language history and basic purpos in other words the court answered the continued explain how changing the mandatory nature of the guidelines to discretionary cures the constitutional deficiency 14 this opinion of the court in part was delivered by justice stevens who was joined by justices scalia souter thomas and ginsburg 15 preponderance of the evidence is the greater weight of the evidence superior evidentiary weight that through not sufficient to free the mind wholly from all reasonable doubt is still sufficient to incline fair and impartial mind to one side of the issue rather than the other bryan garner editor blacks law dictionary second edition st paul mn west group 2001 16 booker at 238 the dissenters in part justice breyer chief justice rehnquist and justices oconnor and kennedy found that blakely should not apply to the federal sentencing guidelines as they are not statutes nor represent elements of crime but rather are sentencing facts 17 united states v dunnigan 507 us 87 1993 holding that the provisions of the guidelines that require sentence enhancement if the judge determines that the defendant committed perjury do not violate the privilege of the accused to testify on her own behalf 18 see witte v united states 515 us 389 1995 holding that the double jeopardy clause did not bar prosecution for conduct that had provided the basis for an enhancement of the defendants sentence in prior case 19 488 us 361 1989 concluding that even though the commission performed political rather than adjudicatory functions congress did not exceed its constitutional limitations in creating the commission 20 booker at 237 stating that the new sentencing practice forced the court to address the question of how the right of jury trial could be preserved in meaningful way guarant eeing that the jury would still stand between the individual and the power of the government under the new sentencing regime 21 the solution urged by justice stevens with but three of his colleagues would be to avoid constitutional infirmities by allowing juries to decide the facts that have guideline consequences the court found that the remainder of the sra is constitutional can function independently and is consistent with congress basic objectives in enacting the sra

courts constitutional holding the supreme court based its decision to delete the mandatory requirement of the guidelines on the supposition that given the choice congress would not have enacted mandatory system modified to accommodate blakely 22 this majority considered three options 1 invalidating the act in its entirety 2 engrafting the sixth amen dment jury trial requirement and 3 severance and excision of the offending parts of the sra the breyer majority opined that congress would have preferred the total invalidation of the act to an act with the courts sixth amendment requirement engrafted onto it 23 in addition it concluded that congress would have preferred the excision of some of the act namely the acts mandatory language to the invalidation of the entire act24 the breyer majority noted that severance and excision was closer to congress intended system by maintaining strong connection between the sentence imposed and the offenders real conduct 25 as such the court concluded that 18 usc 3553b1 and 18 usc 3742e should be severed and excised to match congress intent of increased uniformity of sentencing the court called upon congress to decide whether its declaration of judicial discretion merits legislative action26 possible issue arising under booker involves the degree of deference the advisory guidelines command at one end of the spectrum is the view embodied in united states v wilson wilson27 in which the judge flatly decreed that he will follow the guidelines and impose their prescribed sentence in all but the most exceptional cases 28 at the opposite end is the view reflected in united states v ranum ranum29 where the judge elected to treat the guidelines as just one of number of sentencing factors spelled out in 18 usc 3553a including the defendants history and characteristics30 applied to ranum sympathetic defendant with compelling personal qualities appealing family circumstances and strong proof in mitigationthis approach yielded year and day sentence where the guidelines called for 37 to 46 months 31 third perspective 22 booker at 249 stating that several considerations convince us that were the courts constitutional requirement added onto the sra as currently written the requirement would so transform the scheme that congress created that congress likely would not have intended the act as so modified to stand 23 ibid at 248 24 ibid the dissenters opined that if the constitutional problem was violation of the right to trial by jury the solution should also lay with the jury to require

point generally the question of retroactivity turns on whether the court announced new rule and whether the new rule is substantive in which case it may apply retroactively or procedural in which case it would not apply retroactively unless it qualified as watershed41 the summerlin court concluded that its previous decision in ring v arizona holding that any increase in defendants authorized punishment contingent on the finding of fact including eligibility for the death penalty must be found by jury beyond reasonable doubt 42 cannot be treated as new substantive rule rule that alters the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes43 as such the summerlin court held that ring is not retroactive on collateral review in mcreynolds v united states44 lower court found that booker like apprendi and ring must be treated as procedural decision for purposes of retroactivity analysis45 as such the court concluded that booker does not apply retroactively to criminal cases that became final before its release on january 12 2005 due to the severance of 18 usc 3553b1 and 18 usc 3742e46 district courts are not bound to apply the guidelines however they must consult

appellate courts should undertake the reasonableness review of lower courts sentencing decision mr rita was convicted of perjury making false statements and obstructing justice presentencing report calculated the applicable guideline range of 3341 months after hearing sentencing arguments from both sides the judge imposed sentence of 33 months on appeal the defendant argued that his 33month sentence was unreasonable because 1 it did not adequately take into account the defendants history and characteristics and 2 it is greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of the sentencing set forth in 18 usc 3553a2 the fourth circuit stated that sentence imposed within properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable as such the court rejected mr ritas arguments and upheld the sentence the issue before the supreme court was whether presumption of reasonableness should apply to sentence within the federal sentencing guidelines justice breyer writing for the court 50 held that an appellate court may view the guideline range as presumptively reasonable although the presumption is nonbinding51 the plurality also concluded that the guidelines are rightly owed presumption of reasonableness as the guidelines embody the culmination of an academic effort to craft ranges which accurately reflect the severity of the charged conduct while balancing statutory considerations and seeking uniformity and predictability in sentences52 however according to the court this presumption is applicable only on appellate review53 as such sentencing judge is apparently forbidden from using similar presumption that the guideline sentence is correct or reasonable one54 rather the sentencing judge after determining the guideline range may decide that the guideline sentence should not apply perhaps because as the guidelines themselves foresee the case at hand falls outside the heartland to which the commission intends individual guidelines to apply ussg 5k20 perhaps because the guidelines sentence itself fails properly to reflect 3553a considerations or perhaps the case warrants different sentence regardless see rule 32f thus the sentencing court subjects

district judges posses under booker and stated that they may impose nonguideline sentences by departing or applying 3553a however the court also stressed the importance of providing reasons for the sentencing decision56 these reasons may be brief when sentencing judge imposes guideline sentence however the sentencing judge must respond when party contests the guidelines sentence generally under 3553a that is argues that the guidelines reflect an unsound judgment or for example that they do not generally treat certain defendant characteristics in proper wayor argues for departure 57 while the guidelines can be considered reasonable as starting point for appellate review the plurality cautions that this should not be interpreted to be obligatory58 justice stevens in concurrence signed by justice ginsburg in part appears to pick up on this point and seeks to draw distinction between the process described in rita and prior practices that were deemed unconstitutional in apprendi and booker 59 justice souter the lone dissenter in the case appears to be concerned that affording the guideline range presumption of reasonableness moves the federal sentencing system back in the direction of the prior mandatory scheme that was found unconstitutional in booker and is incongruous with the 6th amendment protections outlined in apprendi 60 in the aftermath of this decision it appears that while it is permissible for appellate courts to apply nonbinding presumption of reasonableness to withinguidelines sentences questions linger as to what factors the appellate courts may or should consider to overcome the presumption moreover given that the court appa rently approved only one method of reviewing sentences questions remain as to other methods the court might approve and whether the acceptable methods of appellate review apply in other instances where sentences are not within guideline range in two recent decisions gall v united states 61 and kimbrough v united states 62 the court provided additional clarification to both sentencing and appellate courts as to crafting and 56 id at 2468 57 id 58 id at 2464 stating that nonbinding appellate presumption that

consider all of the factors listed in 3553a and to apply them to the individual defendants before them appellate courts must then give deference to the sentencing decisions made by those judges whether the resulting sentence is inside or outside the advisory guide lines range under traditional abuseofdiscretion principles as the court acknowledges moreover presumptively reasonable does not mean always reasonable the presumption of course must be genuinely rebuttable 60 id at 2487 stevens j dissentingstating that but if sentencing judges attributed substantial gravitational pull to the nowdiscretionary guidelines if they treated the guidelines result as persuasive or presumptively appropriate the booker remedy would in practical terms preserve the very feature of the guidelines that threatened to trivialize the jury right for presumption of guidelines reasonableness would tend to produce guidelines sentences almost as regularly as mandatory guidelines had done with judges finding the facts needed for sentence in an upper subrange this would open the door to undermining apprend i itself and this is what has happened today 61 2007 wl 4292116 2007 62 2007 wl 4292040 2007

that judges may deviate from the guidelines without having to demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances required sentencing outside the guidelines63 gall while in college joined criminal enterprise to sell ecstasy64 gall withdrew from the enterprise and obtained steady employment and ultimately became successful entrepreneur65 approximately three years after withdrawing from the enterprise gall pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute ecstasy66 the guideline range from this crime was imprisonment between 30 to 37 months67 however the sentencing judge gave him 36 months on probation largely based on galls most recent behavior68 the eighth circuit reversed the decision on the ground that sentence outside the guidelines must be supported by extraordinary circumstances69 in 72 decision the court disagreed and held that the acceptable method of appellate review for all sentences whether inside just outside or significantly outside the guidelines range was deferential abuseofdiscretion standard justice stevens writing for the majority rejected presumption of unreasonableness for sentences outside the guidelines range as such the appellate court must first ensure that the sentencing court followed proper procedure to include correctly calculating the guidelines range and considering the 3553a factors with appropriate explanation70 the appellate court may consider the extent of any deviation from the guidelines range however the appellate court must give due deference to the district courts decision that the 3553a factors on whole justify the extent of the variance 71 the fact that an appellate court would have concluded different sentence was more appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court similarly in kimbrough v united states another 72 decision the court held that sentence outside the guidelines range is not per unreasonable when it is based on disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powered cocaine offenses 72 in reaching its decision the court found that the cocaine guidelines like all other guidelines are only advisory73 as such the cocaine guidelines are just one of the factors warranting consideration under 3553a when determining an appropriate sentence74 under relevant statutes kimbrough pleaded guilty to myriad of offenses including conspiracy to distribute crack and powder cocaine possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack possession with intent to distribute powder and possession of firearm in furtherance of drugtrafficking offense 75 kimbroughs plea subjected him

relevant 3553 factors in crafting its sentence th court noted that the district court homed in on the particular circumstances of kimbroughs ca and accorded weight to the us sentencing commissions consistent and emphatic position that the crackpowder disparity is at odds with 3553a78 as such the court found that reviewing court could not rationally conclude that the reduction kimbrough received qualified as an abuse of discretion79 taken together these cases arguably provide federal district court judges some discretion in crafting reasonable sentences regardless of whether the sentence falls within or outside the guidelines range it would appear that judges have more flexibility in determining sentences in drug cases as judges can disagree with the crack versus cocaine disparity

leading up to the major reform efforts undertaken by many states and the federal government in the midto late 1970s and early 1980s see discussion in the next section many states and the federal government have variations of determinate sentencing including sentencing guidelines some states however continue to operate under indeterminate sentencing early penal policy in the united states served the goals of retribution and punishment beginning in 1870 however rehabilitation became the focus of criminal sentencing which led to the adoption of an indeterminate sentencing system in the federal penal system at the time indeterminate sentencing was seen as the preferred mechanism to rehabilitate offenders which was the stated goal of punishment under the fe deral indeterminate sentencing scheme congress established the penalty range within which the judge imposed sentence typically after one third of the sentence was served parole board would determine if the offender had been rehabilitated and could be released from prison and placed on parole federal sentencing policy was reexamined by congress in the early 1970s and in 1973 proposal to revise the entire federal criminal code was introduced which ultimately included reform of the federal sentencing system 80 it wasnt until 1984 however that congress passed 76 id 77 id 78 id at 15 79 id this decision does not

defendants sentenced under an indeterminate sentencing scheme do not know the length of time they will serve at the federal level primary control over sentencing rested with the district court with few exceptions congress provided only maximum terms of incarceration for federal crimes while judges set the minimum sentence in individual cases and the us parole board decided when the offender was released at the state level range of sentences for particular crime is established according to statute eg 12 to 20 years and judge would sentence the defendant to that range the precise amount of time an offender serves however is left to prison officials usually parole board sentences were indeterminate because the actual length of time that would be served could not be determined at the time of sentencing indeterminate sentencing once viewed as major reform designed to individualize the treatment of offenders and facilitate rehabilitation came under attack because it was perceived as promoting unwarranted disparity in sentences as well as uncertainty of punishment critics contended that the unlimited judicial discretion without documented justification and review by an appellate court produced sentencing disparities 81 the perceived failure of the indeterminate system to cure the criminal usually measured by recidivism rates coupled with renewed concern about rising crime rates throughout the nation in the mid1970s resulted in experimentation with sentencing systems by several states and the creation of sentencing guidelines at the federal level despite these developments however indeterminate sentencing remains the predominate sentencing structure for most states although these laws are becoming increasingly determinate in structure by greater use of mandatory minimums truth in sentencing provisions and reduction in the amount of good time credits an inmate can earn while incarcerated 82 continued institute that document was refined during the following 10 years and in 1962 the institute published proposed official draft of model penal code in 1966 congress created national commission on reform of federal criminal laws the brown commission

sentencing policies the only alternative to indeterminate sentencing was determinate or fixed sentencing as sentencing policy evolved so did the scope of determinate sentencing for example beginning in the 1970s and continuing into the 1990s congress and many states passed legislation that revised sentencing laws and required in many cases the mandatory imprisonment of offenders for committing certain types of crimes in many instances such legislation required mandatory minimum term of imprisonment in addition to mandatory minimum laws congress and several states passed legislation that created sentencing commissions charged with establishing sentencing guidelines congress and some states also passed threestrikes provisions which usually required life sentence after the third strike and truthinsentencing measures which required an offender to serve large percentage of his or her sentence many of the current sentencing alternatives to indeterminate sentencing are variations of determinate sentencing there are usually explicit standards specifying the amount of punishment and set release date that is not subject to review by an administrative body ie parole board under determinate sentencing however time served can be reduced by good time or earned time both indeterminate and determinate sentencing practices have been criticized by many who believe that such practices lead to abuse by criminal justice officials and unwarranted disparities in sentences critics of both penal policies contend that such sentences give way to nonuniform application of sentences across jurisdictions with respect to determinate sentences for example judges sentence offenders to fixed period based on statute which some contend does not take into consideration individual offender characteristics indeterminate sentencing practices on the other hand lead to disparities due to the potential for two defendants committing the same crime under similar circumstances receiving very different sentences depending on particular judges sentencing idiosyncrasies 83

federal sentencing guidelines the sentencing reform act of 1984 chapter ii of the comprehensive crime control act of 1984 pl 98473 in essence eliminated indeterminate sentencing at the federal level the act created the united states sentencing commission an independent body within the judicial branch of the federal government and charged it with promulgating guidelines for federal sentencing the purpose of the commission was to examine unwarranted disparity in federal sentencing policy among other things84 in establishing sentencing guidelines for federal judges the commission took into consideration factors such as 1 the nature and degree of harm caused by the offense 2 the offenders prior record 3 public views of the gravity of the offense 4 the deterrent effect of particular sentence and 5 aggravating or mitigating circumstances85 in addition to these factors the commission also considered characteristics of the offender such as age 83 american bar association justice kennedy commission report with recommendations to the aba house of delegates august 2004 p 14 84 the commission was also mandated to examine the effects of sentencing policy upon prison resources eg overcrowding and the use of plea bargaining in the federal criminal justice system 85 see 18 usc 994c

the following goals retribution education deterrence and incapacitation 88 it consolidated the power that had been exercised by judges and the us parole board to decide the type of punishment and its length by abolishing paroles and creating the us sentencing commission and charging it with establishing sentencing guidelines 89 it made all federal sentences determinate90 it authorized appellate

take three forms substantial assistance departures other downward departures and upward departures substantial assistance departures are form of downward departures and occur when defendant provides substantial assistance to the prosecution of the three types of departures upward departures are used least often and substantial assistance departures are used most often while departures are available for judges the guidelines explicitly prescribe when judge can depart from the guidelines as the supreme court asserted in the booker ruling departures are not available in every case and in fact are unavailable in most in most cases as matter of law the commission will have adequately taken all relevant factors into account and departure will be legally permissible 96 prior to the booker decision congress weighed in on the issue of downward departures in the 108th congress when an amendment to the protect act was passed that restricted the grounds upon which federal judge could apply downward departures97 among other things the amendment struck language in current law 18 usc 3742e that required appellate courts to give due deference to the district courts application of the guidelines to the facts with respect to departures and in cases wherein the district court failed to provide written statement of reasons for the sentence98 as previously discussed the booker case had an impact on federal judges use of departures in sentencing defendants the blakely case albeit indirectly also had an impact on federal judges sentencing behavior although the blakely case pertained to washington states sentencing guidelines99 federal judges weighed in on the implications blakely s decision had on federal sentencing the majority of federal sentences are handed down under the guidelines with approximately 1 of federal sentences falling outside the guidelines jurisdiction100 the following figures figures 1 and 2 depict aggregate departure data preand post booker 2002 and 2006 as previously mentioned blakely also had an impact on federal judges sentencing behavior however the decision was handed down on june 24 2004 less than seven months prior to the booker decision as result there is not complete year of data for which crs could provide analysis on the blakely decision therefore this section analyzes data pre and post booker 2003 and 2006 as figure 1 shows the majority of prebooker partures were downward departures the majority of the downward departures occurred due to the defendant providing substantial assistance to the prosecution or the judge finding mitigating factors which in both cases would necessitate downward departure in 2003 federal judges departed from the sentencing guidelines 297 of the time of which less than 1 of the departures were upward departures 96 us v booker 73 uslw 3077 2004 p 10 97 prosecutorial remedies and tools against the exploitation of children today protect act of 2003 pl 108 21 98 for additional information see

er source crs prese ntation of fed eral senten cing data in both years examined the data revealed that the vast majority of departures were downward departures while proponents view downward depart ures as necessary in structured system because their use allows judges to individualize sentences critics argue that the frequent use of downward departures is mechanism for judges to circumvent the limits imposed on them through the sentencing guidelines moreover such critics argue that departures should be eliminated because they produce unwarranted dispar ity unlike the structure that exists with the prescribed sentencing ranges in the guidelines departures provide an opportunity for judges to sentence outside that range critics contend that permitting judge to sentence outside the specified range could be problematic because judges could potentially increase or decrease defendants sentence substantially depending on the circumstances departures however are not always viewed as

kimrough the issue for congress is whether to amend current law to require federal judges to follow guided sentences or continue to permit federal judges to use their discretion in sentencing under certain circumstances following is discussion and analysis of several selected options congress could consider

the sentencing guidelines by specifying mandatory minimum sentences and increasing the top of each guideline range to statutory maximum for specified offenses hence codify specified sentencing ranges that are in the guidelines in essence this option would re quire any upward departures to coincide with the statutory maximum for the offense in question in which case statutory maximum would have to be specified this option was first presented to the us sentencing commission shortly after the

concluded with respect to such an option the practical effect of such an amendment would be to preserve current federal practice almost unchanged guidelines factors would not be elements they could still constitutionally be determined by postconviction judicial findings of fact the only theoretical difference would be that judges co uld sentence defendants above the top of the current guideline

kansas had presumptive sentencing guidelines that were invalidated by the states supreme court103 in response to the court ruling the states legislature chose to retain the sentencing structure by incorporating jury factfinding as the basis for enhanced sentences104 under this scheme for each enhancement that would increase the sentence beyond the guideline maximum for which the defendant did not waive his or her rights the judge has the option of trying aggravating factors before the jury either during the main trial or in separate bifurcated proceeding the jury would have to find that the enhanced factors exist beyond reasonable doubt in order for the enhanced sentence to be applicable while this option may satisfy constitutional questions it may prove to be an expensive and

federal judges to exercise their discretion in sentencing in cases where congress has not specified mandatory term of sentence this option could possibly mirror the indeterminate sentencing scheme that was in place prior to the sentencing reform effort in 1984 while such an option would allow judges to individualize sentences to the extent that congress has not established mandatory sentence for the offense it could also result in lack of uniformity due to judges applying different sentences across jurisdictions
