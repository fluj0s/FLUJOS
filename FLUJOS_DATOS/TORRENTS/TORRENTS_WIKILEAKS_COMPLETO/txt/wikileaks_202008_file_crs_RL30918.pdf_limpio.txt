basic elements of democracy include effective and independent legislative and judicial branches of government freedom of expression respect for human rights and free elections broad array of

legislature and judiciary inhibiting the development of either as independent democratic institutions in 1999 and 2000 freedom house classified peru as the only country in the hemisphere besides cuba where the press was not free state department human rights report released in february 2000 said that although human rights abuses had decreased in several areas the fujimori governments human rights record was poor in several areas including the protection of civil and political rights the latest elections held in peru in april and may 2000 were deemed by international and peruvian observers to have been neither free nor fair that controversy combined with the revelation of high level corruption in his administration led fujimori first to agree to new presidential elections in which he would not run and then to flee to japan and resign in november 2000 under the constitutions rules of succession the president of the congress valentin paniagua became perus new president the immediate

institutions under fujimori most analysts acknowledge that in some major areas fujimori brought greater stability to peru he did much to bring under control destabilizing factors such as terrorism drug trafficking hyperinflation and border disputes but fujimori also led the country into several constitutional crises he was elected in 1990 under constitution which limited presidents to serving one 5year term in 1992 in what became known as selfcoup fujimori dissolved congress and took control of the judiciary under intense domestic and international pressure fujimori then oversaw the drafting of new constitution that went into effect in 1993 and scheduled elections the new constitution allowed president to serve two consecutive terms and established unicameral legislation

term he quickly began paving the way for yet another term further eroding the independence of perus already weak democratic institutions as he did so in 1996 the unicameral legislature dominated by profujimori majority passed law of authentic interpretation which stated that fujimoris election under the previous constitutio n did not count against the twoterm limit of the current constitution in 1997 the constitutional tribunal high court charged with deciding the constitutionality of laws issued an opinion that the law of authentic interpretation was not applicable the peruvian congress dismissed the three members of the court who signed the opinion the other four members abstained rendering the court unable to act the congress also thwarted an effort by civic organizations to put the matter of third term to national referendum voting against allowing it even though petitioners gathered 14 million signatures more than the 10 of registered voters required to do so the ability of peruvian citizens to challenge such actions was further limited by the inability of the constitutional tribunal to act and by fujimoris withdrawal of peru from the jurisdiction of the interamerican court for human rights fujimori withdrew from the court after the interamerican commission on human rights recommended in 1998 that peru reinstate the three dismissed justices and restore the tribunals power to rule on constitutional issues fujimoris government announced it would not comply with the recommendation elections of 20002 having cleared away obstacles to his candidacy fujimori ran for an unprecedented third term all 120 seats of the unicameral legislature were contested along with the presidency many observers believed that electoral conditions did not represent level playing field but an environment that heavily and often unfairly favored the incumbent numerous peruvian and international election monitoring organizations and press reports indicated several areas of concern the executive branchs manipulation of the judicial system to achieve its desired outcome questions regarding the independence and impartiality of the electoral bodies responsible for organizing perus elections and use of public resources for campaign purposes concerns regarding freedom of the press and access to information involved unequal media access media bias and harassment

loss of control over an institution which had become rubber stamp for his initiatives investigations into the expanding evidence of corruption in his administration and his possible role in it became

corruption and demonstrating fiscal discipline however the interim government increased public confidence and kept the political crisis from leading to economic chaos economic minister javier silva outlined perus most serious economic problems as the national debt the fiscal deficit and the need to create climate for investment the government hoped to meet the fiscal goals for 2001 agreed upon with the international monetary fund some economists said that approach adhering to strict fiscal constraints may prolong economic stagnation but others said peru might experience slight economic growth by the end of the year the 2001 extraordinary elections the 2001 elections determined the new president and all 120 members of the unicameral legislature traditional political parties were

headquarters on may 16 injuring seven people although pamphlets supporting the shining path guerrillas were found near the explosion perus interior minister said the material was atypical of the

to minimum the two presidential candidates facing runoff were alejandro toledo who withdrew from runoff elections with fujimori last year because he believed they were not fair and alan garcia who was president of peru from 1985 to 1990 toledo won the election with 530 of the vote garcia garnered 469 toledo who earned his doctorate in economics from stanford university and was an adviser to the world bank emphasizes his humble origins he is one of 16 children from poor indigenous family and shined shoes as boy garcia spent years in selfimposed exile abroad following allegations of corruption in his administration and has only recently returned to peru many critics blame garcias policies for creating 7000 annual inflation rate and debt crisis which led peru into economic chaos nonetheless

pursuing national agenda the head of the oas electoral observation mission to peru said that peru did an incredible job organizing free and fair elections on june 3 that were an example for the rest of latin america the toledo administration reforms to restore and more fully develop democratic institutions have continued under president alejandro toledos government many analysts believe toledos
