7 nsa for the foreseeable future nsa has two separate definitions of what constitutes content based on eo 12333 and fisapaa collection fisa considers communications data to be part of the content of the communication hence fisa has separate concept of metadata all discussions at the conference were therefore focused on standard collection under the authority of eo 12333 8 there is constitutional expectation of privacy within the us for communications data this is harder to quantify than for content new procedures will permit differentiation between content and communications data allowing for far greater data usage and advancing other related changes tension remains between the desires to minimise shared data containing us identifiers and engaging more openly to support the foreign cryptologic mission 9 it is harder to define what constitutes us identifier with dni data where unclear it is treated as us nsa is moving from minimised records within their databases to minimising identifiers within reports sharing unmasked us identifiers with second party sigint partners will be easier than with some us domestic partners 10 all all sigint agencies seek to protect their equities especially relating to special source exploitation sse 11 special categories of data were considered in the context of their potential to contribute to pattern of life analysis an increasing amount of new data types are available to sigint agencies some proving difficult to categorise as either content or communications data the conference agreed to step back from trying to categorise the data and simply to focus on what is shareable in bulk 12 consideration was given as to whether any types of data were prohibited for example medical legal religious or restricted business information which may be regarded as an intrusion of privacy given the nascent state of many of these data types then or limited precedents have been set with respect to proportionality or propriety or whether different legal considerations applies to the ownership of this data compared with the communications data that we were more accustomed to handle it was agreed that the conference should not seek to set any automatic limitations but any such difficult cases would have to be considered by owning agency on casebycase basis comment nsa normally considers any target data pattern of life or other that can be characterized as foreign intelligence as proper for collection analysis and production comment page 3 etm off limits 35 d icreach sstill pilot this provides minimised dnr data to sigintcleared and appropriately trained analysts across the us intelligence community second party derived data is currently not made available to us intelligence community icdomesticdomo6tic agencies although gcsb has agreed that theier dnh metadata may be shared but such data would be valued in the hope that such agreement will be forthcoming nsa has persuaded other us ic agencies to make almost 100 bn previously noforn records shareable with the 5eyes via global reach voip is treated as dnr though with only dnr records and fields shown to analysts making dni available through icreach is currently restricted due to limited automated general counsel approved methods toprovontod by us policy on minimize dni metadataatiott 36deconfliction is not formalised through icreach query records can potentially be used to alert analysts that other analysts are looking at the same data deconflicting operations remains tough challenge requiring increased coordination of operations and collaboration 37 there is interest in the relationship between the implementation of aspace us dni initiative to link all us ic analysts to common tools and sharable databases and allow for greater collaboration and icreach inasmuch as it may affect second parties internal procedures and access issues with domestic agencies 38 us nscid5 this is specific method of nsa providinosfrafme uniminimized sigint data to cia as if cia had collected it itself in support of the latters operational missionandddatafrom second parties is shared with cia in accordance with special agreements between nsa and each second party 39 gchq are employing methods and b for military sigint needs gchq uses gcos1 to reach back to uk and 5eyes repositories the militarys work within the ambit of the national sigint organisation comes under the authority of gchq 40 nsa shares us sigint data with all us sigint elements that operate under dirnsas operational control agencies with second parties there is an initial minimisation of the data when possible however all second parties have agreed to abide by us minimization criteria ffor us intelligence agencies nsa mustthoro is furthor minimizesing of the data before sharing and for other us agencies such as law enforcement nsa only provides data under its technical support mission currently all such data is minimized before sharingthoro is another furthor lovol of minimising of data most restricted data set
