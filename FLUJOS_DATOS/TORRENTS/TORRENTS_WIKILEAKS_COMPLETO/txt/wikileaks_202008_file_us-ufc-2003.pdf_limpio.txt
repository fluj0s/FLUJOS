new and existing buildings and expeditionary and temporary st ructures the last colu mn of each table titled applicable explosive weight includes sp ecific explosive weights in kilograms pounds of tnt which makes these tables fo r official use only fouo these tables are identical to tables b1 and d1 in ufc 401001 dod minimum antiterrorism standards for buildings except that these tables incl ude the explosive weights while those in ufc 401001 do not incorporating tables 1 and 2 of this document into ufc 401001replacing tables b1 and d1 will make ufc 401001 fouo the explosive upon which the separation distance re commendation recommendation 10 in appendix c of ufc 401001 is based is not included in table 1 but explosive weight i ii in table 2 is the appropriate explosive for application to that recommendation 12 information sensitivity some information in this document is exempt from mandatory disclos ure under the freedom of informa tion act the sensitive information that is exempt is the expl osive weights upon which the minimum standoff distances are based allowi ng potential aggressors to know the minimum explosive weights that all dod inhabit ed buildings are designed to resist could constitute vulnerability to minimize the possibilit of that information being used against dod personnel the following provisions apply 121 distribution follow governing dod and com

contractors will be res ponsible for developing design proposal for that project that may be impacted by provisions of dod minimum antiterrorism standards for buildings ufc 0401001 and this document where that is the case consider alternate means to provide sufficien t information to support their proposals consider for example either specifying spec ific design loads or specifying the required standoff distance and providing candidate stru ctural systems that would allow for mitigation of the applicable explosive if that standoff was less than the minimum once the design build contract is awarded the c ontractor will be eligible to receive this document for use in the develop ment of the final design pack age but that contractor will be responsible for protecting the integrity of the
