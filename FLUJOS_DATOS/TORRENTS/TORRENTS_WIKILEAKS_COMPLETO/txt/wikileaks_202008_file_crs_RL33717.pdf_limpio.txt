routinely procure patents on their innovative medications such rights are not selfenforcing brandname firms that wish to enforce their patents against generic competitors must commence litigation in the federal courts such litigation ordinarily terminates in either judgment of infringement which typically blocks generic competition until such time as the patent expires or judgment that the patent is invalid or not infringed which typically opens the market to generic entry as with other sorts of commercial litigation however the parties to pharmaceutical patent litigation may choose to settle their case certain of these settlements have called for the generic firm to neither challenge the brandname companys patents nor sell generic version of the patented drug for period of time in exchange the brandname drug company agrees to compensate the generic firm often with substantial monetary payments over number of years because the payment flows counterintuitively from the patent proprietor to the accused infringer this compensation has been termed reverse payment commentators have differed markedly in their views of reverse payment settlements some observers believe that they are consequence of the specialized patent litigation procedures established by the hatchwaxman act others have concluded that when one competitor pays another not to market its product such settlement is anticompetitive and violation of the antitrust laws since 2003 congress has required that litigants notify federal antitrust authorities of their pharmaceutical patent settlements that legislation did not dictate substantive standards for assessing the validity of these agreements under the antitrust law however that determination was left to judicial application of general antitrust principles facing different factual patterns some courts have concluded that particular reverse payment settlement constituted an antitrust violation while others have upheld the agreement congress possesses number of alternatives for addressing reverse payment settlements one possibility is to await further judicial developments another option is to regulate the settlement of pharmaceutical patent litigation in some manner in the 110 th congress s 316 the preserve access to affordable generics act would have declared that certain reverse payment settlements would be unlawful legislation could also establish presumption of either legality or illegality under the antitrust laws along with consideration of relevant factors to be weighed by the courts this report will be updated as needed

g343g561he increasing costs of health care have focused congressional attention upon both the development and public availability of prescription drugs congress has long recognized that the patent system has an important role to play in the pharmaceutical industry in each respect the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 19841 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act2 in part reformed the patent laws to balance incentives for innovation and competition within the pharmaceutical industry congress subsequently amended this legislation on several occasions most recently via the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 3 recently congressional attention has been directed towards one aspect of the patent system the settlement of pharmaceutical patent litigation although brandname pharmaceutical companies commonly procure patents on their innovative products and processes such rights are not selfenforcing if brandname drug company wishes to enforce its patents against generic competitors it must pursue litigation in the federal courts 4 such litigation ordinarily terminates in either judgment of infringement which typically blocks generic competition until such time as the patent expires or judgment that the patent is invalid or not infringed which typically opens the market to generic entry as with other sorts of commercial litigation however the parties to pharmaceutical patent litigation may choose to settle their case5 certain of these settlements call for the generic firm to neither challenge the brandname companys patents nor sell generic version of the patented drug in exchange the brandname drug company agrees to make cash payments to the generic firm this compensation has been termed an exclusion6 or exit7 payment or because the payment flows counterintuitively from the patent proprietor to the accused infringer reverse payment8 commentators differ markedly in their views of reverse payment settlements

patent application must include specification that so completely describes the invention that skilled artisans are able to practice it without undue experimentation the patent act also requires that applicants draft at least one claim that particularly points out and distinctly claims the subject matter that they regard as their invention 19 while reviewing submitted application the examiner will determine whether the claimed invention fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute two of the most important patentability criteria are novelty and nonobviousness to be judged novel the claimed invention must not be fully anticipated by prior patent publication or other knowledge within the public 11 medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 pl

must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of competent artisan based upon the teachings of the prior art21 if the uspto allows the application to issue as granted patent the owner or owners of the patent obtain the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the claimed invention 22 the term of the patent is ordinarily set at twenty years from the date the patent application was filed23 patent title therefore provides inventors with limited periods of exclusivity in which they may practice their inventions or license others to do so the grant of patent permits inventors to receive return on the expenditure of resources leading to the discovery often by charging higher price than would prevail in competitive market in the pharmaceutical industry for example the introduction of generic competition often results in the availability of lowercost substitutes for the innovative product 24 patent proprietor bears responsibility for monitoring its competitors to determine whether they are using the patented invention patent owners who wish to compel others to observe their intellectual property rights must usually commence litigation in the federal district courts g8g6g3g561g3g153g153g155g152g159g138g149g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142g156g561 although the award of patent claiming pharmac eutical provides its owner with proprietary interest in that product it does not actually allow the owner to distribute that product to the public permission from the fda must first be obtained25 in order to obtain fda marketing approval the developer of new drug must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective this showing typically requires the drugs sponsor to conduct both preclinical and clinical investigations26 in deciding whether to issue marketing approval or not the fda evaluates the test data that the sponsor submits in socalled new drug application nda prior to the enactment of the hatchwaxman act the federal food and drug law contained separate provisions addressing marketing approval for independent generic versions of drugs that had previously been approved by the fda27 the result was that wouldbe generic drug manufacturer had to file its own nda in order to sell its product28 some generic manufacturers could rely on published scientific literature demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug by submitting socalled pape r nda because these sorts of studies were not available for all drugs 20 35 usc 102 2006 21 35 usc 103 2006 22 35 usc 271a 2006 23 35 usc

g346g561however not all generic firms could file paper nda29 further at times the fda requested additional studies to address safety and efficacy questions that arose from experience with the drug following its initial approval30 the result was that some generic manufacturers were forced to prove once more that particular drug was safe and effective even though their products were chemically identical to those of previously approved pharmaceuticals some commentators believed that the approval of generic drug was needlessly costly duplicative and timeconsuming process31 these observers noted that although patents on important drugs had expired manufacturers were not moving to introduce generic equivalents for these products due to the level of resource expenditure required to obtain fda marketing approval32 in response to these concerns congress enacted the hatchwaxman act statute that has been described as complex and multifaceted compromise between innovative and generic pharmaceutical companies33 its provisions included the creation of two statutory pathways that expedited the marketing approval process for generic drugs the first of these consist of abbreviated new drug applications or andas an anda allows an independent generic applicant to obtain marketing approval by demonstrating that the proposed product is bioequivalent to an approved pioneer drug without providing evidence of safety and effectiveness from clinical data or from the scientific literature the second are socalled 505b2 applications which are sometimes still referred to as paper ndas like an nda 505b2 application contains full report of investigations of safety and effectiveness of the proposed product in contrast to an nda however 505b2 application typically relies at least in part upon published literature providing preclinical or clinical data the availability of andas and 505b2 applications often allow generic manufacturer to avoid the costs and delays associated with filing fullfledged nda they may also allow an independent generic manufacturer in many cases to place its fdaapproved bioequivalent drug on the market as soon as any relevant patents expire 34 as part of the balance struck between brandname and generic firms congress also provided patent proprietors with means for restoring portion of the patent term that had been lost while awaiting fda approval the maximum extension period is capped at fiveyear extension period or total effective patent term after the extension of not more than 14 years 35 the scope 29 see kristin behrendt the hatchwaxman act

drugs congress recognized that the brandname pharmaceutical firm may be the proprietor of one or more patents directed towards that drug product these patents might be infringed by product described by generic firms anda or 505b2 application in the event that product is approved by the fda and sold in the marketplace the hatchwaxman act therefore established special procedures for resolving patent disputes in connection with applications for marketing generic drugs in particular the hatchwaxman act states that each nda applicant shall file list of patents that the applicant believes would be infringed if generic drug were marketed prior to the expiration of these patents 38 the fda then lists these patents in publication titled approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations which is more commonly known as the orange book39 wouldbe manufacturers of generic drugs must then engage in specialized certification procedure with respect to orange booklisted patents an anda or 505b2 applicant must state its views with respect to ea ch orange booklisted patent associated with the drug it seeks to market four possibilities exist 1 that the brandname firm has not filed any patent information with respect to that drug 2 that the patent has already expired 3 that the generic company agrees not to market until the date on which the patent will expire or 4 that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture use or sale of the drug for which the anda is submitted40 these certifications are respectively termed paragraph i ii iii and iv certifications41 an anda or 505b2 application certified under paragraphs i or ii is approved immediately after meeting all applicable regulatory and scientific requirements42 an independent generic

g348g561meeting pertinent regulatory and scientific requirements wait for approval until the drugs listed patent expires43 the filing of an anda or 505b2 application with paragraph iv certification constitutes somewhat artificial act of patent infringement under the hatchwaxman act44 the act requires the independent generic applicant to notify the proprietor of the patents that are the subject of paragraph iv certification45 the patent owner may then commence patent infringement litigation against that applicant g9g142g151g142g155g146g140g561g7g161g140g149g158g156g146g159g146g157g162g561 in order to encourage challenges of pharmaceutical patents the hatchwaxman act provides prospective manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals with potential reward that reward consists of 180day exclusivity period awarded to the first anda applicant to file paragraph iv certification46 once first anda with paragraph iv certification has been filed the fda cannot issue marketing approval to subsequent anda with paragraph iv certification on the same drug product for 180 days because market prices could drop considerably following the entry of additional generic competition the first paragraph iv anda applicant could potentially obtain more handsome profits than subsequent market entrantsthereby stimulating patent challenges in the first instance47 as originally enacted the hatchwaxman act stipulated that the first paragraph iv certification triggered entitlement to the 180day generic exclusivity period the anda applicant need take further steps whatsoever in particular the statute did not require the generic applicant to pursue favorable judgment with respect to the challenged patent seek fda approval of the anda or market its generic product once the fda granted marketing approval48 some commentators believed that the legislation led to abuses by certain first paragraph iv anda applicants who parked their period of exclusivity in order to bar generic competition rather than actively pursue the marketing of their own generic products as pharmaceutical patent expert alfred engelberg has asserted experience has shown that the first anda applicant to file patent challenge may never trigger the start of the 180day period thereby blocking the fda from granting approval to any generic product more often than not the first generic challenger will enter into lucrative cash settlement with the patent owner that results in judgment in favor of the patent and prohibits the challenger from marketing product under its anda until the patent expires therefore the 180day exclusivity period never starts and subsequently filed anda can be approved unless final judgment adverse to the patent is obtained by one of the subsequent applicants but even in that circumstance the winning party would be 43 21 usc 355j5bii 2006 44 eli lilly co v medtronic inc 496 us 1047 1990 45 21 usc 355j2bi 2006 46 21 usc 355j5biv 2006 section 505b2 applications do not

the 180 days of exclusivity belong solely to the first challenger and not to the first winner 49 when congress amended the hatchwaxman act in 2003 it responded to this concern over bottlenecking by generic firms the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act mma established number of forfeiture events that if triggered cause first paragraph iv anda applicant to lose its entitlement to the 180day generic exclusivity50 among the forfeiture events are 1 failure to market its product promptly 2 failure to obtain fda approval to market the generic drug in reasonably timely manner and 3 all of the certified patents that entitled the applicant to the 180day generic exclusivity period have expired 51 if the first paragraph iv anda applicant forfeits its exclusivity then this period does not roll over to the second such applicant in that event generic firm enjoys exclusivity at all52 the possibility of forfeiture was intended to prevent the practice of parking the exclusivity period and to force generic manufacturers to market promptly53

generic firms filing of paragraph iv anda may result in patent infringement suit brought by brandname drug co mpany in such litigation if the nda holder demonstrates that the independent generic firms proposed product would violate its patents then the court will ordinarily issue an injunction that prevents the generic drug company from marketing that product that injunction will expire on the same date as the nda holders patents independent generic drug companies commonly amend their andas or 505b2 applications in this event replacing their paragraph iv certifications with paragraph iii certifications 54 on the other hand the courts may decide in favor of the independent generic firm the court may conclude that the generic firms proposed product does not infringe the asserted patents or that the asserted patents are invalid or unenforceable55 in this circumstance the independent generic firm may launch its product once the fda has finally approved its anda or 505b2 application in addition to the issuance of final judgment in favor of either the brandname drug company or generic firm another resolution of pharmaceutical patent litigation is possible this legal situation 49

g350g561led to number of cases with varying details but common core fact pattern upon filing paragraph iv anda generic firm would be sued for patent infringement as provided by the hatchwaxman act the nda holder and generic applicant would then settle their dispute the settlement would call for the generic firm to neither challenge the patent nor produce generic version of the patented drug for period of time up to the remaining term of the patent in exchange the nda holder would agree to compensate the anda applicant often with substantial monetary payments over number of years opinions about the effects of reverse payment settlements upon social welfare have varied some commentators believe that such settlements are anticompetitive they believe that many of these agreements may amount to more than two firms colluding in order to restrict output and share patentbased profits 56 such settlements are also said to eliminate the possibility of judicial holding of patent invalidity which may open the market to generic competition and benefit consumers57 on the other hand some commentators have found nothing inherently troublesome about reverse payment settlements among their observations is that there is general judicial policy in favor of promoting settlement settlements can allow the parties to avoid the expenses of litigation achieve resolution to the dispute in timely manner and avoid the risk of an uncertain result in the courtroom58 the settlement of litigation further serves the goal of resolving disputes in peaceful manner and also preserves scarce judicial resources59 second any settlement of litigation between rational actors necessarily involves an exchange of benefits and obligations as judge richard posner has explained any settlement agreement can be characterized as involving compensation to the defendant who would not settle unless he had something to show for the settlement if any settlement agreement is thus to be classified as involving forbidden reverse payment we shall have more patent settlements 60 third certain reverse payment settlements have allowed for the introduction of generic competition prior to the date the relevant patent expires it is possible for example for the brand name and generic firms to split the remaining patent term with the generic firm being allowed to market competing product prior to the running of the full patent term such agreements may potentially benefit consumers certainly in comparison to judgment that the patent is not invalid and infringed 61 finally the dispute

infringer to an injunction along with damages awar ded for past uses and sales as result the accused infringer may well be willing to compensate the patent proprietor in order to avoid the risk of such holding62 some observers believe that the structure of the hatchwaxman act alters the traditional balance of risks between the plaintiffpatentee and accused infringer as explained by one federal district court in creating an artificial act of infringement the anda iv filing the hatchwaxman amendments grant generic manufacturers standing to mount validity challenge without incurring the cost of entry or risking enormous damages flowing from infringing commercial sales because of the hatchwaxman scheme the generic firms exposure in the patent litigation was limited to litigation costs but its upsideexclusive generic saleswas immense the patent holder however has corresponding upside as there are infringement damages to collect but has an enormous downsidelosing the patent 63 as result some commentators believe that it is entirely predictable that the unique procedures of the hatchwaxman act have resulted in the new phenomenon of reverse payment settlements64 at the present time the congressional response to pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements has been limited in the 2003 medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act mma65 congress mandated that the department of justice doj and the federal trade commission ftc receive copies of certain patent settlements agreements in the pharmaceutical field the filing requirement applies to agreements executed on or after january 7 2004 between an anda applicant on one hand and either the nda holder or an owner of an orange book listed patent on the other66 such agreements trigger the statutory notification requirement if they relate to one of three topics 1 the manufacture marketing or sale of the brandname drug that is the listed in the anda 2 the manufacture marketing or sale of the generic drug for which the anda was submitted or 3 the 180day generic exclusivity period as it applies to that anda or to another anda filed with respect to the same brandname drug67 the mma stipulates that certain agreements are not subject to this filing requirement in particular agreements that solely consist of purchase orders for raw materials equipment and 62 see kristopher l reed return to reason

antitrust laws are comprised of the sherman act the clayton act the federal trade commission act and other federal and state statutes that prohibit certain kinds of antico mpetitive economic conduct although complete review of the antitrust laws exceeds the scope of this report other sources provide more information for the interested reader 71 section 1 of the sherman act declares every contract combination in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy in restraint of trade to be illegal the courts have long interpreted this language as applying only to unreasonable restraints of trade the determination of whether particular conduct amounts to an unreasonable restraint of trade is commonly conducted under the rule of reason under this approach the finder of fact must decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition taking into account variety of factors including specific information about the relevant business its condition before and after the restraint was imposed and the restraints history nature and effect72 the rule of reason essentially calls upon courts to reach judgment of reasonableness by balancing the anticompetitive consequences of challenged practice against its business justifications and potentially procompetitive impact other sorts of restraints are deemed unlawful per per illegality is appropriate once experience with particular kind of restraint enables the court to predict with confidence that the rule of reason will condemn it 73 the supreme court has explained that there are certain 68 id at

g343g344g561the court of appeals characterized the deal as one in which hmr and andrx agreed to eliminate competition in the cardizem cd market beca use andrx was entitled to the 180day generic exclusivity and because its agreement occurred prior to the 2003 amendments to the hatch waxman act80 andrx was able to park its generic exclusivity and prevent all other generic firms from marketing the sixth circuit reasoned that the hmrandrx agreement was appropriately classified as socalled horizontal agreement that is to say restraint of trade involving businesses at the same level of competition such agreements had long been classified as antitrust violation per the court explained 81 in reaching this conclusion the sixth circuit explicitly rejected several arguments offered by hmr and andrx the defendants asserted that because the courts did not have extensive experience with reverse payment settlements they lacked sufficient basis for declaring them per illegal the sixth circuit instead noted that whatever may be its peculiar problems and characteristics the sherman act so far as pricefixing agreements are concerned establishes one uniform rule applicable to all industries alike82 judge oberdorfer further stated that it is one thing to take advantage of monopoly that naturally arises from patent but another thing altogether to bolster the patents

kind of territorial market allocation that triggers antitrust liability and that is so because the patent gives its owner lawful exclusionary right in characterizing the ag reements as territorial market allocations agreements the district court did not consider that the 207 patent gave abbott the right to exclude others from making using or selling anhydrous terazosin hydrochloride until october of 2014 when it is due to expire to the extent that zenith and geneva agreed to market admittedly infringing products before the 207 patent expired or was held invalid the market allocation character ization is inappropriate 89 rather the court of appeals identified several factors that should be considered by the district court on remand including 1 the scope of the exclusionary potential of the patent 2 the extent to which the agreements exceed that scope and 3 the resulting anticompetitive effects 90 in its subsequent decision in scheringplough corp v ftc 91 the eleventh

agreements during its negotiations with upsher schering refused to pay upsher merely to stay off the market93 schering did agree to license five of upshers products however in addition upsher promised not to market generic version of kdur 20 prior to september 1 200194 in exchange schering promised to pay upsher 60 million upfront royalty along with 10 million in milestone royalty payments and royalties of 10 or 15 on sales95 under the esi settlement schering agreed to llow esi to market generic version of kdur 20 on january 1 2004 schering also agreed to pay 5 million to cover esis legal fees as well as 10 million if esi received fda approval to market its generic product by certain date finally schering obtained the right to license two generic products from esi for 15 million 96 following complaint by ftc counsel the ftc commission held that these arrangements were anticompetitive under the rule of reason97 schering and usher appealed the commissions decision to the eleventh circuit which reversed confirming its analysis under the contours laid out in valley drug the eleventh circuit first observed that the 743 patent enjoyed statutory presumption of validity98 further under the terms of their agreements with schering upsher was able to market generic product full five years before the 743 patents expiration while esi could market two years in advance 99 the eleventh circuit next concluded that the licenses granted to schering constituted adequate consideration for the payments made by schering rather than amounting to thinly disguised payoffs to delay the introduction of generic competition according to judge fay schering had long been interested in licensing those products as result the scheringupsher and scheringesi agreements were legitimate settlements within the scope of the 743 patents exclusionary power 100 finally the court of appeals compared the scope of the 743 patent with that of the schering upsher and scheringesi agreements judge fay concluded that they were commensurate with each specifically addressing controlled release microencapsulated potassium chloride tablets as result the agreements could not be said to be overly broad nor did they delay the entry of other generic products 101 as result the decision of the ftc was reversed102 93 id at 1059 94 id 95 id at 1060 96 id at 106061 97 in re scheringplough corp

judicial opinion resulted from extremely complex factual and legal circumstances zeneca was the owner of patent covering tamoxifen the most widely prescribed drug for the treatment of breast cancer generic firm barr laboratories filed an anda that it subsequently amended to include paragraph iv certification zeneca responded by filing charge of patent infringement in keepin g with the procedures of the hatchwaxman act in an opinion issued in 1992 the district court held that the tamoxifen patent was invalid and unenforceable 104 zeneca appealed the district courts judgment while the appeal was pending zeneca and barr entered into confidential settlement agreement as part of that deal barr agreed to amend its anda to include paragraph iii certification and further agreed not to sell its own generic version of tamoxifen until the patents expiration in 2002 in exchange zeneca agreed to pay barr 21 million and to provide barr with nonexclusive license to sell an authorized generic version of tamoxifenthat is to say an zenecamanufactured tamoxifen under barrs label 105 the parties further agreed that if the tamoxifen patent were declared invalid or unenforceable then barr could revert to its paragraph iv certification106 pursuant to the settlement and consistent with governing law at that time the court of appeal remanded the case to the district court which then vacated its judgment of invalidity and unenforceability107 following the settlement between zeneca and barr three other generic firmsnovopharm ltd mylan pharmaceutical inc and pharmachemie bv filed tamoxifen andas with paragraph iv certifications108 zeneca once more filed charges of patent infringement against each of these firms as allowed by the hatchwaxman act in each of these three cases the court refused to rely upon the vacated 1992 judgment to hold that zenecas tamoxifen patent was invalid further the courts hearing the noveopharm and pharmachemie cases upheld the validity of zenecas tamoxifen patent 109 the mylan case ended with consent order that fda approval of the generic application would not become effective prior to the expiration of the tamoxifen patent110 while those three cases were pending the fda granted tentative approval for pharmachemie to market generic version of tamoxifen however barr petitioned the fda to recognize that barr was entitled to 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity111 as the first paragraph iv anda 103 429 f3d 370 2d cir 2005 104 see imperial chem indus plc v barr labs inc 795 f supp 619 sdny 1992 105 429 f3d at 377 for further

g343g348g561applicant the effective result was that the fda prevented the marketing of other generic versions of tamoxifen until either the zeneca patent expired or 180 days elapsed from the date that barr sold its own generic version of tamoxifen of course because barr was already distributing zenecas authorized generic barr apparently had little incen tive to launch its own generic product112 consumers and consumer groups subsequently filed numerous lawsuits challenging the settlement between zeneca and barr on antitrust grounds the trial court rejected these claims however and on appeal the second circuit affirmed113 the second circuit began by observing that although tension existed between antitrust law and patent law the courts have long favored settlements of litigation the court of appeals saw the law as wellsettled that where there are legitimately conflicting patent claims settlement by agreement rather than litigation is not precluded by the sherman act although such settlement may ultimately have an adverse effect on competition 114 in view of longstanding policies favoring the settlement of litigation the court of appeals concluded that without alleging something more than the fact that zeneca settled after it lost to barr in the district court that would tend to establish that the settlement agreement was unlawful the assertion that there was barantitrust or otherwiseto the defendants settling the litigation at the time that they did is unpersuasive115 the second circuit largely based its conclusion upon the fact that the outcome of patent litigation was unpredictable that the 1992 judgment had found the tamoxifen patent invalid was by itself not of great moment that zeneca had sufficient confidence in its patent to proceed to trial rather than find some means to settle the case first should hardly weigh against it116 while holding that the reasonableness of the settlement must be judged at the time the agreement was concluded117 the court of appeals further observed that federal district courts in the later lawsuits disagreed with the 1992 judgment and upheld the tamoxifen patent118 the second circuit next declined to condemn the existence of reverse payments in pharmaceutical patent settlement as an antitrust violation per agreeing with the analysis of the eleventh circuit in the scheringplough case that the hatchwaxman changed the relative risk profiles of the patent holder and accused infringer the court of appeals found sound basis for categorically condemning reverse payments employed to lift the uncertainty surrounding the validity and scope of the holders patent119 the court of appeals further disagreed with the plaintiffs contention that the zenecabarr settlement was unlawful because the value of the consideration provided to keep barrs product off the market greatly exceeded the value barr could have realized by successfully defending its trial victory on appeal and entering the market with its own competitive generic 112 429 f3d at 37980 113 in re tamoxifen citrate antitrust litigation 277 fsupp2d 121edny 2003 114 id at 386 quoting standard oil co v united states 283 us 163 171 1931 115 id

g343g349g561product120 to the contrary the second circuit reasoned it may well make economic sense for the patent proprietor to pay its generic rival more than its expected earnings the reason of course is that the total profits of the patent hol der and generic firm in competitive market would be less than the supracompetitive profits earned by the patentee alone and that the patent proprietor might find it sensible to pay portion of that difference to the generic firm the second circuit further held that so long as the patent litigation is neither sham nor otherwise baseless the patent holder is seeking to arrive at settlement in order to protect that to which it is presumptively entitled lawful monopoly over the manufacture and distribution of the patented product 121 the second circuits analysis continued with review of the terms of the zenecabarr settlement agreement citing scheringplough the court of appeals framed the question as whether the exclusionary effects of the agreement exceed the scope of the patents protection122 the court of appeals characterized the tamoxifen patent as compound patent rather than one directed towards more limited formulation as result although the settlement precluded barr from manufacturing any generic form of tamoxifen so too did zenecas compound patent the settlement agreement therefore did not restrain the marketing of noninfringing products the court reasoned123 the second circuit further explained that the zenecabarr settlement also allowed barr to introduce authorized generic market into the tamoxifen market although the price difference between the zeneca and barr products was modest this consumer benefit nonetheless occurred almost nine years before zenecas patent was due to expire as result the settlement agreement produced more competition than would have occurred had the parties not settled and zeneca had prevailed on appeal124 as result the second circuit affirmed the trial courts conclusion that the zenecabarr settlement did not violate the antitrust laws g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g5g146g155g140g158g146g157g561 in in re ciprofloxacin hydrochloride antitrust litigation 125

g343g350g561in 2000 and 2001 purchasers of cipro and several advocacy groups brought antitrust action claiming that the agreements violated the antitrust law the district court rejected these arguments128 and on appeal the federal circuit affirmed the federal circuit initially concluded that rule of per illegality was inappropriate because the courts could not confidently predict that reverse payment settlements had an anticompetitive effect with limited potential for procompetitive benefit as result the court of appeals concluded that rule of reason was the appropriate mode of analysis 129 applying the rule of reason the federal circuit confirmed that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that the settlements agreements violated the antitrust laws the court of appeals reasoned that the scope of the bayerbarr agreemen t did not exceed that of bayers patent as result bayers rights as patentee allowed it to exclude generic firms from profiting from its invention 130 the court of appeals further concluded that in the absence of evidence of fraud before the uspto or sham litigation the court need not consider the validity of the patent in its antitrust analysis judge prost observed that patent is presumed valid and held that settlement is not unlawful if it serves to protect that to which the patent holder is legally entitleda monopoly over the manufacture and distribution of the patented invention131 in upholding the settlement the federal circuit cited with favor the district courts observation that evidence demonstrated that it blocked other generic firms from challenging bayers patent indeed judge prost observed the patent survived subsequent challenges by four other generic manufactures 132 finally the court of appeals also cited longstanding policy in the law in favor of settlements in support of its conclusion133 g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g17g139g156g142g155g159g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 in the absence of explicit congressional guidance the federal courts have applied general principles of antitrust law to reach varying results with respect to pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements it is significant that the different cases considered by these courts have each involved their own distinct set of facts n onetheless the difference between the per rule on one hand and alternative approaches similar to the rule of reason on the other have arguably contributed to different judicial outcomes several options are available for congress one possibility is to await further judicial developments while the united states supreme court has not yet addressed pharmaceutical litigation patent settlements it is possible that the highest court may do so in the future supreme court review would resolve the arguable split among the courts of appeal with respect to this issue continuing case law developments in the lower courts could also lead to an informed consensus on the antitrust consequences of

g343g351g561another option is to regulate the settlement of pharmaceutical patent litigation in some manner for example s 316 the preserve access to affordable generics act proposed to outlaw such agreements in particular that bill would amend the clayton act to provide in part it shall be unlawful under this act for person in connection with the sale of drug product to directly or indirectly be party to any agreement resolving or settling patent infringement claim in whicha an anda filer receives anything of value and b the anda filer agrees not to research develop manufacture market or sell the anda product for any period of time 134 this proposed legislation would effectively make reverse payment settlements per antitrust violation as the sixth circuit concluded in the cardizem cd case other alternatives are also possible legislation c ould establish presumption of either legality or illegality under the antitrust laws along with consideration of relevant factors to be weighed by the courts such factors might include the scope of the asserted patent the legitimacy of the litigation position of the two parties the size of the payment made by the patent holder and whether the settlement allows the generic firm to market competing product prior to the patents expiration 135 such legislation could effectively codify the antitrust treatment of settlements of pharmaceutical patent litigation by the second and eleventh circuits or instead provide somewhat more stringent oversight of reverse payment settlements the settlement of pharmaceutical patent litigation forms an important issue because such litigation is itself important to our public health system our patient population relies upon brand name drug companies to develop new medicines but it also relies upon generic firms to increase access to such medications once they have been developed the hatchwaxman act provides for patent litigation between these two traditional rivals as primary vehicle through which these competing demands are mediated when concluded in manner that comports with antitrust principles such settlements may further the public policy goals of encouraging the labors that lead to medical innovation but also distributin g the fruits of those labors to consumers g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 john r thomas
