sanctions legislation in the 106th congress background the current congres sional debate on the use of economic sanctions in foreign policy has its roots in cold war legislation antiapartheid legislation of the 1980s and us reaction to iraqs aggression toward kuwait in 1990 it has not been unusual for congress to scrutinize the executive branchs choice to use sanctions over other foreign policy tools particularly in instances where the united states has acted unilater ally or in instances where the president has invoked statutory authority to curtail economic transactions but has not sought wider counsel or support from congress in some cases congress takes position in contrast to the administration to address relations with apartheid south africa for example congress enacted over the presidents veto the comprehensive antiapartheid act of 1986 to impose range of economic restrictions against that countrys government in other instances as in the recent case of burma congress takes the lead in pressing for or even requiring the imposition of sanctions in yet other instances such as iraqs invasion of kuwait though sanctions are imposed by the administration congress supports the administrations decision to use other means in the case of iraq military force and expresses that support with votes issues involved in the recent sanctions debate most recently understanding when and how sanctions work and understanding what toll their use might exact have become central issues in congressional discussions on foreign policy options1 many analysts consider indias and pakistans testing of nuclear detonatio n devices in the spring of 1998 and the subsequent imposition of economic sanctions by the united states and other significant trading partners to be critical turning point in the sanctions debate the united states imposed sanctions in part because of inflexibility in the law the president had little choice though the statute requires that the sanctions be imposed evenly the nature of the extensive bilateral relationships between the united states and pakistan and between the united states and india resulted in the sanctions being disproportionately punitive toward pakistan what captured congress attention abov all else was the substantial impact the sanctions would have on american wheat growers if congress did not pass alleviating legislation at about the same time but on different front that congress was mulling over the domestic impact of the nonproliferation sanctions news reports circu lated

effective date july 27 1999sanctions against iraq were having devastating impact on that countrys civilian population these sanctions have been in place since 1990 when iraq invaded its neighbor kuwait the multilateral sanctions have been maintained amidst concerns that iraq is pursuing the manufacture and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction in this context congress took new look at the practice of restricting for foreign policy or national security reasons another countrys access to us markets us producers and especially usproduced food and medical exports only two months after the sanctions were imposed against india and pakistan for detonating nuclear devices congress passed and the president signed into law bill to allow us government financing for wheat sales to pakistan few months later most of the sanctions pertaining to nonmilitary assistance and nonmilitary transactions were waived altering sanctions policy to allow us farmers to sell wheat to pakistan and maintaining sanctions against iraq amidst reports about the deterioration of the health of that countrys civilian population in turn invigorated larger discussion on the use of food and medicine in foreign policy members of congress introduced several legislative proposals in the 106th congress to exclude agricultural commodities medici ne and related goods from sanctions regimes on april 28 1999 the president announced that the united states would exempt commercial sales of agricultural commodities and medicine from future unilateral sanctions imposed by the executive branc h2 the president directed the secretary of the treasury to issue new regulations that would allow commercial food and medical exports to libya iran and sudan three states previously severely restricted from such transactions because they are on the state departments list of countries that support acts of international terrorism congress passed and the president signed into law the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 title ix of hr 5426 enacted by reference in pl 106387 on october 28 2000 to remove food and medicine from us sanctions policy unlike the statute that required the president to impose sanctions on india and pakistan most laws give the president and his administration discretionary authority to impose sanctions either pursuant to declaring national emergency and then invoking powers vested in his office in the international emergency economic powers act or by exercising authority stated in various other laws in other instances cong ress might take the lead either by conferring new presidential authority to impose sanctions or by requiring sanctions to be imposed unless the president determines and certifies that certain conditions have been met the presidents use of executive orders directives determinations or proclamations to legislate in effect without concurrence or stamp of approval from congress led some members of congress to conclude that the clinton administration had overstepped itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30384crs3 3 executive orders implementing domestic policies are more plentiful and have been at the center of this debate the presidents issuance of executive order 13107 on december 10 1998 63 fr 68991 however rankled some members of congress eo 13107 established an interagency working group on human rights treaties and stated that it shall be the policy and practice of the government of the united statesfully to respect and implement its obligations under the international human rights treaties to which it is party 1 the prefatory text to the order however referred to other relevant treaties concerned with the protection and promotion of human rights to which the united states is now or may become party in the future emphasis added some perceived this to be an attempt to implement human rights treaties without benefit of the senates advice and consent 4 still other legislative proposals could have had some indirect impact on the way sanctions are used in furtherance of foreign policy or national security goals the justice for the victims of terrorism act for example introduced as hr 3382 hr 3485 and s 1796 finally enacted as sec 2002 of the victims of trafficking and violence protection act of 2000 pl 106386 hr 3244 strengthens the governments authority to facilitate an individuals right to collect frozen assets of sanctioned country in settlement of crime of terrorism specifically sec 2002 requires the secretary of the treasury to resolve particular claims against cuban and iranian assets reaffirms the presidents authority to manage such use of frozen assets and states sense of the congress that the president should not normalize relations between the united states and iran until the claims subrogated have been dealt with to the satisfaction of the united statesconstitutional bounds spurred on by executive actions that had more to do with treaties than sanctions3 members of congress introduced legislat ion to curtail the presidents authority to issue such orders and to cancel current executive orders unless explicitly required by law the issues summarized above the advisability of sanctions against india and pakistan the punitive use of restrictions on food and medicine presidential flexibility to impose waive and terminate sanctions and the broader question of presidential authority versus congressional authority figured prominently in several legislative proposals put before the 106th congress recent decisions by the administration to change how food and medicine are used in sanctions regimes changes in us relations toward north korea iran iraq china and cuba and concerns over recent vexing developments in the governance of russia yugoslavia nigeria indonesia colom bia and pakistan all resulted in new debate over the use and efficacy of economic sanctions as foreign policy or national security tool legislation the 106th congress considered more than 150 legislati ve proposals that were relevant to the sanctions debate4 most received attention beyond referral to committee bills discussed below in any detail however were been taken up either

requirements are too narrow not everyone was in agreement for example on what constitutes sanction s 757 and hr 1244 both considered restrictions on foreign assistance sanction not all members of

foreign policy or national security objectives the extent to which the sanction has harmed humanitarian interests or what impact there may have been on other us national security and foreign policy interests including the us economy some contended that the reporting requirements in the two proposals were skewed toward agricu ltural interests and did not take into consideration other economic sectors some contended that the bills should have requir ed report on the cost of not imposing sanctions in instances where behavior justifies doing so ie where country has engaged in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in congressional testimony state department officials asserted that there was agreed to means to assess such markers efforts to curtail the presidents use of executive orders proclamations and directives emerging late in the 106th congress could have had implications for the executive branchs use of sanctions in us foreign policy two bills sought to clarify and perhaps curtail terms under which the president may issue executive orders that have the weight of law7 because executive orders are often used to establish that national emergency exists
