from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to david parker davidparkermetofficegovuk subject re visit to met office date tue feb 10 164203 2009 cc peter thorne peterthornemetofficegovuk simpson ianr ianrsimpsonmetofficegovuk david peter ian lets go for the week with feb 2526 in it i could come down for late on the 25th then spend most of the 26th discussing ians work and also the antarctic ideas presumably john prior and others will be available at some point on the 26th the antarctic surface t data that are in crutem3 have come from my searches over the years and also from reader much of the early stuff in reader has come from the archives here except where bas have got the original digitized data from the antarctic institutes in all the countries i also have some files of when some of the manned stations on the ice have moved these are forced moves as the station moves but they have never been accounted for halley and casey are affected there are issues to discuss about the awss and also as david knows from aopc work that wisconsin are doing in putting together all the historic us series ive talked to them about this mainly to try and stop them calculating mean t different way if they do this it will screw their series up it all relates to them saying that the mean of min and max is not great way in the antarctic to calculate mean t they say they can now do the mean of every 3 hours but it needs the historic series and the routine updating to change at the same time which is unlikely to happen cheers phil at 1813 09022009 david parker wrote phil thanks i think feb 2526 is better as peter who suggested the reader data project will be away in the first week of march ian will be here except i think on feb 27th when he is going to chess tournament the hotel next to the met office should be ok but i havent checked availability that can be done when the date is chosen david on mon 20090209 at 1653 0000 phil jones wrote david i think i misinterpreted your email when in switzerland i think i thought you wanted talk and possible project now i read it and it is just possible project ive done lot with the antarctic temperature data i also have an archive of mslp data for most sites for some it is station level pressure with regards homogeneity it is difficult to do much beyond the peninsula and be confident about anything as the stations are too far apart there is an issue i could ask adrian whether erainterim is good enough since 1988 this could also assess the avhrr but this may be circular ive read steig et now and i can see all the comments on the ca and rc sites about some of the data it seems that bas have made some mistakes with some of the aws sites the only aws site used in crutem3 is the one at byrd as this is at one of the manned sites the issue with the awss is getting reasonable data in real time whilst i was away the checked monthly data arrived for 2002 i will add byrds data in the problem is that some sites get buried but still seem to transmit what steig et have done is paleotype reconstruction of the full field from the avhrr for recent period and extended it back to 1957 if the data are ok all youre assuming is that covariance structure remains the same i did this paper attached ages ago but it doesnt seem all that relevant anyway i do need to come down to see ian possibilities would be coming mid week say feb 2526 or march 45 how do these dates suit id need to spend the night maybe that travellodge near you it is only one night cheers phil at 1604 30012009 david parker wrote phil thanks i hope the gcos meeting goes well roger saunders will be there we look forward to your thoughts on the antarctic data and to your visit whenever that may be convenient for you david on fri 20090130 at 1556 0000 pjonesueaacuk wrote david the swiss extremes workshop has afternoons off for skiing as i dont ive been on 60 or 90 mins walks along snow covered trails snow is 1m deep off the trails anyway back now so looking at emails as the sun drops the temperature plummets im at the gcos imp plan meeting next week in geneva back in cru on feb 6 ive been reading the steig et paper ive looked at homogeneity issues with the antarctic data in the past difficult to do much except in the peninsula anyway ill give your proposal some thought will talk to others like kevin t next week as well about the paper glad to hear ian is settling it would be good idea to do two things on the visit im sure we can think of more glad also youre helping out brian i just couldnt rearrange my uea teaching again already done this so i can be here now and geneva next week have good weekend if little cold cheers phil phil peter thorne and others have suggested that you visit us in the near future to set up project in which cru would homogenise the reader surface temperature data for antarctica this subject arose in connection with steig et als paper on antarctic temperatures in last weeks nature and is also relevant to the possibility that we may include interpolations over the arctic ocean and antarctica in our analyses for ipcc ar5 peter challenges the results of steig et on the grounds that the in situ surface temperatures may not be homogeneous maybe you could even give seminar on eg antarctic observations please let know when visit would be convenient for you you could of course combine it with review of ians progress ian is now well settled into using our computing systems and has started to calculate rbar from the daily precipitation fields for the uk regions with view to estimating uncertainties in the regionallyaveraged daily values as crosscheck and to gain deeper appreciation of this myself i have independently written some software to calculate rbar this is leading to some ideas which i will send to you when i have had more time to think them through i understand youre busy as i am expecting to attend the malaria meeting at imperial on 1213 feb when you arent available hope youve had good meetings in geneva david david parker met office hadley centre fitzroy road exeter ex1 3pb uk email davidparkermetofficegovuk tel 441392886649 fax 441392885681
