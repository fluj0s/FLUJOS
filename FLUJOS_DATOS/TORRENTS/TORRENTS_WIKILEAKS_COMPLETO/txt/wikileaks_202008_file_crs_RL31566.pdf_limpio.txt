2002 background and analysis presidents generally submit their budget proposals for the upcoming fiscal year early in each calendar year for fy2002 the bush administration presented its summary budget document blueprint for new beginnings on february 28 2001 the single volume contained general scription of the administrations policy proposals and expectations for the budget for fy2002 and for the years through fy2011 on april 9 2001 the administration released its full set of budget documents containing extensive and deta iled budget related information including estimates of the budget without the proposed policy changes current service baseline estimates historical budget data detailed outlay and receipt data selected analysis of specific budget related topics and the administrations economic forecast these detailed budget documents are an annual basic reference source for federal budget information in addition to their use as transmitter of the administrations policy proposals the administrations annual budget sub mission is followed by congressional action on the budget this usually includes the annual budget resolution appropriations and possibly reconc iliation bill or bills during the months of deliberation on budget relate d legislation the administration often modifies its proposals not only because of interactions with congress but because of changing circumstances in the economy and the world budget totals table 1 contains budget estimates and proposals for fy2002 from the congressional budget office cbo the ad ministration the office of management and budget omb and the congressional budget resolution differences in totals occur because of differing underlying economic technical and budgetestimating assumptions and techniques as well as differences in policy assumptions most policy differences between the administr ation and congressional proposals or assumptions for an upcoming fiscal year are often relatively small compared to the budget as whole these small oneyear differences may lead to large dollar differences over extended time periods budg et totals should be expected to change over time from those originally propos ed by the president or congress the terrorist attacks on the unite d states on september 11 2001 the 2001 recession changes to expected policies and technical changes in some underlying budgeteconomic

10year cumulative onbudget surplus the portion of the total surplus excluding social security and the postal service was 31 trillion president bushs fy2002 budget both the blueprint from february 2001 and the complete budget from april 2001 used the then expected positive economic and budget outlook over the 10year budget window to support his proposals to cut taxes and increase selected spending the pr oposals as measured against the 10year baseline included 16 trillion tax cut increases in defense education and medicare spending totaling 172 billi on which included both increases and decreases in other federa l activities the budget implied that there would be possible additional increases in defense spe nding after review of defense needs and because the policy proposals resulted in smalle r surpluses and higher levels of debt higher interest payments of 420 billion over the 10 years the policy changes according to the administration would leave cumulative 841 billion in the on budget surplus over the 10year budget horizon the proposals would assuming all the proposed policies were adopted and that the underlying assumptions proved correct eliminate 2 trillion of the ex isting 34 trillion publicly held debt by fy2011 for fy2002 the bush administration originally proposed surplus of 231 billion 52 billion below its baseline surplus and smaller than the then estimated 281 billion surplus for fy20012 the reduction in the surplus from the baseline surplus resulted from approximately equally sized increases in outlays and reductions in receipts from baseline leve ls the resulting original onbudget surplus was 59 billion in fy2002 52 billion below the baselin estimate and smaller than the then estimated 125 billion fy2001 onbudget surplus in the original administration budget documents the surplus reduction for fy2002 and all 10 years would have come from only the onbudget surplus reserving the offbudget surplus for reducing the federal debt held by

presidents original proposals for fy2002 the differences between the administra tions proposed amounts and those in the budget resolution were small compared to the amounts involved although there were differences in policy choices and emphasis cbos reestimates of the president s budget proposals m ay 2001 differed relatively little from the administration s numbers for fy2002 cbos estimates of the administrations proposed policy produced larger receipts by 9 b illion smaller outlays by 17 billion and larger surplu s by 26 billion than the administration over the 10year budget window cbo showed smaller cumulative receipts than the administration by approxima tely 200 billion larger cumulative outlays by 57httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31566crs4 3the bipartisan economic security plan if adopted as proposed would have increased outlays by 27 billion and reduced revenues by 64 billion in fy2002billion and smaller cumulative surplu s by approximately 250 billion these differences between the cbo reestimates and the administrations proposals were fairly small compared to the 26 trilli on in cumulative receipts and 22 trillion in cumulative outlays projected over the 10 year s the report also contained slightly revised cbo baseline estimates and projections the release of the administrations midsession review msr august 22 2001 substantially changed the shortterm and began showing negative changes to the longterm budget outlook and at that time was seen as increasing the difficulty of completing the new years budget legisl ation in particular the appropriations the continuing economic sluggishness combined with technical adjustments to the estimates and other less significant fact ors reduced the administrations estimated total surplus for fy2002 to 173 billion from 231 billion in april the msr also showed the nonsocial security surplus for fy2002 almost disappearing falling from the 56 billion estimated in april to the 1 billion estimated in august 2001 for the full 10year period covered by the budget window the msr showed cumulative total surplus of 31 trillion incorporating the administr ations remaining unadopted proposals and 38 trillion without the proposals cbos midyear report the economic and bu dget outlook an update update august 28 2001 mirrored the administration s msr the baseline numbers in the cbo report incorporated the effects of th continuing slowing economy the policy changes adopted since may 2001 particularly th tax cut and technical changes the results were much smalle r surpluses fo r fy2002 176 billion than had been

20032012 jan 2002the presidents midsession review for fy2003 july 15 2002 contained the administrations final official budget estimates for fy2002 the estimates reaffirm the deterioration in the budg et outlook for the year the deficit jumped to 165 billion from combination of much lowe r than expected receipts and somewhat higher spending policy changes and changes in technical budget assumptions produced most of the recent changes in budget expectations since the previous administration estimates cbos budget and economic outlook update august 27 2002 put the fy2002 deficit at 157 billion the substan tial change from an expected baseline surplus of 5 billion in march 2002 mostly resulted from reductions in expected revenues cbo estimated th at 43 billion of the revenue reduction came from the adoption of the economic stimulus legi slation in march 2002 and 104 billion came from technical reestimates4 the technical component of the reestimates measured change in the relationship between fe deral revenues and pe rsonal and corporate income cbos estimate of baseline outlays increased by 16 billion between march and august 2002 the treasury released final budget for th year subject to minor adjustments on october 25 2002 the year ended as fo recast in the august 2002 budget reports with deficit breaking the string of surpluses in the previous four years the deficit was 159 billion receipts were 1853 b illion and outlays were 2012 billion uncertainty in budget projections all budget estimates and projections are i nherently uncertain their dependence on assumptions that are themselves subj ect to substantial variation makes budget estimates and projections susceptible to fairly rapid and dramatic changes the changes in the budget estimates for fy 2002 between january 2001 and the summer of 2002 illustrate this volatility the estimate s stretching over five to 10 years into the future are subject to even greater volatility the september 2001 attacks on the united states the legislation adopted in re sponse the weakened economy and shift in critical underlying relationships all show how changes in the budgets environment can substantially alter the budg et path from the one originally expected or proposed cbo devotes chapter to budget uncer tainty in its annual budget report5 to illustrate the uncertainty of budget estimate s it provides two lternative budget path scenarios to its baseline estimate these alternative optimistic and pessimistic scenarios reflect changes to the conditions mostly economic variables but including some technical assumptions underlying the budget estimates the result of the cbo exercise especially over the 10year budg et window shows very large differencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31566crs6 6the budget numbers in the resolution differ so mewhat from those in the administrations proposals mostly because of differences in the underlying baselines and assumptions used by the committee and the administration rather than any fundamental differences in policy proposals the house budget committee used the january 2001 cbo budget report and its baseline to generate its budget resolution numbers the presidents proposals were derived from ombs baseline estimates and pr ojections cbo and omb differ although only slightly in their respective underlying ssumptions used in creating their respective budget baselinesof almost 1 trillion in fy2012 between the size of the timated surplus in the optimistic scenario and the deficit in the pessimistic scenario budget projections are very dependent on the underlying assumptions about the direction of the economy and future govern ment policy and how these interact any deviation from the expected underlying ssumptions such as faster or slower economic growth higher or lower infla tion differences from the assumed spending and tax policies or changes in the tec hnical components of the budget models can have substantial effects on the budget timates and projections and eventual budget outcomes budget action during the first five months of 2001 the house adopted series of bills hr 3 march 8 hr 6 march 29 hr 8 april 4 and hr 10 may 2 that would

resolution for the upcoming fiscal year expected problems in getting the evenly divided committee to agree on resolution discouraged the attempt instead the senate used the house passed budget resolution as the starting point for the debate the senate modified the house passed resolution by among other changes reducing the size of the proposed 16 trillion tax cut to approx imately 12

treasury can also take and has taken more active role in retiring debt held by the public by purchasing securities from the financial markets and retiring some ca llable federal bonds one result of the originally expected large surpluses was the then expected disappearance of much federal debt held by the public sometime in the latter half of the decade10 the august 2001 budget reports like the
