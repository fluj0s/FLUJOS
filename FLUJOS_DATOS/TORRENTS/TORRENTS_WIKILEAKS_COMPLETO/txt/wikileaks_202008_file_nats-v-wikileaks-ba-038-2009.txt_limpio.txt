quotedprintable dear sir 20 i am writing to you in connection with the above mentioned video which you have posted at the link below httpwwwwikileaksorgwikibritish_airways_flight_038_traffic_control _video2c_17_jan_200820 in parallel with this email to you i will also be making sworn representation as to the absolute copyright that nats limited has in the content of this video and will be requiring its removal under that right however i am writing to you separately to give you some background around this requirement so that it does not come across as merely the suppression of pubic information that you appear to portray on your website 20 the content of this recording contains material that is part of an ongoing air accident investigation it is nats policy to share this type of content only in environments where confidentiality can be preserved and where the furtherance of safety is the paramount concern without the guarantee of confidentiality air traffic controllers pilots and other key aviation workers are extremely reluctant to give full disclosure of circumstances surrounding air accidents and without full disclosure it is much harder for lessons to be learned that can assist in improving future air safety 20 mr burkill was part of that confidential reporting culture but chose to take this recording and use it without consent to publicise his forthcoming book that was the reason why nats required him to remove it from his website 20 pubic disclosure of this recording may be made by nats in due course but only at the appropriate time and with the consent of all relevant persons premature public disclosure damages nats stand for just culture among our employees but adds little to the public good apart from satisfying the publics general curiosity the longer the recording stays on your site the more damage is done to the trust we have earned from our employees and our partners in the aviation safety industry i am therefore asking you to please remove it in the interests of speed before the legal process you have established has to run its course 20 if you want to respond to this request or discuss it further then i would be happy to hear from you 20 yours sincerely richard churchillcoleman general counsel nats limited 44 07977 454421 if0ayou are not the intended recipient please notify our help desk at0aemail pos tmasternatscouk
