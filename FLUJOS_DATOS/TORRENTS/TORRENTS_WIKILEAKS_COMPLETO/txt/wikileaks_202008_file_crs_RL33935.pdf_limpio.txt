government and finance division december 21 2007 abstract in the 110th congress representative frank has introduced the shareholder vote on executive compensation act hr 1257 which was approved by the house on april 19 2007 soon afterwards senator obama introduced an identically named companion bill s 1181 the bills would require publicly held companies to hold annual nonbinding shareholder votes on their executive compensation plans and any new golden parachute compensation oﬀered to executives during mergers and acquisitions critics argue that excessive executive pay can be signiﬁcantly traced to the fact that the members of corporate boards are not suﬃciently independent of managerial inﬂuence in this view boards formulate executive pay packages that often allow executives to extract hefty compensation deals that bear little relationship to their contribution to the ﬁrmshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33935g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

officers ceos has more than doubled and the ratio of median ceo to worker pay has risen to 179 to 1 high and rising executive pay could be an issue of public concern on two different grounds first it is contributing to widening income inequality that may be of concern from an equity perspective second it could be the result of economically inefficient labor markets it is difficult to determine whether executive pay is excessive across the board since executives marginal product cannot be directly observed an upward trend in pay over time is not sufficient proo f that the market is not efficient since factors determining supply and demand such as the skills required of the position can change over time to show that pay is excessive from an economic perspective one must first demonstrate that there is market failure that is preventing the market from functioning efficiently the market failure could originate in the division in large modern firms between management and ownership which is typically dispersed among millions of shareholders shareholders interests are represented by board of directors critics of executive pay have argued that boards have all too often been captured by the executive and are longer negotiating pay packages that are in the shareholders best interests they point to number of common practices that they call stealth compensation which are inconsistent with arms length contracting these include golden parachutes generous severance packages companyprovided perks and bonuses that are unrelated to firm performance stock options have been the fastest growing portion of executive pay since the 1990s and critics believe this pattern can also be explained through the prism of stealth compensation rewarding executives with employee stock options was often justified in terms of the pay for performance mantra but options are usually designed to reward absolute not relative performance this means that in the bull market of the 1990s when virtually all stock prices were rising company could fall behind its competitors and its executives could still receive handsome options payouts indeed sizeable portion of the increase in executive pay in the 1990s was likely due to options that turned out to be much more valuable than expected because of the unprecedented price increases of the bull market many of the recent corporate scandals appear consistent with stealth compensation as well stock options backdating earnings manipulation and accounting fraud might have been motivated by attempts to covertly increase executive pay if shortterm fluctuations in the stock price are not good proxies of firm performance then tying compensation to the stock price can create incentives for executives to engage in activities that are detrimental to shareholders policy proposals mostly focus on improving transparency increasing board independence and strengthening shareholder control rather than ttempting to curb pay directly s 1181 obama and hr 1257 frank which the house approved on april 19 2007 would give shareholders nonbinding vote on executive pay another propos would modify the limit on deductibility of executive pay from corporate taxation more broadly income inequality could be reduced by increasing the progressivity of the tax system for current developments and legislation see crs report rs22604 excessive ceo

observers have characterized the annual pay packages awarded to the executives and chief executive officers ceos of the nation s largest firms as excessive according to one estimate the total median ceo pay at the nati ons 350 largest publicly owned firms grew from 27 million in 1995 to 68 million in 20051 the overall increase in ceo pay has outstripped inflation and the growth in nonmanagerial pay over the same period fueling criticism of executive compensation packages among the quite vociferous critics of executive pay are public officials academics shareholders and some members of congress for example william j mcdonough chairman of the public company accounting oversight board has said that there is nothing in economic theory to justify the levels of executive compensation that are widely prevalent today 2 warren buffett has observed that its difficult to overpay the truly extraordinary ceo of giant enterprise but this species is rare3 former securities and exchange commission sec chairman arthur levitt jr has written that these huge paydays i believe undermine corporate governance and send signal that boards are willing to spend shareholders money lavishly4 in addition 2006 survey found that 90 of institutional investors who are the largest owners of outstanding domestic corporate shares said that executives at most companies are overpaid5 there are also number of current examples of congressional concerns over executive pay for example the version of hr 2 the minimum wage bill passed by the senate on february 1 2007 included several tax provisions one of which applies to executive pay current tax rules permit individuals to defer taxes on income that is held in nonqualified deferred compensation plans under the senate version of hr 2 an individual could defer more than 1000000 annually from taxable income by contributing to such plan6 the version passed by the house had similar provision arguing for the cap chairman max baucus of the senate finance committee which unanimously passed the tax provisions that became part of the senate version of hr 2 observed rankandfile workers generally have to pay taxes on their compensation when they earn it the exception is deferred compensation provided through qualified retirement plans with statutory limits on contributions and benefits 401k is the best example management on 1 see testimony of frederic w cook co before the house financial services committee on executive compensation may 25 2006 cook cos data were prov ided by mercer human resources consulting total pay includes salary bonuses deferred compensation and incentive pay such as stock grants and stock options the median measurement is the middle observation in the sample if an average had been used instead both figures would have been higher there are official estimates for executive pay however private estimates have been made based on data that public corporations are required to file in their annual

boards of directors work as effective independent checks they are not the fox guarding the hen house they are the hens guarding the rooster and i think the time has come to say we need the shareholders to do this 8 in the 110th congress representative frank has introduced the shareholder v ote on executive compensation act hr 1257 which was approved by the house on april 19 2007 soon afterwards senator obama introduced an identically named companion bill s 1181 the bills would require publicly held companies to hold annual nonbinding shareholder votes on their executive compensation plans and any new golden parachute compensation offered to executives during mergers and acquisitions critics argue that excessive executive pay can be significantly traced to the fact that the members of corporate boards are not sufficiently independen t of managerial influence in this view boards formulate executive pay packages that often allow executives to extract hefty compensation deals that bear little relationship to their contribution to the firms in addition if corporate executives are overpaid other potentially significant concerns include the following issues over pay inequality and worker productivity according to one estimate between 1994 and 2005 the ratio of annual median ceo pay to median production worker pay nearly doubled growing from 90 to 1 to 179 to 1 9 indeed for many workers the perceived excessiveness of executive pay has become the most visible embodiment of growing pay inequality contributing to feeling that workers have not shared in the gains from economic growth for example adjusted for inflation average worker pay rose 8 from 1995 to 2005 10 median ceo pay at the 350 largest firms rose about 150 over the same period and while it is very difficult to quantify the impact of executive pay packages on worker morale and productivity there are concerns that both could be affected detrimentally for example there have been several high profile stories of executives who have laid off employees at the same time their own compensation was rising potentially negative direct impact on shareholder returns if executive compensation has been receiving share of corporate resources that far exceeds the executives contribution to the firms value shareholder returns may be compromised although not directly addressing the issue of whether increases in executive pay have been accompanied by commensurate increases in their value 7 congressional record january 24 2007 pp s1011s1048 8 congressman barney frank outlines his

executives relative to corporate earnings at sp 1500 firms between 19931995 and 2001 2003 it found that the ratio of executive pay to aggregate corporate earnings doubled between the two periods11 potential proxy for subpar board performance in monitoring executives when corporate board is unable to get handle on excessive ceo pay it may be sign of the boards failings in its central role of corporate governance purported link between excessive executive pay and the corporate scandals of recent years critics argue that misalignment of incentives from executive pay helps explain the occurrence of scandals involving stock options backdating accounting fraud and earnings manipulation but this managerial power perspective of how flawed corporate governance serves to inflate ceo pay is at odds with an alternative notion that the increase has largely been function of natural marketdriven changes in the demand and supply for ceos for example during 2006 interview with the wall street journal then treasury secretary john snow observed that in an aggregate sense ceo pay reflects the marg inal productivity of ceos until we can find better way to compensate ceos im going to trust the marketplace 12 like secretary snow others argue that market forces are more likely than government to solve any problems that do exist with excessive pay in his state of the economy address on january 31 2007 president bush said government should not decide the compensation for americas corporate executives but the salaries and bonuses of ceos should be based on their success at improving their companies and bringing value to their shareholders americas corporate boardrooms must step up to their responsibilities you need to pay attention to the executive compensation packages that you approve you need to show the world that american businesses are model of transparency and good corporate governance whether or not policy intervention is merited to tackle the issue of executive pay will depend on whether the managerial power or the marketbased view of executive pay is the accurate one given congressional concerns with the potentially serious implications of excessive executive pay this report examines critical and supportive evidence surrounding the premise that the executives are generally overpaid from an economic perspective the report also provides brief history of executive pay regulation and analyzes policy options but first the report looks more closely at the available data g6g138g157g138g561g152g151g561g5g7g17g561g18g138g162g561 median ceo

not the first time that ceo pay had risen rapidly it also rose by about one half from 1982 to 198713 as important as the trend in the level of ceo pay is the trend in the composition of ceo pay since 1995 median annual cash salary has risen relatively slowly from 07 million in 1995 to about 1 million in 2006 but over the same pe riod median performancebased pay which includes stock and stock option grants grew 13 year from 13 million to 41 million as will be discussed later the role of stock and stock options in executive pay helps explain why it rose so quickly in the 1990s and why it

awarded to ceos in other nations is often mentioned as evid ence that american executives are overpaid for example controlling for various firm characteristics such as size one study examined pay for ceos in the united states and the united kingdom uk in 2003 it found that ceo pay in the united states to be about 13 times that of ceos in the uk and argued that significant portion of the greater us ceo pay could be attributed to the higher proportion of equitybased pay such as stock options in the united states and the higher risk premiums associated with such pay 14 research on japanese

high and rising executive pay could be cause for policy concern on efficiency grounds or on equity grounds current pay levels would be economically inefficient if they resulted from market failure that prevented pay levels from reflecting an equilibrium between supply and demand in the labor market for executives if so policy response might be justified on the grounds that resources could be allocated in the economy more efficiently however even if pay levels were the result of perfect competition policymakers could still be concerned that high executive pay resulted in an inequitable distribution of wealth that had negative social ramifications the grounds for concern about executive pay matters greatly in determining the appropriate policy response if current pay levels are economically efficient then policy responses that disrupted the market outcome would lead to misallocation of resources and deadweight loss by distorting peoples career choices rather than targeting executive pay specifically more economically efficient response to address equity concerns would be through the normal channels of government redistribution such as the progressivity of the tax system and social welfare spending although it should be noted that these channels create efficiency tradeoffs of their own equity concerns are at heart matters of competing societal values for which economic theory cannot offer definitive answers the noneconomic gains of policies to improve equity would need to be balanced against their economic costs some economists argue that the trend in executive pay is not just an equity issue it is the result of market imperfections that allow executives to manipulate the market outcome if this is the case then executive pay is causing resources to be misallocated to an extent that is arguably nonnegligible for example one study estimated that the compensation of the top five executives averaged 66 of total corporate earnings from 1993 to 2003 17 other economists argue that despite its flaws the market for executive pay delivers results that are close enough to efficiency that potential policy changes run the risk of doing more harm than good18 this section first describes how the market would determine executive pay under perfect competition the socalled neoclassical approach and then considers realworld deviations from that model readers who would first like brief description of the mechanics of setting executive pay should read how executive compensation is set in the box below 16 for example see eric wahlgren spreading the

competition the compensation of an executive or any worker is determined by the executives marginal product19 in other words the executive will be paid just as much as the revenue he contributes to the firm if the firm tries to pay him less than his marginal product he will seek employment elsewhere if the firm tries to pay him more it will be undercut by competitors who are paying their executives at competitive rate and become unprofitable number of economists and business experts believe this world view is reasonable facsimile of reality for example roy smith professor of finance at new york university has written that the best chief executives have proven track records demonstrating management ability in large complex corporate situations such people are always in demand but most get only one shot at being ceo and they want to make the most of it they also know that the rate of ceo turnover at large corporations has incr eased significantly in recent years and that 50 percent of departures are the result of mergers or performance issues if things go wrong their contracts may be all they have to hang on to so they negotiate the best ones they can going in todays ceos are paid well when they deserve to be and sometimes when they dont but most corporate directors will tell you that over the past 20 years public companies have become better managed with increased profit margins productivity and returns on investment 20 in this model high pay is not sign of an executive being overpaid it is sign that the executive is highly productive it therefore follows that the burden of proof should be on critics to show that the high level of executive pay is not simply reflection of the executives strong skills hard work and successful business strategies nor from this perspective is the relative increase in executive pay compared to worker pay necessarily sign of excessive pay the superior performance of us firms on average over the past decade relative to foreign firms and us firms in the past could be taken as evidence in favor of the neoclassical model it could also be that the increase in pay is driven by relative increase in the demand for executives if running 19 in economic theory perfect competition exists in market with many buyers and sellers barriers to entry and perfect information and when the costs and benefits of the transaction are completely borne by the buyer and seller 20 roy c smith worth every last million washington post january 21 2007 p b1

markets are now more competitive or firms are more complexit would be expected in neoclassical world that firms would be willing to pay more now in order to at tract these skills for example economists have described superstar effect where the pay of entertainment celebrities rose once their market draw increased through the development of mass media21 because so much of the market is captured by few individuals small differences in talent or public preferences lead to large differences in pay some economists have suggested similar effect may be at work in the market for executives as firms have gotten larger and begun to operate in global rather than domestic market the value that executives can add to firm has increased and their compensation has followed suit using this logic one study conc luded that the sixfold increase of ceo pay between 1980 and 2003 can be fully attributed to the sixfold increase in market capitalization 22 in the neoclassical model executive pay is held in check not just by competition in the labor market for executives but also by competitive forces in capital markets and the firms product markets the key point made by this model is that for an executive to be overpaid the firm must be generating excess profits that the executive is able to skim off and in world of perfect competition excess profits profits beyond normal riskadjusted rate of return exist for the executive to capture23 it could be argued that the amount the executives are skimming off is too negligible to affect the firms profitability but if so excessive compensation is presumably of rather minor importance there is ample evidence that capital markets and most product markets are efficient so for executives to be overpaid without placing their firms at competitive disadvantage there must be something in the compensation arrangement that is placing most firms at the same disadvantage otherwise the company would be unable to raise sufficient capital or become vulnerable to hostile takeover 24 in world of perfect competition there is need to try to measure whether executives are overpaid because excessive pay is an unsustainable outcome that would be driven out by market forces for executives to be overpaid something must be impeding the efficient market allocation of resources economists who have argued that executives are overpaid have pointed to the principalagent problem as the market failure that could lead to executives being widely overpaid

the principalagent problem is wellknown market failure that exists when principals owners interests are represented by an agent in this case the ceo whose goals or incentives diverge from the principal and the principal is unable to closely enough monitor the agent to keep their interests aligned the agent could be pursuing any number of private interests including minimizing his own effort maximizing his own reputation by unprofitably expanding 21 sherwin rosen the economics of superstars american economic review vol 71 5 december 1981 p 845 22 in the study gabaix and landier present theoretical model showing that with scarce ceo talent ceos pay would increase when firms get larger they believe this explains why pay has risen over time and why it is higher on average in america than abroad xavier gabaix and augustin landier why has ceo pay increased so much national bureau of economic research working paper 12365 july 2006 23 most economists believe that markets are typically better described by model of imperfect competition where firms have some market power than perfect competition but the results for both are the same in model of imperfect competition there are barriers to entry so firms are still not generating excess profits that executives could potentially skim off some economists argue that even in markets where one firm wields significant market power the threat of potential entry is enough to keep the firm from collecting significant excess profits 24 admittedly there are barriers to corporate takeovers such as poison pills that make the takeover market less than perfectly efficient as well httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33935g22g145g142g561g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g156g561g152g143g561g5g152g155g153g152g155g138g157g142g561g7

example covering up his own mistakes minimizing risk and so on the key point is that the agent is not always pursuing the principals goal profit maximization profit maximization is in the agents selfinterest only insofar as it maximizes his own compensation or wellbeing yet there is tradeoff since an incr ease in the agents pay decreases the companys profits all else equal for publicly listed corporation the principalagent problem is particularly hard to avoid because of another wellknown market failure the freerider problem for publicly listed corporation the collective principal is the firms thousands of shareholders assuming for moment that barriers to shareholder action which will be discussed below did not exist it is still unlikely that shareholders could avoid the principalagent problem because it would be highly costly for any individual shareholder or group of shareholders to monitor the agent any benefits that resulted from monitoring the executives would not be captur ed solely by the shareholders undertaking the monitoring they would flow to all shareholders he nce it is in any individual shareholders self interest to leave monitoring the executives to other shareholders since that will lead to the same benefit with none of the cost of personal monitori ng as result every shareholder chooses not to monitor and this is the essence of the freerider problem in theory the firms board of directors is meant to safeguard the shareholders interests and monitor the firms executives the freerider problem has been overcome by the shareholders banding together and appointing board to represent them but does the board really represent the shareholders interests for the board faces principalagent problem of its own since each board members financial stake in the firm typically makes up negligible share of the firms total value the board members may also have an incentive to pursue private interests other than profit maximization this incentive opens the door to number of ways in which the executives could capture the board so that the board memb ers were not truly independent as will be discussed below in this context it is easy to see how an endemic problem of overpaying executives could potentially arise 25 since neither the executives nor the board are acting solely in the shareholders interests they may agree to pay the executive more than his marginal product since executives at competing firms are also overpaid the firms performance would not fall behind its competitors if the burden of proof is on critics to prove that the real world outcome does not match the neo classical ideal then the managerial power critique discussed in the following section attempts to make comprehensive case that the principalagent problem has led to excessive executive pay

cannot numerically estimate how much executives are overpaid bf argue it is prima facie evidence that executives are paid excessively and pursue the goal of maximizing pay rather than shareholder value the primary elements of the managerial power critique are laid out below g4g152g138g155g141g561g515g5g138g153g157g158g155g142g516g561 the neoclassical model assumes that executive pay is determined through arms length contracting in negotiating the executives pay the board of directors typically through its compensation committee is charged with driving the best bargain it can obtain on behalf of shareholders bf argue that the typical board stru cture has little in common with this ideal in many corporations the ceo is also the chairman of the board and other company insiders who may be loyal to the ceo serve on the board bf argue these arrangements are susceptible to the boards being captured by the executives some fears of board capture were allayed in 2003 when the nyse required that boards of its listed companies have majority of outside directors and the boards nominating compensation and audit committees consist solely of outside directors the nasdaq s similar rules except for those pertaining to the compensation and nominating committees but even outsiders who serve on the board may owe their positionsand hence bf argue their allegianceto the ceo for example the only candidates who appear in the official proxy given to shareholders for election are individuals selected by the boards nominating committee it is commonly perceived that the ceo strongly influences the nominating committees selections shareholders can withhold support from director but cannot vote against director which means that director technically needs only one favorable vote to be elected there are few ways that the shareholders can directly select members of the board alternative directors proposed by shareholders are costly difficult and rare board members may feel that they must keep on the ceos good side in order to be re nominated when their terms expire furthermore board members are frequently executives at other corporations which may make them predisposed to view executive compensation requests favorably and may make them hesitant to be critical board members since their criticisms could be used against them at their own companies boards are also dependent on executives to furnish them with information and advice in order to fulfill their duties and must maintain the executives good will in order to receive this information in fact the ceo compensation packages that boards approve typically originate from the companys human resources department which of course is subordinate to the ceo if boards are captured by the executives one woul d expect that arms length bargaining would be compromised there is evidence that less independent boards are correlated with higher executive pay all else equal 27 some studies have shown that ceo pa is

compensation is higher when the ceo picked the boards outside directors29 there are studies that found that executive pay is lower in situations where shareholders have more influence over the boardfor example when there is single large shareholder or institutional shareholders with significant ownership position30 companies often hire outside compensation consultants to help them determine the level and characteristics of the executive compensation package but bf argue that these consultants can also be captured by management because the consultants are eager for more business from the firm including business unrelated to executive compensation as result they tell the executives what they want to hear if shareholders thought that the board was allo wing executives to be overpaid institutional barriers would limit their influence over the board the general terms of the companys overall performancebased compensation packages such as stock options plans may be subject to an up or down vote by the shareholders but shareholders cannot modify the details of the package or offer alternatives only fifteen of 2000 options plans were voted down by shareholders from july 1997 to june 199831 shareholders can introduce resolutions on executive pay but even if they attract majority of voters the resolutions may not be binding32

executive compensation levels are outrage costs fear on the part of executives that if their compensation is too excessive they will face hostility from shareholders and negative publicity from the media33 bf argue that outrage costs have two effects first they reduce executive compensation levels below what they would otherwise be this factor works to the extent that outrage existsbf argue one reason why executive pay rose in the late 1990s is because ceos were exalted during the stock market boom causing outrage costs to diminish continued independent directors executive pay and firm

compensationcompensation delivered in form that is difficult for shareholders and the public to understandin order to avoid outrage golden parachutes generous severance or retirement packages details of which do not have to be disclosed beforehand golden hellos additional incentives to join company34 life insurance deferred compensation personal loans before the sarbanesoxley act bonuses that are not linked to company performance and comp anyprovided perks in the form of vehicles aircraft and club memberships are all examples of stealth compensation bf believe that the rapid growth in executive stock options is explained by the desire for stealth compensation from neoclassical perspective it is difficult to understand why stock options are awarded rather than stockwhen the options are too far underwater the stock price is below the options strike price35 there is incentive effect and when it is close to the strike price executives may be extremely risk averse for fear that the option will fall below the strike price after they are exercised options cease to have any influence on executives behavior and options unlike stock are not necessarily aligned with the shareholders interest since they discourage the payment of dividends ie the money can be used to buy back the stock to boost its price instead but bf argue that from the managerial power perspective the prevalence of stock options is logical because accurately pricing options at the time they are granted is complex and controversial until recently options were not expensed on firms balance sheet so some argued this treatment made their effect on shareholder value less transparent stock options may also be way to increase compensation without generating as much shareholder outrage since options are worth more when the stock price is high and shareholders are doing well without exposing the executives to any risk when the share price falls below the strike price bf also attribute the ratcheting up of executive pay to outrage costs executive pay is often set relative to some selfselected peer group typically identified by the compensation consultant to justify compensation levels the board sets ceo pay somewhat higher than the industry average reasoning that its executive is an above average performer which critics have compared to the mythical lake wobegon where all of the children were above average 36 of course it is mathematically impossible for everyones performance to be above average but as long as compensation is close to the industry norm shareholders are unlikely to complain and the company is unlikely to attract unwanted publicity but if each executive is having their pay set above the average then the average will rise over timeinadvertently the practice will cause pay to be ratcheted up to levels that may have little to do with marginal product if pay levels are set based on peer groups they will also be insensitive to performance the subject of the next section

relentless focus on how much ceos are paid diverts public attention from the real problem how ceos are paid in most publicly held companies the compensation of top executives is virtually independent of performance is it any wonder then that so many ceos act like bureaucrats rather than the valuemaximizing entrepreneurs that companies need37 according to their estimates 100 increase in firm value led to 26 cents median increase in ceo wealth of which cash compensation rose only 4 cents38 they argued that the way to solve the principalagent problem was to align executive incentives with profit maximization by making compensation more sensitive to the firms performance they estimated executive compensation was more sensitive to firm performance than workers wages one way to accomplish this goal was through performancebased bonuses another way was by compensating executives with firm stock or stock options so that when executives made decisions that made the firm more profitable the firms stock price would rise causing the value of the executives compensation to rise in theory executives would longer wish to pursue private goals that undermine firm profitability because it would reduce their compensation the authors argued that if pay were more closely linked to performance average pay would probably rise because bad executives would be forced out more talented individuals would be drawn to managing executives would be motivated to work harder and firm performance would improve in addition pay would need to be higher if it were riskier since incentivebased pay would fall if the executive missed the performance benchmarks because individuals must be compensated to take on risk they argued that performancebased pay could exacerbate inequality but society as whole would be better off overall while most studies confirmed that cash pay and bonuses were fairly unresponsive to firm performance the literature is divided about the relation of total pay to performance once executive stock holdings and stock options are included for example hall and liebman argue that pay for performance rose throughout the 1980s and early 1990s because of the rising share of compensation that consisted of stock and stock options 39 they estimate that ceo wealth rose about sixty cents for every 100 increase in firm value in 1994 significantly higher than jensen and murphys earlier estimate furthermore they argue that executive pay is much more sensitive to performance than jensen and murphys measure implies because the firms involved are so large that even if the ratio of the change in wealth and the change in firm value is small the dollar change in wealth is very large for example they estimated that ceo who increased the performance of his company from below average to above average would increase the median value of his stock holdings by 4 million all else equal similarly core et estimated that the median portfolio value of an sp 500 ceos own firm holdings was 301 million in 2003 and 37 see for example michael jensen and kevin murphy its not how much you pay but how harvard business review 3 may 1990 p 138 38 michael jensen and kevin murphy

in the firms stock price would cause the median portfolio value to change by 43000040 in the context of this report this shift to socalled performancebased pay turns out to be important because it was the source of most of the rise in executive pay in the 1990s and 2000s the estimated value of options granted to ceos at the time of the grant increased ninefold from 1992 to 2000 while other types of compensation rose threefold over that period

noncash executive compensation should not be taken as sign that pay is now tied more closely to performance the managerial power critique identifies several standard components of executive pay that may appear to be performancebased pay but arguably allow executives to circumvent the link between pay and performance in practice for example severance packages often handsomely reward executives for leaving their jobs on good or bad terms these packages have only negative effects on incentives since they send the message that regardless of whether an executive succeeds or fails he will be rewarded after the fact bonuses should be an important part of performancebased pay but studies have found that instead they are often paid for reasons unrelated to profit maximization41 bf identify several common characteristics of stock options that seem inconsistent with the pay for performance mantra stock options are almost always designed to reward absolute performance rather than relative performance42 for example if companys stock price rises by just as much as the overall market then the executives compensation will have risen because of trends largely beyond his control even if co mpany is outperformed by its competitors the options could still have value in bull market since rising tide lifts all ships furthermore stock options are usually granted at the money they have strike price equal to the market price at the time the option is granted since stocks usually rise over time this will generally reward executives for doing nothing phenomenon warren buffett characterized as royalty for the passage of time 43 once exercised usually after vesting period the options longer provide executives with any incentives there is also more basic question to ask in instances where firms offered incentivebased pay why did it typically supplement rather than substi tute for cash salary the thrust of the pay for performance argument was that executives should be paid differently

incompetent executives as many academic obeservers prescribed everyone was made better off besides pay some argue that executives have degree of job security that is at odds with the pay for performance mantra for example murphy found that the correlation between firm performance and ceo turnover was low and fell in the 1990s to statistically insignificant relationship44 ceos also have more contractual job protection than employees schwab and thomas found that only 25 of 375 of the ceos they examined served at will like regular employees while the remainder could only be dismissed

the corporate scandals of recent years have brought greater scrutiny to executive pay practices particularly stockbased and optionbased compensation linking compensation to the stock price can only mitigate the principalagent problem if the stock price is an accurate proxy for firm value the assumption that it is good proxy is at the heart of the efficient market hypothesis and most economists would consider it true over long periods of time but it is difficult to argue that the stock price is good proxy for firm value over short time periods when stock prices tend to fluctuate widely and unpredictably implying that the value of the firm can fluctuate by millions or even billions of dollars in matter of days if it is not good proxy potential problem arises because the agents incentive is linked to goal that is not perfectly aligned with the principals interests in other words the agent can increase his compensation by taking advantage ofor even causingshortterm changes in the firms stock price which could be detrimental to the longterm performance of the firm unsurprisingly the agent may decide to take actions that boost the shortterm stock price when the firms longterm prospects are bleak in this situation the large stock and stock option holdings of the typical executive arguably offer powerful incentive to take actions to boost the stock price long enough to divest ones stock holdings in this context performancebased pay exacerbates the principalagent problem this problem was the essence of many of the corporate scandals that followed the 2001 recession some of the scandals involved executives pumping up the firms stock price by manipulating reported earnings in order to increase their performancebased pay or prevent it from falling 46 other scandals revolved around executives attempting to hide financial problems from the public to prevent their stock and option holdings from losing value in other cases executives used inside information to exercise their options before the firms share price fell likewise the ongoing scandal involving the backdating of stock options revolves around executives retroactively manipulating the timing of the option grant to day when the firms stock price was unusually low in order to increase the options value when it is exercised 47 these scandals suggest that on balance the principalagent problem seems to have survived the shift to performancebased pay intact in fact the growth of performance based pay and accounting 44 kevin murphy executive compensation in orley ashenfelter and david card eds

seems to have gone handinhand700 firms issued financial restatements from 1997 to 2000 compared with 11 from 1992 to 1993 when performancebased pay was less prevalent48 burns and kedia find that firms whose executives have higher share of optionbased compensation are more likely to restate their earnings49 while the incentives for executives to manipulate earnings seems straightforward the rationale for the boards failure to prevent it seems less clear the board would not profit substantially from manipulation 50 and could face high costs if the manipulation is detected unless board capture has occurred or the board is operating under the same shortterm time horizon as the executives51 of course the board may have been unaware of the executives actions but that may raise the question of why it did not monitor the executives more closely there may also be human tendency to use less scrutiny when results appear positive although the corporate scandals that have unfolded over the past few years may not be proof of the managerial power theory they can be shown to be consistent with it boosting pay through accounting fraud and earnings smoothing is consistent with executives desire for stealth pay bergstresser and philippon show that at firms that appear to have managed earnings executives exercise options and sell stock at higher rate than average and have greater share of performancebased pay52 the failure of the board to prevent such activities is consistent with board capture allowing executives to exercise their options at their discretion after vesting period is primarily what made accounting fraud and manipulation profitable yet there is little purpose in allowing options to be exercised at will if the options are meant to keep the executives interests aligned with the shareholders on an ongoing basis it is also difficult to see why firms would allow backdated options except to mask the true size of executive compensation relative to the performance required to earn the compensation firms could have legally paid executives just as much by either issuing them more options or options with lower strike price but doing so would have drawn more attention from shareholders and the media one study found that favorably dated option grants potentially caused by backdating was onethird more likely at firms where independent directors did not make up majority of the board 53 48 patrick bolton et pay for shortterm performance national bureau of economic research working paper 12107 march 2006 49 natasha burns and simi

recent study that found that outside directors also received stock options whose timing was characteristic of back dating in 9 of all cases lucian bebchuk et lucky directors harvard law school working paper december 2006 51 bolton et derive model where earnings manipulation may be in the shareholders and by extension the boards self interest in their model it is possible for the ceo to artificially increase the stock price temporarily above its fundamental value the ceo can then exercise his options and profit from the artificially high price before the price falls back to its fundamental value this arrangement could suit current shareholders since they could sell while the stock price is inflated and profit at the expense of future shareholders who buy the stock at the inflated price this reasoning could also be applied to the board since it represents the interests of current shareholders but not future shareholders patrick bolton et pay for shortterm performance national bureau of

the phenomena that bf identify on their findings critics have disagreed with the following if pay were determined by managerial power then executives hired from the outside should not receive the same generous pay packages as insiders but they do 54 bf reply that the board and compensation consultants have the same incentive to reward someone who will have influence over their welfare in the future as they do over someone who can influence it now bfs claim that executive pay is not well linked to performance as noted above some studies have argued that executive pay is highly sensitive to performance because of their large holdings of their firms stocks and options which gives them powerful incentives to maximize the firms profitability bfs ability to explain the change in executive pay over time first bfs theory depends on the ceos ability to capture the board so that it does not act in the shareholders interests yet boards have become more independent and active in recent years 55 for example in 2003 the nyse and nasdaq required that majority of companys directors must be independent in order to be listed on their exchanges second changes to sec rules required more disclosure of options granted to executives in 1992at the very time that options began to increase in value this pattern seems at odds with bfs argument that executives prefer options because they are form of stealth compensation third murphy argues that outrage costs were much higher in the early 1990s with the introduction of legislation and new regulations to curb pay than the late 1990s when compensation escalated 56 although executive pay is higher in the united states than abroad that could be evidence in favor of efficient markets since the united states stock market has consistently outperformed foreign stock markets this finding casts doubt on bfs claim that excessive pay is undermining firm profitability 57 alternative explanations have been offered for several of the phenomena that the managerial power theory describes some of them are related to the incentives offered by accounting rules for example the shrinking share of executive compensation being paid in cash wages has been attributed to the million dollar cap on pay that corporations are able to deduct from taxes which is described below similarly certain standard characteristics of options such as setting the strike price equal to the actual price at time of issue and using options that reward absolute instead of 54 murphy claims that total compensation is higher for outsiders than insiders kevin murphy

rules that until recently see below did not require that options wi th those characteristics be expensed hall and murphy have argued that the managerial power theory cannot adequately explain the recent burgeoning of stock option compensation because most stock options 90 in 2002 are paid to nonexecutives they offer perceived cost theory of why stock options have become so popular because stock options do not require the company to outlay any cash when granted and were not expensed in the companys accounting statements before the rule change in 2005 they argue that options became popular because they appeared costless to issue 58 on the contrary options do have costthey dilute the existing shareholders ownership position when they are realized the shortcoming of this explanation is it begs the question of whom hall and murphy believed were being duped into thinking the options were costlessthe board or the shareholders in the former case bf argue that if directors had so little financial sophistication then the boardmonitoring model of corporate governance is in even worse shape than our analysis suggests 59 in the latter case the perceived cost argument is consistent with but not proof of the managerial power view that options are form of stealth compensation alternatively the perceived cost view could be rejected on the grounds of market efficiency for example although options were not expensed information about the options were included in the footnotes to corporations financial statements if market actors use all of the information available to them as market efficiency requires then the stock price would already reflect the information presented in the footnotes and the stock price would decline all else equal when options were granted otherwise market participants who were aware of the real costs associated with options could systematically profit by shortselling firms that offered employees overly generous stock options it has also been suggested that there are alternative explanations to the managerial power theory for why executive compensation could exceed marginal product in wellknown article lazear and rosen argued that executive pay could be much higher than the executives marginal product and still be economically efficient from the perspective of the overall firm 60 they argued that this could be true if the firms pay structure is likened to tournament if the firm has easy way to accurately identify each of its workers marginal product then the most efficient way to induce maximum effort from its workers could be to attach large monetary incentive to the winner of each promotion at the top of this ladder is the ceo with correspondingly larger prize each step of the way to motivate workers to strive fo r further promotions as long as the ceos high pay motivates his subordinates to work harder to strive to some day replace him it will be profitable for the firm to compensate him at that rate regardless of his marginal product anabtawi argues that the tournament model explains why executive pay is not more closely linked to performance because reductions would weaken incentives of subordinates to try to win the tournament 61 58 brian hall and kevin murphy the trouble with stock options journal of economic perspectives vol 17 3 summer 2003 p 49 the company also has tax

g22g146g150g142g501g561 the decision to base executive stock options in the 1990s on absolute performance rather than relative performance had important implications during the stock market boom of the 1990s when the board chooses how much stock option co mpensation to award to an executive it is basing its decision on the ex expected value of the options but actual executive pay depends on what happens to the stock price ex post for example if an executive were granted one option with strike price of 40 and the board expected the stock price to rise to 50 when the executive exercised it the executives expected pay gain ex would be 10 but if the stock price actually rose to 60 his actual pay increase would be 20double what the board expected him to earn strong case can be made that since the sharp appreciation in stock prices in the 1990s was largely unexpected much of the pay increase tied to the stock price or other metrics of firm performance was also unexpected windfalls for example in the 50 years preceding december 1995 the inflationadjusted annual appreciation rate of the standard poors 500 stock index averaged 2362 from december 1995 to december 1999 the average real rate of appreciation was 228 figure 2 shows the expected value based on the historical average and actual value for stock option issued in december 1994 and exercised at any point from december 1995 to 1999 if the company set the strike price at the firms current stock price and expected the stock price to follow the historical average then th company would expect the nominal stock price to rise about 26 by 1999 instead the average stock over that period rose by 214 in nominal value assuming strike price at the firms current stock price the actual payment from options over that period would be over eight times higher than expected for the average firm 63 62 the nominal 50year average appreciation rate was 68 this figure does not represent the average rate of return on stocks which includes dividend payments dividend payments are not included since options are based solely on the stock price one drawback to historical comparison is that dividend payments have become smaller

500 actual and pr ojected based on historical v era ge 19951999 source crs calculations based on data constru cted by robe rt shiller yale university figure 2 suggests that much of the increase in pay in the 1990s may have been unrelated to competitive forces or managerial power but instead was unanticipated on the part of executives and board directors in rapidly rising market almo st all executives regardless of talent or effort arguably profited from being in the right place at the right time64 but even if the windfall was unintentional that begs the question of why executive pay did not fall further in the 2000s when the stock market declined by nearly one half it would be expected that boards would react to the stock option windfalls received by executives in the 1990s by offering less generous stock options from that point on or tying future options to relative rather than absolute performance indeed even if directors had made changes to ex option packages one might expect sharp declines in optionbased pay from 2000 to 2003 since stock prices were falling instead overall pay fell by only 11 between 2001 and 2003 which was still higher than it was in 2000 and returned to its previous peak in 2004 which seems difficult to reconcile with the neoclassical model while windfalls are consistent with arms length contracting in world of uncertainty executives would not be expected in neoclassical world to permanently lock in windfall payments after the source of the windfall had disappeared this experience does seem consistent with the managerial power theory however shareholder satisfaction with the large stock market returns of the 1990s may have greatly reduced the outrage costs associated with the corresponding increase in executive stock options executives may have been able to maintain those pay increases in the 2000s despite the fall in the stock market by using past pay levels as benchmark for future pay as way to limit outrage

defined from an equity perspective in terms of material need or in relation to the pay of others in society in economic discussions concerning the efficient allocation of resources these definitions are not likely to be useful from an economic perspective the 64 since the stock market boom was largely unanticipated the need to design pay packages that avoid windfalls ex was probably unforeseeable at first although it certainly became more obvious as the boom persisted

to be whether or not pay exceeds marginal product unfortunately economists have way to directly measure an executives marginal product what monetary value should be placed on say decision making so there is way to directly determine whether executives are being overpaid in absolute terms in the neoclassical model that is not concern since body is overpaid all that can be measured is what specific executives are being paid relative to others and how their firms have performed based on profitability rate of return stock price and so on relative to others many economists have attempted to determine whether executive pay is correlated with firm success in these studies executives with above average compensation can be thought to have earned it if their firm outperformed its rivals 65 as useful as this exercise may be it should be noted that it does not attempt to answer the underlying question of whether overall executives are excessively paid on average and whether firms could achieve the same results if they paid their executives less some economists define excessive pay more broadly than the marginal product definition defining it in terms of executives who are capturing economic rents taken literally an economic rent is defined as any level of pay above the workers reservation wage which is the lowest wage the worker would be willing to accept to work 66 thus according to this definition an executive could be paid less than the value he adds to the firm ie his marginal product but still be overpaid since he would have been willing to perform the same job for less this broader definition is somewhat problematic from measurement perspectivesince the reservation wage cannot be observed classifying an executive as overpaid becomes purely subjective in perfectly competitive labor market one would expect the reservation wage to converge with marginal product since there are very large number of interchangeable workers for any job and jobs for any worker in the market for executives where the candidates and openings are limited and not perfectly substitutable wedge between the reservation wage and marginal product could theoretically exist but it would be expected that the wedge would ultimately be limited by the fact that any executive paid less than his marginal product could be profitably snatched away by another firm willing to pay slightly more furthermore the rent will exist whether it is captured by the executive or the firms shareholders therefore equating the executives capture of the rent with excessive pay and all the negative connotations that entails implies that one views capital shareholders as more deserving recipient of the rent than labor defining excessive pay as pay above marginal product remains less controversial since it has clearer implications for economic efficiency arguments about efficiency mostly come down to incentive effectsthe fear that attempts to curb executive compensation would also reduce executive productivity this would be true if current compensation levels are needed to entice the best possible candidates to become executives instead of pursuing other career paths that would not maximize these individuals skills given the wide gulf between executive pay and pay in nearly any other profession 65 murphy points out problem with this methodology firms with better managers would not be expected to offer investors permanently higher rate of return because of market forces as s oon as investors realized that firm had superior management investors would bid up the current price of the firms stock while the stock price was being bid up investors would experience superior rate of return but after this process was complete future rates of return would not be out of the ordinary because of the law of diminishing returns an economist who compared these future ordinary rates of return to the executives compensation might erroneously conclude that they were overpaid

professions are comparably paid some might be skeptical that pay cut that left portion of the gulf intact would scare off suitable candidates for example one economist recently pointed out that one ceo with net worth of 16 billion would need to spend 30 million per week just to keep his net worth from rising67 but most would agree that some reward is needed to compensate for job attributes such as stress and long hours that are expected of executives perhaps also implicit in efficiency concerns is the neoclassical assumption that higher pay leads to higher levels of utility in other words individuals are motivated to work harder to earn more because earning more makes them happier thus policymakers looking to curb executive pay may need to weigh the loss of welfare it would cause as one of the costs of such proposal but recent empirical evidence on compensation and welfare suggests that this might not be the case68 this research suggests that after certain point people are not made happier by further increases in absolute income that is because when income increases people quickly adapt to their new circumstances and any temporary rise in happines s caused by greater income dissipates rather the research suggests that people are made permanently happier by increases in relative income sentiment captured in the saying keeping up with the joneses according to this theory the ratcheting up in executive pay in recent years has not made anyone better off since all executives pay is rising simultaneously it also suggests that hypothetically if there were costless way to reduce executive pay across the board admittedly an unrealistic assumption it might not make anyone worse off once individuals had adapted to their new circumstances as long as enough of the gulf between executive pay and other professions were maintained to leave sufficient superiority in relative income intact executives may also derive utility from nonmaterial aspects of their job such as fame and power that could be unaffected by an absolute decline in income obviously acrosstheboard changes would require some type of collective action if any single board decided to reduce executive pay those executives would lose utility since their income relative to their peers would fall

deduct employee pay including executive pay from their corporate income subject to taxation in 1993 in response to outrage at executive pay levels obra pl 10366 added section 162 m titled certain excessive employee remuneration to the internal revenue code it imposes 1 million cap on the deductibility of compensation that applies to the ceo and the four next highestpaid officers pay itself is not capped only the deduction of pay from corporate income tax deduction for compensation above the 1 million limit is permitted except for performancebased pay such as commissions or stock options where the ultimate compensation received by the executive depends on the stock price reported sales or profits or some other financial indicator to qualify for the exception the goals underlying the performancebased compensation must have been determined by compensation committee that is comprised solely of two or more outside directors the terms under which the performancebased compensation is to be paid including the performance goals must be disclosed to shareholders and approved by majority shareholder vote executives cash compensation the type of pay most directly affected by obra increased slowly after obra took effect but this prov ision in obra is widely believed to have contributed to the growing importance of stock options in ceo compensation in the mid and late 1990s 69

the requirement that publicly traded companies disclose how much they pay top executives dates from the 1930s the sec has modified the disclosure format several times as the forms of ceo pay have become more varied and complex in 1992 the sec required that proxy statements include tables setting out several categories of pay for the top five executives these included base salaries bonuses deferred and incentivebased compensation including stocks and stock options corporations were required to place an estimated value on options granted to executives by 2006 the sec had concluded the 1992 disclosure rules were in the words of sec chairman christopher cox out of date they havent kept pace with changes in the marketplace and in some cases disclosure obfuscates rather than illuminates the true picture of compensation we want investors to have better information including one numbera single bottom line figurefor total annual compensation in july 2006 for the first time since 1992 the sec adopted major changes to executive disclosure rules contained in public companies registration and proxy statements75 the disclosure requirements apply to the ceo the chief financial officer cfo and the next three most highly compensated executive officers the rules require the disclosure of the executives total compensation the fair value of their stock option grants estimates of potential postemployment payments and benefits and tabular disclosure of director pay it requires that statements include compensation discussion and analysis cda which is narrative that must explain the objectives and implementation of companys executive pay program and in response to the stock option grant backdating controversy the rules require detailed information about companys option grant practices in the both the cda and supplemental table the rules also require the disclosure of directors compensation figures for the preceding fiscal year the disclosure requirements went into effect in 2007 sec officials have said that the central contribution of the disclosure reform is the provision of enhanced transparency with respect to executive pay 76 they may also be intimating that the new disclosure requirements could at least indirectly help improve shareholders ability to exert pressure on management to temper executive pay by restraining executives from

neoclassical world executive pay would be determined by marginal product since the outcome would already be economically efficient any policy response that created wedge between executive pay and executives marginal product would reduce economic efficiency those who believe that market forces are the best curb on excessive pay argue that government should be doing less not more in this area because government cannot determine appropriate levels or forms of executive pay more accurately than shareholders or boards the managerial power critique makes the case that executive pay is not determined by arms length contracting it suggests number of reforms to bring executive pay closer to an arms length contracting ideal these reforms could be promoted by shareholders board members or in some cases mandated by the government through legislation or regulation they fall under three broad categories improving the transparency of executive pay strengthening board independence to reduce the potential for board capture and strengthening shareholder control over the board and management proponents often argue that they are not trying to interfere with market forces but to level the playing field for shareholders in their interactions with management some of the reforms they promote do not affect executive pay directly eg not allowing the ceo to be chairman of the board rather their stated intent is that reforms that strengthen shareholders rights or board independence should lead to lower pay or pay that is more sensitive to performance but few proposals do affect executive pay directly and are analyzed below g15g138g146g151g157g138g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g21g157g138g157g158g156g561g19g158g152g561 some observers favor the status quo arguing that congress should continue to defer to more specialized regulatory bodies such as the sec with an expertise in corporate governance the regulatory bodies have focused on making occasional minor policy modifications to enhance transparency and align boards incentives more closely with shareholders interests in this view hasty policy changes in reaction to rising pay levels would risk undermining the

added section 162m to the internal revenue code which limited companys tax deduction for what it pays each of its top executives to 1 million but exempted performancebased pay like stock options supporters of the neoclassical model argue that the million dollar deduction limit is good example of how government intervention in markets can have unintended consequences that cause policy to backfire despite the deduction limit overall executive compensation continued to rise rapidly and the limit may have contributed to the rapid growth of executive stock options which critics argue are at the heart of the corporate scandals 79 critics see this as an example of policy with unintended consequences in which government regulation encourages behavior that circumvents the regulations original intent tax policy may be too blunt tool to effectively encourage these goals since the deduction limit failed to curb the growth in executive pay some would argue that it should be eliminated or scaled back alternatively if the purpose of the deduction limit is to curb overall executive pay levels others would argue the limit would be more effective if expanded to cover all forms of pay perhaps at different deduction level some research found that the deduction limit appears to have been factor in the growth in executive stock options and overall executive pay80 but other research concluded that the statute had little to do with subsequent increases in the sensitivity of overall executive pay to performancebased components like stock options 81 factors that may have played larger role in the growth of stock options include the bull market of the 1990s not having to treat stock options as corporate expense and pressure on firms to provide executive pay that better aligned their interests with those of shareholders alternative research concluded that while the million dollar cap may have initially helped to compress executive salaries around the 1 million level it did not appear to have had significant impact on total compensation and other components of pay such as bonuses and stock option awards 82

162m of the internal revenue code to prohibit businesses from taking tax deductions for compensation provided to executives when the ratio of executive pay to that of its employees exceeds certain level the ratio could be set relative to say the average employees pay or the lowestpaid employees pay very few firms have voluntarily implemented such policy for example the ceo of whole foods markets limits his pay to more than 14 times the pay of the firms average employee 79 if one argues that the purpose of the cap is solely to encourage performancebased pay then the subsequent rise in overall compensation levels may be irrelevant 80 for example see brian hall and kevin murphy the trouble with stock options journal of economic perspectives vol 12 2003 pp 4970 and tod perry and marc

address some concerns with the erosion of pay equity and growing income inequality supporters of this policy argue that discouraging excessive pay through tax disincentives is preferable toand less disruptive than prohibiting excessive pay directly critics could ar gue that the growing ratio between worker and ceo pay owes itself in part to an unrelated developmentthe moribund growth in worker pay critics could also argue that the reform could undermine the core investor concern of whether ceo receives compensation commensurate with his or her performance furthermore wage levels vary by company primarily because different companies hire different types of workers for example the average pay at software company is likely to exceed average pay at chain of fast food restaurants under this proposal the fast food company would face higher taxes if it wanted to pay its executives comparable wage to the software company as with complaints about the obra cap such cap could result more in maneuvering by businesses to avoid the cap than fulfillment of its intended goalfor exampl any such cap would have to delve into the complexities of what forms of employee and ex ecutive compensation should or should not fall under the cap creating incentives for stealth pay detractors could also cite research that concluded that the tax deductibility of executive compensation tends to have minimal impact on firms ultimate profitability raising additional questions about the ability of such policy to help constrain executive pay 83

outside compensation consultants are generally hired to help boards craft the firms executive compensation packages in number of cases the consultants are part of larger companies that furnish additional consultation services to the firms it could be argued that when firms provide multiple consultancies to individual firms there is conflict of interest that makes it difficult for their compensation consultant subsidiaries to resist pressure to recommend favorable executive pay packages two possible options to address such concerns would be 1 an sec requirement that firms proxy statements disclose all of the services it receives from companies that offer it compensation consulting services or 2 law to ban outfits that furnish executive compensation consulting services to firm from offering other consultant services to them similar to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002s proscription on auditors providing certain ancillary services to the firms they audit if the latter alternative were pursued some companies might stop offering compensation consulting services these reforms might not lead to any change in behavior however because the basic incentive to recommend high pay remains even if compensation consulting is the firms sole business for reasons discussed earlier 84 83 nancy l rose and catherine wolfram has the milliondollar cap affected ceo pay american

determining the pay packages of senior executives at the largest publicly traded corporations during the hearing corporate governance experts institutional investors and compensation consulting firms testified regarding the role of consultant s in setting executive pay efforts to prevent and manage conflicts of interest and the adequacy of the information available to shareholders and the public simultaneously the committee released report executive pay conflicts of interest among consultants which examined whether compensation consultants who are hired by large publicly traded firms act independently the reports principal finding was that over 100 large publicly traded companies hired comp ensation consultants with substantial conflicts of interest in 2006 and that in many cases the consultants who are advising on executive pay are simultaneously receiving millions of dollars from the corporate executives whose compensation they are s upposed to assess the study can be found

while directors must be approved by shareholders the nominees are typically chosen by the board or management at present shareholders can nominate directors but the process is arduous expensive estimates range up to 1 million and thus rarely pursued to ease the process the sec proposed rule in july 2003 that would have allowed shareholders with more than 5 of companys voting securities to under certain conditions have their board nominees included in companys proxy materials which carry the managements slate of board nominees 85 response to widespread concerns over the accountability of corporate directors after number of corporate scandals the propos received the support of various observers including some institutional investors they argu ed that the integrity of corporate boards would be enhanced because the reform would result in boards being populated with greater number of outside directors who are less beholden to management and better able to provide independent oversight and scrutiny of executive compensation practices and excesses such as backdating although publicly listed firms are required to have outside directors some critics have questioned the independence of outside directors recommended by management for example one study found that large numbers of outside directors inexplicably appear to have been the beneficiaries of options manipulation 86 opponents of shareholder access reform argue that it could potentially result in antagonistic directors and thus dysfunctional boards shareholders may also be less able to identify the most qualified candidates for the position in the end the sec did not adopt the proposed 2003 shareholder proxy reform rule decision that many ascribe to vehement business opposition but the issue reemerged in august 2006 when the united states court of appeals for the second circuit reached decision in american federation of state county and municipal employees pension plan v american international group inc this ruling was the appeals courts response to an earlier petition by the american federation of state county and municipal employees afscme to reverse the american international groups aig rejection of its effort to place binding shareholder proposal in the companys proxy materials that would have changed its bylaws to facilitate shareholder nomination of directors historically the sec has generally allowed firms to exclude shareholder proposals relating to an election from their proxies as it did in this case however the second circuit found the secs policy in this area to be historically inconsistent and asked the agency to clarify it 87 after the decision the sec basically chose not to rule on proxy access petitions which chairman cox said

one proposal the short proposal would essentially codify longstanding sec practices of denying shareholderproposed candidates for board director positions to be included in company proxy statements called proxy access88 the proposal which the agency eventually adopted in late november of the year appears to have been response to the uncertainty that prevailed after the aig decision the second proposal the socalled long proposal was not adopted89 it would have allowed shareholders or shareholder coalitions with greater than 5 of outstanding shares to propose binding bylaw provisions that could permit spec ified shareholders to nominate directors and require the company to include the nominees in the companys proxy statement90 generally business interests applauded the agencys decision to adopt the short proposal while shareholder interests derided it chairman christopher cox claimed that the agencys vote would create legal certainty for the upcoming annual proxy season in spring of 2008 but conceded that investor advocacy groups and others would be disappointed he has however indicated that the agency will probably revisit the subject of shareholder proxy access in 2008 when the commission has its full complement of democratic members 91 after the secs vote senate banking chairman dodd said that he might try to offer legislation to reverse the decision saying that he did not think it was fair decision and barney frank chairman of the house financial services comm ittee expressed disappointment that the sec would deny shareholders the right to offer proxy access proposals

subsidiary part of the long proposal the proxy rules were amended to further the use of electronic shareholder forums in which shareholders would have an additional means to communicate with each other and the company historically participation in such sh areholder forums would potentially constitute solicitation subject to the current proxy rules but as amended such electronic communications would be exempt from most proxy rules if the conditions to the exemption are satisfied forum pa rticipants would be able to rely on the exemption so long as his or her communications occur more than 60 days prior to the date the company announces for its annual or special meeting of shareholders and the communicating party does not solicit authority while relying on the exemption also under the change management will be able to participate in such electronic shareholder forums without first providing proxy statement and participant would not be liable for the statements or information

pay packages along these lines there is representative franks shareholder v ote on executive compensation act hr 1257 which was approved by the house on april 19 2007 and obamas companion and identically named bill s 1181 furthermore in anticipation of the 2007 annual corporate meetings activist investors have submitted shareholder proposals at about 60 companies seeking the right to have nonbinding vote on executive pay93 proponents believe that votes against individual pay packages or merely the threat could raise outrage costs thus prompting directors to exercise greater restraint in pay setting and to be more conscientious in linking pay to performance they argue that the vote would not overly burden or restrict the board since the vote would be nonbinding several countries including the united kingdom australia and sweden have given their shareholders the right to such nonbinding vote domestically at least one firm the insurer aflac has reportedly agreed to provide its shareholders with such vote 94 many other firms however are publicly opposed to the idea two main arguments are made in opposition to mandatory nonbinding shareholder vote on pay first to the extent that current levels of executive pay are largely explained by legitimate market forces as some have argued giving shareholders nonbinding vote on pay might inject undesirable distortions into the pay setting process and the demand and supply of ceos second the minutiae of ceo compensation packages can be difficult enough for corporate directors to master thus it has been argued that expecting shareholders with relatively limited resources available for comprehending such things to be knowledgeable presence in the pay setting process would be unrealistic

executive pay is equity not efficiency then the policy goal may be to reduce inequality in the least economically costly way more progressive tax system is widely considered to be the least costly way to redistribute income in terms of lost economic efficiency of course the tax code cannot target executives specifically without also affecting other high income individuals thus while progressive taxation can be viewed as an effective way to promote equity goals it is not well targeted toward reducing potential efficiency losses that result from the principalagent problem that affects executive compensation given the importance of stocks and stock options in executive pay policymakers attempting to increase the tax codes progressivity could consider reducing the tax preference currently given to capital income compared to labor income for example capital gains and dividends are taxed at lower marginal rate than labor income and sizeable portion of capital income tax can be deferred through taxpreferred savings vehicles stock options are taxed at regular income rates but receive favorable treatment because tax liability is deferred until gains are realized economists are divided over whether taxing labor and capital at the same rate would be 93 erin white and aaron patrick shareholder push for vote on executive pay the wall street journa l february 26 2007 p b1 94

companys stock at predetermined fixed price called the strike price regardless of the stocks price at the date of purchase the holder exercises the option when he subsequently buys the stock after the option is granted the companys stock could either rise above or fall below the strike price if the market price fell below the strike price the option would have value and would not be exercised because the holder could buy the stock for less on the open market an option with strike price above the market price is said to be under water if the market price rose above the strike price the value of the option would be equal to the difference between the strike price and the actual price because the holder can buy the stock at the strike price and then sell it at the market price for example if person was granted an option to purchase company xs stock in one year at 100 and the stock turns out to be worth 125 in one year then he would earn 25 by exercising the option in year alternatively if the stock turns out to be worth 75 in one year he would not exercise the option and would neither gain nor lose any money thus the options value can never fall below zero because the future is uncertain economists and accountants must use complex formulas to place value on an option when it is granted that takes into account how much value if any the option is expected to have when it is ultimately exercised there is consensus among economists that the expected value at issuance is the amount that should be included in measures of executive pay the value of the option when it is ultimately exercised is unlikely to be the same as its expected value when it is issued however generally stock options can be bought and sold on the open market by anyone there are subset of stock options called employee stock options in which firms issue their own stock to their workers and executives employee stock options ca nnot be sold to others and often the holder must wait until vesting period is over before being able to exercise them in order to encourage employees to stay with the firm usually the strike price for employee stock options is set at the firms current price the firm does not have to outlay any cash when it grants employees stock options for this reason employee stock options ar particularly popular with startup firms with limited cash flow and high growth prospects however when the options are exercised new stock is created which dilutes the ownership of the existing stockholders the firm can offset this dilution by buying back an equivalent amount of outstanding stock from the open market which would require cash outlay at that point the prevalence of employee stock options is somewhat puzzling to economists because if employees firms and shareholders acted rationally they would each have reasons not to prefer them employees should prefer cash wages to options since the options expose them to risk and people are generally risk

employees in the form of forgone wages that must be paid back when the option is exercised if capital markets are efficient it should be cheaper for the firm to borrow on the open market than through
