2004 oios conducted an audit of unhcr oper ations in ukraine the audit covered activities with total expenditure of us 2 millio n in 2002 and 2003 briefing document with findings and recommendations was issued in june 200 4 for which replies were received in july 2004 the regional representative has accepted the recomm endations made and has implemented or is in the process of implementing th em overall assessment oios noted that while the unhcr operation in ukrai ne had problems in 2002 due in part to problems with local implementing partner in 2 003 the representation took corrective action and discontinued working with this partner consequently oios assessed the operations as above average in 2003 overall the operation was well run and although s ome weaknesses in the application of internal controls were identified the weaknesses concerned were not sufficiently critical to compromise the ov erall system of internal controls programme management for all the partners reviewed except edelweiss re asonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disburs ed in accordance with the sub agreement edelweiss now defunct ngo created b former unhcr programme assistant in 1997 and staffed by former unhcr staff had serious financial management and implementation deficiencies oios was unable to tr ace the financial information or statistical information to the subproject monitori ng reports the representation prudently stopped partnering with edelweiss in 2003 because f persistent allegations against the ngo about its hostile attitude towards refugees and asy lum seekers financial improprieties and nonimplementation of project objectives in 2003 unhcr had contract with the european com mission ec for the cross border cooperation process in 2004 ec is providing the funding to the swedish migration board which then funds unhcr under the project the rep resentation engaged local staff who were being administered by undp because unhcr does not establish posts from project funds some administrative problems existed with u ndp such as delayed salary payments and critically undp does not want to continue wit h this arrangement the representation would also like to change this arrangement the division of operational support and the bureau for europe said they discussed the staffing issue with the legal affairs section as result various options are being explored to ma intain the current arangement to use consultancies or to use special service agreements hiring staff under temporary assistance is not considered viable because of the nature of t he project the implementing partners did not appear to underst and unhcr procurement guidelines and thus did not follow them even though they had greed to do so as per the subagreement the guidelines presented to the partners were in glish not russian the language in which the partners are conversant the bureau for europe informed oios that russian version of the procurement guidelines had been available fo r some time supply management the representation engaged in direct implementation of procurement and construction contracts in part to ensure reimbursement of the value added tax vat of 20 per cent although the ukraine government provides reimbursem ent of vat for organizations like unhcr different interpretations exist whether such reimbursement extends to purchasing goods on behalf of partners or even whether partner s may be reimbursed outright administration in the areas of administration and finance the rep resentation generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review the representation makes substantial cash withdrawa ls which totalled almost us 08 million in 2003 for security reasons and also to comply with unhcr rules which discourage cash withdrawals the representation sho uld minimize cash transactions the representation uses online banking called clie ntbanking which is good approach however treasury had not been informed about this activity the representation s client banking is done in ukrainian thus in effect only two of the approved signatories both national officers have control over these transact ions since the other signatories do not know ukranian for medical insurance reimbursements list of hos pitals and doctors had not be maintained as required security and safety the representation said it did not have enough fund s to fully comply with the minimum operating security standards moss august 2004 table of

ions in ukraine had been conducted in 2000 oios reviewed the recommendations made du ring that audit and followed up as appropriate 3 ukraine is the secondlargest country in europe and shares long border with newcomers to the european union poland slovakia and hungary the unhcr office in kyiv which became regional representation in 2004 is the seat of the secretariat of the söderköping

objectives and scope 2 the main objectives of the audit were to ev aluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets and compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and sub agreements 3 the audit focused on 2002 and 2003 programm activities under the 400 project with total expenditure of around us 15 million oios review concentrated on the activities implemented by governmental organization s state committee for nationalities and migration scnm expenditure of us 150000 and at the request of the ro department of migration in odessa dmo expenditu re of us 65000 local ngos state public charity foundation for refugees and grants sympathy expenditure of 2 us 240000 ukrainian family planning association rokada ufpa expenditure of us 170000 edelweiss expenditure of us 360000 and the international ngo hebrew immigration aid society hias expenditure of us 130000 and direct implementation of around us 600000 oios also br iefly reviewed united nations volunteers with about us 60000 in expenditure 4 the audit reviewed the administration of th ro with administrative expenditures totalling around us 360000 for the years 2002 and 2003 and assets with an acquisition value of us 11 million and current value of us 1 75000 the number of staff working for the unhcr operation in ukraine based on the may 2004 official staffing table was 13 there were also 4 national united na tions volunteers and one staff under an undp ssa contract as well as seconded staff fr om icmc iii audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners 8 for the six partners reviewed reasonable assura nce could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subagreements with the exception of edelweiss the more pertinen t issues are discussed below 9 audit certificates for the partners were receive d where required with the exception of edelweiss the ro has requested an audit certificate from edel weiss unsucessfully state committee on nationalities and migration scn m 10 for scnm reasonable assurance could be taken t hat unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subagreement scnm is the state body responsible for refugee and migratio n issues and receives funds for capacity building in 2002 to reduce the number f partners working with unhcr the representation effectively made scnm an umbrella pa rtner to various regional migration departments this experiment was unsuccessful for various reasons thus in 2003 the ro reverted to the previous model whereby scnm was re sponsible only for its own activities 11 in terms of capacity building the financial ma nagement system needs to be strengthened scnm has very basic accounting sys tem with records kept manually in 2002 and by excel spreadsheet in 2003 scnm is req uired to follow government financial rules which differ from unhcr rules bud get lines and so forth 12 scnm did not maintain aggregate expenditure rep orts therefore it was difficult for oios to readily agree the amounts in scnms rec ords to the spmr at the periodic spmr verification the ro programme staff checks rep orted expenditure by adding up the invoices which scnm segregates by unhcr budget lin however record of this is maintained to faciliate checking and to improve financial management including 3 budgetary control oios recommended that scnm creat list of all expenditures incurred on monthly and quarterly basis the representation replied that this would be done oios also noted that there was internal review f scnms records instead scnm relied on unhcr to do this 13 in 2004 the representation informed oios that problems existed with the tendering process for construction works at yagotyn for example scnm ignored established unhcr protocols and appended an unhcr s taffs signature to document which she had not signed among other issues sinc the scnm person responsible for procurement was not available during our visit we arranged another meeting to discuss the tendering process in the interim scnm decide d it would fully fund this particular construction works because of this as well as tim constraints we did not revisit the partner oios also understands that using scnm in future may be limited since the representation is aware of the gos problems in pro curement oios makes further comment department of migration in odessa dmo 14 for dmo reasonable assurance could be taken th at unhcr funds were properly accounted for and generally disbursed in accordance with the subagreement dmo has very basic manually kept accounting system the general ledger did not match the spmr oios was told that according to ukrainian ac counting law only items distributed could be considered as expended and this may occur outside unhcrs reporting year to reconcile this dmo had sprea dsheet with unhcr budget codes oios was able to agree them to the budget lines and to supporting documents on test basis while the system functions oios recommende d that it be computerized the representation replied that this would be done by 3 1 august the budgetary control did not work because when unhcr revised the budget the partner did not change its spreadsheet to reflect this instead still referrin g to the old budget further purchase orders are not used the subproject symbol is not affixed to the invoices and invoices are not marked paid to avoid reuse all these things should be considered in terms of improving accounting system and controls 15 in 2002 dmo implemented small construction s ubproject 02abukrls400m1 totalling 320000 uah us 60 000 however unhcr procurement guidelines were not followed completely nor was waiver or prequalification received from unhcr state public charity foundation for refugees and grants sympathy 16 reasonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and generally disbursed in accordance with the subagreement sympathy had simple manualbased accounting system and although it worked oios recommended it be computerized since unhcr had provided computer s including thinkpad sympathy should begin to utilize this equipment t he chief accountant who also maintains the financial records for dmo said that she could computerize the accounting system similar to dmo there is budgetary cont rol and this should be done as with dmo purchase orders were not used the subproject symbol was not affixed to the 4 invoices invoices were not marked paid to avoid reuse and all these things should be considered in terms of improving accounting system and controls 17 for the years under review the staff did not h ave employment contracts per instead they have orders which were just few l ines written in notebook on request of sympathys auditors the ip has printed out the orders individually in 2004 some staff are hired under orders others have contracts the contracts are tied to the project agreement and thus do not provide indemnification i n case of termination orders do it was oios opinion that the ro should understand the differences because unhcr could end up liable for termination benefits 18 the budget line for vehicle maintenance in 2002 and 2003 was around 20000 uah per annum which oios considers high given that new economytype vehicle in ukraine may cost 25000 uah if unhcr had provided new vehicle in 2002 for example there would have been need for mainte nance line of 20000 uah in 2003 savings of around us 3500 the representation said it would review this but th at it was easier to pay out 20000 uah over the project ear instead of upfront for new vehicle 19 the chief accountant is budgeted under both dmo and sympathy as full time oios does not object to the current accountant work ing on both dmo and sympathy accounts but expects that it should be transparent if she works parttime on each sub project she should receive parttime salary from each subproject not two fulltime salaries since the subprojects are discrete the should each be charged the appropriate amount to reflect her actual work activities edelweiss 20 this now defunct ngo was created in 1999 by f ormer unhcr programme assistant at the request apparently of one of the p revious representatives various staff who worked in unhcr joined this ngo some of whom re now with hias partner which has taken over edelweisss legal assistance d uties oios selected edelweiss to review because we were told that it had had impleme ntation difficulties and it represented large dollar component of the 2002 programme budg et edelweiss was responsible for legal counselling and social work distributing cas h grants and material assistance like school uniforms and kits 21 because of problems with project implementation and allegations of corruption unhcrs new management in ukraine correctly decided to discontinue using the partner at the end of 2002 oios was informed of financial corruption allegations only after our very brief review of edelweiss however even with out knowing this it was apparent to oios almost immediately that there were problems wi th the 2002 financial records 5 22 it was extremely difficult to total the cash gi ven to the refugees because aggregate listing either on weekly monthly or qu arterly basis had been prepared to verify each payment slip would have had to be adde d up because of time constraints and the poor condition of the records oios was ble to do this the representation staff said they did add up the slips as part of the quarterly spmr verification however there was record for us to refer to 23 edelweiss also apparently kept two sets of reco rds one for the tax inspectors and one to account for assistance given to asylumseeke rs who by ukrainian law are not eligible for such benefits although they are person s of concern to unhcr the ip either did not have or did not retain the records of mater ial assistance such as blankets etc given to the illegal beneficiaries the ip did keep rec ords for cash to all beneficiaries legal or otherwise the representation told us that likely when legal refugee ie recognized refugee rr received for example blanket the ip would mark two blankets as distributed the second blanket going to the illeg beneficiary there is way to verify this unless unhcr was present at each distri bution oios tried to agree august 2002 statistics listed in the situation report and which should be derived from the ips reports but was unable to do so because edelweiss d id not track or did not retain information on certain distributions 24 edelweiss did not follow unhcr procurement guid elines even though the director of edelweiss told oios it had 25 the director of edelweiss was in an accident in 2001 with an unhcr vehicle but this was never reported to the local or headqua rters asset management board instead note to the file was written by the then programme officer this same programme officer conducted an investigation into the allegations against edelweiss and despite the numerous complaints by refugees of rudeness hostility and forging signatures of departed refugees nothing was conclu sively substantiated apparently note to the file about edelweisss problems had bee n written but the representation could not find copy the bureau for europe had heard f problems about implementation but had not heard of these financialrelated allegation s until oios informed it at the time of the audit the senior protection officer at the rep resentation told oios that the representation had zero tolerance for partner malfe asance and would pursue any instances in local court oios recommended that be fore this occurred the representation should consult with legal affairs ction the representation stated that an mail was sent to on actions to be taken in cas of malfeasance or inappropriate retention of funds b other programme issues 26 the programme section has taken positive step in harmonizing the salariestitles for certain ngo partners oios recommended that th representation consider expanding this standardization process to kyivbase d ngos and to other titles like guardscleaners t which the representation agreed programme said it also plans to do this for other standard costs like office supplies equipment and maintenance of vehicles 6 27 the representation has an urban refugee caseloa d to which it provides financial and material assistance the cash grant rate curre ntly is from us 40 to us 130 depending on family size some longstayers who ca nnot work for medical or legal status reasons receive assistance the representa tion is aware of the sixmonth cutoff for this assistance but explains that these benefic iaries do not have access to jobs this issue should be revisited because unhcr cannot cont inue to support longstayers 28 the representation purchased certain items and entered into construction contracts instead of the implementing partner becau the representation is not subject to vat which is 20 per cent unhcrs philosophy how ever is to limit direct implementation instead relying on partners to impl ement project activities although the ukraine government provides reimbursement of the va t for organizations like unhcr different interpretations exist whether such reimbu rsement extends to purchasing goods on behalf of partners or even whether partners may be reimbursed outright ukrainian law apparently says that such purchases must be use d for the benefit of the exempted organization oios recommended that the representa tion consult with the on this particularly if foreseen that procurement by partne rs will be high the representation responded that it would obtain relevant law arrang its translation into english and forward to for their comments by the end of aug ust 2004 29 the implementing partners did not appear to und erstand unhcr procurement guidelines and thus were not following them one f the reasons was that the procurement guidelines they had been given were wri tten in english not russian or ukrainian oios informed the representation that t he procurement guidelines should always be provided and discussed with partners during budget negotiations particularly when information is written in other than the local language the representation agreed and replied that the russian version of ip procurem ent guidelines had been provided with particular emphasis on adhering to them at oios post audit briefing with the bureau for europe oios was told that russian trans lations do exist for some relevant documents in future the representation should sult with the desk on these matters to identify what information has been translated ready oios also recommended that the representation ask the bureau for europe to pro vide workshop for the partners and relevant unhcr staff on unhcr rules to enhance thei r understanding of unhcr rules and to expand their skill sets the representation agreed and said that it plans to have small training session on the guidelines with the i mplementing partners involved c supply management procurement 30 the lease for the office premises was for five years with rental of just under us 100000 per annum the contract was not submitted t the headquarters committee on contracts coc although it did go to for revi ew the representation did not consider that the contract was for five years as i t contained notice to vacant clause the representation held the view that its total value t herefore did not exceed us 100000 oios maintains that the contract should have been s ubmitted to the coc despite the opt out clause 7 31 the representation has been using local audit firm to conduct audits of the partners in accordance with unhcr policy oios was told that the last tender for audit firms was done in 1998 or 1999 and that the represe ntation was happy with the results of the work given the time lapsed since the last ten der the representation should conduct another invitation to bid in accordance with unhcr rules asset management 32 oios noted that the right of use agreements and physical inventory of some partners had not been done for 2003 the representation is aware of this and is in the process of rectifying this 33 the unhcr vehicle used by edelweiss which was i n an accident in 2001 had not been officially reported to either the lamb or the hamb oios recommended that this be reported as required the representation replied that an email was sent to the secretary of the hamb seeking clarification on furt her actions required from the office and actions will be taken as recommended by the sec retary by end august 2004 34 in its response the representation further noted t hat since the establishment of unhcr in ukraine not single staff member has bee n trained in asset management the representation requested hqs to organise trai ning on assettrak system for the region because it believes that many offices would be interested to join this initiative recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for europe with the assistance of the asset management unit smsdfsm should organize region wide assettrak training as appropriate rec 01 d administration financial management 35 the representation uses bank but operates in cash on significant basis in 2003 cash withdrawals totalled us 736000 and ar ound us 60000 in local currency equivalent the representation stated that it must pay part of its rent in cash and staff salaries are also made in cash because staff do not have bank accounts due to taxes imposed on deposits oios told the representation it should try to minimize using cash in accordance with unhcr policy and in terms of sec urity the representation reasoned that since it is located in monastery t he chances for theft are slim nonetheless the cash has to be brought to the prem ises thereby exposing the staff who withdraw it from the bank and deliver it to the rep resentation oios said to reduce risk the bank should bring the funds to unhcr on the day of distribution if the representation still needed to operate on cash ba sis 36 one of the reasons for paying cash to suppliers and partners is to avoid paying taxes to the government for example the landlord required partial payment in cash partners staff were paid in cash in part in orde r to avoid reporting the amount received to the government oios understands that funding t hese tax payments would likely 8 increase the cost of doing business for unhcr thi s issue is not unique to unhcr operations in ukraine unhcr should review this si tuation and develop practical policy regarding tax avoidance and evasion by unhcr field operations recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in kyiv and the unhcr lega l affairs section should consider the implications of enabling suppli ers and partners to avoid paying taxes or otherwise circumvent local laws rec 02 37 the representation uses its banks online clien tbanking system which is good approach however oios recommended that the repre sentation inform the unhcr treasury section on this use the representation replied that it had informed the chief of treasury 38 the clientbanking is done in ukrainian thus in effect only two of the approved signatories both national officers have control ver these transactions this defeats the purpose of having several bank signatories and impa irs control 39 oios recommends that unhcr treasury section dev elop policy and guidelines on electronic banking ebanking for th field offices which identifies the rights and responsibilities of each party involved and establishes thresholds similar to more conventional practices etc online banking compasses different situations ranging from simply using the banks software for ccessing an account to using web enabled systems recommendation head2right the unhcr treasury section dfsm should develop p olicy and guidelines on electronic banking for field offices rec 0 3 40 cash advances for financial assistance payments to refugees given to staff member to distribute were charged directly to the p roject technically unhcr requires that they be charged to vf account only upon li quidation of the advance should the project be charged the representation agreed that this should be done and said it would do so if recommended however it takes lot of wor k and the representation is short staffed the representation also noted that in p revious oios audit the auditors said that advances made in the name of the staff should stop due to the risks associated with this practice to unhcr and the staff to whom the ad vances were made and instead open bank account however in the instant case the staff withdraws the money from the bank thus the issue is not one of security or expos ure but of following unhcr rules oios appreciates the work involved but recommends t hat advances be handled according to unhcr rules 9 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in kyiv should charge cash advances to the appropriate vf account and charge the project upon liquidation of the advance rec 04 41 for medical insurance reimbursements list of hospitals and doctors had not been maintained as required the representation responded that list of hospita ls and doctors would be established by the end of 2004 other operational issues 42 the representation has two contracts with the european commission ec one for the cross border cooperation process cbcp an d the other for building or renovating temporary accommodation centres and prov iding domestic and legal assistance typically contracts are multiyear an d do not match unhcr reporting requirements tracking the expenditure accurately can be difficult funds are allocated among various budget lines to various partners and under direct implementation oios recommended that hqs should review those operations which receive or are expected to receive this specific funding that is funding fro m or through the ec which may revise the operations initial objectives and mandate in order to develop consistent tracking methodology for reporting expenditure instead of ea ch field office creating its own this should make each operation more efficient 43 in discussions oios had with the bureau fo r europe and the division of operational support dos it was acknowledged that in 2003 this kind of project had been learning experience but that standards and p rocedures generally have now been developed which could address future concerns it should be noted that 2004 differs from 2003 in that the swedish migration board is funding unhcr with ec funds instead of the ec directly funding unhcr although some issues may have been addressed oios still recommends that the bureau for europe assist those country operations adopt consistent expenditure tracking methodology where appropriate recommendation head2right unhcr bureau for europe should review those operati ons which receive funding under multiyear projects with the european commission or other donors in order to develop consistent tracking thodology for reporting expenditure where appropriate instead of each field office creating its own rec 05 44 for the cbcp project the representation gaged local staff who were administered through undp some administrative pro blems existed with undp such as delayed salary payments lack of social security be nefits and leave entitlements different from unhcr staff in addition undp did not really want to be part of this arrangement the representation also wanted to cha nge this arrangement and have some flexibility in hiring staff but believed that unhc r policy would not allow recruiting 10 unhcr staff under projects the representation thi nks this affects unhcrs ability to implement ec funded projects particularly since ot her agencies do have project staff in this particular case in 2004 the ec funds the swed ish migration board which in turn funds unhcr 45 oios discussed with dos and the bureau for europe the possibility that staff for this project be charged to temporary assistance si milar to other ec projects for example albania dos and the bureau explained that situation in alba nia was not the same they said they consulted with about the staffin g issue and were informed that because the project deals with migration issues and not solely refugees it is not core unhcr activity also it is shared result in tha t it does not only belong to unhcr consequently it was not appropriate to hire projec t staff under temporary assistance dos and the bureau are exploring other options besi des staying with the status quo using consultants or providing special services agr eements recommendation head2right the unhcr division of operational support and the b ureau for europe should seek suitable solution for the staffing f ec funded projects in eastern europe rec 06 f security and safety 46 the representation informed us that it did not have sufficient funds for certain items required for compliance with minimum operatin g security standards moss oios noted that the current premises have only one exit recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in kyiv should consult wit h the unhcr field safety section about achieving full moss compliance rec 07 iv acknowledgement 47 i wish to express my appreciation for the assis tance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of unhcr and its implemen ting partners in ukraine egbert c kaltenbach chief unhcr audit service office of internal oversight services
