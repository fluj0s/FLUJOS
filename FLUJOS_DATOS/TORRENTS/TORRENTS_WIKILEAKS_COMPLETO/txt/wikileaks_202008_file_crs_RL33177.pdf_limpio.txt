losses was normally included in genera l insurance policies without cost to policyholders following the attacks bot h primary insurers and reinsurers pulled back from offering terrorism coverage citing particularly an inability to calculate the probability and loss data critical for insurance pricing some argued that terrorism risk would never be insurable by the pr ivate market due to the uncertainty and potentially massive losses invol ved because insurance is required for variety of economic transactions it was feared that lack of insurance against terrorism loss would have wider economic impact congress responded to the disruption in the insurance market by passing the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 tri tria created temporary program expiring at the end of 2005 to calm the insurance markets through government backstop for terrorism losses and to give th private industry time to gather the data and create the structures and capacity necessary for private insurance to cover terrorism risk from 2002 to 2005 terrorism insurance became widely available and largely affordable and the insurance indus try greatly expanded its financial capacity there was however little apparent success on longer term private solution and fears persisted about wider economic consequences if in surance were not available to large degree the same concerns and arguments that accompanied the initial passage of tria were before congress as it considered tria extension legislation congress responded to the impending expi ration of tria with the passage of two different bills the senate bill s 467 was approved by the senate on november 18 2005 the large majority of the language from the house bill hr 4314 was inserted into s 467 and passed by the house on december 7 2005 s 467 was titled the terrorism risk insuran ce extension act whereas hr 4314 was titled the terrorism risk insu rance revision act these titles did reflect essential differences between the two bills s 467 extended the current program by two years and further increased the private sectors exposure to terrorism risk as did the original act during the three years c overed by the initial act insurance industry deductibles and aggregate retention rose each year s 467 continued to increase these and also reduced the types of insu rance covered by the program and increased the size of terrorist event necessary to tr igger the program hr 4314 extended the program for two or possibly three years and substantially revised many aspects of it among the notable changes it excluded some lines of coverage and included others that were not covered before it segmen ted lines of insuran ce introducing different deductibles for different lines it included the concept of resetting the deductibles and the trigger amount to lower amounts if rrorist attack occurs in the future the final version signed into law closely tracked the senate legislation this report briefly outlines the issues involved with terrorism insurance and includes sidebyside of the initial tria triaextension legislation as considered in the house and senate and the final bill as signed by the president it will not be

webelterrorism risk insurance legislation in 2005 issue summary and sidebyside introduction prior to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks insurance covering terrorism losses was normally included in general insurance policies without specific premium being paid essentially most polic yholders received this coverage for free the attacks and the more than 30 billion in insured losses that resulted from them caused rethinking of the possibilities of futu re terrorist attacks in response to the new appreciation of the threat and the perceived inability to calculate the probability and loss data critical for pricing insurance both primary insurers and reinsurers pulled back from offering terrorism coverage many argued that terrorism risk is essentially uninsurable by the private market due to the uncertainty and potentially massive losses involved because insura nce is required for variety of ec onomic transactions many feared that lack of insurance against terrorism loss would have wider economic impact particul arly on largescale developments in urban areas that would be tempting targets for terrorism congress responded to the disruption in the insurance market by passing the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 1 tria which was signed by the president in november 2002 tria created the terrori sm risk insurance program which was enacted as temporary prog ram expiring at the end of 2005 to calm the insurance markets through government backstop fo r terrorism losses and give the private industry time to gather the data and create the structures and capacity necessary for private insurance to cover terrorism risk terrorism insurance has become widely available under tria and the insurance industry has greatly expanded its financial capacity in the past three years it appears however that less progress has b een made on creating terrorism models that are sufficiently robust for insurers to return to offering widespread terrorism coverage without government backstop and that practically progre ss has been made on private pooling mechanism to cover terrorism risk some see the past three years as proof of the argument that the private market will never be able to offer insurance to cover terrorism risk and continue to see the possibility of wider economic consequences if terrorism insurance again is unavailable others notably the us treasury department respond that tria itself is retarding the growth of this private market and should be allowed to expire or at least be reduced from its current formhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33177crs2 legislative action congress responded to the impending ex piration of tria with two different bills that initially passed the respective hous the senate bill senator christopher dodds s 467 was approved by the nate on november 18 2005 the large majority of the language from the house bill representative richard bakers hr 4314 was inserted into s 467 and passe d by the house on december 7 2005 s 467 was entitled the terrorism risk insura nce extension act whereas hr 4314 was entitled the terrorism risk insurance revision act and the titles did reflect essential differences between the two bills senate legislation s 467 senator dodd introduced s 467 on febr uary 18 2005 as introduced it was identical to bill s 2764 introduced by senator dodd in the 108th congress s 467 as introduced would have explicitly ex tended tria for two years until the end of 2007 and would have added soft landing year by changing the definition of an insured loss so that policies written in the second year and extending into third year would be covered th individual insurer deductible was to remain at 15 of earned premiums during the extension while the insurance industry aggregate loss retention amount was to increase from the current 15 billion in 2005 to 175 billion for 2006 and finally 20 billion for 2007 s 467 also would have directed the treasury to promulgate new rules in cluding group life insurance under tria on june 30 2005 the department of th treasury released report on tria accompanied by letter from secretary snow indicating that tria had achieved its goal of stabilizing the insurance market and that the administration would not support an extension without significant changes reducing the taxpayer exposure from the program on november 16 2005 the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs marked up s 467 and substituted an amendment by chairman richard shelby for the original text it then reported the bill favorably to the full senate by voice vote as amended s 467 would have extended the current program two years and further increased the private sectors expos ure to terrorism risk over the life of the act as did the original legislation during the three years covered by the initial act insurance industry deductibles and aggregate retention rose each year s 467 continued to increase these it would ve also reduced the types of insurance covered by the program and increased the size of terrorist event necessary to trigger the program specifically it removed commercial auto burglary and theft surety farm owners multiple peril and professional liability except for directors and officers liability as covered lines raised the insurer deductible to 175 in 2006 and 20 in 2007 decreased the federal share of insured losses from 10 to 15 for 2007 and raised the event trigger to 50 million in 2006 and 100 million in 2007 s 467 was brought to the senate floor and passed by unanimous consent on november 18 2005 the house brought the bill to floor and amended it with most of the text of hr 4314 befo re passing it on december 7 2005httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33177crs3 2 amendment texts can be found at httpfinancialserviceshousegovlegisaspformmode itemnumber430 house legislation s 467 as amended with text from hr 4314 hr 4314 was introduced by represen tative baker on november 14 2005 and marked up by the house financial services committee on november 16 three amendments by chairman michael oxley and representatives barney frank and debbie wasserman schu ltz were adopted in committee by voice vote2 chairman oxleys amendment made number of changes including adjusting the exact deductibles for various insurance lines reducing the program trigger amount in program years after the second year and stri king language that would have preempted some state laws relating to rate and form filing representative franks amendment increased the size needed by company or municipality to be considered an exempt commercial purchaser of insurance representative wasserman schultzs amendment added the requireme nt that life insurers not deny insurance coverage based on lawful overseas travel the amended bill was favorably reported to the full house by vote of 643 in the 108th congress the committee had reported favorably straightforward extension of tria with relatively minor changes hr 4313 however went well beyond the previous ly reported house bill or the changes recommended by secretary snow hr 4314 as reported woul d have limited the types of insurance covered by removing commercial auto insurance however it would have expanded the program to cover domestic terrorist even ts and increased the covered types of insurance to include group life and speci fic coverage for nuc lear biological chemical and radiological nbcr events it would have raised the event trigger to 50 million in 2006 and added an additional 50 million to this for every future year the program is in effect it also would have changed the insurer deductible but would have done so differently for di fferent lines of insurance raising it to as high as 25 for casualty insurance but lowering it to 75 for ncbr events hr 4314 would have lowered the federal share of insure d losses to 80 for events under 10 billion but raised it gradually to 95 for events over 40 billion in the case of terrorist act the deductibles and event triggers would have reset to lower levels with deductibles possibly as low as 5 in the event of large attack it would have removed the cap on the mandatory recoupmen t provision so that all money expended under tria would be recouped by the fede ral government through surcharge on insurers in the years after the attack hr 4314 also would have created tria capital reserve funds crf to allow insure rs to set aside untaxed reserves to tap in the case of terrorist event with few changes notably the addition of language striking section 107 of the original tria the language of hr 4314 as it was reported was inserted into the senatepassed s 467 and this amended version of s 467 passed the house 37149 on december 7 2005 shortly after passage the house called for

administration policy supporting s 467 on november 17 2005 it also indicated that the administration would strongly oppose an efforts to add lines of coverage including group life insurance on december 7 2005 statement of administration policy was issued that specifically opposed the housepassed version of s 467 final passage following the house appointment of conferees on decembe r 7 2005 the senate did not appoint conferees instead it took up and passed further amendment samdt 2689 to s 467 by unanimous consent on december 16 2005 the house followed this with passage of this ve rsion of s 467 by voice vote on december 17 2005 pl 109144 s 467 was signed by the president on december 22 2005 becoming public law 109144 pl 109144 closely follows s 467 as initially passed by the senate
