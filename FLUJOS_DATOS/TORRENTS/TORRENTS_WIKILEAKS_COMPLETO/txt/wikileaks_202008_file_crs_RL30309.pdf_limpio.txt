further provided that birth or former adopted parent of any such adopted child shall thereafter by virtue of such parentage be accorded any right privilege or status33 it could be inferred that the bill langua ge in effect defines potential adoptive parents as single parent or married husband and wife ho wever questions may arise as to whether this provision would include single adoptive parent cohabiting with another person of the same or different sex there appears to be uncertainty as to precisely what adoptive parents marita l status and gender are covered by the definition the bill does not specifically address how its re quirements may impact either narrowing or broadening the doption requirements which are set by the individual states section 204d of the ina 8 usc 1154d would be amended by adding new provision which states that petition may be approved on behalf of an alien child who seeks to be accorded immediate relative status as child unless the secretary has certified to the attorney general that the central authority of the childs country of origin has notified the unite d states central authority under the convention that united states citizen do miciled in the

discussion below 38 the bill specifically requires that determ ination has been made in accordance with section 107 of public law 10589 that the child cannot be placed in the united states however section 107 of public law 10589 does not require such determinations rather section 107 amends the federal foster care program authorized under title ive of the social security act and requires state child welfare agencies to document their efforts to place children for adoption or other permanent arrangements if reunification with their families is not determined appropriate the provision applies only to children who are in foster care under state supervision 39 id sec 303b1 40 there may an inconsistency in the use of certain terms used in this section the introductory language of section 303b refers to prospective adoptive parents and requires that children be adopted by marri ed man and woman while section 303b2b makes reference to the prospective adoptive parent or parents 41 bill sec 303b2section 303 adoption of children emigrating from the united states specific standards are set for adoptions of children emigrating from the united states for adoption in any other convention

parent is woman not necessarily married to the married man alternative legislative drafting might be used such as married husband and wife 48 bill sec 303b1ccase required by the secretary to perform cer tification functions or otherwise to carry out its responsibilities under the convention42 state court certifying an adoption as final or granting custody for the purposes of adoption of child

necessary the required information and documentation described above and evidence that the convention requirements have been satisfied and 2 determined that the adoptive placement is in the childs best interests43 in these cases of child emigrating abroad the secretary upon the receipt and verification of the requisite documents and information shall issue as applicable an official certification that th child has been adopted or declaration that the custody for purposes of adoption has been granted in accordance with the convention and with this legislation44 in adoption cases involving children emigrating from the united states states may impose additional responsibilities and requirements not inconsiste nt with the provisions of this section upon accredited persons and prospective adoptive pa rents acting on their own behalf45 two of these requirements are examined the first of these is that in cases of children emigrating from the united states the child will be adopted by married man and woman46 this requirement appears to provide limit on the pool of eligible adoptive parents to specifically married man and woman47 it should also be noted that this language differs from the language used earlier in the bill for prospective adoptive parents for children immigrating to the united states this language in section 302 was the prosp ective adoptive parent or married husband and wife the second limiting requirement in the bill is that twelve months have elapsed since the person made efforts to place the child in the united states48 this one year wait would extend the period of adoption completion for those american children who are to be adopted abroadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30309crs12 49 id sec 304 50 id sec 305a 51 id sec 305b 52 id sec 305c 53 id
