sufferings caused by pestilence famine fire floods and other great national calamities 31 stat 279 since 1900 congress has rechartered the anrc once and greatly amended its charter at later time in 1905 congress repealed the charter of 1900 and enacted new charter in response to complaints regarding anrcs handling of funds governance structure and other problems 33 stat 5996025 under the 1905 charter the activities of the anrc were directed by the central committee it had 18 members six of whom were appointed by the president one of these six appointees served as the chairman of the committee and the other five were representatives of the departments of state war navy the treasury and justice at the anrcs urging6 congress enacted major amendments to its charter in 1947 pl 8047 61 stat 8083 these changes were perhaps as dramatic as those made in 1905 in particular congress made significant alterations to the managerial structure in response to complaints that the anrcs board was insufficiently democratic7 the law replaced the 18member central committee with 50person board of governors the president appoints eight members of the board one of whom serves as the chairman8 the chapters elect 30 members at the annual anrc convention and these 38 then elect 12 membersatlarge who are to represent the national interests which the corporation serves the effects of this

less the positions perspectives and interests of the federal government since 1947 congress has made modest alterations to the anrcs charter9 thus the anrc charter of today is largely the same as it

reportedly for example president bernadine healy resigned her position after two years on the job saying that she had been forced out by the board17 her successor marsha j evans served little more than three years before resigning in december 200518 critics of the organization have argued that the governance structure of the anrc discourages those who serve as its president and chief executive officer ceo19 from having long tenures20 they point out that in the past seven years the anrc has had three chief executives and three interim executives21 leaders of the anrc they say inevitably find themselves at odds with board dominated by local chapter representatives who lack the experience that is required to oversee large corporation and who are protective of local chapter interests

persons affected by hurricanes katrina and rita23 while there were many positive accounts regarding the relief work of the anrc there also were reports of shortcomings in its performance questions were raised about the practicability of the federal governments reliance on volunteer organization to respond to mass disasters24 there were complaints of racial insensitivity by anrc volunteers

voted to authorize and commission an audit of its governance41 it established an independent42 governance advisory panel and asked it to carefully examine red cross governance and to provide current examples of best practices in forprofit and nonprofit corporations43 according to the anrc the panel was to focus its inquiries on the following topics the size and composition of the board of governors participation by and independence of governors and the process for selecting candidates for the board the organization and functioning of the board of governors including the composition structure and roles of the boards committees the roles and relationships of the board of governors and management the board of governors oversight of the governance practices of the local chapters and

panel delivered report to the board of governors45 and on october 30 2006 the board released to the public more than 150page report american red cross governance for the 21st century report of the board of governors46 according to the report the anrc had authorized and commissioned an audit of the anrcs governance in light of the increased numbers of catastrophic domestic and international events in 2004 and 2005 and with view toward continuing the legacy of the red cross and strengthening its position to meet the unprecedented challenges of the 21st century including terrorism natural and manmade disasters and the need for safe blood supply47 the report contained chapters that examine the aforementioned subjects and two others not required by the board of governors governance oversight of local red cross chapters and enhanced transparency of governance practices the report addresses governance issues rather than operational issues attention was devoted to governance rather than operational subjects and an effort was made to refrain from addressing matters more appropriately handled by management for instance while inquiries were made about structural and reporting relationships among finance treasury and internal audit personnel and the outside auditor effort was made to conduct substantive review of financial reporting or accounting or internal audit procedures while inquiries were made about hotline procedures substantive evaluation of specific hotline or whistleblower complaints was made allegations of theft mismanagement or 45 according to the chairman of the board of the anrc to achieve the transformational changes the board envisioned the governance committee requested that an independent governance advisory panel be created with the assistance of independent counsel to provide the board of governors its substantial expertise and knowledge of best practices in governance working collaboratively with the independent governance advisory panel the governance committee advised the board of improvements and enhancements that it could consider these recommendations accompanied by the historical governance practices of the red cross and an analysis of best practices in nonprofit and forprofit governance formed the basis of draft report that was reviewed and deliberated upon on october 27 2006 by the board of governors bonnie mcelveenhunter letter from the chairman of the board of the american red cross in anrc american red cross governance for the 21st century second page of the report 46 the report of the panel as delivered to the board was not made available to the public it is unclear whether that report differs substantially from the report approved by the board the approved version appears to have had two documents appended to it that were not included in the draft report resolution of the board of governors that was adopted on october 27 2006 and governance committee report of recommendations and approved actions the latter of which included proposals for amending the anrcs charter see anrc american red cross governance for the 21st century pp 145147 and 149156 47 anrc american red cross

various disasters or otherwise likewise were not within the scope of the audit48 the report provided an analysis of the history of the anrcs charter and current managerial best practices it included dozens of recommendations for improving the governance of the anrc generally speaking the panel favored making many changes through anrc governance via alterations to the corporations bylaws rather than through amendments to its charter the rationale for this approach was not stated in the report perhaps to the surprise of some critics of the board of governors49 the report stated that the prevailing view among those interviewed in connection with the governance audit was that chartered unitelected board members understand that their duties as board members run to the national organization and they act accordingly50 nonetheless the report faulted the current board of governors citing structural cultural and historical factors that have blurred the distinction between governance and management functions at the red cross there was according to the report lack of clarity about the role of the board of governors51 the report offered extensive recommendations on measures that might be taken to improve the anrcs board of governors including reducing its size and improving its composition by changing the selection process to favor persons with the skills and experience to prepare them for board membership the panel also recommended establishing national leadership council in order to provide local chapters with forum for their ideas and concerns and creating presidentially appointed cabinet council of eight to 10 officials of us government departments and agencies52 the same day that the report was released the anrc announced that its board of governors had unanimously approved series of recommendations for transformational changes in an effort to modernize its 60yearold governance structure and to enhance the boards ability to support the critical mission of the red cross in the 21st century53 specifically the anrc stated that it would seek four major changes to its charter that would 48 ibid p 24 49 reportedly former anrc president

diverse the second amendment added the following text to the bills sense of congress section 57 in the recommendations and approved actions attachment to its governance audit report the governance committee said that the anrc should consider establishing an ombudsman position on its own authority anrc american red cross governance for the 21st century p 155 the ombudsman proposal did not appear in the anrcs red line document which outlines its preferred amendments to its charter 58 the text reads it is the sense of congress that 1 charitable organizations are an indispensable part of american society but these organizations can only fulfill their important roles by maintaining the trust of the american public 2 trust is fostered by effective governance and transparency which are the principal goals of the recommendations of the board of governors in the governance report and this act 3 federal and state action play an important role in ensuring effective governance and transparency by setting standards rooting out violations and informing the public and 4 while the american national red cross is and will remain federally chartered instrumentality of the united
