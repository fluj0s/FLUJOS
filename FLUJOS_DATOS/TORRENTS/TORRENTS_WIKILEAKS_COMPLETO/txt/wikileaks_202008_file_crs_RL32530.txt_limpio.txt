june 9 2005 robert pirog specialist in energy economics and policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress world oil demand and the effect on oil prices summary the price of oil began rising in october 2003 and reached record levels in 2004 and again in 2005 as result of these price increases consumers budgets have been under pressure business costs have risen and oil producers profits have increased the 109th congress is considering broad energy legislation hr 6 that addresses conditions in the oil and petroleum products markets long term explanatory factor for increasing oil prices could be the decline of the world reserve base the reserves to production ratio is the measure which indicates the worlds ability to maintain current production based on proved reserves over the past decade there has been little change in the reserve to production ratio suggesting that at least for now long term forces are not driving up the price of oil wide variety of cyclic and short term factors have converged in such way that the growth of demand has been unexpectedly high causing upward pressure on oil prices those factors which have been identified as contributing to the high price of oil include the resumption of relatively rapid growth rates of gross domestic product in many countries around the world declining value of the us dollar gasoline prices the changing structure of the oil industry opec policies and the persistently low levels of us crude oil and gasoline inventories expectations concerning future market conditions are quickly embodied in oil prices formed in futures markets like the new york mercantile exchange the fear of terrorism and war uncertainty concerning the relationship between the russian government and the oil company yukos and other political factors are quickly reflected in price along with real political unrest like that experienced by oil producing venezuela and nigeria speculative buying and selling might also affect prices as financial traders adjust their investment portfolios to reflect expected market conditions demand patterns for world oil and oil products show significant diversity by country region and product groupings as result of this diversity it is not possible to attach blame for the current level of price to any one nation region or product segment the view that the oil market is international in scope and tightly interrelated is enhanced by the demand data as result of the integrated nature of the world oil market it is unlikely that any one nation acting on its own can implement policies that isolate its market from broader price behavior as new major oil importers notably china and potentially india expand their demand the oil market likely will have to expand production capacity this promises to increase the worlds dependence on the persian gulf members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries especially saudi arabia and maintain upward pressure on price this report will be updated contents background 1 oil prices 2 reserves and production 5 price and markets 7 economic growth 8 exchange rates 9 gasoline

characterized by strong demand growth that began in 2003 and continued through 2004 and into 2005 as result of this growth and the resulting high prices consumers budgets were under pressure the profits of energy producers were up and consuming nations again had to face the economic and political costs of dependence on imported oil appropriate policy responses to world oil market conditions may well depend on whether the factors that pushed the market to its current level are likely to be temporary or permanent the lessons of past volatility in the oil market suggest that even transitory forces and market adjustments can yield not only changing prices but changing patterns of consumption and production as well past performance also suggests that the expectation or actuality of period of high prices or reduced availability of supply can change economic incentives as both consumers and producers adjust to the new perceived conditions this report analyzes the factors that have driven both demand and supply in the world oil market in the period 2003 through 2005 the report provides and analyzes basic information to inform debate on broad energy legislation hr 6 background while the primary focus of this report is on conditions in the u s market analyses should be carried out in the context of the larger world market few actions by consuming or producing nations can be properly evaluated independently of the world market oil is fungible international commodity whose ownership and ultimate destination is determined by market forces once it leaves the producing country country can effectively isolate itself from changes elsewhere in the market nor is it likely that any nation can take actions that do not indirectly affect other nations oil prices are linked like those of other commodities to the levels of economic activity in the industrial nations demand both from consumers and industrial users tends to pick up when growth rates of gross domestic product increase and slow down when those growth rates decline as result oil prices tend to be volatile at least partly due to variations in the business cycle while oil markets may behave like other commodity markets much of the time the oil market does have unique features first few commodity markets have an institution like the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec since its creation in 1960 opec has had variable influence on the price of oil through crs2 its member nation quota system second oil has been subject to supply disruption due to political instability as well as technical factors third psychological or expectations effects tied to real or perceived probabilities of market disruption may lead to price volatility finally world oil transactions are settled in us dollars which affects the value of the dollar in world currency markets as well as the magnitude of international reserves held by petroleum importing and exporting nations around the world oil prices spot market price data for west texas intermediate wti at cushing oklahoma is shown in figure 11 during the time period covered in figure 1 the opec price band for crude oil was at 22 to 28 per barrel accounting for quality and location differences between the opec reference crude saudi arabian light and wti prices in the us spot market during 2003 remained close to or were above the upper end of the opec price band however prices moderated for several months after the beginning of the iraq war in march 2003 figure 1 us spot price of oil 20032005 dollars per barrel 55 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 jan 2003 may

fall of 2003 and continued into 2004 reaching yearly peak of over 53 per barrel in october 2004 although prices fell by 10 per barrel by december 2004 they began to rise again in january 2005 and peaked again 1 spot market prices are for current delivery of physical oil in this case wti at cushing oklahoma crs3 at nearly 53 per barrel in april 20052 some insight into future spot market prices might be gained by examining nymex futures market prices3 for example in the five days before it terminated trading on july 20 2004 the august 2004 contract on wti at cushing oklahoma was trading at over 40 per barrel as of july 23 2004 the september and october wti futures contracts continued to trade at over 41 per barrel on the nymex4 on august 10 2004 the nymex futures price for crude oil traded above 45 first in the history of the exchange on the same day the spot market price for wti was at 44485 these data accurately suggested that high crude oil prices were likely to continue for the remainder of 2004 by the end of may 2005 futures prices for the august 2005 contract were trading at nearly 50 per barrel and the september 2005 contract was trading at 5041 per barrel these prices suggest that while the crude oil price might remain volatile reacting to current market conditions it is unlikely that prices will return to pre2003 price increase levels for the remainder of 2005 figure 2 shows the behavior of spot market prices for reformulated regular gasoline at new york harbor the price of gasoline has shown pattern of movement somewhat similar to that of oil prices 2 oil daily oil nears 45bbl on iraqi supply concerns vol54 no152 august 10 2004 p1 3 the nymex trades futures contracts on crude oil futures contracts obligate buyers and sellers to purchase or deliver crude oil one or more months in the future however delivery of crude oil rarely occurs in conjunction with futures contracts the difference between the contracted future price and the actual cash price when the futures contract comes due or expires is usually settled in cash during the trading life of the futures contract its value either increases or decreases on daily basis depending on the current spot value of crude oil futures contracts are thought to aid in price formation in that they process current information and embody it in future price of oil trading in futures contracts terminates at the close of the 3rd business day prior to the 25th calendar day of the month preceding the delivery month of the contract for example the august 2004 contract terminated trading on july 20 2004 4 energy information administration weekly petroleum status report for the week ending july 30 2004 table 16 p30 5 oil daily oil futures take breather after breaching 45bbl mark vol54 no153 august 11 2004 p3 crs4 figure 2 us spot market price for reformulated regular gasoline new york harbor 20032005 gasoline prices peaked in february and august of 2003 they then lagged oil prices not showing price increases in the fall of 2003 however they did follow oil price increases throughout the spring of 2004 also peaking in may of 2004 gasoline prices were volatile for the remainder of 2004 after the may peak the price remained approximately 12 cents per gallon lower for the next four months although the price went above 137 per gallon in october 2004 it finished the year at 107 about 24 off the may peak gasoline spot prices increased in 2005 by april 2005 the price peaked at over 152 per gallon on june 3 2005 the nymex future prices for gasoline in july august and september were above 150 per gallon6 as in the oil market these futures prices suggest that there is likely to be only modest if any moderation in gasoline prices for the rest of the year conclusions concerning projected spot prices based on the trading value of current futures contracts may or may not be accurate futures prices process new information and market conditions quickly and prices can change direction on daily basis the futures price on the nymex and other markets is conditional on information available today as more information becomes available futures prices will adjust however futures markets are providing little indication that either oil or gasoline prices might decline in the near term 6 energy information administration weekly petroleum status report for the week ending may 27 2005 table 16 p30 crs5 reserves and production the long term ability of the oil market to meet demand depends on the magnitude of available reserves an important category of reserves are proved reserves proved reserves are those quantities that geological and engineering analysis suggest can be recovered with high probability under existing technological and economic conditions proved reserves can be augmented through exploration and development of new discoveries through technological improvements as well as through the existence of more favorable economic conditions in the past all of these factors have contributed to augmenting the proved reserve base whether the proved reserve base grows over time or not depends in part on the level of production as production proceeds the level of proved reserves declines as new oil discoveries are made recovery technologies improve or as the price of oil rises the stock of proved reserves increases standard measure of the potential availability of oil over time is the reserve to production ratio rp the rp can be interpreted as the number of years that the existing reserve base can sustain the current level of production since both proved reserves and production can change yeartoyear the value of the rp is more descriptive as measure of potential market viability when considered over time table 1 shows the rp over the past 20 years for the world as well as various regions table 1 shows that on the world level there appears to be little cause for concern that oil is physically running out while the rp is lower in 2003 than in 1993 it is actually higher than it was in 19837 reasonable estimate given the political changes since 1983 might be that the ratio has remained roughly constant over the past 2 decades leading to the inference that 2003 levels of consumption seem to be about as sustainable as 1983 and 1993 levels of consumption were at those times even though 2003 world consumption levels were 17 greater than those of 1993 7 as noted in the table the numbers for 1983 are not strictly comparable to those from later years because of the lack of clear data for the ussr the 1983 data might be interpreted as reserves available to the market economies as soviet production and reserves did not enter the world oil market as normal matter of commerce in 1983 crs6 table 1 oil reserveproduction ratios selected years 1983 1993 2003 world 316 425 410 us 70 77 113 north america 146 179 122 south and central america 255 429 415 europe and eurasia incomplete 162 171 middle east 764 923 881 africa 329

tables 14 30 pp 30 84 europe and eurasian data incomplete because of lack of ussr data for 1983 the reserve portion of the ratio shows that the world had access to more reserves in 2003 than in 1993 or 1983 reserves in 2003 totaled 1147 trillion barrels reserves in 1993 were 1023 trillion barrels and in 1983 were 723 billion barrels these data represent over 12 increase in reserves for the decade since 1993 and 36 increase compared to 1983 similarly world production is greater in 2003 at 767 million barrels per day bd than in 1993 when production was 66 million bd or 1983 when production was 579 million bd this represents an increase in production of over 32 compared to 19838 on regional level the most important change between 1993 and 2003 is the weakening reserve position of north america and the reserve position of the united states on one level the data suggest that the us position is improving the us rp has increased from 77 years in 1993 to 113 years in 2003 and total us reserves have also increased to 307 billion barrels from 302 billion barrels in 1993 however the us rp has increased because us production has declined from 86 million bd in 1993 to 74 million bd 2003 as us total consumption has increased over the period the result has been that us imports of oil have increased along with our dependence on other nations and the world oil market the declining reserve position of north america in general means that absent new major discoveries the united states will continue to depend on the world market and the opec persian gulf nations for large part of its supply9 8 bp statistical review of world energy 2004 june 2004 pp46 9 in 2003 the united states imported over 96 million bd of crude oil opec provided the united states over 45 million bd of crude oil or about 47 of total imports saudi arabia provided about 17 million bd of total us imports or about 18 source energy information administration petroleum supply monthly july 2004 table s3 pp815 crs7 the middle east and especially saudi arabia continue to be the largest holders of reserves in the world some of the other regional changes in the data reflect changing national and political borders as well as oil positions european reserves are now dominated by members of the former soviet bloc including azerbaijan kazakhstan romania and others overall the data suggest the continuation of an integrated world oil market any region or nation might well experience difficulty in trying to implement singular oil policy independent of the world market another conclusion that might be drawn from the rp data is that it provides little support for the escalated prices of the first quarter of 2004 since little has changed in the long term balance between reserves and production it is unlikely that the rp has been the source of upward price pressures long term oil prices might be affected by reserve and production positions in the future but rp ratios do not appear to be major cause of recent oil price increases the world rp has stayed roughly constant over the past 2 decades because investments have been made in exploration development and production the international energy agency estimates that over 3 trillion or 103 billion per year will need to be invested in the oil sector through 2030 if its projections for increased demand materialize it estimates that 70 of this total will be spent on exploration and development with the remainder in refining transportation and the development of nonconventional oil sources10 oil industry investment is only partly required to meet new demand only 16 of total investment is projected to meet new demand growth the remaining 84 is required to compensate for declining production from the reserve base the reason so much investment is needed to compensate for declining fields lies in the decline rates observed in producing fields decline rates depend on wide variety of factors including geology extraction technology field age and production policies decline rates range from 4 to over 11 per year if production levels are to be maintained new reserves and production must continually be developed to compensate financed by investment in exploration and development11 price and markets after averaging about 23 per barrel for the five year period 1998 to 2002 the average price of oil increased to 31 in 2003 for 2004 price remained high reaching peak of 5328 per barrel in october12 as of april 2005 the price of oil continued to remain over 50 per barrel and peaked at 54 per barrel in march 10

p27 crs8 200413 rp analysis showed that there has been little change in the underlying long term balance in the oil market that might be used to justify high prices however number of short term economic fundamentals as well as the coincidence of set of singular events affecting the market may have interacted in such way that prices were pushed up economic growth economic growth in oil consuming nations increases the demand for oil and pushes up oil prices the world economy continued its recovery in 2003 and 2004 with gross domestic product gdp growth rates increasing in many regions the strongest growth performances were in oil importing united states and china but better performance was also observed in japan and russia as well as the emerging growth nations of asia us growth was 31 in 2003 and forecast to reach 46 during 2004 chinese economic growth was 74 in 2003 and projected to be 68 in 2004 moderating only slightly for 200514 in the united states economic growth has been linked to high levels of oil consumption of which increasing gasoline demand is an important component in china expanding exports have increased the industrial demand for oil and rising consumer income has increased consumers demand for gasoline us oil demand increased by 19 in 2003 to over 20 million bd chinese oil demand increased by 115 in 2003 to almost 6 million bd15 in both the united states and china the increase in gdp growth and economic activity in general has led to increases in energy demand however feedback relationship exists which can mitigate this effect to the extent that oil prices rise reflecting increased oil demand gdp growth rates might decline for two reasons16 if the monetary authorities interpret increasing oil costs as generalized price inflation they may adopt restrictive monetary policies which could slow the economys growth also if oil product prices rise and consumers are unable or unwilling to reduce oil product consumption consumers may reduce expenditures on other goods and services again potentially slowing the rate of gdp growth17 13 prices are for west texas intermediate crude oil located at cushing oklahoma analysts frequently monitor two prices in the oil market the spot price and the futures price as traded on the new york mercantile exchange both provide useful information the spot price is good measure of current tightness in the physical product market the near month and succeeding futures prices measure the markets expectations for future supply and demand balance the two price sets are related because at expiration the near month future price must equal the then current spot market price to avoid an arbitrage opportunity 14 international monetary fund world economic outlook 2004 april 2004 table 11 p3 15 bp statistical review of world energy 2004 june 2004 p9 16 both of these reasons are relevant to current monetary policy decisions see washington post predicting growth fed lifts key rates august 11 2004 p1 17 for further analysis on the effects of oil price shocks on the macroeconomy see marc labonte the effects of oil shocks on the economy review of the empirical evidence crs report rl31608 updated june 25 2004 crs9 while the united states and china increased their demands for crude oil and petroleum products as result of their gdp growth russia an oil exporter improved its gdp growth rate as result of the expansion of the petroleum industry for russia it is likely that expansion of the oil sector led the growth in russian gdp this behavior is typical of nations whose oil exporting sector is major component of their gdp for nations in this category high oil prices based on rising oil demand create an inflow of oil derived revenue increasing gdp growth the danger for these nations is that if prices go too high and stay high gdp growth in the consuming nations might decline reducing the demand and price of oil an additional factor is that high prices lead to increases in exploration and development budgets around the world as new oil is found and brought to market supply increases and prices might be reduced damaging the oil exporting nations growth or high oil prices can make alternative fuels more competitive potentially reducing the demand for oil exchange rates changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar can affect the level and distribution of world oil demand the us dollar achieved recent peak value in february of 2002 since that time the index measuring the value of the dollar has declined by over 2018 the decline in the dollars value has not been uniform against all currencies most of the change has been against nations in the euro area the japanese and some of our other asian trading partners have intervened in the currency markets in an attempt to prevent the dollar from declining in value relative to their currencies china maintains fixed exchange rate against the dollar as result the yuan has experienced appreciation against the dollar exchange rate variations in the us dollar can affect the world price of oil because oil is priced in dollars and generally paid for in dollars several results may follow from this relationship first if the value of the dollar declines against other currencies the dollars received by oil exporting nations are worth less in terms of world purchasing power if oil exporters are able to exert market power in setting prices or if market conditions permit oil exporters to dictate higher prices they have incentives to increase the money price of oil in an attempt to preserve the purchasing power they earn through selling barrel of oil the effect of declining dollar on oil importing consumer nations varies with respect to how their currency has adjusted to the changing value of the dollar for the united states of course any increase in the dollar price of oil is immediately felt as an increased price burden possibly leading to decreases in demand for the euro area consumers the situation is different since the value of the euro has increased in terms of dollars the effect of any increase in dollar denominated oil prices is offset by the amount of euro appreciation for example if the euro appreciates by the same percent that the price of oil in dollars increases the two effects cancel each other the 18 federal reserve board of governors price adjusted major currencies dollar index available at httpfederalreservegovreleases viewed on august 10 2004 crs10 result is that the demand for oil in the euro area is less likely to be affected by high oil prices as long as the euro appreciates19 nations that intervene in world currency markets to prevent the dollar from falling relative to their currencies for example japan korea and taiwan are implicitly choosing to forego the associated real reduction in oil prices an appreciating currency would bring to preserve the export advantage for their goods that lower exchange rate brings since these nations are both large oil importers as well as major exporters on world markets the choice can have important implications for their economies china which maintains fixed exchange rate against the us dollar also foregoes any exchange rate based benefit with respect to oil purchases in favor of supporting export industries gasoline prices crude oil is the major physical input in the production of gasoline and accounts for over 40 of its cost20 as result changes in the cost of crude oil will be reflected in gasoline prices recently it might be that the relationship has been reversed the high price of gasoline may have become factor in keeping the price of oil at elevated levels especially on the new york mercantile exchange nymex gasoline prices have achieved record levels since they began increasing in the first quarter of 2004 although the rising price of crude oil is one factor other factors exist which are independent of the oil market in general the high utilization rates of refinery capacity in the united states the lack of investments in new refining capacity the extra costs associated with producing the variety of different gasoline mixes to satisfy environmental requirements in various regions of the country low inventories as the summer driving season 2004 approached and the high cost of refinery investment to meet both product and site environmental requirements all contribute to the record levels of gasoline prices additionally on the nymex condition known as backwardation was common during the first half of 2004 in this situation the nearmonth futures contract in this case regular grade gasoline delivered to new york harbor is persistently priced higher than the price level of the same gasoline scheduled for delivery months further in the future the effect of this pricing condition is to make the acquisition of inventories in the present month more expensive than acquiring them further in the future backwardation provides an incentive to keep current inventories low the low current inventory position then acts as factor keeping prices high because low inventories are taken to be indicative of tight supply situation in the market it is possible that the high price of gasoline price that is highly visible in the us market might contribute to keeping the price of oil high through an expectations 19 the results of an appreciating currency are not all positive economists believe that an appreciating currency raises the cost of that nations exports on the world market this cost increase reduces their sales and if the reduction in sales is large enough might reduce the gdp growth in the nation with the appreciating currency 20 energy information administration primer on gasoline prices 2004 p2 crs11 based effect traders could hypothesize that since the price of gasoline is high this might be the result of tight oil markets if not there would be more oil refined and gasoline produced driving down the price these expectations could be acted upon through the nymex futures markets this position ignores the importance of the independent factors cited in this report that suggest that gasoline prices in the united states would likely have risen even if the price of crude oil moderated industry structure recent study by the government accountability office gao asserted that total of over 2600 merger transactions took place in the oil industry from 1991 through 2000 these mergers fell into two main classes asset mergers and corporate mergers asset mergers accounted for approximately 80 of the total and the remaining 20 were corporate mergers asset mergers are defined by the gao as one company purchasing part or specific asset from another company for example tosco petroleums acquisition of unocals refining and marketing assets on the west coast in 1997 was an asset merger corporate mergers are defined as those in which one company acquires the other companys total assets resulting in one company examples include exxonmobil and chevrontexaco which produced two of the super major oil companies21 possible outcome of mergers and acquisitions is that the resulting companies larger and more capable of exerting market power raise prices to the detriment of consumers gao carried out econometric analysis on set of these mergers and found that mergers and the resulting higher concentration ratios observed in the oil industry resulted in wholesale price increases of about 2 cents per gallon in six of the eight specific cases it examined22 the federal trade commission and its staff have challenged the gao finding on methodological grounds and question the validity of their conclusions23 if the mergers that took place in the us oil industry did raise wholesale gasoline prices it is possible that retail gasoline prices also increased as result if that was so in period when oil markets were perceived to be tight those price increases might have fed back through the futures market process described in previous section of this report to help support high oil prices opec policy opec seeks to create favorable oil prices for its members by assigning production quotas to its member nations with the goal of limiting the supply of crude oil available on the world market the ability of the quota system to control price has been questioned because of the well known propensity for opec members to produce beyond their assigned production levels even so the very existence of 21 united states general accounting office energy markets effects of mergers and market concentration in the us petroleum industry gao0496 may 2004 p34 22 ibid p6 23 ibid pp153158 171193 crs12 opec has influenced conditions in the petroleum market as buyers and sellers await decisions taken at opec meetings and monitor the institutions behavior at certain times in its history opec has had relatively clear influence on oil prices as in 1996 when flood of saudi crude oil came on the market and drove down prices in response to recent price increases opec has maintained that shortage of crude oil on the world market is not the reason opec has asserted that the market is well supplied and its actual production has exceeded quota levels opec official production for june 2004 was announced as 255 million bd by the opec 10 to increase to 26 million bd on august 1 200424 actual opec production for june was thought to exceed 29 million bd25 although gross volumes are consistent with market that is not suffering from supply tightness the effects of product segmentation must be considered fundamental breakdown in the crude oil market exists between sweet or low sulfur content and sour high sulfur content oil it may be that opec volumes of sour crude make the overall market appear in balance while tightness in the sweet crude market underlies this overall balance sweet crude oil is useful in efficiently producing the low sulfur transportation fuels both gasoline and diesel that environmental regulations increasingly require and is important to nations with relatively strict air quality standards the role of opec in the 2004 market price may be more traceable to actions taken in 2002 in 2002 opec production declined from an average of over 30 million bd to approximately 285 million bd decline of some 5 this production cutback changed the nature of the market in 2003 as economic growth began to recover and enhance oil demand growth production in 2003 not only had to satisfy the growing demand requirements of 2003 but also to compensate for the reduced availability in 2002 which reduced inventories the result of these conditions is that as the market evolved in late 2003 and into 2004 with economic growth strengthening persistent shortfalls in inventory levels were observed inventories the united states holds petroleum stocks in three ways the oil industry holds stocks of crude oil in inventory as well as stocks of petroleum products these stocks are held to insure the efficient operation of refineries in the face of shifting seasonal product demand and potential disruptions in crude oil supply seasonal fluctuations in product demand are managed through varying the stocks of petroleum products mainly gasoline if inventories of either crude oil or gasoline are low relative to the past average or in the perception of market traders this is taken to be an indication that the market is tight implying that demand is nearly equal to or might even exceed potential supply at current price levels as result upward pressure on price occurs even if there is physical shortage observable 24 the opec 10 nations does not include iraq which is excluded from quota restrictions 25 oil daily opec turns up the volume but will markets respond in kind vol 54 123 june 29 2004 p6 crs13 figure 3 shows the behavior of crude oil stocks in the united states excluding the strategic petroleum reserve the level of reserves in 2003 is relatively low compared to 2002 stocks are increasing in 2004 on month to month comparative basis with 2003 but satisfying growing demand at the same time that stocks are growing contributes to the strong demand that has been major factor in oil price increases it has been reported that us crude oil inventories during the last week of july 2004 reached 2986 million barrels which on its own was judged to be consistent with price of oil of around 26 per barrel26 figure 3 us crude oil stocks excluding strategic petroleum reserve several factors have contributed to the decline in stocks held by the private sector long term trend in the refining sector particularly and the oil industry in general is cost reduction inventory is expensive to hold and one way to minimize costs is to reduce the size of inventory and expand the use of efficient inventory management techniques while this strategy benefits the profitability of the companies it has the side effect of providing less of buffer in times of surging demand second when the futures market for commodities is in normal price relationship prices for future delivery tend to be somewhat higher than current prices making inventory accumulation economically viable recently oil future markets have reversed the more typical price structure and the future price has been lower than the current price providing disincentive to accumulate inventories at current prices the third factor contributing to low inventories in the private sector is the tight market refineries are near full capacity production and supplies of 26 oil daily analysts weigh impact of fear in oil price vol54 no151 august 9 2004 p1 crs14 light low sulfur crude oil are perceived to be tight on the world market27 taken together this is difficult set of circumstances within which to expand stocks of oil for inventory however since inventories remain low in the view of some market traders they are one more factor contributing to the high price of oil the third way the united states holds stocks in this case crude oil is in the strategic petroleum reserve spr this governmentheld reserve was established to provide buffer against physical disruption in the delivery of imported crude oil recently there have been calls to either suspend deliveries to the spr or to release oil from the spr to the market with the intent of increasing market supply reducing speculation and moderating prices28 exceptional events this section briefly identifies and discusses set of factors that may exert an influence on oil prices but seem to be more in the nature of one time event rather than trend or cyclic factor the effect of each of these factors tends to be made more important by the general tightness of the market in some cases there is an interactive relationship between two or more of these factors again possibly increasing the overall effect on price the war in iraq has contributed to high oil prices in different ways as events have progressed the predominant effect of the conflict on oil prices has been an increase in uncertainty during the early stages of the conflict concerns about possible disruption of oil supply out of the persian gulf and disruption of iraqi production due to military operations were prominent until it became clear that the military would quickly oust the government of saddam hussein later market uncertainty revolved around the ability of iraq to export oil in the midst of political transition in which pipeline and other oil facilities were attacked by hostile groups within the country uncertainty with respect to terrorist attacks both in iraq and spilling over to other gulf nations including saudi arabia continue to unsettle the oil market and contribute to fear factor being built into the price of oil recent terrorist attacks in saudi arabia directed at the oil industry and its personnel are more than psychological influence on the market recent reports have asserted that as of july 2004 world spare production capacity was between one and two million bd almost all in saudi arabia29 this level of spare capacity is close to the minimum amount required to cover supply disruption from one exporting nation major disruption in saudi oil production would cause that cushion to disappear and would likely cause upward volatility in world oil markets 27 energy information administration

to bankrupt the company or force the sale of producing assets markets are concerned that bankruptcy or significant asset sales might lead to an oil supply cutoff or reduction of exports from russia the worlds largest nonopec producer30 another factor that some feel might be influencing the price of oil is the influence of financial investors and financial instruments at the time of the first oil shock in 19731974 the primary market for oil price formation was the rotterdam spot market where physical cargoes of oil for near term delivery were bought and sold generally by traders who had real commodity interest in the market31 today the primary market in price formation may be the nymex supplemented by the international petroleum exchange ipe in these markets the focus is not on physical supply for current delivery but on the open interest in financial contract generally future or options contract that will expire in the near month generally the month after the current month the goal of financial traders is to make profit on the contract which may necessitate the price of the contract rising or falling depending on the traders position in the market and current prices the implication of this is that financial traders may have an interest in the price moving either up or down almost without regard to the underlying fundamentals of the market the rationale for this view is that financial traders have entered the nymex oil market in large numbers seeking profits that stock and bond markets have not produced since the boom years of the late 1990s profits can be earned on futures and options markets when prices of the underlying commodities go steadily up or down stay the same or even when they exhibit more or less random volatility depending on the strategic position the trader has created sectoral demand patterns global oil demand was over 79 million bd in 2003 an increase of about 18 over 2002 levels demand for 2004 was over 82 million bd an increase of about 3 compared to 2003 levels demand projections for 2004 were increased for nine consecutive months by the iea since its estimate in november 2003 world oil demand is expected to exceed 84 million

and 18 respectively within the region most of the large gains in demand are in nations with small initial consumption levels led by azerbaiijan belarus austria and poland these nations account for 12 of world demand although lower than average european oil demand growth may be tied to levels of economic activity they may also be tied to changing consumption patterns and conservation especially in western europe where motor vehicle transportation costs are very high russian oil consumption grew by 23000 bd to 25 million bd in 2003 while production rose by 845000 bd to over 85 million bd enhancing the nations role as major exporter however the russian economy has been in trouble for many years if economic growth picks up and the economy restructures and stabilizes consumption might return to levels similar to those in 1993 when 38 million bd were consumed russian consumption at that level might reduce the amount of oil available for export pushing other consuming nations to become increasingly dependent on middle eastern supplies crs17 the asia pacific region includes some nations with the highest yeartoyear growth rates in the world while other nations in the region experience declining demand in 2003 china strengthened its position as the second largest oil consuming nation in the world by increasing its margin over japan from only 20000 bd in 2002 to 431000 bd in 2003 given the disparity of economic growth rates geographic and population factors as well as the comparative density of transportation it seems that the chinese lead over japan may widen at current growth rates more relevant question might be when china will overtake the united states as the worlds largest consumer this is most likely not competition either nation will directly benefit from winning the united states imported about 63 of the oil it consumed in 2003 and production has fallen every year since 1993 china imported about 45 of the oil it consumed and production increased by only 15 for 2003 less than the 115 increase in demand the growing demands in both the united states and china make it likely that the world oil market will become increasingly dependent on middle eastern oil in the coming years and keep exerting upward pressure on price petroleum product demand product demand analysis reveals that there are regional and country differences in the mix of oil based products consumed gasolines middle distillates fuel oil and other products are the main groups33 at the world level gasolines comprise 316 of consumption middle distillates 357 fuel oil 122 and other products 2053435 the consumption pattern in the united states differs from the world averages the us demand is 462 gasoline 293 middle distillates 38 fuel oil and 207 other products36 this mix reflects the us use of oil as transportation fuel with car and light truck use responsible for the relatively high gasoline percentage the us refinery industry is unable to supply adequate gasoline to the domestic market as result imports of finished gasoline and gasoline blendstocks have increased to almost one million barrels per day us refineries operate at near full capacity but lack of new capacity expansion by the industry suggests further increases in imported gasoline if available on the world market37 33 gasoline includes aviation and motor gasoline as well as other light distillates middle distillates includes jet fuel heating kerosene and other products fuel oil includes marine bunkers and crude oil used as fuel others includes refinery gas lubricants wax solvents refinery fuels and other products 34 product demand data for the world exclude the nations associated with the former soviet union 35 bp statistical review of world energy june 2004 p12 36 ibid 37 imported gasoline must meet us performance standards which themselves are multitude of federal state regional and local regulations if these requirements are different than those foreign refiner is prepared to meet product may not be available to the us market foreign refiners must undertake refinery investments to adapt processes continued crs18 europe has different preferences in transportation fuels than the united states middle distillates dominate the european product slate at 44 with gasoline at 244 these values reflect the ongoing shift to diesel engines in european passenger vehicles as product demand shifts refiners are following by investing in the technology needed to produce greater proportions of middle distillates and less gasoline as this transformation proceeds european refiners may find that they have less surplus gasoline available for export to the united states this outcome could lead to tightening us gasoline markets keeping an upward pressure on the price of gasoline and indirectly supporting high oil prices the asian pattern of product demand especially chinas includes larger portion of demand 138 in the case of china dedicated to fuel oil this percentage is approximately three times that of the united states the use of fuel oil in industry accounts for the difference as well as the lower requirements for gasoline for private automobile use future projections the international energy agency recently reduced its forecast for global oil demand in 2005 it estimated that world demand would be 843 million barrels per day in 2005 this value represents growth of 177 million barrels per day or 22 above 2004 levels38 in typical manufacturing or service market demand growth of this magnitude might be welcomed and met with increased job creation and facility expansion or more intensive use of existing facilities conditions in the oil and oil products industries might not be so accommodating excess capacity in the crude oil market is low with most estimates averaging less than 15 million barrels per day if we add the increased estimate of consumption in 2004 to the projected increase in 2005 it is clear that the crude oil industry is likely to be at full production capacity through 2005 it has been reported that aramco saudi arabia has plan in place to expand production by 1 million barrels per day within year nonopec production is expected to increase by about 14 million barrels per day in 2004 but only smaller increases are expected in 200539 high prices if they persist can be expected to increase exploration and ultimately production in the longer term if the current market follows past patterns the eias annual energy outlook 2004 aeo provides projection of us energy balance out to 2025 and

assumed to be determined on the world market for the base case the aeo assumes crude oil price of 2361 per barrel in 2010 and 2671 per barrel in 2025 for the high price case aeo assumes price of 3280 per barrel in 2010 and 3490 per barrel in 202540 if the factors that are influencing the current market continue in the future it may be that even the high price case assumptions are too low conclusions the world oil market as result of the convergence of number of factors has experienced significant tightness since the end of 2003 continuing through 2004 and the first half of 2005 some of the factors influencing the market might be temporary some may be cyclical and others may possibly be permanent while the high prices that resulted from the tight balance between oil demand and supply caused increased energy expenditures for consumers business and industry it also led to higher incomes for energy producers it is possible that the economy as whole might experience macroeconomic effects not only from the high oil prices themselves but as result of the monetary and fiscal policy responses that might be taken if the high prices persist and are determined to constitute inflation although it has been under pressure in 2003 2004 and into 2005 the oil market has shown that the market process is functioning the factors discussed in this paper that affected oil and gasoline demand as well as the supply response of opec and other producers caused prices to rise but there has been little or evidence of physical shortage or supply disruption effective policies to mitigate high oil prices are difficult to define at the national level the price of oil is determined on world market it is unlikely that any consuming nation can insulate itself from the forces driving the world market for example if nation decided to reduce or eliminate its direct dependence on the persian gulf it might succeed in doing that by buying oil from other nations however this would reduce the total amount of nonpersian gulf oil available to other nations increasing their dependence on the region and leaving the level of world dependence unchanged if political events in the persian gulf caused the price of oil to rise that price increase would be transmitted to all oil produced around the world it is not possible to isolate oneself from the world market except perhaps by cutting domestic consumption to the level of domestic production the market in 2004 was likely affected by fear factor premium on the price of oil raising its price above that indicated by market fundamentals some estimates of the fear factor run as high as 15 per barrel while others rate it at only few dollars or nothing at all41 the threat of supply disruption due to potential terrorism or political instability appears to be the source of this price factor an important 40 these prices are expressed in 2002 dollars to control for inflation 41 oil daily analysts weigh impact of fear factor in oil price vol 54 151 august 9 2004 p1 crs20 question is how long this factor will influence price in the past fears of political instability especially in the persian gulf tended to be quelled in relatively short timeframes today with the war on terrorism perceived as long term reality it may be that oil prices will incorporate fear factor for significant time the nature of the exploration and production cycle in the oil industry encourages major swings in the price of oil even in more politically stable times this cycle makes it difficult for governments to time oil policies effectively in the past periods of high oil prices have led to rapid expansion of exploration and given improving technology have led to substantial oil finds in many places in the world as newly discovered extra oil comes on the market several years later the increased supply tends to overwhelm demand causing price to drop while demand tends to increase incrementally by few percent per year supply tends to increase discrete amounts in response to period of high prices this relationship leads to cyclic price volatility set against this record is the opinion of some that world oil production is soon to peak as result of geological factors and the likelihood that the largest oil reserves have already been discovered42 major continuing factor in the market is the emergence of china as major importer of crude oil in addition the possibility exists that india and perhaps other asian nations might expand their imports of oil as industrial production expands in those nations although the 2005 projection of chinese import growth moderates to approximately 7 from the 2003 level of 112 in the longer term much depends on whether oil use for private automobiles in china expands very quickly or is moderated by the government however either of these yearly growth rates imply stress for the world oil market based on chinas consumption of almost 6 million barrels per day in 2003 it may generate increases of demand of 500 thousand bd or more in the next few years in market with very limited excess capacity and possibly facing the discovery of fewer giant fields increases in demand of these magnitudes promise to contribute to an upward pressure on price the 2004 and potentially for 2005 oil market reflects the influence of number of factors all of which have led to upward pressure on price although some of these factors might have been judged temporary in the past there is danger that in the current political environment they may perpetuate themselves
