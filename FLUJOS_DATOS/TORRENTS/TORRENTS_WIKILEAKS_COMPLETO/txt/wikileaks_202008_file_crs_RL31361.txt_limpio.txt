fuel standards updated may 10 2006 brent d yacobucci specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress boutique fuels and reformulated gasoline harmonization of fuel standards summary the current system of gasoline standards in the united states is complex because of federal and state programs to improve air quality and local refining and marketing decisions suppliers of gasoline face many different standards for fuel quality as result fuels are formulated to meet varying standards state and local decisions overlap with federal requirements leading to situations where adjacent or nearby areas may have significantly different standards these various fuel formulations are often referred to as boutique fuels in this system supply disruptions can result if fuel from one area cannot be used to supply another area because of potential supply concerns there is interest in simplifying harmonizing the system so that regional or national standards are consistent however the competing goals of air quality supply stability and costs make harmonizing the system complex process adding to these complications are concerns over methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe common gasoline additive that has been detected in groundwater in numerous states at least 25 states have passed legislation to ban or limit the use of mtbe on august 8 2005 president bush signed the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 among other provisions pl 10958 addressed several boutique fuels issues as result of pl 10958 key component of the federal reformulated gasoline rfg program was eliminated may 6 2006 this requirement which gasoline suppliers asserted was facto mtbe requirement was used by gasoline suppliers as defense against liability for mtbe contamination therefore while pl 10958 actually gives the industry more flexibility the industry moved quickly to eliminate mtbe from the gasoline supply in spring 2006 this increased pressure on already tight refining capacity the loss in volume and energy from eliminating mtbe increased demand for gasoline as well as ethanol exacerbating the supply problem was the fact that the industry was making the transition from winter gasoline to more stringent summertime air quality specifications which adds competition for the highestquality gasoline components these pressures along with historically high crude oil prices led to historically high gasoline prices further some localized areas faced shortterm supply disruptions as refineries made the transition this report discusses how gasoline composition is regulated and explains the various federal and state gasoline standards next the report presents some of the key issues with the federal rfg program some of the problems associated with boutique fuels are discussed as well as some of the potential effects of harmonization finally congressional actions in the 109th congress related to boutique fuels rfg and harmonization including the passage of pl 10958 are discussed this report will be updated as events warrant contents introduction 1 what are boutique fuels 1 what is the concern over boutique

gasoline harmonization of fuel standards introduction because of federal and state programs to improve air quality and local refining and marketing decisions suppliers of gasoline must supply fuel that meets number of different standards according to exxonmobil as of 2002 there were 18 different gasoline formulations required across the country1 depending on how various overlapping standards are counted this number can increase or decrease2 the two key federal programs are the reformulated gasoline program rfg which aims to reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants and ozoneforming compounds and the oxygenated fuels oxyfuel program which aims to reduce carbon monoxide emissions these programs are required by the clean air act in places where federal rfg is not required states may optin to the program or they may impose other fuel requirements as part of plan to meet air quality standards this mix of state and federal standards along with local marketing and refinery decisions has resulted in adjacent or nearby areas that may require gasoline with significantly different properties what are boutique fuels the term boutique fuels refers to the various specialized gasoline formulations made to meet air quality standards or local preferences besides conventional fuel3 refiners and marketers in state may also have to meet requirements in different areas for one two or even three different formulations what is the concern over boutique fuels because requirements can vary from state to state and within state if there is disruption in fuel supply it may be difficult for refiners to supply fuel meeting local specifications to the affected area if this happens prices can rise sharply as occurred with particular severity in the midwest in the summer of 20004 and in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita 1 exxonmobil us gasoline requirements february 2002 2 drastically higher numbers generally imply that the number of standards has been multiplied by three to indicate that each type of gasoline is sold at three octane levels or grades suppliers are not required by law to sell three grades of gasoline 3 conventional gasoline is sold across most of the country 4 major pipeline problems along with other complicating factors led to short supplies of gasoline in the area conventional gasoline supplies were low as were supplies of the blendstock used to create rfg for the chicagomilwaukee area crs2 the ability to move product from one area of the country to another is called fungibility why not simply require one fuel across the country the existing system has evolved in response to various federal air quality standards and resulting state standards local refiner decisions and consumer choices further many of the state formulations were designed to mitigate moderate air quality problems without requiring more stringent and presumably more expensive measures an attempt to group states under one regional or national standard referred to as harmonization might lead to higher pump prices for areas with less severe ozone problems or higher emissions in areas with more severe problems further refiners may have made considerable investments in tooling facilities to meet specific local requirements harmonizing standards would be complex process competing goals will make harmonizing standards complex process gasoline distribution would likely be more uniform under regional or national standards but refining costs and consumer price could increase under new standards5 further air quality could be improved or diminished depending on how standards are combined any changes in the us gasoline system will need to take all of these factors into account organization of report this report outlines the current situation with boutique fuels it discusses the various state and federal requirements their purposes and how they interact next it discusses in detail one of the key components of the federal rfg program component eliminated by the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 then the report describes some of the supply problems caused by the current system followed by discussion of the tradeoffs associated with harmonization finally the report discusses congressional actions as well as actions taken by the bush administration that will likely affect the fuel system this report will be updated as events warrant gasoline standards changing gasoline standards as was stated above the current fuel system has resulted from mix of federal and state requirements mandated or motivated by the passage of the clean air act amendments of 19906 before 1990 fuel requirements were much simpler with only limits on volatility in the summer months to control ozone formation because temperature plays key role in ozone formation twotier system was established with tighter summer volatility standards in the south 5 it is difficult however to distinguish the effects of any one change on the costs of refining and distribution or on consumer prices both the costs to supply gasoline and pump prices respond to wide range of variables 6 pl 101549 crs3 the 1990 clean air act amendments added additional requirements producing more complex multilayer system these requirements include the use of various fuel formulations targeted at specific air quality problems in addition to federal requirements states with less severe pollution problems may establish their own standards these various federal and state standards lead to patchwork of areas with in some cases very different standards gasoline supply and distribution is further complicated by local refining and marketing decisions to promote or limit the use of certain additives this multilayer system of various standards and formulations can lead to supply instability if fuel from one market cannot be used in another market to meet changes in supply and demand general standards some gasoline standards apply to all fuel while others only apply to particular formulations currently fuel may be regulated for volatility nitrogen oxide emissions heavy metal content content and emissions of toxic compounds sulfur content andor oxygen content each of these factors plays role in pollutant emissions and overall air quality volatility volatility is chemicals propensity to evaporate evaporative emissions of hydrocarbons such as motor fuel contribute to the formation of ground level ozone which leads to smog7 reid vapor pressure rvp is measure of fuels volatility lower numbers indicate lower volatility the rvp for conventional gasoline can range from about 8 to 15 pounds per square inch psi8 but is limited to 90 psi in the summer months in areas where ozone is problem lower rvp is required nitrogen oxides nox nitrogen oxides nox include nitrous oxide nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide nox contributes to the formation of ozone therefore fuel may be formulated to limit nox emissions heavy metals lead was commonly used as an octane enhancer until it was phasedout through the mid1980s it was completely banned in 1995 due to the fact that lead can disable emissions control devices and because it is toxic to humans in some areas the use of other heavy metals eg manganese in gasoline may also be restricted toxic compounds some gasoline components and additives are toxic to humans further fuel combustion can lead to the formation of other toxic compounds such compounds include benzene acetaldehyde formaldehyde 13 butadiene and polycyclic organic matter benzene is known human carcinogen while the other compounds can cause irritation and exacerbate asthma some might 7 groundlevel ozone is an air pollutant that causes smog adversely affects health and injures plants it should not be confused with stratospheric ozone which is natural layer some 6 to 20 miles above the earth and provides degree of protection from harmful radiation 8 us department of energy alternative fuels data center properties of fuels httpwwwafdcdoegovpdfsfueltablepdf crs4 be human carcinogens9 in some fuels benzene content is limited the overall emissions of toxic compounds may be limited as well sulfur sulfur in gasoline can interfere with onboard emissions control devices catalytic converters are especially vulnerable10 to improve the performance of emissions controls the sulfur content of gasoline may also be limited by state or federal regulations currently alabama california georgia and nevada require lowersulfur gasoline starting january 1 2004 epa began phasing in new national limits for sulfur in gasoline effective january 1 2006 most gasoline is limited to sulfur level of 30 parts per million ppm11 before the new standards gasoline sulfur content averaged around 300 ppm oxygen because oxygen can improve combustion and thus limit the emissions of certain compounds minimum oxygen content may be required because pure oxygen cannot be added directly to gasoline it would simply escape from the fuel an oxygenbearing compound called an oxygenate is added typically ethers such as methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe or alcohols such as ethanol are used to enhance the oxygen content of gasoline these oxygenates are also highoctane compounds and reduce the need for other octane enhancers that may be more toxic such as benzene as discussed below key oxygen standard for federal reformulated gasoline was eliminated by pl 10958 federal fuels the clean air act requires the use of special fuels in areas that are in nonattainment of the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ozone or carbon monoxide federal reformulated gasoline rfg must be used in severe or extreme nonattainment areas for groundlevel ozone other areas with less serious ozone problems may optin to the rfg program to help them attain or maintain compliance with the naaqs in carbon monoxide nonattainment areas federal oxygenated fuel oxyfuel is required in winter months conventional gasoline as was stated above conventional gasoline is the fuel sold across most of the country it is the least stringently regulated fuel with summertime limit on rvp of 90 psi prohibition on the use of lead and limit on the level of manganese heavy metal because gasoline blended with 10 ethanol gasohol has higher volatility the rvp limit is raised by 1 psi to 100 psi the 9 agency for toxic substances and disease registry toxfaqs httpwwwatsdrcdcgovtoxfaqhtml 10 for more information on issues relating to sulfur in gasoline see crs report rs20163 sulfur in gasoline by stephen thompson and james mccarthy 11 this sulfur restriction is part of larger wholesystem approach by epa to limit vehicle emissions starting in model year 2004 automobile manufacturers are facing more stringent emissions standards for their vehicles to enable the use of more advanced emissions control devices the sulfur content of gasoline must be limited as well crs5 one pound waiver12 in summer months conventional gasoline accounts for approximately 49 of us gasoline consumption13 reformulated gasoline rfg in areas with major ozone pollution problems federal rfg is required other areas with less severe problems may also optin to the program currently major metropolitan areas in 17 states and the district of columbia use rfg the program has several requirements including benzene cap of 10 by volume limits on nox and toxic emissions and cap on rvp in the summer months the rvp limits are more stringent than in the winter months14 before pl 10958 summertime rvp limits were also more stringent for southern areas than for northern areas that law set single standard at the more stringent southern level federal rfg accounts for about 28 of summertime gasoline consumption15 prior to may 6 2006 rfg was also required to contain 2 oxygen by weight requirement that was eliminated by pl 10958 low volatility conventional gasoline the environmental protection agency epa requires that certain ozone nonattainment areas that are not required to use rfg use lower volatility fuel in the summer months instead of the 90 rvp conventional fuel required across most of the country rvp is capped at 78 for these areas which include parts of states in the south and west the one pound waiver for gasohol still applies lowvolatility gasoline accounts for about 7 of summertime gasoline consumption16 oxygenated fuel oxyfuel in carbon monoxide nonattainment areas the clean air act requires the use of oxygenated fuel in the winter months as of november 2005 12 areas were implementing the program17 the oxyfuel program requires minimum oxygen content of 27 by weight because of the nature of carbon monoxide pollution most carbon monoxide nonattainment areas are not ozone nonattainment areas18 the only exception is the angeles area which is in nonattainment for both pollutants the program has been largely successful with 12 there are other benefits to using ethanol in gasoline that counterbalance its higher volatility 13 us environmental protection agency epa office of transportation and air quality otaq staff white paper study of unique gasoline fuel blends boutique fuels effects on fuel supply and distribution and potential improvements october 2001 14 heat is catalyst for the reactions that produce ozone that is why ozone tends to be more serious in the summer months therefore in warmer areas and during warmer times ozoneforming emissions are more tightly controlled 15 epa otaq op cit 16 epa otaq op cit 78 rvp gasoline actually accounts for about 13 of gasoline consumption but 6 of this is result of state not federal requirements see the section below on state fuels 17 epa otaq state winter oxygenate fuel program requirements for attainment and maintenance of co naaqs november 2005 18 carbon monoxide emissions tend to increase at colder temperatures and carbon monoxide pollution tends to be worse at higher elevations crs6 fewer than half of the original participants in the program still required to use the fuel19 as the number of participating areas has dropped so has oxyfuel consumption as share of winter gasoline consumption the oxyfuel program should not be confused with the oxygen standard in rfg see above which was eliminated by pl 10958 state fuels in areas that have less serious ozone problems in contrast to severe or extreme nonattainment areas states may establish their own fuel standards as strategy for mitigating emissions if they do not to optin to the rfg program the clean air act gives the epa the authority to permit reductions in the allowable rvp of fuel in the summertime most states require only lower rvp at 70 72 78 or 85 rvp in all other ways these state fuel requirements are identical to conventional gasoline however some states go further and require lower sulfur content eg georgia or limit the use of certain additives eg texas further minnesota requires minimum of 10 ethanol in all gasoline sold in the state these various fuels account for about 12 of summer gasoline consumption20 california cleanerburning gasoline cbg in addition to giving states leeway on setting fuel standards the clean air act allows california to set its own standards as long as those standards are more stringent than the federal standards california requires the use of cleanerburning gasoline cbg with generally stricter requirements than those for federal rfg sulfur is restricted to 30 ppm benzene is limited to 08 by volume and performance standards are tighter for voc nox and toxic emissions in areas of the state where federal rfg is required gasoline must meet all the standards for rfg as well as cbg21 arizona and nevada have state programs that mimic the california standards california cbg accounts for approximately 45 of summertime gasoline consumption22 elimination of the federal rfg oxygenate standard under pl 10958 before amendment by the energy policy act of 2005 the clean air act required that rfg contain at least 2 oxygen by weight refiners met this requirement by adding number of ethers or alcohols any of which contain oxygen and other elements until recently the most commonly used oxygenate was mtbe in 1999 87 of rfg contained mtbe number reduced to about 46 in 2004 according to epa mtbe has also been used since the late 1970s in conventional 19 of the 12 areas implementing the program 5 are for attainment purposes and 7 for maintenance purposes in 1992 36 areas were implementing the program epa otaq op cit 20 epa otaq staff white paper 21 for example while federal rfg requires minimum oxygen content california cbg does not 22 epa otaq op cit crs7 gasoline as an octane enhancer as result gasoline with mtbe has been used throughout the united states and elsewhere in the world whether or not an area has been subject to rfg requirements mtbe leaks generally from underground gasoline storage tanks have been implicated in numerous incidents of groundwater contamination the substance creates perceptible taste and odor in water at very low concentrations and some animal studies indicate that it may pose potential cancer risk to humans for these reasons 25 states have taken steps to ban or limit its use according to the renewable fuels association23 the most significant of the bans in terms of the amount of fuel affected took effect at the end of 2003 california and new york leading many to suggest that congress revisit the issue to modify the oxygenate requirement and set more uniform national requirements regarding mtbe and its potential replacements principally ethanol the debate over the rfg oxygen standard support for eliminating the oxygenate requirement on nationwide basis was widespread among environmental groups the petroleum industry and states in general these stakeholders concluded that gasoline can meet the same low emission performance standards as rfg without the use of oxygenates but agricultural interests presented potential obstacle to enacting legislation to remove the oxygen requirement according to the us department of agriculture roughly 13 of the nations corn crop is used to produce the competing oxygenate ethanol supporters of ethanol argued that as mtbe use was phased out with the oxygen requirement still in effect ethanol use would soar increasing demand for corn in fact according to epa ethanol demand has grown substantially as mtbe has been be phased out as result of state bans and refinery decisions conversely if the oxygen requirement were waived by epa or through legislation not only would mtbe use decline but so likely would demand for ethanol thus some members of congress and governors from corngrowing states took keen interest in mtbe legislation and related oxygenate requirements one concern voiced by ethanol supporters over the elimination of the rfg oxygen standard is that it had provided major impetus for ethanol demand to fill potential void in ethanol demand left by an elimination of the oxygen requirement there were legislative proposals to develop renewable fuels standard rfs renewable fuel is one that can be produced from renewable resources such as solar energy agriculture products or waste material in general renewable fuels are those produced from animal or vegetable matter ethanol is the most common renewable fuel approximately 39 billion gallons were produced in the united states in 200524 the next most common renewable fuel is biodiesel synthetic diesel fuel made from 23 renewable fuels association new jersey becomes 25th state to ban mtbe august 19 2005 24 renewable fuels association from niche to nation annual industry outlook 2006 february 2006 crs8 vegetable oils mainly soy or recycled grease approximately 75 million gallons of biodiesel were produced in 200525 as enacted the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 contains numerous provisions relevant to mtbe and ethanol26 most notably pl 10958 repeals the clean air act requirement to use mtbe or other oxygenates in place of this requirement the bill establishes an rfs to prevent backsliding on air quality the bill requires that reductions in emissions of toxic substances achieved by rfg be maintained it also authorizes funds for mtbe cleanup27 pl 10958 established an rfs of 40 billion gallons in 2006 increasing yearly to 75 billion gallons in 2012 supporters argue that renewable fuels standard will foster agricultural production promote domestic energy sources and lead to cleaner air critics argue that it will raise gasoline prices artificially inflate demand for ethanol and add one more layer of requirements to an already complex gasoline supply system further some critics argue that renewable mandate will result in corporate welfare for few large ethanol producers some critics question the net energy saving from fuel ethanol because the production of corn and ethanol requires significant fossil fuel inputs28 issues in the spring of 2006 mtbe phaseout and ethanol supply as result of pl 10958 the oxygen requirement for rfg was eliminated as of may 6 2006 the elimination of the oxygen standard was supported by various states with mtbe contamination and by the refining industry as way to simplify gasoline supply however the oxygen requirement which gasoline suppliers asserted was facto mtbe requirement has been used by gasoline suppliers as defense against liability for mtbe contamination29 pl 10958 did not ban mtbe use rather it actually gives the industry more flexibility in making rfg with or without oxygenates but because of liability concerns the industry moved quickly to eliminate mtbe from the gasoline supply in spring 2006 this increased pressure on already tight refining capacity because higher grades of gasoline blendstock were 25 national biodiesel board estimated us biodiesel production may 2006 26 for more detailed discussion of mtbe and ethanol provisions in pl 10958 see crs report rl32865 renewable fuels and mtbe comparison of selected provisions in the energy policy act of 2005 hr 6 by brent d yacobucci mary tiemann james mccarthy and aaron m flynn 27 not included in the final version was particularly controversial provision in an earlier version of the bill safe harbor from product liability lawsuits for producers of mtbe ethanol and other renewable fuels product liability lawsuits have been used to force petroleum and chemical companies to pay for cleanup of ground and surface water contaminated by releases of fuels containing mtbe disagreement over the safe harbor provision for mtbe is seen as one of the issues that led to the failure an energy bill in the 108th congress 28 for more detailed discussion of the energy balance of corn ethanol see crs report rl33290 fuel ethanol background and public policy issues by brent d yacobucci 29 petroleum industry research foundation inc rising gasoline prices made in the usa may 2006 crs9 required to make the transition away from mtbeblended fuel in 2005 us mtbe production was approximately 2 billion gallons representing roughly 15 of us gasoline demand the loss in volume and energy due to eliminating mtbe increased demand for gasoline refined from petroleum crude oil for the production of feedstocks and ethanol in response to pl 10958 in spring 2006 many refiners began producing gasoline blendstock for ethanolblended rfg30 for use in rfg areas ethanol cannot be blended with conventional gasoline but requires specific lowvolatility gasoline blendstock this blendstock called reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending rbob tends to be more difficult and costly to produce and it requires the use of more highquality gasoline blending components further sharp increase in demand for ethanol for gasoline blending strained ethanol supplies also during the transition from mtbe to ethanolblended gasoline in many cases refiners terminals and retailers had to halt operations to purge their tanks of the old fuel potential issue with the transition between rfg with and without the oxygen requirement is one of timing during the transition some refiners had eliminated mtbeblended rfg before the may 6 transition to nonoxygenated rfg however between the time they eliminated mtbe and may 6 rfg was still subject to the oxygen standard therefore some gasoline suppliers who may in the future make the transition to nonoxygenated rfg needed to supply ethanolblended rfg during the transition the ultimate demand for ethanol in rfg will depend on gasoline refiners and suppliers decisions about whether to market ethanolblended or non oxygenated rfg exacerbating the supply problem was the fact that the industry was making the transition from winter gasoline to more stringent lowvolatility summertime specifications which adds competition for the highestquality gasoline components these pressures along with historically high crude oil prices have led to historically high nominal gasoline prices further some localized areas faced shortterm supply disruptions as refineries made the transition renewable fuels standard some detractors of the rfs have claimed that high gasoline prices in spring 2006 are partly due to the enactment of the rfs however while the shortterm increase in ethanol demand from the elimination of the oxygenate standard has certainly played role in the spring 2006 gasoline situation see above the effects of the rfs on high gasoline prices are less evident for 2006 the rfs requires the use of 40 billion gallons in gasoline roughly equivalent to us ethanol use in 2005 therefore while the increasing rfs could put pressure on ethanol supplies and gasoline prices in coming years it seems less likely that the rfs has played role in the current situation31 30 statement of blakeman early american lung association before the senate committee on environment and public works march 29 2006 31 it should be noted that when gasoline prices are relatively high ethanol prices tend to track with gasoline prices when taxes are factored in ethanol blended into gasoline is continued crs10 harmonizing gasoline standards the multiple gasoline standards along with the use of various fuel additives have led to supply incompatibility before 1990 the us gasoline system was relatively fungible product could be moved from one market to meet diminished supply in another currently gasoline used in one area may not necessarily meet the standard of another for example in the summer fuel produced for the charlotte nc area cannot be used in norfolk va rfg or atlanta ga lower rvp and sulfur cap however fuel from either norfolk or atlanta could be shipped to charlotte in many cases the system is essentially oneway giving suppliers the ability to move product from more stringent areas to less stringent areas but not vice versa adding to this problem is the fact that us refiners and fuel pipelines are currently operating at or near capacity reducing the flexibility to produce and ship multiplicity of formulations or respond to change in local market needs any supply disruption caused by refinery fire pipeline rupture or other incident can lead to price volatility even with more fungible conventional gasoline adding localized requirements creates an even more complex situation where excess supply in one area may not be moved to the affected area because of emissions standards because of the complex nature of various gasoline standards there is interest in harmonizing the standards this would entail requiring one set of standards across region or even across the country potential scenarios include requiring that within an area only one low rvp fuel could be used in addition to conventional gasoline and rfg in the above scenario with norfolk charlotte and atlanta while norfolk would still use rfg the standards for charlotte and atlanta would be identical another more drastic scenario would require that all fuel be conventional gasoline or rfg some of the key issues involved in harmonization would be production costs consumer prices production capacity supply stability and air quality production cost depending on the way standards are harmonized production costs could increase32 while fewer standards across the country would seem to benefit refiners it could create need for expensive refinery modifications to meet the harmonized standards because refiners made investments in tooling their plants to meet the local requirements changes could be costly however less drastic harmonization where some of the lowrvp fuels are harmonized but not eliminated could mitigate some of these difficulties 31 continued subject to 51centpergallon tax credit therefore ethanol tends to sell for roughly 50 cents higher per gallon than conventional gasoline for example on march 30 regular unleaded gasoline sold for approximately 200 per gallon wholesale while ethanol spot prices were 247 to 251 difference of between 47 and 51 cents oil intelligence link key spot product prices the ethanol monitor april 3 2006 32 it should be noted that refinery production costs are only one factor among many that play role in determining pump prices crs11 production capacity most us refiners are operating at or near capacity us refiners have operated at or above 90 nominal capacity for over decade33 limited production capacity can lead to higher prices especially if there is disruption in production on in the flow of gasoline and gasoline inputs it is possible that harmonization could exacerbate this problem depending on how it is implemented new standards could lead to higher or lower supply levels for example very stringent volatility standards could require refiners to limit the use of some gasoline components the loss of volume from cutting back on these components would require increased supply in the form of petroleum ethanol or other blending components some of which are imported supply stability presumably main goal of harmonization would be to improve the fungibility of the system reducing the possibility of supply and distribution problems fewer standards make it more likely that product could be moved from one area of the country to another to meet local needs however it must be noted that supply disruptions can never be completely eliminated because there are so many factors outside of fuel standards that play role in supply these include levels of crude oil supply petroleum imports refining capacity seasonal fluctuations in demand and weather patterns which may influence demand for fuel air quality key concern in any discussion of harmonization is the effect on air quality many of these boutique fuels standards were created specifically to mitigate the unique air quality problems in specific metropolitan area the standards were devised as part of state implementation plan sip for ozone sips are based on models showing that particular fuels requirements will lead to projected reductions in pollutant emissions more stringent requirements while more costly lead to greater emissions reductions therefore an effort has been made in the sips to balance air quality goals with producer and consumer concerns about cost any harmonization would necessitate that certain state fuels be chosen over others what must be resolved is the question of which standards should apply to all states in region the most stringent the least stringent some compromise standard any standard less stringent than an sips current standard would require the state to identify other emissions reductions any standard more stringent than states current standard would likely lead to higher consumer prices state fuel requirements in addition to the above concerns about harmonization other issues remain one of these has to do with local marketing decisions and state requirements unrelated to air quality if these factors are not addressed the system could still remain quite complex for example minnesota requires the use of ethanol in gasoline across the state under harmonization would states be allowed to set such standard or would they be precluded 33 us department of energy energy

was stated above section 1504a eliminated the oxygen standard for federal rfg this standard was key motivation for the use of mtbe in gasoline second section 1504c eliminated the distinction between summertime rfg in northern and southern areas starting in may 2006 all rfg areas will use the more stringent southern rfg in summer months third section 1541b capped the number of state boutique fuels

administration action on harmonization as part of the bush administrations action on its national energy policy35 epa is currently studying the potential effects of harmonization in preliminary report epa studied various scenarios and attempted to analyze the effects of those scenarios recognizing that its study is the first step in much longer process epa found that depending on the scenario standards could be harmonized without major cost increases increases in emissions or reductions in gasoline supply the study states that even though some of the harmonized areas have not faced supply disruptions in the past harmonization could reduce the potential for future 34 epa epa administrator governors to review boutique fuels may 4 2006

task force to study potential harmonization and report to the president in july 2006 congressional action the most notable congressional action on boutique fuels in the 109th congress was the passage of the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 as stated above pl 10958 eliminated the oxygen standard for rfg eliminated the distinction between northern and southern summertime rfg limited the number of state boutique fuels required the study of fuel system harmonization and established renewable fuels standard other bills have been introduced in the 109th congress addressing boutique fuels from various angles hr 3807 ney would eliminate all boutique fuels including federal rfg and oxyfuel requiring the use of conventional gasoline across the country s 1859 burr would make some boutique fuels provisions of pl 10958 more stringent for example the bill would not allow new fuels to be added to epas list of allowable state boutique fuels after fuel is delisted language similar to hr 1459 blunt
