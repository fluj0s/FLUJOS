riddle and rebecca r skinner specialists in education policy domestic social policy division elementary and secondary education act an analytical review of the allocation formulas summary the elementary and secondary education act esea contains 45 separately authorized programs plus approximately 20 specified subprograms the largest of these programs distribute funds by formulas that prescribe how funds are to be allocated among state educational agencies seas or local educational agencies leas nationwide they take the form of mathematical equations through which the us department of education ed and in many cases also seas calculate grant amounts for each potential grantee meeting statutory eligibility criteria they almost always include one or more population factors and may also include state or lea minimum grant provisions eligibility thresholds expenditure factors fiscal accountability provisions and reservations of funds for variety of purposes the recipients of majority of the funds under almost all esea formula grant programs are leas under most of these programs grants are provided to leas via seas that is they are stateadministered formula grant programs funds are allocated by ed directly to leas only under limited number of esea programs the most influential esea allocation formulas are those under the title ia program both because this is the largest esea program and because there are five esea programs under which grants are made in part or in full in proportion to grants calculated under title i part as result majority of esea funds are allocated under formulas in which the primary population factor is schoolage children in poor families and state expenditure factors are applied the share of all public k12 education revenues that is provided under esea programs varies substantially among the states although esea funding constitutes only approximately onetenth or less of total public k12 education revenues in all cases except puerto rico the average esea program grant per schoolage child poor and nonpoor increases as the state average poverty rate rises with the third of states having the highest poverty rates receiving 14 times as much as low poverty states at the same time an opposite trend is found in average esea grants per schoolage child in poor family with low poverty states receiving 13 times as much as states with the highest poverty rates most esea allocation formulas include state or lea minimum grant provisions as result states with the smallest schoolage population receive approximately 17 times as much as the remaining states per schoolage child and approximately 22 times as much per schoolage child from poor family this report will be updated if substantial changes are made in one or more esea

schoolage child poverty rate 87 elementary and secondary education act an analytical review of the allocation formulas introduction the primary source of federal aid to k12 education is the elementary and secondary education act esea particularly its title i part program of education for the disadvantaged1 the esea was initially enacted in 1965 pl 89 10 and was most recently amended and reauthorized by the child left behind act of 2001 nclb pl 107110 esea programs are explicitly authorized through fy2007 although they were automatically extended for one additional year through fy2008 when congress did not act upon reauthorization legislation by december 31 20052 the 110th congress has considered proposals to amend and extend the esea although it appears likely that esea reauthorization will again be on the agenda of the 111th congress the nclb initiated major expansion of federal influence on several aspects of public k12 education primarily with the aim of increasing the accountability of public school systems and individual public schools for improving achievement outcomes of all pupils especially the disadvantaged states that receive grants under esea title ia must implement in all public schools and school districts variety of standardsbased assessments in reading math and science make annual adequate yearly progress ayp determinations for each public school and local educational agency lea and require virtually all public school teachers and aides to meet variety of qualification requirements state ayp policies must incorporate an ultimate goal of all public school pupils reaching proficient or higher level of achievement in reading and mathematics by the end of the 20132014 school year further states participating in esea title ia must enforce series of increasingly substantial consequences for most of their schools and almost all school districts that fail to meet the ayp standards for two consecutive years or more major esea programs other than title ia provide grants to support the education of migrant students recruitment of and professional development for 1 richard n apling retired specialist in education policy also contributed to this report 2 the general education provisions act gepa provides that the authorization of appropriations for or duration of an applicable program shall be automatically extended for one additional fiscal year unless congress in the regular session that ends prior to the beginning of the terminal fiscal year of such authorization or duration has passed legislation that becomes law and extends or repeals the authorization of such program 20 usc 1226a crs2 teachers language instruction for limited english proficient lep students school safety and drug abuse prevention programs afterschool instruction and care expansion of charter schools and other forms of public school choice education services for indian native hawaiian and alaska native students impact aid to compensate leas for taxes foregone due to certain federal activities and wide variety of innovative educational approaches or instruction to meet particular student needs the esea contains 45 separately authorized programs plus approximately 20 specified subprograms the methods by which federal funds are provided to grantees under these programs fall into five general categories programs under which federal funds are allocated by the us department of education ed to states as well as to all or most leas via one or more formulas specified in the esea example esea title i part education for the disadvantaged programs under which federal funds are allocated by ed to states via statutory formula while state educational agencies seas suballocate these funds either on competitive or discretionary basis or via statedeveloped allocation formula consistent with general statutory guidance example esea title iv part b 21st century community learning centers programs under which federal funds are allocated by ed directly to leas via formulas specified in the esea example esea title viii impact aid programs under which federal funds are allocated by ed to state andor local grantees on competitive or discretionary basis example esea title v part d subpart 6 gifted and talented students and programs under which federal funds are allocated by ed to single eligible grantee specified in the esea example esea title ii part c subpart 2 national writing project esea allocation formulas are mechanisms established through statute or other official policy documents that define how appropriated funds are to be allocated among seas or leas nationwide they take the form of mathematical equations through which ed and possibly also seas calculate specific grant amounts for each potential grantee meeting statutory eligibility criteria they almost always include one or more population factors but typically include number of additional factors this report discusses and analyzes the current allocation formulas for esea programs in the first three categories listed above it provides the following 1 description of general categories of factors used in the eseas allocation formulas crs3 2 descriptions of each programs formulas and 3 analyses of general patterns and issues related to these formulas other crs reports provide more detailed discussions and analyses of the allocation formulas of major individual esea programs3 this report will be updated infrequently when major changes occur in esea program allocation formulas general esea formula grant characteristics it is important to understand the vocabulary commonly applied to federal k12 education allocation formulas therefore an explanation of key terms precedes the discussion of the esea formulas level of recipient entity and level at which grants are calculated by ed under most esea formula grant programs grants are made to leas via the seas if leas are the ultimate grantees in state formula grant program the esea program may provide for substate distribution of grants by seaadministered competition through statutory substate allocation formula directing seas how to determine lea grants or less frequently through statutory lealevel formula with grants calculated by ed itself but distributed to leas by seas with limited options for seas to adjust the lea grants as calculated by ed under few esea formula grant programs lea grants are calculated and directly allocated by ed eg impact aid formula factors allocation formulas have one or more factors that target funds to seas leas or other entities to accomplish or facilitate some policy outcome for example program aiming to serve children from poor families would have formula based on estimated numbers of schoolage 517 years children in poor families in simple formula each state would be allocated funds in proportion to the estimated number of such children living in that state that is states proportion is obtained by dividing its number of schoolage children in poor families by the total number of such 3 see the following reports for more detailed descriptions of selected esea program allocation formulas crs report rl33731 education for the disadvantaged reauthorization issues for esea title ia under the child left behind act by wayne c riddle crs report rl34119 impact aid for public k12 education reauthorization under the elementary and secondary education act by rebecca r skinner crs report rl33804 rural education and the rural education achievement program reap overview and policy issues by jeffrey j kuenzi and crs report rl34066 english language acquisition grants under the child left behind act analysis of state grant formula and data options by rebecca r skinner crs4 children nationwide for example if 14 of all schoolage children in poor families live in california this simple formula would allocate 14 of all state grant funds to california formula can include more than one population factor and it can weight the factors differently for example formula could distribute 50 of funds based on total schoolage population and 50 based on schoolage children in poor families population factor the most common allocation formula factor is population factor almost all federal k12 education program allocation formulas include such factor the most common population factors are schoolage children in poor families and total schoolage children in addition several esea programs allocate funds on the basis of population factor that is specifically related to the programs purpose such as indian pupils migratory children or children whose parents live or work on federal property usually population factor is direct but sometimes it is indirect for example if program allocates grants in proportion to grants made under esea title ia this provision indirectly incorporates the title ia formulas population factors primarily schoolage children in poor families title ia grant factor many esea programs allocate some or all of their funds in proportion to grants made under the largest esea program aid for the education of the disadvantaged under title i part for example grants under esea title ii part d education technology are made in proportion to title ia grants subject to higher state minimum grant provision than under title ia thus grants calculated under title ia become an allocation factor for several other programs eligibility threshold many esea programs require leas to meet population factor thresholds in order to be eligible to receive grants for example under the title ia concentration grant allocation formula leas must meet either of two population factor eligibility thresholds 1 6500 population factor children mostly schoolage children in poor families or 2 population factor child percentage population factor children divided by total schoolage population of 15 in order to receive grants expenditure factor several esea program allocation formulas include an expenditure factor these are based on state or less frequently lea average per pupil expenditure for public k12 education expenditure factors are intended to adjust for state or local differences in the costs of providing public k12 education although they are often criticized as reflecting differences in ability to pay for educational services as well in most cases floors and ceilings based on percentages of the national average are applied to this factor eg floor of 80 and ceiling of 120 of the national average per pupil expenditure usually an expenditure factor is crs5 direct but sometimes it is indirect for example if program allocates grants in proportion to grants made under esea title ia see above this provision indirectly incorporates the title ia formulas expenditure factors hold harmless some formulas establish minimum state or lea grant equal to specified percentage of the amount received in previous year usually this is the immediately preceding year although sometimes it is base year that may be several years in the past the minimum percentage may be the full amount received in the previous year ie 100 or more often some lesser percentage eg 85 raising state or lea to its hold harmless level almost always reduces grants to other states or leas that do not benefit from the hold harmless hold harmless amounts are only guaranteed if funds are sufficient to pay for them if not hold harmless amounts are ratably reduced see below to meet the level of the appropriation further in almost all cases hold harmless provisions only apply to grantees meeting program eligibility criteria for the current year not necessarily every grantee that received grant in the preceding year4 foundation grant under some esea programs each state or lea first receives foundation grant amount then additional appropriations if any are allocated on the basis of population and possibly other formula factors if funds are insufficient to pay the full foundation grant amount then each grantee receives an equal proportion of its foundation grant the foundation grant may be an equal amount per grantee eg 3 million per state or more often it is the amount received in base year under one or more antecedent programs the latter usually occurs when two or more programs are consolidated into one new program in reauthorization of the esea minimum state grant in addition to hold harmless amounts see above which are always expressed in terms of percentage of previous year grant several programs have state minimum grant expressed primarily in terms of percentage of all allocations to states or as fixed dollar amount per state such minimum grant provisions are aimed at providing what advocates argue is minimum viable grant to all states state minimums are set at percentage of total state grants typically 025 035 or 05 occasionally they are fixed dollar amounts eg 500000 or the 4 for example the esea title ia targeted grant allocation formula has eligibility thresholds of 10 children counted in the title ia population factor primarily schoolage children in poor families and 5 population factor child rate if an lea should meet these criteria and receive targeted grant in year 1 but fall below one of the thresholds in year 2 it would receive funds in year 2 even though the targeted grant formula includes lea hold harmless of at least 85 of preceding year grants crs6 greater or lesser of fixed amount or percentage of the total in some cases one or more caps may be placed on these minimums eg state minimum might be 025 of total state grants subject to cap of 150 of the national average grant per population factor child multiplied by the state total number of such children when applying the minimum the money to increase grants to relatively low population states that would otherwise receive less than the minimum amount comes from all other states which would see their initial grants ratably reduced ratable reduction or ratable increase this is the process of either reducing or increasing grants as initially calculated in order to adjust for the level of available appropriations or application of certain formula factors such as state minimum or lea hold harmless these reductions or increases are applied in proportion to initial grants ie they are ratable for example raising certain states to minimum grant amounts requires that funds be redistributed from states with initial grants above the minimums ratable reduction reduces funds in proportion to their initial grants for states above minimum levels and redistributes these funds to states with initial grants below minimum levels when ratable reduction occurs all states or leas above the minimum have their initial grants reduced by the same percentage resulting in different dollar amount changes similar processes of ratable reduction occur in the application of hold harmless provisions fiscal accountability requirements most esea programs include one or more of three types of fiscal accountability requirements these are intended to assure that federal funds provide net increase over state and local funds devoted to k12 education the two most common esea fiscal accountability requirements are 1 maintenance of effort recipients must provide from state and local sources level of funding either aggregate or per pupil in the preceding year that is equal to at least some specified percentage usually 90 of the level in the second preceding year5 and 2 funds must be used so as to supplement and not supplant state and local funds that would otherwise be available for the same purpose as under the esea program in question third type of fiscal accountability requirement comparability applies only to title i parts c and d services provided with state and local funds in schools participating in title ia must be comparable to those in nontitle ia schools of the same lea 5 if state fails to expend the requisite level of funds the esea program is reduced according to the proportion by which the required level 90 of the preceding year is missed crs7 treatment of puerto rico outlying areas and the bureau of indian affairs6 esea programs usually distribute funds by formula only to the 50 states the district of columbia and puerto rico the latter two entities are defined as states for the purposes of program formulas other entities usually receive funds from amounts that are reserved from the total appropriation these set asides can include funds for the outlying areas american samoa guam commonwealth of the northern marianas and the us virgin islands and funds provided to the bureau of indian affairs bia for services to certain indian students typically total of 1 of program appropriations is reserved for these entities other reservations from appropriations under many programs before remaining funds are allocated to states portion of appropriations is also reserved for such national activities as competitive grants program evaluation research or technical assistance related to the overall program7 further adjustments by seas of lea grants as calculated by ed many state grant formulas permit states to reserve proportion of their total grant for state level activities these activities include state administration of the program together with statewide services such as technical assistance and program evaluation aimed at assisting and improving the implementation of the program under title ia states are required to reserve 4 of state grants subject to certain limitations described later in this report for school improvement activities typical total state setaside might be 5 of the state grant with more than 1 of the grant ie 20 of the setaside8 for administration and 4 for other state activities the following tables 19 summarize the provisions of esea allocation formulas with respect to many of the formula factors or provisions discussed above as illustrated in table 1 the recipients of majority of the funds under almost all esea formula grant programs are leas under most of these programs grants are provided to leas via seas that is they are stateadministered formula grant programs funds are allocated by ed directly to leas only under limited number of esea programs 6 the esea statute refers to the bureau of indian affairs bia however in practice the bia has been superseded by the bureau of indian education bie 7 the esea includes in section 9601 general authorization for the us secretary of education to reserve up to 05 of appropriations under any esea programs except those under titles i and iii for program evaluations if such reservation is not separately and explicitly authorized this authority is exercised on occasion 8 some authorizing statutes specify that the administrative setaside may be the larger of dollar amount or percentage of the grant such provisions aim to ensure that administrative funds for smaller states are sufficient to administer the program crs8 within states either funds are allocated to leas under formulas that are specified in the esea but are actually calculated by seas or b funds are distributed on competitive or discretionary basis within states title ia is the only esea program under which funds are allocated via seas but grants are calculated by ed at the lea level

state minimum grant provisions expressed as percentage of total state grants are more common than hold harmless provisions expressed as percentage of grants for previous year in the esea only the

esea formula grant programs include provisions allowing seas to reserve limited percentage of state total grants for administration evaluation and technical assistance maximum reservations for these specific activities range from approximately 1 for title ia to 5 under number of other esea programs as noted in table 6 some programs have maximum reservation percentages above 5 but these funds are to be used for variety of activities in addition to administration evaluation and technical assistance such as statewide competitive grant programs limits on the use of funds by leas for

islands guam and the virgin islands some programs simply treat these areas the same as the 50 states the district of columbia and puerto rico others reserve share of state grants either 05 or 1 for this purpose somewhat smaller majority of esea formula grant programs provide funds to the bureau of indian affairs bia for services to indian pupils either by treating the bia the same as state or more often by reserving 05 or 1 of grants for this purpose only few esea formula grant programs reserve share of formula grant funds for national programs or activities national programs are much more often authorized under separate provisions of the statute eg safe and drugfree schools and communities national programs are authorized in esea title iv part subpart 2 whereas state formula grants are authorized under subpart 1 similarly only few programs authorize reservations from formula grant appropriations for evaluations and technical assistance however as with national programs several esea formula grant programs contain separate authorizations for evaluations eg evaluations for title ia are authorized in title ie in addition the esea contains general authorization in title ix part f for the secretary of education to reserve for program evaluation up to 05 of appropriations under any esea program except those in titles i and iii or any other esea program for which the reservation of

for the education of disadvantaged children title ia grants provide supplementary educational and related services to lowachieving and other pupils attending prekindergarten through grade 12 schools with relatively high concentrations of pupils from lowincome families in recent years it has also become vehicle to which number of requirements affecting broad aspects of public k12 education for all pupils have been attached as condition for receiving title ia grants these include requirements for assessments of pupil achievement adequate yearly progress ayp standards and determinations for schools leas and states consequences for schools and leas that fail to make ayp for two consecutive years or more plus teacher and paraprofessional qualifications under title ia funds are allocated to leas via seas annual appropriations bills specify portions of each years appropriation to be allocated under four different formulas once funds reach leas the amounts allocated under the four formulas are combined and used jointly under three of the formulas basic concentration and targeted grants funds are calculated initially at the lea level and state total grants are the total of allocations for leas in the state adjusted to apply state minimum grant provisions under the fourth formula education finance incentive grants grants are first calculated for each state overall with state totals subsequently suballocated by lea using different formula primary rationale for using four different formulas to allocate shares of the funds for single program is that the formulas have distinct allocation patterns providing varying shares of allocated funds to different types of leas or states eg leas with high poverty rates or states with comparatively equal levels of spending per pupil among their leas in addition crs19 some of the formulas contain elements that are deemed to have important incentive effects or to be significant symbolically in addition to their impact on allocation patterns in the discussion below each of the four esea title ia allocation formulas is discussed separately9 basic grants basic grants are the original title ia formula authorized and implemented each year since fy1966 it is also the formula under which the largest proportion of funds is allocated 47 of fy2008 appropriations and under which the largest proportion of leas participate approximately 91 in fy2007 largely due to its low lea eligibility threshold see below however because all post fy2001 increases in title ia appropriations have been provided for the targeted and education finance incentive grant formulas see below the proportion of title ia funds allocated under the basic grant formula has been declining steadily since fy2001 when it was 86 compared to some of the other title ia formulas the basic grant formula is relatively straightforward grants are based on each leas share compared to the national total of population factor multiplied by an expenditure factor subject to available appropriations an lea minimum or hold harmless and state minimum these formula factors are described below followed by mathematical expression of the formula population factor children aged 517 in poor families according to the latest available estimates for leas from the census bureaus small area income and poverty estimates saipe program these constitute approximately 96 of all formula children for fy2007 b in institutions for neglected or delinquent children or in foster homes approximately 39 of all formula children for fy200710 and c in families receiving temporary assistance for needy families tanf payments above the poverty income level for family of four less than 01 of all formula children for fy2007 each element of the population factor is updated annually eligibility threshold in order for an lea to be eligible for basic grant the number of children counted in the population factor must constitute at least 10 such children and at least 2 of the total schoolage population expenditure factor state average per pupil expenditure for public k12 education subject to minimum of 80 and maximum of 120 of the national average 9 for additional discussion and analysis of the four title ia allocation formulas see crs report rl33731 education for the disadvantaged reauthorization issues for esea title ia under the child left behind act by wayne c riddle 10 the portion of funds allocated to states under the basic grant and the other three title ia allocation formulas that is based on delinquent youth in local programs is set aside and separately allocated to leas providing services to such youth seas are to allocate these funds to leas with concentrations of youth in local correctional facilities seas may allocate these funds through statedeveloped formula or on discretionary basis crs20 further multiplied by 040 the expenditure factor is the same for all leas in the same state lea minimum grant or hold harmless level if sufficient funds are appropriated each lea is to receive minimum of 85 90 or 95 of its previous year grant depending on the leas schoolage child poverty rate assuming that the lea continues to meet the basic grant formulas eligibility thresholds11 minimum state grant each state is to receive minimum of up to 025 of total basic grant appropriations if total basic grant funding is equal to or less than the fy2001 level as has been the case each year since fy2001 thus far and up to 035 of total basic grant appropriations in excess of the fy2001 amount if any state may not as result of the state minimum provision receive more than the average of 1 025 of the total fy2001 amount for state grants plus 035 of any amount above the fy2001 level and 2 150 of the national average grant per formula child multiplied by the number of formula children in the state ratable reduction after maximum grants are calculated if appropriations are insufficient to pay the maximum amounts as has been the case every year beginning with fy1967 these amounts are reduced by the same percentage for all leas subject to lea hold harmless and state minimum provisions until they equal the aggregate level of appropriations fiscal requirements there are three title ia fiscal accountability requirements which are applicable to total lea grants under all four formulas 1 maintenance of effort recipient leas must provide from state and local sources level of funding either aggregate or per pupil in the preceding year that is at least 90 as high as in the second preceding year 2 title ia funds must be used so as to supplement and not supplant state and local funds that would otherwise be available for the education of disadvantaged pupils in title ia participating schools 3 comparability services provided with state and local funds in schools participating in title ia must be comparable to those in nontitle ia schools of the same lea12 treatment of puerto rico outlying areas and the bureau of indian affairs with one possible exception13 puerto rico is treated the same as state under the basic grant formula grants to schools operated or supported by the bureau of 11 the hold harmless rate is 85 of the previous year grant if the leas schoolage child poverty rate population factor divided by total schoolage population is less than 15 90 if the schoolage child poverty rate is between 15 and 30 and 95 if the school age child poverty rate is greater than 30 12 if all of an leas schools participate in title ia then services funded from state and local revenues must be substantially comparable in each school of the lea 13 through fy2007 the minimum expenditure factor applicable to puerto rico was lower than that for any state the nclb provided for the elimination of this special provision in stages although scheduled increases in the puerto rico expenditure factor are not to be implemented if doing so would result in decrease in the grant to any state the final step in this process was not implemented as scheduled in fy2007 however it was implemented in fy2008 crs21 indian affairs the outlying areas of guam american samoa the virgin islands and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands as well as competitive grant to the outlying areas plus certain freely associated states14 are provided via reservation of 1 of total title ia appropriations further adjustments by seas of lea grants as calculated by ed among esea programs distinctive aspect of title ia is that after calculation of lea grants by ed applying the methods discussed herein seas make number of adjustments before determining the final amounts that leas actually receive these adjustments are made to the total of title ia grants to leas under all four formulas combined these adjustments include 1 reservation of 4 of state total allocations to be used for school improvement grants15 2 reservation of 1 of state total allocations under all formulas for esea title i part plus

differences regarding the lea hold harmless and state minimum grant provisions although the title ia statute has included concentration grant formulas with varying provisions and sometimes under different names since 1970 the current version dates from 1988 pl 100297 relatively small 10 of fy2008 appropriations and declining from 14 in fy2001 proportion of title ia appropriations is allocated under the concentration grant formula approximately 48 of leas receive concentration grants fy2007 as with basic grants concentration grants are based on each eligible leas share compared to the national total of population factor multiplied by an expenditure factor subject to available appropriations an lea minimum or hold harmless and state minimum these formula factors are described below followed by mathematical expression of the formula population factor same as basic grants see above eligibility threshold in order for an lea to be eligible for concentration grant the number of children counted in the population factor must constitute either 6500 such children or at least 15 of the total schoolage population expenditure factor same as basic grants see above lea minimum grant or hold harmless level the hold harmless rates for concentration grants are the same as those for basic grants unlike basic grants and all of the other title ia formulas the hold harmless applies to all leas that received grants for the previous year even if they do not currently meet one of the concentration grant formulas eligibility thresholds unless they fail to meet one of the thresholds for 4 consecutive years that is an lea that is eligible to receive concentration grant in one year can continue to receive concentration grant for three succeeding years even if it does not meet either of the eligibility thresholds in those succeeding years18 minimum state grant the concentration grant state minimum is modified version of the basic grant minimum each state is to receive minimum of up to 025 of total concentration grant appropriations if total concentration grant funding is equal to or less than the fy2001 level as has been the case each year since fy2001 thus far and up to 035 of total concentration grant appropriations in excess of the fy2001 amount if any state may not as result of the state minimum provision receive more than the average of 1 025 of the total fy2001 amount for state grants plus 035 of the amount above this and 2 the greater of i 150 of the national average grant per formula child multiplied by the number of formula children in the state or ii 340000 18 in this scenario the concentration grant for each year would be equal to 85 of the previous year grant crs24 ratable reduction same as basic grants see above fiscal requirements same as basic grants see above treatment of puerto rico outlying areas and the bureau of indian affairs same as basic grants see above further adjustments by seas of lea grants as calculated by ed with one exception these are the same as for basic grants the exception is that in states where the state total number of children counted in the population factor constituted less than 025 of the national total of such children as of the date of enactment of the nclb19 seas may allocate concentration grants among all leas with number or percentage of children counted in the population factor that is greater than the state average for that year not just leas meeting the 6500 or 15 thresholds concentration grant allocation formula the mathematical expression of the concentration grant formula is the same as that for basic grants above with one exception as discussed immediately above in states where the number of children counted in the population factor constituted less than 025 of the national total of such children as of the date of enactment of the nclb the state total is to be allocated on the basis of the population factor among the leas that are to receive grants these leas may include at state discretion either those leas in the state meeting the concentration grant eligibility criteria described above or all leas in the state with number or percentage of children counted in the population factor that is greater than the state average in either case for states where the number of children counted in the population factor constituted less than 025 of the national total of such children

formula was slightly modified by the nclb beginning in fy2002 all increases in title ia appropriations have been allocated as either targeted or education finance incentive grants below thus targeted grants constitute substantial 21 of fy2008 appropriations and growing portion of total title ia grants they are allocated among large majority of leas 83 in fy2007 19 this group of states will be very similar to but not necessarily the same as the group of states currently receiving state minimum concentration grants 20 the improving americas schools act iasa pl 103382 crs25 the allocation formula for targeted grants is essentially the same as that for basic grants except for significant differences related to how children in the population factor are counted for targeted grants the poor and other children counted in the formula are assigned weights on the basis of each leas schoolage child poverty rate and number of schoolage children in poor families as result leas receive higher grants per child counted in the formula the higher their poverty rate andor number there is also somewhat higher lea eligibility threshold for targeted grants than for basic grants aside from these two differences targeted grants are like basic grants based on each eligible leas share compared to the national total of population factor multiplied by an expenditure factor subject to available appropriations an lea minimum or hold harmless and state minimum these formula factors are described below followed by mathematical expression of the formula population factor the children counted for calculating targeted grants are the same as for basic grants see above however for targeted grants leaspecific weights are applied to these child counts to produce weighted child count that is used in the formula children counted in the formula are assigned weights on the basis of each leas schoolage child poverty rate and separately number of school age children in poor families as result an lea would receive higher grants per child counted in the formula the higher its poverty rate or number the weighting factors are applied in the same manner nationwide formula children in leas with the highest poverty rates have weight of up to four and those in leas with the highest numbers of such children have weight of up to three compared to weight of one for formula children in leas with the lowest poverty rate and number of such children see table 10 below the higher of its two weighted child counts on the basis of numbers and percentages is actually used in the formula for calculating grants for each lea crs26 table 10 weights applied to counts of population factor children in the calculation of esea title ia targeted grants weights based on lea numbers of children in the

30163824 325 above 3824 40 there are five ranges associated with each of the number and percentage weighting scales these steps or quintiles were based on the actual distribution of title ia population factor children among the nations leas according to the latest available data in 2001 at the time that the nclb was being considered based upon those data onefifth of the national total of population factor children were in leas in each of the five numbers ranges and separately each of the five percentage ranges the targeted grant population factor weights are applied in stepwise manner rather than the highest relevant weight being applied to all population factor children in the lea and the greater of the two weighted child counts for each lea is the number actually used to calculate the targeted grant for example assume an lea has 2000 population factor children the total schoolage population is 10000 and therefore the population factor percentage is 20 the population factor figure used to calculate targeted grants would be determined as follows numbers scale step 1 691 10 691 the first 691 population factor children are weighted at 10 step 2 2000 691 1309 15 19635 crs27 for an lea with total number of population factor children falling within the second step of the numbers scale the number of population factor children above 691 the maximum for the first step is weighted at 15 total numbers scale 26545 the weighted population factor counts from steps 1 and 2 are combined percentage scale step 1 1558 10000 1558 10 1558 number of population factor children constituting up to 1558 of the leas total schoolage population is weighted at 10 step 2 20 1558 442 10000 442 175 7735 for an lea with population factor percentage falling within the second step of the percentage scale the number of population factor children above 1558 of the leas total schoolage population the maximum for the first step is weighted at 175 total percentage scale 23315 the weighted population factor counts from steps 1 and 2 are combined since the numbers scale weighted count of 26545 exceeds the percentage scale weighted count of 23315 the numbers scale count would be used as the population factor for this lea in the calculation of targeted grants eligibility threshold in order for an lea to be eligible for targeted grant the number of children counted in the population factor with weights applied must constitute at least 10 such children and at least 5 of the total schoolage population expenditure factor same as basic grants see above lea minimum grant or hold harmless level same as basic grants see above minimum state grant each state is to receive minimum of up to 035 of all targeted grant appropriations state may not as result of the state minimum provision receive more than the average of 1 035 of total state grants and 2 150 of the national average grant per formula child multiplied by the number of formula children in the state in the latter calculation population factor child counts are not weighted ratable reduction same as basic grants see above fiscal requirements same as basic grants see above crs28 treatment of puerto rico outlying areas and the bureau of indian affairs same as basic grants see above with the additional provision that for puerto rico only cap of 182 is placed on the aggregate weight applied to the population factor under the targeted grant formula21 further adjustments by seas of lea grants as calculated by ed same as basic grants see above targeted grant allocation formula same as basic grants see above except that the population factor pf would be the weighted child count as described above education finance incentive grants efig the efig formula is in several ways significantly different from the other title ia allocation formulas as with targeted grants efig grants were initially authorized in 199422 but funds were appropriated for them until fy2002 after the formula was in the case of efig considerably modified by the nclb beginning in fy2002 all increases in title ia appropriations have been allocated as either efig or targeted grants thus as with targeted grants efig grants constitute substantial 21 of fy2008 appropriations and growing portion of total title ia grants they are allocated among large majority of leas 83 in fy2007 the distinctive elements of the efig formula begin with the fact that the first stage in the process of calculating grants is based on data for states as whole not leas lea grants are determined in separate later stage of the allocation process second major difference is that the efig formula includes not only population factor and an expenditure factor but also two unique factors these are an effort factor based on average per pupil expenditure for public k12 education compared to personal income per capita for each state compared to the nation as whole and an equity factor based on variations in average per pupil expenditure among the leas in each state third distinctive feature of the efig formula is that while population factor child counts are not weighted when calculating state total grants they are weighted in the separate process of suballocating state total grants among leas this intra state allocation process is based on the same number and percentage scales as used for targeted grants although the weights attached to each point on those scales varies among states based on the states equity factor final difference between 21 this cap applies to both the numbers and percentages weighting scales and was intended to provide that the share of targeted grants allocated to puerto rico would be approximately equal to its share of grants under the basic and concentration grant formulas for fy2001 this cap reduces grants below the level that would obtain if there were cap at all ie if puerto rico were treated in the same manner as the 50 states and the district of columbia since puerto ricos high number and percentage of schoolage children in poor families would translate into significantly higher aggregate weighting factor if not capped 22 the improving americas schools act iasa pl 103382 crs29 the efig grant and other title ia formulas is that the expenditure factor is modified through application of slightly more narrow floor and ceiling constraints for efig grants thus state total efig grants are based on each states share compared to the national total of population factor multiplied by an expenditure factor an effort factor and an equity factor adjusted by state minimum then each leas share of the state total efig grant is based on weighted population factor count for the lea compared to the total for all leas in the state adjusted by an lea hold harmless provision these formula factors are described below followed by mathematical expression of the formula population factor in the firststage calculation of state total efig grants this factor is the same as for basic grants the estimated number of children aged 517 in poor families b in institutions for neglected or delinquent children or in foster homes and c in families receiving tanf payments above the poverty income level for family of four in the secondstage suballocation of state total grants among leas as under all stages of the allocation process for targeted grants weights are applied to these child counts before they are actually used in the formula this process is the same as for targeted grants with respect to the number and percentage scales used and use of the greater of the two weighted child counts to calculate lea grants however for efig grants only the weights attached to each point on the number and percentage scales differs depending on the states equity factor described below this variation is illustrated in table 11 below as indicated in table 11 the weights rise more rapidly as the numbers and percentages of population factor children increase in states with higher equity factors for states with an equity factor below 010 the weights are the same as for targeted grants for states with equity factors between 010 and 020 or above 020 the maximum weights are 50 higher and twice as high respectively as for targeted grants as is discussed below states with higher equity factors have relatively high degrees of variation in average per pupil expenditure among the states

additional factors not found in any other esea program allocation formula effort factor the effort factor is based on comparison of state average per pupil expenditure appe for public elementary and secondary education with state personal income per capita pci more specifically it is the ratio of appe to pci for each state divided by the ratio of appe to pci for the nation the resulting index number is greater than 10 for states where the ratio of expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary education to personal income per capita is greater than average for the nation as whole and below 10 for states where the ratio is less than average for the nation as whole narrow bounds of 095 and 105 are placed on the resulting multiplier so that its influence on state grants is rather limited and its importance is largely symbolic equity factor the equity factor is based upon measure of the average disparity in average per pupil expenditure among the leas of state called the coefficient of variation cv the cv is expressed as decimal proportion of the state average per pupil expenditure in the cv calculations for this formula an extra weight 14 vs 10 is applied to estimated counts of children from poor families the effect is that grants would be maximized for state where expenditures per pupil crs31 from poor family are 40 higher than expenditures per pupil from nonpoor family23 typical state equity factors range from 00 for the singlelea jurisdictions of hawaii puerto rico and the district of columbia where by definition there is variation among leas to approximately 025 for state with high levels of variation in expenditures per pupil among its leas the equity factors for most states fall into the 010 020 range24 in calculating grants the equity factor is subtracted from 130 to determine multiplier to be used in calculating state grants as result the lower states expenditure disparities among its leas the lower is its cv and equity factor the higher is its multiplier and its grant under the efig formula conversely the greater states expenditure disparities among its leas the higher is its cv and equity factor and the lower is its multiplier and its grant under the efig formula eligibility threshold same as targeted grants see above expenditure factor state average per pupil expenditure for public k12 education subject to

for all leas in each state lea minimum grant or hold harmless level same as basic grants see above with one exception the hold harmless is not taken into consideration in the initial calculation of

part c migrant education program the migrant education program mep provides grants to seas to develop or improve education programs for migrant children28 most migrant programs are administered by leas and operate during the regular school year as well as during the summer months in the allocation of funds each state first receives base grant amount equal to its fy2002 grant amount adjusted for updated migrant children counts discussed below states are held harmless at this amount to mitigate substantial redistribution of funds under the new provisions appropriations in excess of the fy2002 level are provided to states based on their proportional share of the sum of 1 the number of identified eligible migrant children ages 3 through 21 residing in the state during the previous year plus 2 the number of identified eligible migrant children ages 3 through 21 who received services under the mep in summer or intersession programs provided by the state during the previous year the sum of these two groups of migrant children is multiplied by 40 of the average perpupil expenditure appe in the state except that the states appe may not be less than 32 or more than 48 of the national appe appropriations for mep have not exceeded the fy2002 appropriations level of 396 million thus since fy2002 the amount of states grant allocation has been based on the level of its fy2002 baseyear state grant which is largely dependent on the states 20002001 count of eligible migrant children29 residing in the state relative to other states although these numbers have been adjusted in recent years for inaccurate or incomplete data submitted by states for the calculation of their fy2002 mep grants30 that is for each state ed calculates defect rate that is then applied to the 20002001 counts of eligible migrant children that were used to make fy2002 awards these counts are then multiplied by 40 of the average perpupil 28 migratory child is defined as child who is or whose parent or spouse is

appropriations act 2001 pl 106554 in the suballocation of state grants to leas if sufficient funds are available each lea first receives an amount equal to the total of the grants it received for fy2001 under the same two antecedent programs if an lea did not receive grant under one or both of the antecedent programs in fy2001 its foundation grant is to be equal to the amount it would have received if it had participated in each program that year the antecedent programs and their allocation formulas continue to substantially influence the distribution of current grants under title iia as the fy2001 appropriation for state grants under these programs 2062620000 constitutes approximately 71 of the fy2008 appropriation for state grants under title iia 2920572000 the formulas for the two antecedent programs may be briefly described as follows eisenhower professional development program in the allocation of grants to states 50 of funds were allocated on the basis of grants under title ia and 50 on the basis of population aged 517 with 05 state minimum for substate allocations to leas 50 of funds were allocated on the basis of total public and private school enrollment and 50 on the basis of title ia grants class size reduction program allocations of the amounts available for state grants were initially calculated using 1 the eisenhower professional development program formula above and 2 the esea title ia formula the greater of these two amounts was selected for each state then these amounts were ratably reduced to the available state grant funding level while applying 05 state minimum for substate allocation to leas 20 of funds was allocated on the basis of total public and private school enrollment and 80 on the basis of schoolage children in poor families crs44 thus the foundation grants incorporate mixture of factors related to poverty or title ia grants plus total schoolage population or enrollment in particular the substate allocation formula for title iia is very similar to the substate formula for the class size reduction program overall while proportions differ formulas for the antecedent programs are similar to the factors used to allocate the remaining title iia funds although less current population and other data are involved since the foundation grants are based on fy2001 population and other factors population factor in the allocation of funds to states 35 of funds above the amount necessary to provide foundation grants is allocated on the basis of total schoolage population ages 517 and 65 on the basis of schoolage

the impact aid program compensates leas for substantial and continuing burden resulting from federal activities these activities include federal ownership of certain federal lands as well as the enrollments in leas of children of parents who work or live on federal land the federal government provides compensation because these activities deprive leas of the ability to collect property or other taxes from these individuals even though leas are obligated to provide free public education to their children section 8003b authorizes payments directly to leas crs65 to compensate them for the cost of serving certain groups of federally connected children49 the presence of these children can increase the number of children the lea must serve without providing commensurate increase in taxes that support public education to be eligible for 8003b payments an lea must have at least 400 federally connected children or such children must represent at least 3 of an leas average daily attendance ada50 population factors each federally connected child is assigned to category that has specific weight associated with it these weights are used to produce weighted student count for each lea that is used to determine grant amounts the weights assigned to each category are shown in table 12 federally connected children receiving the highest weights ie 10 or above have historically been referred to as children while students with lower weights have been referred to as b children51 table 12 weights applied to specific categories of federally connected children section 8003a1 shorthand

by formula formula grants are available to leas receiving section 8003 payments and in which either 1 students living on indian land constitute at least 50 of the leas total student enrollment or 2 military students living on or off base constitute at least 50 of the leas total student enrollment the funds available for formula grant construction payments are divided equally between these two groups of leas ie 20 of total section 8007 appropriation for each group grants for leas impacted by military dependent students are determined by dividing the total amount of available funding by the total number of weighted student units of military children living on or off base across all eligible leas and multiplying this result by the total number of weighted student units of these children enrolled in an lea the same calculation is made for leas impacted by children living on indian lands population factors at least 50 of an leas total student enrollment must be composed of either 1 military children living on or off base or 2 children living on indian lands these student counts are then multiplied by their relevant weights to produce weighted student count see discussion of section 8003b for additional information about these categories of students and the applicable weights 57 although statutory language mandates that 40 of the appropriations for section 8007 be distributed through formula grants and 60 through competitive grants in recent years the labor health and human services and education appropriations acts have specified that the funds be distributed solely through formula or competition for example for fy2008 section 8007 funds are being distributed only through competition in accordance with the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl 110161

as well as the limited availability of current grant data at the lea level all of these analyses are conducted at the state not lea level esea allocations and total federal funds compared to total revenues from all sources for public k12 education table 13 below provides two different federal share calculations for each state the first of these compares total esea formula grant allocations for fy2006 to total revenues for public k12 education for the 20052006 school year the table is sorted on the basis of this calculation from lowest to highest the second calculation compares federal grants under all k12 education programs administered by ed including not only the esea but also the individuals with disabilities education act idea and other federal programs to total public k12 revenues for 20052006 ie the same denominator as in the first comparison figure 1 further illustrates this esea share for the states states are again sorted according to the esea share of total public k12 revenues from lowest to highest as seen in table 13 the share of public k12 education revenues that is provided under esea programs varies substantially among the states although esea funding constitutes only approximately onetenth or less of total public k12 education revenues in all cases except puerto rico the esea share of revenues is lowest 25 or less for the states of iowa massachusetts minnesota connecticut and new jersey these states have relatively low rates of poverty so their grants under title ia and other programs with formulas based on title ia grants are relatively low also three of these states connecticut massachusetts and new jersey have especially high levels of state and local source funding for public k12 education so federal grants are low in comparison at the other end of the scale puerto rico is special case with an esea share 213 of total revenues that is at least twice as high as that of any state among the states the esea share is highest at 84 to 107 for the states of new mexico montana north dakota south dakota and alaska these states receive relatively high grants under the esea impact aid and indian education programs among others in addition alaska montana north dakota and to lesser extent south dakota benefit substantially from the state minimum grant provisions in several of the esea program formulas the total federal share of revenues is in most cases slightly more than twice the esea share for example the national average for esea grants as share of total public k12 education revenues is 41 while the national average for total ed funds as share of public k12 education revenues is 91 ratio of 22 states where this ratio is much lower 16 or below include south dakota montana alaska wyoming and north dakota plus puerto rico all jurisdictions where the esea share is relatively high in contrast states where the ratio of the total federal share to the esea share is especially high at 28 to 34 include maine minnesota crs72 louisiana utah mississippi and iowa most of these states have especially low esea shares but louisiana and mississippi have both relatively high esea shares and high ratios of total federal share to esea share indicating comparatively high level of support from both esea and other federal programs as well as lower than average nonfederal revenues per pupil table 13 esea

the effort factor used in the title ia efig grant formula is illustrated in table 15 and figure 3 below as discussed above this factor is intended to reward states with relatively high levels of expenditures per pupil for public k12 education compared to their level of personal income per capita this factor is equal to the average per pupil expenditure appe for public elementary and secondary education divided by state personal income per capita pci for each state divided by the national average of this ratio in other words it is the ratio of appe to pci for each state divided by the ratio of appe to pci for the nation the effort factor is greater than 10 for states where the ratio of expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary education to personal income per capita is greater than average for the nation as whole and below 10 for states where the ratio is less than average for the nation as whole however the range of the effort factor is limited to 095 to 105 the limited range and therefore the limited impact on grant levels of this factor is evident only 14 states fall within the narrow range between the minimum of 095 and the maximum of 105 while 18 states are at the minimum of 095 and the remaining 20 states are at the maximum of 105 if all other relevant factors are held constant state with maximum effort factor 105 would receive an efig grant of 11

figure 4 as discussed above this factor is intended to reward states with relatively equal levels of expenditures per pupil among their leas the equity multiplier is equal to 13 minus the states equity factor the equity factor is the coefficient of variation for average per pupil expenditure among the states leas in the cv calculations for this formula an extra weight 14 vs 10 is applied to estimated counts of children from poor families as result the lower states expenditure disparities among its leas the lower is its cv and equity factor and the higher is its multiplier conversely the

for fy2007 calculated on the basis of total schoolage children and schoolage children in poor families the states are sorted only on the basis of their total number of schoolage children from largest california to smallest district of columbia as shown below there is substantial variation in average grants per schoolage child as well as grants per schoolage child in poor family among states in all population size ranges for example among the 5 smallest jurisdictions wyoming vermont north dakota alaska and the district of columbia the average grant per schoolage child ranges from 592 to 1407 while the average grant per schoolage child from poor family varies from 3957 to 10935 this variation results largely from 3 factors the varying impact of caps placed on state minimums under the title ia allocation formulas variations in schoolage child poverty rates higher poverty rate is associated with higher grants per schoolage child but at least in the smallest states lower grants per schoolage child from poor family and the eligibility of alaska for substantial funds under titles vii and viii smaller but still substantial variation also may be seen among states in other size ranges nevertheless overall the average grants per child are generally much higher for the smallest states than for the remaining states the average for the 12 smallest jurisdictions new hampshire and smaller is 644 per schoolage child and 4879 per schoolage child from poor family similarly these jurisdictions received 518 of esea formula grants for fy2007 but have only 314 of the nations schoolage children and 246 of the schoolage children from poor families in contrast the average for all of the other states plus puerto rico is 386 per school age child and 2254 per schoolage child from poor family thus the smallest states receive approximately 17 times as much as the remaining states per schoolage child and approximately 22 times as much per schoolage child from poor family this results primarily from the state minimum grant provisions in many of the esea allocation formulas although the differences in average grants per child between the smallest and other states are quite substantial the small states receive relatively modest share of total esea funds the total share of funds received by the 12 smallest jurisdictions 11 smallest states plus the district of columbia for fy2007 was 52 even if these small states were to receive the same amount of esea funds per child as other states the net increase in funds reallocated to the larger states would be relatively marginal for example if the share of funds going to the smallest states were reduced by half the average increase for the remaining states would be approximately 27 crs85 table 17 total esea grants per child

of commerce bureau of the census small area income and poverty estimates program table prepared by crs crs90 figure 6 esea grants per child by state poverty rate differences among states are less obvious or large than in the state population size analysis above however especially if one focuses on groups of states according to their schoolage child poverty rate as in figure 6 two significant patterns appear first the average grant per schoolage child increases as the state average poverty rate rises from 309 per child for low poverty states to 363 for states in the middle range to 445 for high poverty states 144 times as much as for low poverty states this reflects the fact that most esea funds are allocated under or in proportion to the title ia allocation formulas and estimated schoolage children in poor families is the primary formula factor in those at the same time an opposite trend is found in average grants per schoolage child in poor family this figure declines from 2820 for low poverty states to 2393 for states in the middle range and 2182 for states with the highest poverty rates this is reflection of at least 3 factors first many of the states with the lowest poverty rates are small and receive high grants per child as result of state minimum provisions eg new hampshire wyoming vermont north dakota and delaware second large proportion of the low poverty rate states have high expenditure factors eg connecticut new jersey massachusetts and others while large proportion of the highest poverty rate states have low expenditure factors eg california arizona tennessee north carolina alabama arkansas mississippi and others and third the targeting on high poverty areas under the crs91 title ia concentration targeted and education finance incentive grant formulas is carried out at the lea not the state level as was noted above these formulas tend to favor leas with especially large numbers of schoolage children in poor families in many cases leas with such high concentrations of poverty are found in states with low poverty rates overall eg baltimore city maryland or boston massachusetts while in several states with high poverty rates poverty tends to be widely dispersed eg west virginia or mississippi for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34721
