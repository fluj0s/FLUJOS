annually in 20032005 fell by 98 in 20062 it remains to be seen if this decline is the beginning of broader trend decline in housing wealth could also depress consumption thereby depressing aggregate spending in the short run sudden collapse in housing prices could also aﬀect the health of the ﬁnancial sector if ﬁnancial institutions are not adequately safeguarded all of these possibilities give congress cause for concern yet eﬀective policy responses to bubble are diﬃcult if house prices were to decline in some regions it would not be the ﬁrst time this occurred the report examines previous

government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918us housing prices is there bubble summary us housing prices increased by 101 in the past year and total of 565 in the past five years although large thes increases look small in comparison to the behavior of house prices in cer tain parts of the country pri ces in six states have more than doubled in the past five years recallin g the behavior of the stock market in late 1990s some analysts fear that the recent appreciation in housing prices points to bubble or rise in house prices driven by irrational exuberance that cannot be explained by fundamentals fundamental explanations for ri in housing prices include falling interest rates inflation and rising inco mes recent changes in few economic factors suggest reasons why house prices could be rising without bubble being present in parts of the country but when the data are examined at regional level the large price increases in east coast states and the west have recently led to sharp decline in housing affordability that is consistent with bubble in the second quarter of 2006 prices continued to ri but much more slowly than they had been sharp declines in housing sales and st arts this year suggest that the boom may be coming to an end policymakers are anxious to see if the next phase will be decline or leveling off in prices the problem with bubbles is that they cannot be identified with any confidence if bubbles could be accurately identified th ey would never develop in the first place because people would respond to the emer gence of bubble by selling the asset to avoid future losses thereb eliminating the bubble i ndeed economists who believe in the rationality and efficiency of the ma rketplace use this logi c to argue that bubbles can never exist even if the rise in housin g prices cannot be expl ained by the factors identified in this report it is possible that other unidentifie d fundamentals are driving prices up rather than bubble if housing prices were being driven by bubble there is chance that they could suddenly collapse with adverse effect s on the us economy residential investment which rose 9 annually in 20032005 fell by 98 in 20062 it remains to be seen if this decline is the beginni ng of broader trend decline in housing wealth could also depress c onsumption thereby depressing aggregate spending in the short run sudde n collapse in housing prices could also affect the health of the financial sector if financial institutions are not adequately safeguarded all of these possibilities give congress cause for cern yet effective policy responses to bubble are difficult if house prices were to decline in some regions it would not be the first time this occurred the report examines previous price declines in california new england and texas couragingly those declines were much smaller than the prior increase in prices even if there is not bubble it is still po ssible that house prices could fall in the near future for example interest rates are likely to continue to rise in the next few years placing downward pressure on pr ices all else equal but from macroeconomic perspective fall in house prices is an independent economic concern only if caused by bubble for in stance if interest rates rose sharply because of stronger economic growth re sulting fall in housing prices would not be cause of concern for the economy as wholehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918contents the recent behavior of housing prices 2 d t r m i n n t s f h u s i n g p r i c s 5 econometric evidence of bubble 1 3 p

overall prices increased by 33 in the past ye ar and total of 133 in the past five years as measured in the gdp accounts measured by the consumer price index the comparable numbers are 38 in the past ear and 136 in five yearsus housing prices is there bubble us housing prices increased by 101 in the past year and total of 565 in the past five years1 these increases easily outstripped the general increase in prices over this period so that there has been large real incr ease in house prices2 house prices began appreciating rapidly in th third quarter of 1997 and accelerated even further from the fourth quarter of 2003 to th first quarter of 2006 in eight of those nine quarters growth was bove an annualized rate of 8 this is the only time since 1980 that prices have risen more rapi dly than 8 for two or more quarters in row in the second quarter of 2006 pr ice appreciation slowed sharply to an annualized rate of less than 5 it remains to be seen if this marks the beginning of the end of the housing boom deteriorati on in leading indicators such as housing sales and housing starts indi cate that may be the case although the increase in national house pr ices is large th increases look small in comparison to the behavior of house prices in certain regions of the country in six states dc fl ca hi nv and md prices have more than doubled in the past five years early in the housing boom the large price increases were mostly in california florida and the northeast tely the boom has spread to most of the west and midatlantic for example pri ces in arizona increased by 241 in the past year fastest in the nation and 967 in the past five years there could be two forces driving up hous prices first housing demand could be increasing faster than supply because something has changed to make housing more desirable than previously for exam ple people could be wealthier and decide to spend some of that wealth on housing mortgage rates and co sts could have fallen or larger proportion of the population c ould be of homebuying age these are examples of changes in the economic f undamentals that determine house prices but there is also another possible expl anation for why house prices have risen so rapidly recalling the behavior of th stock market in late 1990s some analysts fear that the recent appreciation in housing prices points to pr ice bubble or rise in house prices that cannot be explained by fundamentals instead prices could be driven by what alan greenspan called irrational exuberance if housing prices were being driven by bubble there is chance that they could suddenly collapse with adverse effects on the us economy this report first describes recent developm ents in housing prices and factors that influence housing demand on regional and na tional basis second it uses statisticalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs2 3 this report focuses on the house price index published by the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo it is repeat sales index of single family homes so that it is measuring the appreciation in price of gi ven house from the first time it was sold to the second time it was sold this type of index so lves some problems but causes others since it is based only on repeat sales the change in prices from one period to another is measuring comparable good unless additions or renovations were made to the house between sales however the index is not constant quality index since the houses added to the index over time may be of different quality than the houses previously included in the index thus the index is not pure measure of house price in flation since the index captures changes in quality with lag the index only records houses purchased with conforming mortgages so it excludes houses at the high and low end of the market it only measures houses that were actually sold which may have different value than other houses for discussions of the repeated sales housing index see jesse ab raham

which the data in this report are based with lagtechniques to determine whether histor ical supply and demand relationships can explain the recent price increase third it examines previous regional price declines fourth it discusses bubbles and research on housing bubbles finally the report describes the implications of housing bubble for public policy and what policy options would be available to respond to bubble the recent behavior of housing prices careful look at the data suggests that if there was turning point in the recent behavior of national hous ing prices it was in the third quarter of 19973 before then prices consistently rose by less than 1 per quarter 4 on an annualized basis in the 1990s from this quarter onward prices consistently rose by more than 1 per quarter thus this report will focus on the period from the third quarter of 1997 onward as the possible bubble period the current boom acceler ated further from the fourth quarter of 2003 to the first quart er of 2006 when prices consistently rose more than 2 quarter from 1975 wh the index was first published through the second quarter of 1997 house prices rose on average by 53 year in nominal terms since then they have increased by an average of 78 year but the contrast in price increases between the two periods is greater after adjusting for inflation over those periods inflation ro by an average of 43 in the earlier period and 24 in the latter period this suggests that in real terms house prices increased by about 1 year before the third quarter of 1997 and almost 55 year since then4 the first fact to glean from the housing data is that housing markets are local and there is wide diversity in recent price behavior from market to market as seen in table 1 the increase in house prices in the pacific region was more than threehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs3 5 goldman sachs recently estimated that house pric relative to income were as high in san francisco today as they were in tokyo before the

and housing prices bis quarterly review bank for international settlements march 2004 p 79 9 notice that the behavior of prices in the presen ce of lags in supply changes is similar to the rise and collapse of bubble price rises at first with change in demand and then subsequently falls as supply adjusts thus observed price changes are not sufficient proof of housing bubble 10 the importance of lags is confirmed in robert topel and sherwin rosen housing investment in the united states journal of political economy vol 96 n 4 august 1988 they find that the supply price elasticity rise s from 168 after one quarter to 276 after eight quarters for permanent increase in price temporary increase in price has lower supply elasticitythe sharp increase in prices experienced by the united states in recent years is not unique many other countries saw nominal price increases from 1997 to 2005 that were even larger than in the united states including france 87 australia 114 spain 145 and britain 154 however germany and japan who have experienced weak economic growth during that time saw nominal prices fall7 to an extent this is unsurprising since the recent decline in interest rates has been widespread among developed countries nd the countries listed above experienced relatively robust economic growth as well but if anything these countries are more at risk of bubbles than the united states historically housing prices have been significantly less volatile in the united states than in many foreign countries8 housing markets in britain nd australia cooled down in 2005 determinants of housing prices while the increases described above sound impressive until we consider what has happened to the factor s that determine housing prices we can make judgement as to whether these increases ar excessive or compatible with changes in economic fundamentals housing prices will be determined by both supply and demand on the supply side market effi ciency suggests that house prices should reflect the marginal cost of building an additional house when the demand for housing increases price and profit increa ses and builders respond by building more houses until the price is driven back down to marginal cost since building house is time consuming and changes in demand may be difficult to spot there may be lag between the rise in house prices and th increase in supply that drives the price back down9 however over long enough time horizon the profit incentive ensures that prices would always be driv back down to marginal cost10 cursory glance at the national data c onfirms this hypothesis as seen in figure 2 nationally singleunit housing starts have increased since 1997 but perhaps less than one would expect given the increase in prices since 2002 housing starts havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs6 11 while concern about bubbles usually focuses on the demand side of the market it is possible that irrational exuberance could also ffect the supply side of the market causing overbuilding that eventually leaves prices below marginal cost after the bubble bursts 12 davis and heathcote estimate that the suppl of land used for housing increased at an annual average of 06 from 1970 to 2003 and land accounts for 38 of housing value see morris davis and jonathon heathcote the price and quantity of residential land in the united states board of governors of the federal reserve finance and economics discussion series 200437 2004risen more rapidly11 on regional basis however the west and south are the only regions that have shown strong increase in housing starts recently in the northeast although prices have risen si gnificantly housing starts are much lower than in the rest of the country and did not shown any significant acceleration until 2004 supply was not responding to changes in demand to drive the price back down this is puzzling and suggests that other factor s besides time lag may be suppressing supply in that region what might those other factors be source us census bureau note figure displays singleunit privately owned housing starts on the supply side of the market margin cost may or may not be steady over time it will change if the technology rrounding the building process or the price of inputs such as timber land and labor chan ges in particular the price of land would be expected to be affected by the availability of land12 decrease in supply would be more important in densely populated areas that are growing rapidly and relatively unimportant in sparsely populat ed areas this suggests one fundamental reason prices might have risen more quick ly in the densely populated northeast and california than in the rest of the country more indirect factor s can also influence020040060080010001200140016001800 1987

metropolitan areas harvard university joint center for housing studies working paper w0410 dec 2004 and edward glaeser and joseph gyourko the impact of zoning and housing affordabilityharvard ins titute of economic research discussion paper 1948 march 2002 14 inflation does reduce demand in the face of liquidity constraints because of the way mortgages are set up since traditional mortgages have level payments over the term of the mortgage payments at the beginning of the mortgage are larger in real terms than payments at the end of the mortgage this means that initial mortgage payments will be higher relative to income when inflation is high 15 if there were simple way to keep house quality constant in the data it might be easier to determine whether there is bubble some other price indices try to control for changes continuedcost on the supply side for example the implementation of zoni ng regulations and impact fees to limit new construction w ould increase the cost of new housing since zoning is determined at the local level it is difficult to tell how much it is influencing national prices13 housing is somewhat unusual in that it is good that can be used for either consumption ie to live in or investment to rent out or hold to resell at profit since the ofheo house price i ndex measures only single family homes most of the houses measured serve primarily consum ption role although small proportion of single family homes are rented out for the sake of simplicity let us consider only factors related to consumption that w ould influence housing demand this way we can neglect factors such as the rate of return on alternative assets and expectations of future changes in house prices unle ss an owner has the freedom to move from market to market it is reasonable to assu when there is bubble that the typical owner is not motivated by these factors fo r any given market overall in the short run since he must rent or buy in the same mark et even if he wished to take advantage of profit opportunities there is evidence suggesting that the demand for housing has increased recently for example after staying flat throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s the home ownership rate began rising in 1995 nd continued rising through 2005 many factors may have influenced the demand fo r housing and while it is not possible to measure all of them few of them are obvious and easily quantifiable first nominal price changes due to in flation should not have any effect on demand all else equal increases in infla tion will be translated into higher housing prices one for one14 as noted above after adjustin g for inflation real house prices increased by only about 1 year fro m 1975 through the second quarter of 1997 but they have increased by nearly 5 year since second as incomes and wealth rise people may desire to spend some of the increase on housing as the income ava ilable to spend on housing increases houses would be built or renovated with more amenities causing their price to rise15 thushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs8 15 continued in attributes directly but this is mathemati cally difficult and raises questions about which attributes should be included and how accurately they can be priced 16 interest rates also have an effect on the supply side of the market that should not be neglected when interest rates fall the cost of capital falls for firms this would reduce the marginal cost of building house and induce more houses to be built in the long runincreases in house prices caused by gr eater wealth and income would not be indicative of bubble nor would they be indicative of an increase in price above marginal cost higher incomes would also be expected to cause some people to prefer home ownership to living with family or roommates over the long term changes in income explain real changes in house prices very well third since most house sales are financed through mortgage mortgage rates can change the cost of home ownership even when the price of house is constant figure 3 demonstrates the relationship between interest rates housing prices and monthly mortgage payments anytime mortgage interest rates go up the cost of carrying mortgage rises and demand falls when mortgage rates fall the cost of carrying mortgage falls and demand rises assuming the supply of housing is fixed in the very short run house prices can rise and fall dramatically as interest rates change16 there should only be one time not continuing price adjustment to one time change in interest rates if homeowners desired mortgage payment is held constant at 1200 per month on 30year mortgage the homeowner could borrow 200000 when interest rates ar 6 but only 180 000 for the same mortgage payment when interest rates ar 7 in reality the link between house prices and mortgage rates will be weaker since the rates on some mortgages are adjustable and lowcost opportunities for re financing exist mortgage rates fell sharply from 2000 to 2003 however they have risen slightly since then thus mortgage rates cannot explain the rapid pr ice appreciation that has occurred since 2003 when price increases have been most

mortgage markets tax changes relative change in the cost of home ownership versus renting and so on so analysts are concerned that looser lending standards are contributing to the ri in housing demand it is claimed that increasingly mortgages have higher loan tovalue ratios reportedly fourth of borrowers made down payment in 200417 and are adjustable rather than fixed interest rates in addition mortgages that allow borrowers to take on more debt such as interestonly loans and mortgages that give the borrower an option of how much they wish to pay each month allowing them to increase the loan principal have emerged and are growing in popularity the economist reports that 60 of new mortgages in california in 2005 were in terest only or negative amortization compared with 8 in 200218 businessweek reports that option arms accounted for 12 of all new loans in the first five months of 2006 and 80 of borrowers were making only the minimum payment19 some fear these loans would become unmanageable for borrowers if interest rates rise or house prices decline if so they might be considered both causes because th riskier borrowing allows borrowers to bid up prices and effects because borrowers are taking on more risk in the beliefhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs10 20 similarly rosen derives mortgageservicing index and shows that the cost of servicing mortgage has not risen significantly th rough 2004 richard rose n explaining recent changes in home prices chicago fed letter 216 july 2005 21 full discussion of bubbles appears later in the report to clarify the following discussion the reader may wish to read that section firstthat rapid appreciation will continue of housing bubble evidence of looser standards is more anecdotal than concrete at this point however figure 4 makes some simple assumptions for illustrative purposes it compares the behavior of the house price index hpi to changes in income inflation and interest rates over the past five years20 if movements in these variables can explain the movement in house prices housing bubble can probably be ruled out without even considering the full array of f undamentals that infl uence house prices21 if these variables cannot explain the increase in housing prices since 1997 then there may be bubble although we cannot rule out the possi bility that neglected factors are driving supply and dema nd as seen in figure 4 from 1997 to 2005 the increase in real monthly mortgage costs which captures ch anges in house prices and the effects of changes in mortgage rates mostly kept pace or were exceeded by increases in real disposable income in other words lthough house prices were rising rapidly affordability was not deterior ating because of falling mort gage rates this does not offer evidence that there is housing pri ce bubble in the nation as whole during that period however bot h house prices and mortgage costs have risen rapidly since 2003 as result the increase in monthly payments has greatly outpaced income gains since 2005 which may provide evidence that bubble has emerged in the six quarters ending in 20062 real mortgage payments have increased 14 while real per capita disposable income has increased 1 at annualized rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs11 22 population effects are included in figure 5 but not figure 4 because population is likely to be more important factor in densely populated areas than the nation as whole population growth is accounted for in figure 5 in the disposable income measure 23 of course when analyzing local regions it should be noted that not all housing demand is driven by local factors for example housing demand in vacation communities will be continuedsource crs calculations based on data from bureau of economic

house prices as illustrated in tables 13 which suggests that some ar eas have bubble while other areas have larger bubbles than an analys is based on national data would indicate although increases in house prices have been significantly greater in certain regions than the country as whole this by itself is not evidence of bubble since it is possible that fundamental economic charact eristics such as income and population have increased just as rapidly in these areas22 to estimate whether there are regional bubbles at present the same analysis that was done for the nation as whole can be conducted locally figure 5 compares the rise of mortgage costs in one of the fastest appreciating states in the country californi against the rise of state income and population23 figure 5 suggests

smaller than an economic model predicts 25 in an international study covering the past three decades borio and mcguire find that peaks in equity markets occur on average two years before peaks in housing markets suggesting that fall in the stock market may temporarily boost housing markets but only temporarily claudio borio nd patrick mcguire twin peaks in equity and housing prices bis quarterly review bank for international settlements mar 2004 p 79 26 this approach contrasts to the forecasts made using theoretical relationships in figures 45 for example instead of positing that inflation raises house prices one for one regressions can be used to estimate historically exactly how much of an increase in inflation is passed through to house pricesit would place downward pressure on prices on the demand side if say recession caused income and nonhousing wealth to decline it could cause prices to temporarily decline all else equal on the other hand th poor behavior of the stock market after 2000 could have cau sed people to shift more of their wealth into housing if it is viewed as safe haven temporarily increasing housing demand25 and the future behavior of interest rates could cause decline in housing prices in june 2003 nominal mortgage rates reached their west point in the past three decades due to expansionary monetary policy that wered overnight intere st rates to 1 the lowest nominal rate since 1954 now th at economic conditions have improved the fed has begun to tighten monetary polic and mortgage rates have increased somewhat as well economists are surprised however that mortgage rates have risen so much less than shortterm rates so far if this trend continues it would raise the cost of housing to borrowers and reduce demand thereby putting downward pressure on housing prices econometric evidence of bubble another method for determining whethe r bubble is present in housing prices is to statistically estimate the historical relationship between house prices and variables that affect housing supply and demand before 1997326 those relationships can then be used to forecast what house pr ices would have been since 19973 if the historical relationships had held constant if the forecast is similar to the actual behavior of house prices in the past five years then bubble can be ruled out if the forecasted appreciation is significantly wer bubble may be present forecast cannot definitively prove the presence of bubble however since demand and supply relationships may have changed so th at the historical re lationship is longer accurate the forecast may also fail to pr edict actual events because it is flawed either because the wrong mathematical function is used to relate the factors to one another or because important supply and demand determinants are omitted from the model for example potentially important factors such as demographic composition construction costs and the costs of renting are omitted from the model for technical reasons figure 6 compares actual housing prices to th forecast results generated by five different models which are described in technical appendix all of the models except for model 5 predicted that housing prices would rise considerably morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs14 figure 6 actual vs forecasted housing pricesslowly over the past five years than they actually have mode ls 14 predict housing prices that were 127229 lower than act ual prices at the end of 2002 and actual housing prices are outside the 95 confid ence interval in each case for reasons discussed in the appendix while model 5 does the best job tracking actual prices it is the least likely to distinguish between bubble and house price increases that are driven by fundamentals as expected ll five models did pr edict some house price appreciation over the last five years if there is bubble it is considerably smaller than the overall increase in house pri ces that has been experienced before taking these forecasts as ev idence of national bubble one should remember the regional variation presen t in the national data the amount of appreciation forecasted in models 1 and 4 is only little less than the appreciation that occurred in the country outside of the northeast midatlantic and pacific regions unfortunately similar forecasts were not possible at local level due to paucity of quality data in any case inte rpretation of forecast based on historical data would have been ambiguous in key local markets since bubble may have been present there during the 1980s see

5 sep 2006 p 413previous house pri ce increases and declines in determining the likelihood of bubble t oday it useful to ask whether there have been bubbles departures in housing pri ces from their fundamental value in the past27 since bubbles must be transient by definition price in crease in the past cannot be identified as bubble after the fact unless it was followed by price decline although subsequent price declin is not sufficient evidence that bubble has occurred since prices can also decline for fundamental reasons housing prices have never fallen in nominal terms on national basis for more than one quarter and in those cases the d ecrease was more than reversed in the next quarter however house prices did fall in real terms on nationwide basis in the early 1980s from the second quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1983 house prices rose 156 whereas overall inflation as measured by th gdp deflator rose by 266 this trend seems easily explaine d by the change in fundamentals during that period the econom in 1980 1982 featured historically high real interest rates and the worst economic recession in the postwar period during this period nominal mortgage rates peaked above 18 the unemployment rate reached double digits and real per capita income rose by cumulative 51 although there have not been large nominal declines in hous ing prices the housing market has been highly cyclical with little appreciation in the early 1980s and ea rly 1990s and significant appreciation in the late 1980s and 1990s28 there have been historical examples of sharp nominal drops in local housing markets suggesting that if there was bubbl in some local markets at present it would not be unprecedented recent federa l reserve study identified 17 states that experienced significant declines in housin g prices in the 1980s or 1990s all 17 of the price declines were linked to four sp ecific economic shocks the farm and rust belt decline of the early 1980s the drop in energy prices in the mid1980s which negatively affected energyp roducing states the downturn in new england in the late 1980s to early 1990s and the downtur n in california and hawaii in the early 1990s which the author links to the re duction in defense spending and japanese financial crisis interestingly most of the states affected by the first two shocks did not experience preceding housing boom and thus cannot be categorized as bubbles likewise the author identified severa l other housing booms in the 1980s and early 1990s that never resulted in housing declin underlining the point that not all booms are bubbles29 figures 7 8 and 9 focus on three cases californi texas and new england where sharp prolonged increase in house pr ices was followed by significant andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs16 30 there was also smaller boom and bust cycle in new jersey prices in new jersey rose in nominal terms by 1237 between the firs t quarter of 1983 and the fourth quarter of 1989 they then fell by 78 in nominal terms through the third quarter of 1991prolonged nominal decline in house prices30 in california after rising about 75 in four years nominal prices fell by 133 from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the first quarter of 1995 in texas after rising bout 25 in five years with most of the increase in the first two years nominal pr ices fell by 144 from the first quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1988 in new england after rising about 170 in six years nominal prices fell by 129 from th first quarter of 1990 to the first quarter of 1995 in all three of the cases althoug h the trough of housing prices took several years to be reached most of the decline ccurred in relatively short time in texas prices were 128 down from their peak by the fourth quarter of 1987 in new england prices were down 106 by the th ird quarter of 1991 the pattern was little different in california where most of the decline occurred toward the end of the housing bust rather than the beginning prices fell 123 from the second quarter of 1992 to the first quarter of 1995 all three areas took several years after the bust had ended to reach their previous peak as seen in the figures hopeful sign for today is that in each case even after the crash much of the prior appreciation was not reversed it would be difficult to explain these pr ice increases and subsequent declines which are quite large in real terms by macroeconomic factors alone in each of these cases while there were periods of ri sing and falling inte rest rates within each downswing the episode as whole could not be characterized as period of rising interest rates however in each of the three cases the local economy was experiencing recession although in each case the housing bust exceeded the length of the recession in texas the state ec onomy shrank 05 in 1987 in california the economy shrank 19 from 1992 to 1993 and in new england the economy shrank 46 from 1990 to 1991 in california and new england simple comparison of house prices and per capita disposable in come suggests the pattern of house prices in the 1980s fits bubble during the boom house price increases exceeded income gains when house prices crashed they were brought back into line with nominal income which helps explain why house prices did not decline as much as they had previously risen the texas experience l ooks least like classic bubble there the pattern is different house prices never exceeded income during the boom which was considerably smaller than the california and new engl and booms

dema nd determinants of that object the problem with bubbles is that they cannot be identified with any confidence since supply and demand determinants change over time often unpredic tably if bubbles could be accurately identified they would never develop in the first place because people would respond to the emergence of bubble by selling the asset to avoid future losses thereby eliminating the

d stock that they believe is overpriced in continuedalthough the recent behavior of the stoc k market lends strong support in favor of the existence of bubbles there are reas ons to believe that bubbles are less likely in housing markets than stock markets basi cally it is the intangib nature of certain assets that makes their pr icing difficult and opens the possibility of bubble forming for example corporate equitie s are difficult to price becau their price should equal the expected future profitability of company discounted to the present since nobody knows how profitable corporation will be in the future the price of its equity is subjective and imprecise if enough market participants become irrationally exuberant bubble can emerge houses are easier to price accurately because they are more tangible each house has an observable number of rooms windows fireplaces and so on and can be compared to other houses with similar attributes in many areas buyers should also be able to anticipate that large enough price increases will induce increases in supply that will push prices back down still there are intangible attributes to any given house for example tastes change over time that make pricing less than certain and open the possibility for bubble these intangibles can be thought of as bundle of services attached to the house that include schools entertainment transportation and so on since housing is viewed by the owner as both consump tion good and an investment and for those buyers who do not live in the house it is onl an investment th expected price of the house in the future should be factor in determining the value of the house today and the expected price of the house is uncerta in since future interest rates income inflation and so on are uncertain these f actors may be reasonably predictable on national level minimiz ing the potential for national bubble but they are highly unpredictable at local level making localized bubble possible any particular local economy could boom in the future and any given neighborhood could be the next hot place to live in landscarce or otherwise constrained areas supply cannot easily be increased to push prices back dow nward if these predictions come to pass an increase in price is justified but if enough home buyers irrationally overweigh the probability of certain neighborhood or even metropolitan area booming bubble could emerge this ma be particularly likely to occur if their neighborhood or city has boomed in recent years and buyers project that trend forward indefinitely another difference between housing markets and stock markets is that there are high transaction costs financial and time to buying or selling home this means that buying or selling solely in res ponse to mispricing is less likely to occur furthermore the only individuals who can take advantage of mispricing are those who are not living in their homes or are free to move to nonbubble areas which may be unlikely because of professional family or community ties whether high transaction costs make bubbles more or less likely is unclear they reduce the opportunity for rational traders to co rrect the mistakes of others as economic theory would suggest but also reduce the opportunity for transactions motived solely by shortterm profit and another factor that may make it more difficult for rational traders to eliminate bubble in the housing market than financial markets is the fact that few methods exist in housing markets analogous to selling stock short32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs20 32 continued the anticipation that they will be able to buy back the stock in the future at lower price earning profit on the difference obviously there is direct way to sell borrowed house and then buy it back in the future 33 economic models tend to rule this behavior out since it is too risky that the bubble will burst before the trade has been made see jean tirole on the possibility of speculation under rational expectations econometrica sept 1982 34 eugene fama market efficiency longt erm returns and behavioral finance journal of financial economics vol 49 1998 p 283 35 see the journal of economic perspectives vol 17 n 1 winter 2003 for symposium on behavioral finance good non technical discussion of psycholog ical explanations of stock market bubbles is the subject of robert shiller irrational exuberance princeton nj princeton university press 2000there has been recent anec dotal evidence in some local housing markets at the peak of the boom that is sometimes identif ied as symptomatic of bubble including prices selling for above list price homes lling within days of listing multiple bids for house and buyers forgoing standard services such as home inspection that would delay sale while an examina tion of these phenomena is beyond the scope of this report it is unclear whether this behavior should be associated with bubble or not it is behavior that suggests th at buyers consider housing to be underpriced regardless of whether or not their reasoning is rational it is somewhat surprising that this behavior ever occurs since sellers can observe comparable recent transactions and set their own price accordingly so th at excess demand is eliminated although some have suggested that sellers some times intentionally unde rprice in order to induce buyers to bid against one another in 2006 the inventory of houses for sale rose sharply suggesting that this behavior has probably subsided economists do not assume that prices are efficient because everyone is rational all the time rather economists assume that efficient pr icing occurs because people do not make systematic mista kes and because enough pe ople are correct that they can take advantage of others mistakes until prices move back to their efficient point for example if an investor realized th ere was stock market bubble that would burst soon he could make large pr ofits by selling stocks shor t of course those who realize that there is bubble may instead try to profit from the bubble by pushing prices higher and selling before the bubble bursts33 it may even be possible for the actions of different people making different errors to cancel each other out leaving prices at the same level as if nobody had made mistake34 thus for bubble to emerge and persist the following criteri would have to occur most people are making mistake which is not quickly corrected most mistakes have systematic bias in the same direction and those w ho realize that mistake has occurred do not or cannot take actions to profit from it that would reduce the bubble the efficient market hypothesis is not without its detractors in the economics profession group known as behavioral economists have been trying to use evidence of nonrational behavior which is welldocumented in psychological research to explain economic phenomena some of their efforts have been directed

paper 9801 jan 1998research on housing bubbles during the last housing boom and bust in the late 1980s economists karl case and robert shiller wrote seri of papers on whether th behavior of housing prices in certain markets constituted bubble in two papers the authors presented evidence that housing mark ets are not efficient36 in an efficient market one could not predict future house prices based on past housing prices since all existing information should already be incorporated into the price yet the authors demonstrate that past housing prices have statisti cally significant effect on future housing prices37 they also show that the rate of re turn on housing was far higher than other assets during most of the 1970s and 1980s this suggests that housing was undervalued rather than valu ed at its efficient price during the housing boom of the late 1980s they presented evidence of housing bubble based on survey data38 in 2003 they repeated this survey and found similar results39 they tried to ascertain whet her peoples attitudes toward housing prices reflected rational response to changes in economic fundamentals or irrational exuberance they pointed to evidence that it was the latter for example in the booming markets of san francisco angeles and insignificant homeowners expected prices to rise by at least 13 year for the next 10 years which is significantly higher than the long run historical return on housing or any other riskadjusted asset higgins and osler look at the price ri ses and declines experienced by some regions from the late 1980s and early 1990s and attempt to distinguish how much of the price change was due to economic fundamentals and how much was due to nonfundamentals40 their measures of fundament als include income employment construction costs interest growth and expected appreciation they estimate that the 10 real price decline experienced in new england midatlantic pacific mountain and east south central regi ons can be entirely

between the stock market and housing prices to forecast whet her the recent increase in the stock market can explain the large increase in housing prices his results are questionable however since he relies so heavily on th stock market explanation and does not consider more traditional explanations such as income further his stock market model suggests that housing prices should have risen even more than they did in the late 1990s and since his study was publis hed local house prices have stopped rising rapidly but have not fallen with the stoc k market as his research would predict in two recent reports zandi and oungblood define local housing price increases as bubbles if pri ces are more than one sta ndard deviation above their estimated equilibrium value based on th eir respective criteria youngblood finds evidence of bubbles in 45 metropolitan areas and zandi finds evidence of bubbles in 41 metropolitan areas43 in an international study covering the past three decades borio and mcguire find that peaks in equity markets occur on average two years before peaks in housing markets suggesting that fall in the stock market may mporarily boost housing markets but only temporarily they show that the peak in equity prices are better predictors of housing price peaks than inte rest rates gdp growth or unemployment the applicability of their results to us data is limited however by the fact that us housing prices are significantly less volatile than prices in many foreign countries44httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs23 45 edward leamer bubble trouble your ho

future implicit rent less maintenance discounted to the present are the houses future earnings and should therefore determine the price of the house if present rents are correlated with future rents todays earnings should give an indication of the houses fundamental value houses with high pe ratio are indicativ of bubble major drawback to this analysis is that it does not control for mortgage rates when rates fall the cost of financing house relative to paying rent falls yet the pe ratio would remain unchanged in addition accura tely measuring the pe ratio empirically is difficult implicit rents present and future nd the proper discount rate cannot be easily estimated historical earnings are only g ood guide to future earnings if supply and demand fundamentals are consta nt over time to measure ear nings leamer uses the rental data from the cpi index which is pr oblematic for two reasons first the cpi data is reported as an index not in dollars so only histor ical trends can be observed numerical pe ratio value that could id entify bubbles directly cannot be calculated second the cpi keeps quality constant in its measurement so comparisons between the cpi and house price meas ures such as the ofheo house price index or median house prices are akin to comparing apples to oranges mccarthy and peach argue that the census bureaus constantquality index is more appropriate for measuring pe ratios and after using this ratio and adjusting for the fall in interest rates there is little evidence of bubble46 mccarthy and peach then construct nd estimate structural model and estimate that the equilibrium price that houses should currently be based on supply and demand factors is higher than current market values thus they find little evidence of bubble the fall in interest ra tes is the main determinant of the recent rise in equilibrium prices in their model macroeconomic effects of bubble the primary reason why policymakers may be concerned about housing bubble would be if it had an effect on th wider economy particularly after it bursts bubble could deflate slowly vi long period of stagnant prices or suddenly it is the latter scenario that threatens macroeconomic stability there are several channels through which the ec onomy could be affected reduction in housing wealth could lead to reduction in consumption lower housing prices could lead to slowdown in the construction i ndustry lower housing prices could lead to problems in the financial system and lowe r housing prices could cause personal debt burdens to become unsustainable each effect is discussed below effects on consumption many analysts have speculated that the recent rise in housing prices is having positiv wealth effect on personal consumptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs24 47 for example see going thr ough the roof house prices the economist mar 30 2002 p 77 48 john benjamin peter chinloy and g donald jud real estate wealth

versus the housing market national bureau of economic research working paper 8606 nov 2001 the wealth effect for housing is statistically significant at the 1 level the wealth effect for equities is statistic ally insignificant in some regressions 50 in the long run there can be net wealth effect because consumption is determined by the economys productive capacity and change in the price of an existing asset does not alter the economys productive capacitysince consumption has been the strongest s ector of weak economy they reason that decline in house prices could pus h the economy back into recession47 viewing housing as an asset from lifecycle saving perspective an increase in the value of that asset would increase an individual s potential lifetime c onsumption assuming the asset would be liquidated at some point the lifecycle theory suggests that the individual would wish to spread the c onsumption derived from the future income from the sale of the asset evenly over his lifetime beginning immediately since the consumption derived from the increased wealth is being spread over lifetime the increase in consumption in any given year would be very small one study estimated that households increase consumption by 008 for every 1 increase in housing wealth which was about thr ee times larger than the authors estimate of stock market wealth effect48 another study estimated that households increased consumption by 003009 for every 1 increase in housin g wealth compared to 0007 increase in consumption for 1 increase in stock market wealth49 still if housing wealth increased sharply as it has in some parts of the country recently even small wealth effects can dd up to large effects on the macroeconomy while this analysis has much to recommend it there are some offsetting factors that could diminish the importance of w ealth effect first the proponents of the wealth effect tend to focus on the gains to the sellers but the housing market is made up of both buyers and sellers when prices increase sellers are wealthier and can increase their lifetime consumption but this is exactly offset by buyers whose non housing wealth falls when house prices go up eg they will now have to borrow more to purchase the house and devote more of their income to repaying their mortgage thus change in housing pri ces causes an income transfer from buyers to sellers which reduces the lifetime consumption of buyers by as much as the lifetime consumption of sellers is raised50 second housing is highly illiquid sset with large transaction costs therefore it is more difficult to realize housing capital gain than it is for other assets however homeowner could incr ease his consumption in other ways he could either save less out of other income than previous ly planned or he could take out home equity loan when consider ing the effect of home equity loans on consumption however we should be car eful to limit it to loans used for consumption not other forms of saving which could include paying down other forms of debt or using the capital to renovate or upgrade the house although muchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs25 of this investment would be classifi ed as consumption in the gdp accounts personal saving rates have indeed fallen in recent years and are now slightly negative which suggests that this channel of the wealth effect has more or less been exhausted third there is another more direct channel through which rise in housing wealth influences consumption by reducing disposable or aftertax income most counties or municipalitie s levy property tax as per centage of the houses value so that payment rises when hous assessed value rises th is factor partially offsets any positive wealth effect fourth the lifecycle model makes several specific assumptions in determining whether or not consumption would be affected the appreciation must be unexpected since an expected appreciation would already have been incorporated into the individuals saving and consumpti on plans the asset cannot be held until death it must at some point be liqui dated and consumed which is problematic assumption with owneroccupied housing since the homeowner still needs to live somewhere if the asset is liquidated to increase consumption upon the liquidization of primary residence the owner must sell and move to lower cost region or residence this is not th case for houses that are rent ed or secondary residences the riskiness surrounding the appreciation w ould also be an important determinant of how much consumption would increase when housing wealth increased some economists have argued that the wealth ffect from housing is greater than the wealth effect from the stock market because gains in housing prices are less likely to be suddenly reversed neverthe less if home owner believe d that the appreciation in his house was caused by bubble he s hould be hesitant to increase consumption since the bubble might burst at any second pplying these principles to the state of housing markets today it suggests that in markets with little appreciation consumption would not be greatly alte red since the appreciation was probably expected and in markets with rapid appr eciation home owners may feel hesitant to spend that wealth because of their uncerta inty about whether or not the appreciation represents bubble that may soon burst if prices did subsequently fall but remained above preboom levels th is hesitancy ma prevent consumption from falling significantly finally although aggregate demand ma increase along with housing prices through the consumption channel it is important to distinguish between the macroeconomic effect of an independent change in house prices and change in house prices that is the side effect of another policy chan ge for an example of the latter consider change in monetary policy that lowers interest rates this would be expected to increase investment and c onsumption in the economy one of the channels through which monetary easing would increase consumption would be the wealth effect from the increase in housing pr ices but the change in house prices in this example has independent effect on the economy since house prices only rose as result of interest rates declining while it is fair to talk of independent changes in housing prices as affecting overall gdp the change in gdp that results from another policy change should be attributed to the policy change itself not to the change in housing prices that results from the policy change in this example it is more accurate to describe this change in consumption as resulting from the decline in interest rates rather than the rise in house prices httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs26 51 the global housing boom the economist june 18 2005 p 66this distinction between the macroecono mic effects of an independent rise in housing prices and rise that results fro m another policy change has an important implication for analyzing the macroecono mic effects of potential housing bubble it suggests that movements in housing pr ices should only be specific concern of macroeconomic policymaking if they are caused by bubble that is independent of economic fundamentals to understand why it is useful to consider again the interest rate example most economists would agree that the objective of monetary policy is to keep the growth of output and inflation stable sometimes higher interest rates are necessary to slow the growth of aggregate demand to meet this objective if house prices fell as result of higher in terest rates this w ould reduce consumption spending through the wealth effect channel since slower aggregate demand growth was the intention of the monetary policy tig htening this would be of concern to policymakers on the other hand if housing bubble suddenly burst policymakers would likely be concerned since the bursting of bubble will shock aggregate demand and move it away from the grow th rate policymakers had targeted in general whether decline in consumption as result of the bursting of housing bubble were concern to the ma croeconomy would depend largely on the state of the economy at the time the bubbl was burst if ec onomic activ ity were robust decline in consumption which is equivalent to rise in saving could be translated into rise in capital investment fairly rapidly and this would be beneficial to the economy in the long run moderate decline in consumption is really only problematic if the economy is operating below full potentia l in which case it could lead to more underutilized resources in the economy effects on the housing industry on the supply side of the economy decline in housing prices would have direct effect on the housing industry keeping construction costs constant lowe r housing prices would lead to lower revenues and profits for the housing industry as result fewer new houses would be built and the output of the housing industr would decline again in evaluating this decline it is useful to differentia between house price declines caused by change in fundamentals and the bursting of bubble if the decline in housing output were caused by the bursting of bubble it would have negative consequences for the macroeconomy alternatively decline in the output of the housing sector caused by an increase in interest rates cannot be judged to be good or bad except in the context of the overall state of the economy interestsensitive i ndustries benefit most when interest rates are lowered because the economy is below full employment and bear the brunt of an increase in intere st rates because the economy is above full employment for this reason the residential investment sector has historically been one of the more volatile sectors of the economy as shown in table 4 recently it has been one of the fastest growing sectors of the ec onomy growing an average of 9 annually in 20032005 the economist estimates that over twofifths of all privatesector jobs created since 2001 have been in housin grelated sectors ch as construction real estate and mortgage brokering51 in the past three decades the sector has

their homes off of the market rather than lower th asking price this would require depository institutions to shift from mortgage lending to other types of lending or investments while this would not be expected to greatly affect the overall profitability of the banking sector some institutions might find the shift in lending difficult particularly if they are small and heavily reliant on mortgage lendingfrom 1980 to 1982 residential investment shrank by cumulative 406 in real terms while gdp grew by 02 from 1988 to 1991 residential investment shrank by 239 while gdp grew by 92 it is useful to

macroeconomy if the bursting of bubble caused widespread harm to the financial sector the overall economy could suffer there are number of reas ons that bursting bubbles effect on the financial system could be limited however change in the value of house has direct effect on the value of loan thus bursting bubble would only be harmful to the financial system if homeowners responded by defaulting on existing loans52 while this strategy could be profitable in theory when the value of mortgage exceeds the value of the home in reality it seems unlikely given that houses are not solely investments to most homeowners nd that people wish to maintain good credit history for the value of the mort gage to exceed the value of the house the loan would have to have high loantova lue ratio loan made fairly

default54 there was spike in default rates in massachusetts that exceeded the national average however following the real estate bust of the early 1990s55 an increase in the default rate could be harmful to three types of financial institutions depository institutions when they keep the mortgage as an asset mortgage insurers and investors who pur chase mortgages on the secondary market the largest investors in secondary markets are the government sponsored enterprises gses fannie mae and freddie mac on average real estate secured lending makes up about one third of depository institutions assets for savings institutions more than one half of total assets are real estate secured if the bubble were localized the chance of harm to the overall financial system would be reduced national institutions such as large banks and the gses should be diversified enough from local risk that they should not be seriously harmed by the bursting of local bubble small local in stitutions particularly savings institutions would be more vulnerable to the bursting of local bubble but significant number of these institutions would need to become insolvent before the overall financial sector was detrimentally ffected on the other hand one should keep in mind that the regions that may be experiencing bubbl california and the northeast make up large fraction of the national housing market the household debt channel another point of macroeconomic concern raised in relation to the possible housin g bubble is its effect on household debt commentators have argued that the housin g bubble has led to households taking out too much home equity debt and when th bubble bursts consumers will be forced to retrench causing recession56 data from the fed reveal that home equity second mortgage debt has indeed risen rapidly in the past few years home equity loans have risen from 402 b illion in 1999 to 911 billion in the first quarter of 2005 while home equity loans are often described as supporting consumption expenditures this is not necessarily the case they may also be used to pay off other higher interest debt or for investment wh ich could be physical eg home improvement s financialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs29 57 although home improvements would conceptually be identified as an investment since it increases the value of housing assets some types of home improvements would actually be counted as consumption in the gdp acc ounts the same is true of education while it adds to human capital it is counted as c onsumption or government spending in the gdp accounts 58 national association of realtors real estate outlook june 2005 p 4 59 jan hazitus daily financial market comment goldman sachs newsletter mar 15 2005or human eg educational spending57 thus it is only the portion of home equity loans used for consumption that decreases the nations saving although concerned analysts often point to the ratio of total consumer credit to disposable personal income which reach ed 118 in 2005 better measure of the debt burden is debt payments as percen tage of income this figure equaled 14 in 2005 up from 12 in the 1990s mortgage paymen ts as percentage of income have risen less to 109 in 2005 thus although total debt increased the decline in interest rates meant that the burden of debt declined which suggests that consumers are rationally responding to the incentive of lower interest rates rather than bubble to the extent that the interest on house hold debt is adjustable an increase in interest rates would increase the burde n of servicing that debt perhaps to unsustainable levels nearly twothirds of new mortgage s in the second half of 2004 were estimated to be adjustable rate58 although the percentage of total outstanding mortgages with adjustable rates is much lower 17 in 200359 if consumer debt levels became unsustainable this could lead to decline in consumption expenditures and possibly shortterm dec line in aggregate spending this may be more of cause then an effect of th housing bubble however greater borrowing in response to lower interest rates may be partially ling the rise in house prices and the growth in both borrowing and house prices could reverse when rates rise housing bubble on the other hand woul d have little effect on households ability to service its debt the only ch annel between househol d debt and housing bubble comes from the fact that when hous ehold takes out home equity loan it decreases the equity in the home this increases the probability that decline in housing prices would cause the value of the house to fall below the value of the outstanding debt making defa ult profitable strategy as was discussed previously most people do not seem to default on mort gages solely for profit motives so this effect may be limited the bursting of housing bubble could also reduce new home equity lending since it would reduce the equity that homeowners could use for collateral and to the extent that home equity lending is used for consumption aggregate demand could be re duced through that channel another housing bubble concern that has been raised relates to mortgage refinancing many households have recently taken advantag of the low interest rate atmosphere to refinance their mortgages on more favorable terms and this could boost consumption since it frees up disposab income that was previously devoted to debt service goldman sachs estimates that cashout refinancing rose sharply tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs30 60 jan hatzius us economic analyst goldman sachs newsletter apr 15 2005 61 see for example ben bernanke asset price bubbles and monetary policy speech before the national association of busi ness economics new york ny oct 15 2002 62 greg ip booming local housing markets weigh heavily on overall sector wall street journal june 20 2005 p 1an average of 150 billion to 200 billion from 2001 to 200460 as with home equity loans only portion of refinancing direc tly supports consumption spending and to an even greater extent than home equity loans mortgage refinancing activity will be more dependent on interest rates than housing prices thus it is unlikely that refinancing activity would be influenced by housing bubble policy options some analysts have argued that when bubble emerges the fed should raise interest rates to atte mpt to prick it before it gets an bigger policy responses to potential bubble are always problematic b ecause of the inherent difficulty in differentiating bubble from price increases motivated by changes in fundamentals for this reason the fed has continued to prefer to limit its policy responses to stabilizing inflation and output and to worry about bubbles only when there is concrete evidence that they are affecting inflation or output61 critics argue that this strategy amounts to too little too late because by th time bubble has deflated the damage to the economy has already been done furthermore housing bubbles are unlikel to be concern of macroeconomic stabilization policy when the bubbles are localized although the bursting of localized bubble could have negative ffect on local economy it is unlikely to have spillover effects on the nation as whole stabilization policy is focused on the national economy only and could not be accura tely aimed at local markets if desired monetary policy must be exclusively nati onal since financial markets are national any attempt to change interest rates in one region would lead capital to flow in or out of that region until interest rates returned to the national average fiscal policy could be theoretically directed toward sp ecific region although its efficacy is limited when one considers that goods markets are also highly integrated on national level on the other hand the markets that are candidates for bubble are large enough that they comprise significant fraction of the nations total housing wealth for example the wall street journal reporte d that the 22 metropolitan areas with the fastest growing house prices comprise d 35 of the nations housing wealth62 thus the potential bursting of local housing bubbl could have ramifications for the overall economy if stabilization policy cannot be used to effectively offset the macroeconomic effects of housing bubble can bubble be eliminated directly through the use of public policy policy tools could be used to reduce or suppress housing demand such as tightening of lending standards as discussed above growing share of mortgages are nontraditional in this housing boom and many of these mortgages such as the interest only arms and option arms have the potential to resulthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs31 in rapid debt accumulation in ways that may not be fully understood by borrowers these mortgages may have allowed some borrowers to purchase houses that they cannot really afford on the belief that th eir property would become affordable once prices have risen further obviously if bubble were to burst this strategy would dangerously backfire this could potentially lead to vicious cycle if these owners were forced to sell at fire sale prices thereby pushing down the value of all properties but again the problem with policies to reduce demand is the uncertainty concerning whether the pri ce increase is being driven by fundamentals or bubble if price increase were being driven by fundamentals policy changes to suppress demand could be seen as needlessly punish ing the housing industry since housing bubbles are more likely to be local than national if policymakers decided to use public policy to suppress housin g demand policies that coul d be beneficial in bubble areas would be damaging in areas that ve experienced little price appreciation on the other hand higher priced markets may be more affected at the margin by tightening of lending standards price controls are another policy tool to prevent bubble from forming but economists are nearly unanimous in their belief that in competitive markets with many buyers and sellers such as the hous ing market price controls do more harm than good price controls do not eliminat excess demand even if there is bubble they shift excess demand into other areas they would create large incentives to shift higher costs into form s that would not be covered by the price controls furthermore they would eliminat the incentive to the supply side of the market to increase the housing stock which is the only longterm solution to bringing prices back down when demand has increased for fundamental reasons policy changes could attempt to rem ove impediments to increasing supply which some economists claim have contri buted to rising prices however these impediments mostly fall under the jurisdicti on of local government the government could also attempt to reduce prices by in creasing the housing supply directly through an increase in public housing investment yet the goal of public housing has traditionally been poverty reduction whereas bubble could affect all income levels or even higherincome housin g exclusively furthermor bubble is temporary phenomenon that will be reve rsed whereas increasing public housing is longterm response that involves pe rmanent change in supply finally some argue that speculators are responsible for bubbles and policies to curb speculation could eliminate bubbles in practical terms it would be dubious and burdensome for the government to attempt to differentiate between speculative behavior and normal investment or consum ption furthe rmore although theory is ambiguous if anything it seems more likely that speculators would prevent or reduce bubbles than cause them if we define specu lators as individuals attempting to profit from pricing mismatches then we would expect to see them disinvest from areas that are overpriced and the process of disinves tment would help deflate the bubble before it became serious if speculation is defined as shortterm holdings then these are already discouraged by unfavorab capital gains tax treatment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs32 conclusion while the increase in us housing pri ces since 1997 has been considerable reasonable argument can be made that til recently the increase can be explained by changes in the economic fundamentals th at determine housing supply and demand increases in income and declines in in terest rates through 2003 increased housing demand and placed upward pressure on prices since 2004 rapid increases in housing prices have gone hand in hand with small increases in interest rates causing mortgage affordability to deteriorate rapidly which is consistent with but not proof of bubble but national data mask significant regiona l differences in much of the south and midwest the increase in housing pr ices since 1997 has been modest and unsurprising by contrast east coas t states and the west have experienced extremely rapid house price appreciation durin g that time significantly more than can be explained by inflation in terest rates and income alone recently new england where prices boomed earliest has seen pri ce appreciation rates fa ll below the national average while prices in parts of the west where rapid appreciation started later grew fastest in the nation bubbles by th eir very nature can never be identified beforehand with confidence but the po ssibility of bubbles currently existing in many local markets and perhaps even regions as whole is significant these regions comprise enough of the national economy that the potential bursting of housing bubble could have ec onomywide ramifications nationally the us has seen prolonged periods of stagnant house prices but never falling prices bubble or not macr oeconomic stability would be threatened only if prices were to fall suddenly wh ile nominal house prices have never fallen nationwide regional price declines have ccurred in the past on the bright side these price declines were far smaller than the preceding ascent this would diminish the macroeconomic consequences of the bubbles unwinding th historical record suggests that rising interest rates alone may not be enough to cause housing crash since the real estate busts of the recent past were all characterized by severe local recessions deflating bubbles are not the only source of price declines even if there is housing bubble in the nation as whole s upply and demand factors could change in the near future in such way that downw ard pressure was exerted on prices the most likely source is further increase in mortgage rates as the economic expansion progresses which would raise the cost of financing home increasing supply in response to higher prices is another plausible fundamental factor that could drive prices down but if prices were to fall it would be an independent cause for concern to policymakers only if the fall were due to the deflation of bubble in that case residential investment could fall signifi cantly and consumption expenditures could decline because of negative wealth eff ect although the decline would be only small fraction of the decline in wealth there are several reasons to believe that the wealth effect has been exaggerated however for instance the most direct link between house prices and consumption is negative higher pr operty tax assessmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs33 reduce aftertax income profits in the housing finance sector could decline depending on what happens to default rate s household debt would be unlikely to become troublesome since it depends more on interest rates than house prices if house prices fell because of an external factor such as an increase in interest rates there would be similar effects on residential investment consumption the financial sector and there would be gr eater effect on household debt but these effects should be attributed to the source of the price decline not the decline itself for that reason the price decline could not be characterized as good or bad without analyzing why the external factor d changed for example one could not characterize an increase in interest rates as negative if it were caused by booming economy even though it would place downwar d pressure on housing prices all else equal the appropriate policy response in the face of potential bubble is problematic although the bursting of bubble may be rmful to the economy all of the policy options have their drawbacks the consen view is that macroeconomic policy is best focused on stabilizing aggregate out put and inflation and giving special attention to other issues like bubbles n ecessarily detracts from those other goals tightening lending standards is potentia l regulatory response given the role that nontraditional mortgages have played in the recent boom but the main problem with policy response to bubble is identifying the bubble with confidence that requires policymakers to have some special insight into the functioning of market that all of the highly knowledgeable and speci alized participants in that market lack supply and demand determinants change unpr edictably over time so there is never failsafe method to identify what th right price should be given this uncertainty microeconomic po licy responses are problema tic because policy options that could effectively counter act bubble could be quite harmful to the market if the price rise is attributable to fundamentals in any case given that housing bubbles are more likely local than national phenomena the policy options available to the federal government could potentially harm regions that have seen little price appreciationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs34 technical appendix this appendix presents technical details and description of the forecast results presented in figure 6 of the report table 5 summarizes the characteristics of all five models and compares the difference between actual housing prices at the end of 2002 and the forecast model 1 uses the ordinary least squares ols regression method to explain house prices in terms of the most fundamental variables one would expect to influence housing prices infla tion real income per capita real mortgage rates seasonal dummy variables and housing starts as seen in table 6 all of the variables were statistically significant at the 1 level except for interest rates in other words the model predicts that each variable will have an effect on house prices different from zero in 99 out of 100 sample s model 2 uses the same methods but expands the explanatory variables to incl ude real nonhousing net wealth total net wealth omitting housing assets and mortgage debt population and real tax payments per capita since taxes reduce the disposable income available to spend on housing all of the variables were statistically sign ificant at the 1 or 5 level including interest rates except for wealth which was significant at the 10 level model 3 adds linear time trend to the variables this helps to reduce spurious correlation between data sets that are highly correla ted for reasons other than causation this may explain why the parameters on variable s that had the wrong sign in model 2 such as population and tax payments now have the correct sign adding time trend can also be thought of as way to comp ensate for omitted vari ables all of the variables in model 3 except taxes were statistically significant

population real tax payments per capita it is possible that housing prices respond to changes in supply and demand with time lag this could occur because exp ectations change slowly for example to compensate for this possibility model 4 uses distributed lag model that allows each explanatory variable in the current quart er and previous four quarters to affect housing prices all of the variables were statistically significant at the 1 or 5 level except for wealth another way to compensate for sluggish price adjustment is to let previous house prices influence current prices this is done in model 5 using an autoregressive method allowing house pr ices over the four previous quarters to affect current house prices nd also allowing current valu of the core explanatory variables affect curre nt house prices th is method allows for the possibility that house prices themselves adjust sluggishly or can be thought of as way to capture the lagged effects of omitted variables in this model only lagged housing prices housing starts and population were statistically significant and several variables had the wrong signs this indicates that the past values of housin g prices are better predictor of current prices than current supply and demand terminants but it should be noted that this model would ttribute any changes in house prices due to lags in the explanatory variables to lags in house prices this suggests that model 4 might be the best model for our purposeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31918crs36 63 whether taxes should have had negative effect on house prices in these particular regressions is open to debate higher taxes reduce the disposable income available to individuals to spending on housing reducing demand all else equal and suggesting negative effect on house prices but all else may not be equal in these regressions for example if taxes are raised to pay for gove rnment services that increase house values such as public safety the effect on house prices is now ambiguoustable 6 presents the regression results listing the beta coefficients for each variable and the standard error beneath it in parentheses for variables that were logged the beta coefficients can be roughly interpreted as percentage change for example model 1 predicts that 1 incr ease in real income would lead to 0918 increase in housing prices b ecause their coefficients are so much larger than the other variables income in flation and population are esse ntially driving the results in models 14 since income growth and inflation has been low in the last two years none of the models predict the large in crease in house prices during that period variables such as mortgage rates that one would expect to explain recent house price appreciation had much sma ller effect on house prices hi storically than one would expect there are many shortcomings to the models that suggest their results are far from definitive although the root mean square error meas ure of overall goodness of fit is very high and most variables ar highly significant this is not unusual for timeseries results and does not necessarily indicate that the results are reliable on the contrary there is not sufficient varia tion between the variables to yield reliable estimates although statistica lly significant the estimated effect of many variables was negligible in some models the coe fficient for population and tax payments had the wrong sign63 major shortcoming with the regressions is the fact that the explanatory variables were not truly indepe ndent of one another as ols requires for unbiased estimation inco inflation and interest rates are all interrelated variables that do not meet this criteria the m odel also assumes that housing starts cause changes in house prices whereas in reality causation runs in both directions while an increase in housing starts push down pri ces as modeled in the forecasts causation runs in the other direction as well hi gher house prices leads to an increase in housing starts the simple modeling used he re does not capture this other effect and leaves the meaning of the results ambiguous since the results from model 5 yield such different results and it is the model with the lowest root mean square error it is useful to focus on its proper interpretation by allowing for past house pr ices to influence current prices it is the only model that does not explain house pr ices exclusively by supply and demand fundamentals the lagged effect of past housing prices used in model 5 has much larger effect on current prices than any of the other explanatory variables this leads the forecast to be much closer to actual results in the past five years but it also makes the forecast the least useful for iden tifying bubble because supply and demand variables have such small role in predicting prices in other words if there were bubble present last year rather than identif it model 5 would predict it to continue this year
