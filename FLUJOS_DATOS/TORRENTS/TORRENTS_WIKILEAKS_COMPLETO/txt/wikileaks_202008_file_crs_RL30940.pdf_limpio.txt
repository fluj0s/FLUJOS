107th congress summary congress ional advocates of enhanced airline passenger rights have introduced legislation in the 107th congress that proposes remedies to variety of consumer complaints most of the bills include provisions requiring prompt and truthful disclosure of reasons for delays cancellations and diverted flights others found in some of the bills include preventing airlines from assessing fee against or prohibiting ticket holder from using only part of ticket requiring airlines to make available information on all fares offered through any media phone internet etc and giving passengers the right to exit flights delayed on the ground beyond certain length of time some bills would increase penalties for violating aviation consumer protection law or increase the airlines liability for mistreatment of passengers during the 106th congress the air transport association ata which represents the major air carriers successf ully forestalled major legislation using three major strategies first the ata took issue with the perceived extent of consumer dissatisfaction by comparing the relative number of complaints reported to the department of transportation dot to the high passenger volume second the ata argued that most delays were due to the weather and to the air traffic control system finally to mitigate the perception of some members of congress that legislation was needed the ata proposed voluntary airline customer service commitment hereafter referred to as the service commitment all the major carriers would develop customer service plans that would include their commitment to promises such as offering the lowest fare available notifying customers of known delays cancellations and diversions providing on time baggage deliver of checked baggage and being more responsive to customer complaints on february 13 2001 the dot office of the inspector gene ral ig released its report on how well the airlines have met their service commitments it concluded that while the airlines were making some progress on some of the commitments that there were significant shortfalls on others two bills introduced following release of the igs reportthe air customer service improvement act s 319 and the fair treatment of airline pass engers act s 483 incorporate many of the igs recommendations including provisions to make the service commitments enforceable after incorporating significant number of provisions from s 483 the senate committee on commerce science and transportation reported out s 319 on february 13 2001 after two summers of record delays cancellations and consumer complaints these indicators have improved significantly during the first half of 2001 it remains to be seen if this improvement will be enough to forestall the

the reduced number of consumer complaints filed with dot in 2001airline passenger rights legislation in the 107th congress in the 107th congress supporters of enhanced airline passenger rights have introduced legislation significantly influenced by both legislation introduced in the 106th congress and the airline industrys response to that threat of legislative remedies as group the various bills provisions address the issue of how to respond to reported growing consumer dissatisfaction with airline service also at issue is the appropriate degree of federal involvement in protecting airline customers two summers of record delays and flight cancellations by the major airlines and perception of complacency by airlines concerning customer discontent have led to variety of proposed remedies to consume r complaints related to delays cancellations lost or misrouted baggage partial ticket use and the provision of complete fare information for 2001 delays cancellations and consumer complaints have all declined from the high levels of 1999 and 2000 it remains to be seen however if this improvement will be enough to forestall the momentum toward legislative remedies in the 107th congress1 this report examines legislation pertaining to airline consumer protection in the 107th congress for background it first summarizes legislation proposed in the 106th congress and the

legislative remedies proposed in the 107th congress finally sidebyside presentation of provisions from six airline passenger rights bills is set forth background airline consumer rights legislation in the 106th congress early in the 106th congress number of bills referred to collectively in the press as airline passenger bill of rights legislation were introduced in bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30940crs2 2for detailed examination of passenger rights bills in the 106th congress see airline passenger rights legislation in the 106th congress by robert s kirk crs

passenger fairness act washington march 11 1999 6 p the house and senat e2 their introduction followed close on the heels of major airline consumer event just days before the 106th congress first met powerful storm swept across the upper midwest dropping nearly foot of snow on the detroit metropolitanwayne county airport in the high winds and low temperatures that followed the snowfall nearly 50 aircraft loaded with passengers were trapped on the airport s taxiways and aprons some of the flights were not allowed to deplane for over seven hours and as the time wore on some aircraft ran out of food water and functioning toilets the extreme nature of the detroit incident the seeming complacency of the initial airline response and wide press coverage helped increase public attention to already growing airline passenger discontent with airline customer service and business practices the bills introduced in the 106th congress included variety of legislative remedies as well as range of enforcement mechanisms and penalties all the bills required prompt announcement and truthful disclosure of any flight delays cancellations or diversions about half of the bills required full access to fare information regardless of the technology or method of access eg via telephone or internet other consumer rights provisions addressed in two or more bills included partial ticket use the right of access to services and the right to deplane from delayed aircraft restrictions on federal preemption of state consumer protection laws and number of provisions of benefit to travel agents about half of the bills provided for fines for violation of the acts provisions or set airline financial liability for each passenger subject to non safety delay or cancellation other bills would have made violation of certain provisions subject to existing dot enforcement procedures as unfair or deceptive practices and unfair methods of competition under 49 usc 41712 none of these freestanding passenger rights bills were enacted the air carriers response the air transport association ata which represents the major air carriers responded to these passenger rights bills in several ways3 in testimony before the senate commerce committee on march 11 1999 ata president carol hallett said that the airlines would accept responsibility for the service failures that are within their control she also however pointed to severe weather and air traffic control as the two main causes of delay the most common customer complaint she charged that 65 of delays were attributable directly to the atc air traffic control system finally the ata argued that legislation to improve customer treatment was unnecessary because the air carriers were voluntarily making changes that would improve their customer service httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30940crs3 the ata airline customer service commitment on june 17 1999 the ata announced that each of the major air carriers would develop voluntary customer service plans guided by twelve part airline customer service commitment in their service commitments the ata carriers claim they will offer the lowest fare available from the airlines telephone reservation system notify customers of known delays cancellations and diversions provide ontime baggage delivery return misdirected bags within 24 hours support an increase in the lost baggage liability limit allow reservations to be held or canceled for 24 hours provide prompt refunds 7 day credit card 20 days for cash properly accommodate disabled and special needs passengers meet customers essential needs during long onaircraft delays handle bumped passengers with fairness and consistency disclose travel itinerary cancellation policies frequent flyer rules and aircraft configuration ensure good customer service from codeshare partners be more responsive to customer complaints an ata transmittal letter to the senate commerce committee stated that its view was that only voluntary commitment from the industry could improve customer service without unintended and costly consequences the reemergence of airline passenger rights issues after the release of the ata voluntary plan many thought airline passenger rights would not be an issue for the rest of the first session however although some members of congress supported giving the ata plan chance others voiced skepticism of the likely effectiveness of voluntary industry commitments in the waning days of the first session of the 106th congress during floor debate in the senate both on the dot fy2000 appropriations bill and the faa reauthorization bill airline passenger protection issues reemerged in the form of multiple amendments to the two bills the wendell h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century pl 106181 air21 and the fy2000 dot appropriations act pl 10669 included provisions that both altered some consumer protection provisions of title 49 and also included provisions that called for investigatory studies by the dot inspector general ig and the general accounting office gao the changes to the aviation consumer protection statutes were few in number and included raising the maximum penalty for violating the passenger consumer protection provisions to 2500 ordering dot to raise the maximum liability for lost luggage and making the failure of an air carrier or ticket agent to notify purchaser of an eticket of its expiration date an unfair or deceptive practice more significant for the 107th congress are the investigatory studies especially the one that required the ig to monitor the implementation of any of the voluntary airline customer service plans submitted to dot by the air carriers for this study the ig was required to report on the effectiveness of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30940crs4 4department of transportat ion office of the inspector general final report on the airline customer service commitment washington the office 127 p internet address httpwwwoigdotgovauditsav2001020htmcustomer service plans and to make recommendations for improving accountability enforcement and consumer protections for airline passengers there was further legislat ive action in the 106th congress most members of congress were willing to wait and see what the igs final report concluded and recommended some would argue that the atas strategy had successfully forestalled passage of an airline passenger rights bill in the 106th congress on the other hand the congressionally mandated studies of the air carriers implementat ion of their customer service plans and other business practices insured that the airline passenger rights issue would remain alive into the 107th congress the igs report on the airline customer commitment on february 13 2001 the dot office of the inspector general ig released its final report analyzing the progress made by the airlines under their voluntary customer service commitment4 the ig report concluded that althoug h progress had been made there were still significant shortfalls especially in provisions that trigger when there is flight delay or cancellation these provisions include keeping customers informed of delays and cancellation s and also meeting customers essential needs during extended onaircraft delays the report also found need for improvement in regard to the provision for fairness and consistency in bumping practices on flights that are oversold the ig concluded that the policies for accommodating passengers delayed overnight were often inconsistent with the service commitment or the airlines contracts of carriage on the positive side the report found that in general the airlines were complying with the commitment to offer the lowest fare to provide prompt ticket refunds to be more responsive to customer complaints and to support higher payout for lost baggage the report however pointed out that the service commitments did nothing to address the underlying problem of delays and cancellations the ig recommended that the customer service commitments be made enforce able either by requiring their inclusion in the airlines contracts of carriage or by regulation commitment be added to establish quality assurance and performance measurement system and to audit compliance with the commitment the resources allocated to the dot division responsible for consumer protection be significantly increasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30940crs5 at the time of booking and without being asked the prior months ontime performance rate for consistently delayed andor cancelled flights be disclosed to consumers airlines clarify in their customer service plans what is meant by an extended period of time and emergency so passengers know what to expect the airlines should also ensure that comprehensive customer service contingency plans specify the efforts that will be made to get passengers off the aircraft when delayed for extended periods dot should establish standard checkin time and disclose it on the ticket jacket assure that all bumped volunteers are equally compensated increase compens ation to bumped passengers and disclose orally to passengers that involuntarily bumped passengers must be compensated in advance of payments being offered to volunteers uniform system for tracking delays cancellations and their causes be established and implemented capacity benchmarks for the nations top 30 airports be established to provide common framework for understanding what maximum arrival and departure rate can physically be accommodated by an airport by time of day under optimum conditions by early june 2001 14 ata member airlines had voluntarily incorporated the ata custome r service commitments into their contracts of carriage critics however argue that the vagueness of the language of the commitments limits the importance of their inclusion in the contracts of carriage for consumers proposed legislative remedies of the 107th congress mos t of the passenger rights bills introduced in the 107th congress are influenced by legislation introduced in the 106th congress or by the findings of the dot ig or both four of the bills s 200 the air travelers fair treatment act senator reid hr 332 the aviation consumer right to know act representatives defazio and slaughter hr 384 the airline passenger fair treatment act representatives sweeny and hr 907 the airline competition and passenger rights act representative dingell all reviv ed numerous provisions from legislation first introduced in the 106th congress following release of the ig report on the airlines customer service performance two new bills s 319 the airline customer service improvement act senators mccain hollings hutchison and s 483 the fair treatment of airline passengers act senator wyden were introduced these bills include provisions to make the voluntary service commitments enforceable they also include provisions that would implement many of the igs other recommendations during senate committee on commerce science and transportation markup significant number of provisions from s 483 were added by amendment in the nature of substitute to s 319 which was reported on march 15 2001 with senator wyden becoming the fourth sponsor in early may representatives sweeny andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30940crs6 5from here on in the text hr 384 because virtually all of its provisions were incorporated in hr 1734 will not be mentioned 6the sidebyside includes hr 1734 s 200 s 332 hr 907 s 483 and s 319 hr 571 the airline customer right to know act representative bilirakus hr 711 to clarify that state attorneys general may enforce state consumer protection laws with respect to air transportation representatives trancredo and schaffer and s 633 the aviation delay prevention act senators hutchison and rockefeller are discussed in the textdingell combined many or the provisions of their two bills hr 384 and hr 907 and introduced hr 1734 the airline passenger bill of rights act5 although there are significant differences in provisions of the airline passenger consumer rights bills introduced in the 107th congress it is possible to place many of the provisions into comparable issue categories this section describes these provisions in general way and does not include provisions that are unique to one bill for detail on six individual bills see the sidebyside comparison that is set forth in the table at the end of this report6 access to all fares about half of the bills introduced would require air carriers to make available to customers information on all fares charged by an airline regardless of the technology or means used to access the information the heart of this issue is the lowest fare available debate under this provision for example if someone contacts an air carrier by telephone the air carriers agent would have to notify the customer if there were cheaper fare being offered via internet or through travel agencies two of the bills s 319 and s 483 would simply require the airline s to notify customers that cheaper fairs may be available through other distribution systems access to services and the right to deplane from delayed aircraft during emergencies three bills hr 1734 s 200 and hr 907 included language that would have limited to one hour the length of time airlines can require passengers to stay aboard an aircraft during grounddelayed departures or arrivals at an airport hr 907 also requires dot to issue regulations that require air carriers ensure access to necessary services and conditions including food water restroom facilities and also provide for an ability to deplane in the event of weather or other emergency s 319 hr 1734 and hr 907 require air carriers to ensure that comprehensive emergency plans are maintained and coordinated with local airport authorities and the faa baggage handling s 319 and s 483 would both require more detailed and accurate information on mishandled baggage s 319 would require luggage tracking system be established and toll free telephone number passengers can call tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30940crs7 check on the status of their delayed luggage it also requires that passengers who do not check luggage not be counted when calculating the rate of mishandled luggage s 483 sets forth specific statistical categories that must be reported and requires air carriers to establish performance goals aimed at reducing the incidence of mishandled baggage bumping and overbooking s 319 and s 483 have similar provisions that require dot to establish uniform checkin deadline and require airlines to disclose it on their ticket jackets notification that involuntarily bumped passengers must be offered compensation before any offers are made to volunteers s 483 also requires that air carriers on request tell passenger whether flight is oversold hr 1734 and hr 907 would also push the boarding deadline right up to the time that the aircrafts door is closed delays cancellations and diversions virtually all the bills introduced include provisions that require prompt notification and truthful explanation of any flight delays cancellations or diversions chronically delayed or cancelled flights four bills s 319 s 483 hr 1734 and hr 907 include provisions that require air carriers to disclose without being asked to customers when they are making reservation or purchasing ticket the ontime performan ce and cancellation rate for any chronicallydelayed or cancelled flights hr 1734 and hr 907 would make failure to make such disclosure an unfair or deceptive practi ce and unfair method of competition s 319 would require that dot include table in the air travel consumer report that shows for the most recent three month period flight numbers of flights delayed by 15 minutes or more 40 of the time or more and flights canceled 30 of the time or more information system provisions four bills s 319 s 483 hr 1734 and hr 907 also include variety of information system requirements including setting up notification system that would notify passengers before they leave for the airport that their flight will be cancelled or delayed these three bills also require that air carriers coordinate with airport officials to assure that master airport flight display monitors contain uptodate flight information and are consistent with their own monitors another provision in s 319 and s 483 would require air carriers to post the ontime performance for each scheduled flight for the previous month on their web sites enforcement provisions airline passenger rights legislation introduced in the 107th congress includes variety of approaches to enforcement s 319 and s 483 both contain provisions that would implement number of the ig recommendations regarding enforcement these bills would require the major air carriers to writehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30940crs8 7some of the enforcement provisions refer to the air carrier contract of carriage when passenger purchases ticket from an airline the passengers rights and respon sibilities as well as the limits of the air carriers responsibilities and liabilities are set forth in contract of carriage coc on the back of the ticket in the ticket jacket or on the ticket jacket itself is summary of selected provis ions of the coc and reference to the full text as mentioned in the text by writing the customer commitments into their cocs the air carriers could be held liable under contract law for violating their commitments some airlines have made the full text of their cocs available on their internet web sites others still require that request be made to their customer service departments 8some would argue that failure of the airlines to fulfill the ata customer commitments could be considered deceptive trade practice and could therefore lead to enforcement actions by the counsel for aviation enforcement and proceedings 9as reported in the igs final report the office staff is half as large as it was in 1985 when the offic had staff of 40 the decline in staffing has continued even as consumer complaints received by the office have gone from 6026 in 1995to 23381 in 2000 in 2000 the office had staff of 17 five new positions were authorized for fy2001 air21 also added other responsibilities to be carried out by the office includi ng provision requiring comprehensive investigation of each disabilityrelated complaint there were 595 in cy1999 and 676 in cy2000 extension of the disabled passenger discrimination law to international flights and variety of data collection and reporting requirements the housepassed fy2002 appropriations bill hr 2299 provides for 9 of the 20 new staff requested by dot the senatepassed bill s 2278 fully funds the requesttheir customer service plans into their contracts of carriage thus making the provisions enforceable in court under contract law as mentioned earlier in early june 14 of the ata airlines announced that they had voluntarily incorporated the customer service commitments into their contracts of carriage7 s 319 in addition requires that dot monitor compliance to provisions of the bill and to take enforcement actions as necessary the agency is to monitor customer service quality assurance and performance measurement systems and review the airlines internal audits s 319 and s 483 would also amend 49 us c section 46301 to extend the 2500 per occurrence penalty to violations of any of the bills provisions the other bills rely on existing enforcement mechanisms or expanding the coverage of existing law under 49 us c 41712 relating to unfair or deceptive trade practices or unfair methods of competition8 finally these bills call for dot to increase resources for the airline passenger consumer protection activities of the department both the monitoring requirements and the expanded section 41712 practices would be the responsibility of the dot assistant general counsel for aviation enforcement and proceedings at this writing this office has staff of 22 including 8 attorneys and 9 transportation industry and consumer analysts some argue that the proposed enforcement provisions could overwhelm the assistant general counsels staff9 air21 authorized significant increase in funding but appropriations for this activity have been significantly below the authorized levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30940crs9 10 preemption is the doctrine adopted by us supreme court based on the us constitutions supremacy clause holding that certain matters are of such national as opposed to local character that federal laws preempt or take precedence over state laws as such state may not pass law inconsistent with the federal law blacks law dictionary st paul minnesota 1990 p 1177 see also state and local sanctions some constitutional issues by jean j grimmett crs report 98795 asome of the bills would increase the airline liability for specific violations for example s 319 s 483 and hr 907 all would modify bumping regulations to increase the maximum compensation amount hr 907 includes unique airline liability provision the bill would set the airline liability for delay of between two and three hours at 200 of the price paid for ticket on the delayed flight and another 100 for each additional hour or portion of an hour above three hours delay delays caused by certain air traffic control directives mechanical and other safety concerns are exempted federal preemption of state consumer law six bills include provision designed to narrow the scope of federal preemption of the application of state consumer protecti on laws to air transportation10 the intent of these provisions is to allow state and local officials to enfo rce state consumer protection laws with respect to air transportation and the advertisement of air transportation services one of the bills hr 711representatives tancredo schaffer presents this provision as standalone bill partial ticket use four bills hr 1734 hr 332 hr 1074 and hr 907 include provisions that would prevent air carriers from assessing fee against or prohibiting ticket holder from using only part of ticket this would shield consumers who use backtoback round trip ticketing or hidden city ticketing backtoback ticketing generally refers to purchasing two round trip discount tickets but only using one way on each ticket usually to avoid the weekend stayover requirements hidden city ticketing refers to passenger who wishes to fly to hub destination but buys cheaper ticket to city served through the hub the passenger simply gets off the plane at the hub airport and does not use the ticket for the final leg of the flight airlines argue that they must be allowed when passenger does not show up for trip segment to cancel any remain ing trip segments otherwise they argue especially when demand is high they could deny passenger reservation when an empty seat actually exists air21 included provision that required the general accounting office gao to study the potential impacts of legalization of partial ticket use the study released at the end of july 2001 concludes that restricting the ability of airlines to forbid hiddencity and backtoback ticketing is unlikely to help consumersand would likely have unintended consequences that could hurt some consumers nevertheless consumer advocates and passengers havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30940crs10 11general accounting office aviation competition restricting airline ticketing rules unlikely to help consumers gao01831 july 31 2001 washington gao 2001 p 4445legitimate concerns that some fares are higher than what might be expected in more competitive market11 travel agent provisions three bills hr 1734 s 200 and hr 907 include provisions that could be seen as benefitting travel agents their provisions require that air carriers provide 90 days notice to ticket agent if the carrier wishes to cancel terminate or not renew the agents appointment as carrier agent it would give the agent 60 days to correct any deficiency identified by the air carrier as reason for ending the agents appointment other legislation the airline customer notification act hr 571 the airline customer notification act representative bilirakis amends the consumer protection provisions of title 49 of the us code its provisions require air carriers to announce the reason or reasons for delay of two or more hours or cancellation of flight the diversion of flight to another airport one hour delay of deplaning after touchdown and in the case of delay the expected length of the delay passengers may request the reason or reasons in writing the passengers right to notification must be posted at the gate or ticket counter finally the bill includes prohibition on false or misleading explanations because of hr 571s conciseness it is not included in the sidebyside consumerfrien dly airline ticket transfer act hr 1074 the consumerfriendly airline ticket transfer act representative gibbons requires dot to issue regulations within 90 days of enactment that require air carriers to make paper tickets for intrastate or interstate air transportation transferrable at cost also within 90 days dot is to make recommendations to congress relating to the transfer of electronic tickets as mentioned earlier hr 1074 also includes provisions to prevent air carriers from prohibiting or assessing fee for partial ticket use the aviation delay prevention act s 633 the aviation delay prevention act senators hutchison and rockefeller was proposed as an amendment to s 319 but was withdrawn during markup andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30940crs11 was later introduced as standalone bill the intent of the bill was to provide some near term relief to airport congestion and delay by spreading out peak hour schedules and also accelerating capacityenhancing airport project s as introduced s 633 had three main provisions first it called for review of and repo rt on air carrier overscheduling at large hub airports an analysis of the congestion mitigation authority of dot and recommendations for increasing dots authority second the bill would have provided air carriers with limited exemption from the antitrust laws allowing them to discuss in the presence of dot representative cooperative scheduling arrangements to reduce over scheduling third the bill called for dot to implement an expedited coordinated environmental and judicial review process done concurrently not consecutively for airport capacityenhancement projects in committee an amendment in the nature of substitute significantly altered the text and scope of s 633 the senate commerce committee version of the bill shifts the initiative for action from the airlines to the dot and also adds number new provisions the bill as reported requires that within one year of enactment and for each of the next five years dot must complete review and report on air carrier overscheduling and scheduling practi ces including flight cancellations for economic reasons at large hub airports and must include an analysis of the congestion mitigation authority of the secretary and make recommendations for providing additional authority the bill provides that the secretary of dot may request that air carriers meet with the administ rator of the faa to discuss flight reductions at severely congested airports the bill provides for shortterm stormy weather agreement limited antitrust exemptions for airlines to meet to discuss schedules the secretary of dot is to identify airportsfrom among those included in the airport capacity benchmark reportwhere delays occur that significantly affect the national airport and airway system if any of those identified airports have plans in place to increase airport capacity dot is to create task force to conduct capacity enhancement studies these airports any airport for which capacity enhancement study recommends building new runway or reconfiguring its existing runways becomes national capacity project dot is required to complete an environmental review within five years and expedite funding for the project airports not following through with the recommended capacity expansion can loose funding for noncapacity projects as well as loss of passenger facility charge revenues the bill includes five year pilot program that would allow airport sponsors to pay for additional environmental specialists and attorneys from outside the us government to assist in providing an appropriate level of planning and environmental review of runway development projects for designated national capacity projects the pfc eligibility for gate related airport improvements is expanded and aip funds would be available for construction of air traffic control towers the bill would raise the noise setaside for aip discretionary funds to 35 this provision also appears to make national capac ity projects eligible for aip noise mitigation funds without having to meet the requirement of having an faa approved part 150 noise mitigation plan dot is also directed to provide list of categorical exclusions currently recognized and list of additional proposed categorical exclusions under the national environmental policy act of 1969httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30940crs12 the airline passenger treatment bill hr 1407 as reported h rept 10777 part 2 the airline passenger treatment act representative young allows air carriers at an airport to file request with the attorney general ag for autho rity to discuss with one or more other air carriers agreements or cooperative arrangements relating to limiting flights at an airport during time period that the ag determines that scheduled flights exceed the capacity of the airport the purpose of the meeting is to discuss reducing delays during that time period the bill would allow for limited antitrust exemption the ag must however find that the voluntary adjustments could lead to substantial reduction in travel delays and impr oved service without substantially lessening competition or tending to create monopoly three days notice must be given to all carriers providing service or seeking to provide service at the airport under discussion the ag or hisher representative will attend and monitor the meeting unanimous agreement of the carriers at the airport is required participants may not discuss rates fares charges inflight service or service to any
