appropriations bills are considered by the house of representatives under the terms of an open rule reported by the house committee on rules and adopted by the house or under terms similar to an open rule1 this means that when the bill is brought to the house floor the number of amendments that can be offered to it and the debate on those amendments are largely unrestricted in the last decade however the house has moved away from this pure open rule tradition and begun to adopt unanimous consent uc agreemen ts that comprehensively regulate thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22711crs2 2 data from the legislative information system lis of the us congress two other regular 110th congress appropriations bills hr 2642 and hr 3222 the fy08 military construction and defense appropriations measures respec tively had open rules reported for their consideration but were brought up under the terms of such negotiated comprehensive uc agreement and the special rules were neve r considered hr 3161 the fy08 agriculture appropriations bill was also brought to the hous floor under an open rule after the house was unable to negotiate comprehensive uc agreem ent structuring its further consideration the committee on rules reported second structured rule which was adopted by the house consideration of regular appropriations bills shortly after an open rule brings them to the floor when considering spending bill under an open rule the legislation is read by paragraph in the committee of the whole members are free to propose amendments to each pending paragraph so long as their ame ndments comply with the chambers standing rules any first degree amendment offered unde r an open rule is itself subject to further amendment and debate is rgely unrestricted by offering pro forma amendment to strike the last word each member may gain five minutes to speak on each pending paragraph of the bill or amendments to it although consideration of re gular appropriations bills under an open rule provides forum that maximizes deliberation it also means that the time spent considering such measures is uncertain and open to wide vari ation time spent on floor consideration of given spending bill will depend on how many amendments are offered and how long members choose to engage in debate to provide scheduling predictability and to facilitate progress in busy chamber it has become common for the house following period of initial consideration of regular appropriations bill under an open rule to adopt uc agreement negotiated by the appropriations committee party leaders and interested members that comprehensively regulates further debate and am endment of the legislation such uc agreements supplant the open rule limit the amendments that may be offered to finite list restrict

2008 only one regular appr opriations bill was considered on the house floor and comprehensive uc agreement was entered into during its consideration in 2007 however eight regular appropriations bills that came to the house floor under an open rule were subsequently regulated by such uc agreement2 in 2006 seven of nine regular appropriations bills considered under an open rule were subs equently

house washington gpo 2003 ch 54 2 p 882 5 unanimous consent agreements of this type mu st be propounded orally in the house not in the committee of the whole and are published in the congressional recordthe time between the adoption of an open sp ecial rule for regular appropriation bill and its being supplanted by comprehensiv uc agreement is often short in most cases both occur on the same day in fact party leaders often notify members of their intention to craft such uc agreement even before bill comes to the house floor3 uc agreements vs stru ctured special rules unanimous consent agreements regulating the further consideration of regular appropriation bills limit the universe of possible amendments as well as the time for considering those amendments in this way such uc agreements act in manner similar to structured special rule albeit with an important difference every member can have say in the content of uc agreement and in real sense dictat its terms under an announced policy that is generally strictly adhered to the speaker will not normally recognize member to propound such unan imous consent request unless that request has been cleared in advance by the bipartisan floor and committee leadership4 structured special rules by contrast are privileged fo r consideration and adopted at the will of majority of the house in short such uc agreements are largely accepted and presumably increasingly common because they provide all parties with something they want party leaders get increased certainty about the floor schedul the appropriations committee is able to move its bills forward more readily and members are permitted to offer the amendments of their choice features of appropriations uc agreements unanimous consent agreements regulating the further consideration of regular appropriations bills in the house have several common features that differ significantly in effect from consider ation under an open rule5 such uc agreements routinely limit the amendments that can be offered to those listed in the unanimous consent agreement by spons or and subject or by amendment number occasionally uc agreement will give the majority bill manager blanket authority to offer am endments on the subject of fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22711crs4 6 congressional record daily edition vol 153 july 26 2007 p h8639 7 congressional record daily

paragra ph of the bill so long as those amendments comply with house rules and practice in addition members are not required to give notice of their amendments under an open rule specify that each amendment may be offered only by the named member or the members designee and t hat those amendments shall be considered as read7 by contrast under an open rule any member might conceivably offer any amendment or dinarily amendments that have not been preprinted in the congressional record must be read aloud unless their reading is waived by unanimous consent forbid division of an amendment in the house or committee of the whole8 ordinarily as matter of ri ght any member may demand that an amendment be divided and its pieces voted on separately if the amendment consists of two or more separate substa ntiative provisions bar seconddegree amendments to the amendments9 under an open rule when an amendment is offered as many as three other amendments may then be offered an amendment to the amendment substitute for it and an amendment to the substitute permit one pro forma amendment ffered by each of the chair and ranking member of the appropriations committee and the appropriations subcommittee on each am endment specify that only the chair and ranking member of the co mmittee on appropriations or their designees may offer pro forma amendm ents at any point in the reading of the bill10 under an open rule each member not just the floor managers would be able to strike th last word to obtain five minutes to debate each amendment as s been noted under an open rule each member may offer pro forma ame ndment on the pending paragraph of the bill during its reading structuring the uc agreement in this way puts control of debate time almost exclusively in the hands of committee leaders instead of rankandfile members specify the time for debate on each amendment often 10 minutes equallydivided between pr oponent and an opponent although longer periods may be specified11 under an open rule the proponent and opponent of an amendment each have right to five minutes of time andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22711crs5 12 congressional record daily edition vol 153 june 14 2007 p h6411

considered to fit the description stated in this uc agr eement if it addresses in whole or in part the object described12 normally in the committee of the whole member would need unanimous consent to modify his or her amendment under structured special rule such modifications would not be in order at all this nguage of the uc agreement allows members to freely negotiate changes in given amendment as long as it addresses the subject contemplated fostering progress on the bill in order to further expedite consider ation such uc agreements sometimes grant the bill manager blanket authority to package amendments on the list bloc in these instances it is common for the agreement to permit members to insert remarks on their amendments in the congressional record other provisions although less common such uc agreements sometimes waive points of order ag ainst amendments or deem certain amendments to be automatically adopted13 procedural events not cove red by such uc agreements it should be noted that unanimous consen t agreements of this type do not provide complete certainty of how long floor consider ation of given spending measure will last because they do not regulate time spent on every procedural step that may occur including voting on the amendments themselves the bill managers striking the last word and yielding to other members for deba any separate votes requested after the committee of the whole rises and reports the bill back to the house consideration and voting on the motion to recommit voting on final passage and any general slippage of time other procedural events including but not limited to points of order appeals quorum calls and motions to rise might also extend floor considerati on of given regular appropriations measure and also might add some uncertainty to the proceedings
