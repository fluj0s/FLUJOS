mortgage purchases are subject to the conforming loan limit which is 417000 in most states for 2007 for singleunit houses and is adjusted annually9 the enterprises have limited authority to undert ake other activities the economic stimulus act of 2008 tempor arily increased the conforming loan limit in high cost areas to maximum of 72975010 the limit for any area would be the greater of 1 the 2008

urban development hud 30 days to calculate the new limits the increase expires december 31 2008 the enterprises finance the purchase of mortgages in two ways first they may be held in portfolio and financed by the sale of ordinary bonds and other debt this strategy generally earns high profits because of the spread between the rates earned on longterm mortgages and the relatively low cost of shorterterm borrowing financing in this manner creates risk however because if market interest rates rise significantly borrowing costs can rise nough to reduce yields from the mortgages whose rates generally do not rise or are adjusted more slowly the second way the enterprises fina nce the purchase of mortgages is securitization this is done by pooling s imilar mortgages together with and reselling them as securities backed by the entir pool to investors mortgagebacked securitization earns smaller but more constant profit from the differential between the yield on mortgages in the pool and the payout to investors in the securities historical development prior to the development of the seconda ry mortgage market mortgage markets were local and there were significant differences across the nation in mortgage rates and serious fluctuations in lending activity primary lenders had to balance their lending practices with their deposits received which led to severe credit shortages during economic downturns when savings accounts were depleted by withdrawals11 this shortage was exacerbated due to the concentration of major money centers

from these areas where mortgage money was available to other areas such as california where it was in relatively short supply in effect this amounted to geographic barrier that pr evented the law of supply and demand from operating on national level in the home loan market12 the secondary mortgage market combined these many regional mortgage markets into single national market that draws financing from around the world to encourage improvement in housing st andards and conditi ons and to provide system of mutual mortgage insurance congress enacted the national housing act in 193413 title iii of the national housing act established national mortgage associations giving rise to the creation of fannie mae in its original form fannie mae was federal government agency th at was chartered to support government backed mortgages and carry out some government subsidy functions in 1954 congress rechartered fannie mae as mixed government and private sector entity with clearly delineated separation betw een its marketoriented ie secondary mortgage trading and governmental i special assistance and managing and liquidating governmentheld mortgages functions14 in 1968 congress split the firm into two distinct organizations with the secondary market arm retaining the fannie mae name and the government functions ar m taking the name ginnie mae short for the government national mortgage association15 the partitioning legislation re chartered fannie mae as gse to become completely privately owned with federal funding fannie mae co mpleted this transition in 1970 in 1970 congress enacted the emergency home finance act16 which authorized fannie mae to buy conventiona l mortgages fannie mae bought most of the mortgages from mortgage bankers savi ngs and loans the other major source of mortgage money were restricted to holdi ng mortgages and were generally unable to work with fannie mae to facilitate s econdary market trading of conventional mortgages for savings and loan associations the act created freddie mac as wholly owned subsidiary of the federal home loan bank system fhlbs in 1989 congress rechartered freddie mac so that its shares could trade on the new york stock exchange in the same manner as fannie maes17 the 1989 act also did away with the separate missions of fannie mae and freddie mac with the result that today the two enterprises

reform frequently asked questions by n eric weissgse privileges to help fannie mae and freddie mac accomplish their public policy missions congress granted each of the enterprises certain benefits not available to other private financial institutions for example the limitations and restrictions concerning dealing in underwriting and purchasing investment securities for its own account by national banking association do not apply to the enterprises18 perhaps the biggest advantage that fannie mae and freddie mac enjoy over other private companies is the presumption on the part of investors that were the enterprises to fall into dire financial straits the government would bail them out19 this presumption of an implied federal guarantee allows many market advantages including the ability to obtain capital for their operations at near governmental interest rates critics argue that this implied guarantee lends to the enterprises such an advantage that it effectively squeezes out serious competition in the housing market20 regulation given the ambiguous relationship that ex ists between the enterprises and the federal government congress has long been concerned about the adequacy of gse regulation so that fannie mae and freddie mac can meet their public policy missions and not pose risks to taxpayers in this regard congress enacted the federal housing enterprises financial safe ty and soundness act of 199221 the act splits the oversight functions of mission from sa fety and soundness between two primary regulators 1 the department of hous ing and urban devel opment hud and 2 the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo an independent entity within hud22 hud is responsible for mission regula tion and general policy oversight of fannie mae and freddie mac in
