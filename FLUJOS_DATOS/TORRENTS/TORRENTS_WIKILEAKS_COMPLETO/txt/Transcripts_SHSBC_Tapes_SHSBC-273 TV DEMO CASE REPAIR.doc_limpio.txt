tv demo case repair an auditing demonstration given on 27 february 1963 here we are with demonstration and were going to give an auditing demonstration here tonight that i hope you will appreciate but of course were auditing the television station general manager electronics expert and janitor and so therefore whatever happens here on tv that seems little bit peculiar to you why you will know why lrh all right have seat reg and lets see this meter all right now reg the subject of this activity here is totally involved with doing case straightenup pc all right lrh the only thing im going to do is just go over everything thats happened on your case here pc mmhm lrh and so forth okay you neednt pick up the cans yet unless youd feel more comfortable with them pc im happy lrh youre happy with them all right now if youll notice here weve got another area this is another camera down here and its flipped over so that weve got show your papers see pretty good huh reg is pretty good at this sort of thing of course hes not listening to this broadcast so its all right for to praise him i wouldnt dare do that to his face okay now mr williams youve been auditing reg here and the situation deteriorated into the finding of an item which didnt get found and didnt check out that is the case of noncheckedout item auditor right lrh there is lot of things im going to go into with relationship to this because theres lot of auditing been done here on the case since i last audited you and well see where we are just to give people an idea of how to check this back but also because im interested in where youve gotten to pc thank you lrh all right now our main work here starts in and what i want to do you very often by the way you know youll have to be youll have to be doing cases to which you have auditor so this is very easy tonight because i have mr williams here to interpret his own writing and few other things of that character now i left this case way back here on an item murderer right auditor right lrh and that fired very nicely and nice big rocket read on it and then oh oh oh oh i see some errors here now who or what would oppose murderer for completion then assess the questions would murderer oppose blank oppose murderer all right thats beside the point but we had this anyway and we were giving brief tiger first prepcheck on murderer and then on the goal to know we had here auditing sessionan auditing session of 3 october of last year and we see here that we had prepcheck on murder and so forth and then tiger drill buttons on 1 october hcob on the goal to know which was according to this firing well now did you see that tv demonstration auditor yes lrh yeah did you see the goal to know firing auditor yes few times i saw it fire lrh yeah all right thats where we went to now what happened here now we got into situation this is in way courtmartial auditor thank you lrh were not interested in courtmartialing you matter how richly deserved auditor thank you lrh all right so youre not up for anything here but ill show you how one of these things goes now lets just look forward here and see what happened and as we go over these lists and articles you picked up the case apparently on about the 22nd of october right auditor right lrh and weve got here this and that and the other thing and you did some tests for completeness now heres represent on murderer hahahaha thats the first thing i saw hohohoho of course thats representation of rock slamming item auditor mmm lrh so thats what happened to its read auditor yeah lrh right what does murderer represent to you and of course that went noplace and any item you would have gotten off of that one wow man auditor thats right item on that lrh well there wouldnt have been so thats what happened to murderer as an item and then we went into prehav level dislocate and i dont know if there was an item here or not auditor i got ticking item i remember lrh yeah auditor i used it as as list one lrh yeah then you eventually did something with this list up here someplace where are we at here tiger drill and we went up here to dislocate probably wrong now we went to we found something bad manager how well did that rs do you remember auditor that i think bad manager came off the dislocate list lrh oh it did huh auditor and we we really treat that as represent this was that experimental rundown lrh oh all right well neglect it well neglect that lets look forward here now dont worry about it huh i see auditor now heres some more work on murderer lrh and heres some more work on murder this was murder now the original list was then extended auditor yes lrh the original what isnt part of existence was extended that was where murderer came from and of course its read was gone and we got out the end of the list now i dont see where that list is must be before that auditor that it there there lrh youve got missing list here someplace auditor not there lrh yeow there you are auditor there who or what wasnt part of existence lrh yeah and you got amurder is that right auditor there assessed item murderer lrh all right auditor and thats the continued list lrh and then you opposed murder auditor murderer lrh and uh auditor murder lrh yeah thats it and youwhat would murderer oppose auditor murderer oppose lrh and what would oppose murderer auditor that was test listing i test that was two headings test list lrh all right auditor and who or what would oppose murder was the lrh yeah that was your oppterm and you got down to that and you got something off of that auditor now thats got out of order lrh that doesnt matter were not much interested in it to tell you the truth auditor oh i know what happened ron i got the i made had two item package there and then lrh oh auditor then i checked an impostor then i went back later soon as the fouritem came out and i made four package out of it lrh oh all right all right and an impostor came up here your old friend auditor that was test listing to see if we could get anything on an impostor nothing lrh and there was nothing auditor lrh all right and we move on forward lot of stuff here of one kind or another im sorry to be knocking your items around pc thats all right ron lrh i saw right away that that wasnt quite all right and we found gentleman in this package pc mm lrh right auditor right lrh right and we got gentleman opposed and we got something on that and this moves on down and then we got uneducated people auditor society lrh and then you did life auditor society lrh society all right that gave you package so you finally had line plot of says here murder with terminal gentleman gentleman and society versus uneducated people thats fine and then life consists of and you found an item finding out all right thats fine and you did something with it what auditor who or what would finding out oppose lrh ah i dont see this list auditor it came up with it came up with sleeping lrh hm auditor and the item that opposed that was sleeping lrh oh all right all right gee thats long enough list there yes and you got that sleeping okay good enough now these lists are little bit in reverse here thats why were having hard time auditor oppose sleeping lrh and then oppose sleeping and you got what auditor uh selfish person lrh yeah well you should have line plot that gives those i point that out as somewhat negligent unless its in here someplace but that would be an earlier line plot auditor and i didnt take it any further than that in view of this note here i decided to go on to the goal lrh yes yes yes auditor it didnt seem to be getting anywhere well in other words i assumed that the goal getting the goal was more priority lrh yeah auditor than fiddling around with that little package lrh absolutely absolutely auditor so the next session i tried to complete that package and i took the goal to know lrh all right and it reacted every time once with an inch auditor half an inch lrh half an inch latent rr and you got sporadic rrs and then you listed who or what would the goal to know oppose well now of course goal that has been that left alone could be expected to be sporadic so that would be of criteria you go ahead and list it and test list it and see if you could get something out of it now you evidently got something out of it here what would the goal to know oppose and now were getting down to what is very very interesting to and i will simply bundle up these other papers and lay those aside thats all right and we will take look here at this situation now this is 22 february 63 is what we have brought this up to but we have goal here list what would who or what would the goal to know oppose and this came up with i think the item secrecy auditor yes lrh and acquainting ourselves with this situationand weve got secrecy and where is the check out slip item checked out by brian secrecy rr sometimes one inch sometimes half an inch sometimes quarter of an inch but nevertheless apparently it was an ri and it was firing now where did that occur on this list thats whats very important where did that occur on this list lets find out what this looked like auditor i think it was about page 6 yes page 6 lrh all right auditor thats the goal oppose list lrh thats correct and you had rrs on td and you had rrs on nulling huh auditor yes lrh all right now did you make test of this for term or oppterm auditor yes lrh and it was determined it was what here is oppose secrecy auditor well frankly i couldnt get good test out of it i couldnt be absolutely lrh oh there youre there youre right there in good company because none of these early goals give good test none of these items and you have to be very slippy about it and you have to test them very gently and this is too hard list for test list you actually mustnt test list 3m completely different than 212 mustnt test list it make up your mind now there are several things that can help you make up your mind thats all rightcan help you make up your mind several things but this you see as fourpage test list would be absolutely guaranteed to knock your frequency of the bank appetite over tin cup auditor hm lrh so that youd find yourself now having to extend the next list auditor ah lrh you get the idea auditor yeah yeah lrh so this is the kind of thing you want to look for so therethis would upsetthis would upset this list right here because itweve got who or what would oppose secrecy and weve got this and this and weve got this all on wrong way list if it is wrongway list but now lets take look at this list and see if we have an increasing incidence of rs pc doping off pulling missed withholds pc remarked cognitions on this and that like concerning his state now what kind of what kind of heres one of the ways to check this thing what kind of list do you make when you are doing an oppose list lets see this is who or what would oppose secrecy so we want what kind of list he does as terminal list dont we and the goal to know gives us terminal list and what the dickens sort of thing does he list off terminals list that is important this is an oppterm listthe goal to know opposethis is an oppterm list but heres ourheres our determination here and i already know this to be studying the case judge read those auditor judge an honest man truth seeker an investigator researcher straightforward man brave man an open man an open minded man man with an open mind cheat briberim sorry library scientology seeker after truth policeman the law courts courts of law and lrh i know this pc i know this pc and thats nice terminals list wheres the rrs auditor there arent any lrh whats this rr auditor its one rr lrh it says rs rs well its an interesting list but it didnt give any rrs is that what we assume auditor yeah lrh all right now we got that list which actually shouldnt have been done which occasionally you find yourself doing auditor may i have look at my my reports lrh theres your reports auditor yes thats the first list i did lrh secrecy auditor yes ifirst of all i tested it treating secrecy as an oppterm then when that didnt go so well i ran the other way lrh hmmm and how didnt it go so well what happened auditor well its just the the the nonappearance of lot of rrs in other words here that thats question mark rr theres two reads there i just didnt see because of the body motion on that one some surges here lrh mm auditor now actually theres just the one question mark rr there oh and theres question mark rr on page 1 and question mark rr on page 3 lrh an honest man huh auditor mm lrh all right got the pc right here pick up the cans would you ree is it all right with you if i make check on you pc yes lrh especially if i put the plug in all right now lets take look at this item here that was apparently the last something or other on this list and lets see what weve got okay this is not very important what were doing here but there was an item there so lets see if there wasnt anything about it pc mmhm lrh okay is it all right with you if i start short check pc sure lrh all right here it is start of check all right now we have an item an honest man all right now uhwhats this incipient rr pc oh iisorry i was ahead of you ron i was starting to see to see if there was any form of suppressions or something on here and uh lrh yes yes pc ii was just sort of lrh oh all right all right pc i was looking at the item incidentally lrh good good i probably added another suppression to it by doing that pc all right lrh all right here we go on the item an honest man has anything been suppressed pc well what i suppressed just then i just caught myself was that uh am i fighting honest men in other words is it is honest men an oppterm that was the thought that i had when you asked what was going on lrh oh all right thank you on the item an honest man has anything been suppressed pc okay theres something here um ive always strived so hard to be honest and its been so not so much out of i dont want to put halo up here but its more out of uh thats the only thing you dare to do is to be honest you see lrh all right okay pc like having good cheat sometimes but lrh all right on this item has anything been suppressed pc i dont get anything else right away ron lrh all right very good let check it on the meter on the item an honest man has anything been suppressed thats pretty hard to tell im going to ask that again its equivocal read on the item an honest man has anything been suppressed id say yes pc all im getting here is that im not 100 percent honest as i told you before when it comes to income tax lrh oh all right okay pc that suppresses an honest man if anything does lrh all right very good okay now on the item an honest man has anything been suppressed oh i cant make anything out of that particularly do you think thats flat pc i havent got any answer ron lrh very good on the item an honest man is there anything youve been careful of pc oh ive always been very very careful to be honest um if im being dishonest uh i have been very very careful to make sure i wouldnt get found out um very careful to be to give the impression of an honest man and uh im being very careful now not to give the impression that im dishonest man because im not really lrh all right okay pc that about covers it lrh all right very good on the item an honest man is there anything youve been careful of pc im always careful to prove that im an honest man to um um put my cards on the table all the time lrh okay good on the item an honest man is there anything youve been careful of pc i dont get anything else lrh very good ill check that on the meter on the item an honest man is there anything youve been careful of all right i dont think there was read on that on the item an honest man is there anything youve failed to reveal pc failed to reveal that i threw bit of paper away today that perhaps if i was 100 percent honest i wouldnt have done lrh all right on the item an honest man is there anything youve failed to reveal pc i dont um dont get anything else lrh all right very good ill check that on the meter on the item an honest man is there anything youve failed to reveal well thats not anything i can read offhand do you think thats flat pc i was just sitting here but iyes i think its flat i was just sitting here and this seems to be making feel very dishonest man for some reason lrh all right all right im sorry pc its all right lrh okay very good all right on the item an honest man has anything been invalidated get anything pc i didnt get anything right away lrh all right very good on the item an honest man has anything been suggested yes there is suggest on that pc ive always suggested that im an honest man and um i know i when i was very young i had the idea that it would be very nice to be to go down as an honest man and um i suggested it would be good idea to be very honest in business and so on which i have been like the only way to be lrh hm pc i overstepped the mark in that direction but sheer for profit i mean lrh all right okay on the item an honest man has anything been suggested i dont think there was read on that okay on the item an honest man has mistake been made yes theres apparently mistake there pc um that the only mistake i can get is something it might be that i sometimes get this tied up with man of integrity its very much the same thing but um well that would have described it better lrh hm all right on the item an honest man has mistake been made all right that would appear to be more or less it on the item an honest man has anything been protested i didnt see anything clearly read on protest on the item an honest man has anything been decided theres probably decide there this is all guess work on this meter by the way pc um well i probably deci i probably decided that as i go out so much for honesty that i must be basically dishonest its uh you see lrh all right good enough good enough you got that pc yes lrh all right on the item an honest man has anything been decided you think of another answer to that lot oflot of enturbulence to this meter pc um well it is the sort of thing that is said that you decide to be honest ive decided to be honest in future but uh i cant um ever recall that dishonesty well once as child i was dishonest and got caught out very badly thats right i stole some change thats from some shopping id done taking it or something like that lrh mm pc and uh got caught and was very badly punished but so i just sort of decided then that in future i should be honest lrh all right very good all right im going to read this item now an honest man an honest man an honest man well i would say offhand theres probably an rs under this someplace but that is definitely not the item okay you can put down the cans for moment pc yup lrh all right now lets cross that out as td dice and now lets take up the item itself secrecy and see what we get here although from the amount of jumping around here probably the wisest thing to do is take this goal to know and see if i can get fire out of that and then take up the item secrecy and then we will take up some of this material here toward the end of your list and we will check this secrecy oppose end of list okay and well see what we can find on there because there is something on that auditor hm lrh because i noticed you went page after page you see auditor interesting lrh its so clean see these additional pages are clean i maligned you you had completed the list so you can put it down in your diary ron maligned and admitted it in public auditor ill never be able to use that motivator again lrh yeah yeah pc its recorded auditor is it oh good lrh yeah all right the list is complete but somewhere before this list was ended you see an item has appeared its for sure the item is there somewhere and you will find because its an ri oppose list that the item undoubtedly will fall on the matter this is the wrong list undoubtedly will fall on the last thats oppose secrecy your test auditor thats secrecy oppose lrh yes and somewhere heretheres page 9 now theres apparently action clear on out to the end here you see to page 12 auditor but this is treating secrecy as the term here ron lrh yes auditor its all right is it lrh well quite whats the matter auditor weve just treated it thats yeah i see lrh that list is now scrubbed auditor right that says i was treating it as an oppterm lrh thats treating this list here were treating this list here as oppose secrecy and weve just found out it cant be an oppterm because we took your last reading item now if i wanted to be very very clever here and if i wanted to do exactly what i was teaching everybody to do i would take these whats that auditor microscope and that did rs so did that one rs lrh so we got microscope whats this next one mirror auditor mirror lrh and whats the item above this auditor thats cognitions yeah drawing lrh drawing auditor see that was after pc doping off pulling missed withholds lrh oh all right so i to some degree took that into effect so this couldnt be pullover auditor hm lrh see so wed have to go youre supposed to go above and below see all right pick up the cans would you reg and just let read these just see where we stand here see if we can get anything at all im just being supercareful now this is almost idiot carefulness in view of the fact you had cognitions just before this and this was your very next item pc mm lrh all right microscope tendency microscope mirror naw but if you look here look here old man microscope right here auditor hm lrh and did you see that thing rs auditor hm lrh small rs auditor see its marked rs there on the list lrh see auditor yeah lrh well i know but just because its marked on the list it shouldnt rs when its read back auditor not if youve got complete list lrh auditor not that i lrh so theres something awful wrong with this list auditor so its definitely incomplete lrh well it would be either incomplete or auditor wrong way to lrh or wrong way to and because it didnt rr anyplace and when you did it the other way to you did get rrs auditor yes lrh then we immediately assume that it was auditor the other way lrh other way even though we shouldnt have done this list in the first place see auditor yeah lrh we shouldnt have done this oppose secrecy list if we hadnt done it by the way youd only do this just few items at the top see auditor mm lrh your trick is look at the pc see is the pc getting any darker auditor mm lrh you know that kind of thing auditor mm lrh as list and i dont care if hes going off and talking and that sort of thing still look at the pc you can tell just after few items its that fast see you can tell all of this all right now were going to go into the goal here the goal to know and see if we can do anything about that reg pc all righty lrh is that all right with you pc mmhm lrh and were just going to drill that up and see what weve got here all right on the goal to know has anything been suppressed pc all the mistakes i make are suppressed hopes about the goal are suppressed um anything i dont know is obviously suppressed lrh all right pc mmhm lrh on the goal to know has anything been suppressed pc ive suppressed thoughts that maybe didnt read all that well lrh mm all right pc cant think of anything else on this lrh okay on the goal to know ill check it on the meter now on the goal to know has anything been suppressed oh i think theres another suppression there of some kind or other this meters little bit hard to read here tonight pc min i apologize lrh it isnt you it isnt you so much pc well whenever i dont let other people know things im suppressing the goal to know um and i had to suppress such things as i um its an overt not to know if um well for example if you want something and i should be one step ahead of you i should know its almost theetieweetie in reverse do you see lrh oh i see pc i should know and its i always feel guilty if somebody finds something before i do or anything like this it really is people might find this hard to believe but i feel that way that i ought to know first and um i ought to know so i suppress then i look at this analytically well it is damn silly hill to take you see be sensible but ive got to suppress this overt feeling im committing overts every time i dont really know if i dont know my data 100 percent you see its an overt if i make mistake its an overt and i feel this and yet i suppress it down because its uh analytically its so damn silly lrh all right okay ill check that on the meter on the goal to know has anything been suppressed i didnt see thing there all right on the goal to know is there anything youve been careful of pc im always very careful to try and to know and this does work in reverse that im also careful not to let people know uh on some things um in particular the wife and so on that ill be very very secretive about this there seems to be flip on it but its um this seems to work that i have to know myself but other people dont have to know i suppose its probably win if i know and somebody else doesnt and uh so im im careful when im keeping other people in the dark on anything lrh hm hm all right on the goal to know is there anything youve been careful of pc well ive been careful to look at this goal to see how it is affecting my life and to see uh try and see what sort of things its its doing and so on and work it out and be sensible about it lrh all right on the goal to know is there anything youve been careful of pc i cant think of anything lrh all right ill check that on the meter on the goal to know is there anything youve been careful of yes there is another one here pc well i was careful to um come into scientology thats what came up right away because uh this was right up my i didnt realize at the time but ive since realized it that uh scientology is the science of knowing how to know and so of course when i saw this this seemed terrific to and i didnt and i whenever i was running pe course this would be the sermon if you want to know anything boys you join scientology do you see and this was terrific entry point for and i was very careful to take it up lrh all right very good on the goal to know is there anything you have been careful of ah thats very equivocal let let ask you again here unless youve thought of something on the goal to know is there anything youve been careful of oh i wouldnt say there is read there on the goal to know is there anything youve failed to reveal pc um to other as far as other people are concerned ive failed to reveal as i was telling you earlier on um this hasnt come up lately but i have gone to great lengths to substitute knowuh with um ive always said well i dont know but i always know where to find out so thats uh i like notebooks and or notebooks and books of reference which i rarely go to but which i like to have there and i can always find out i always prize myself that ive got that far on knowing that i know where to find out lrh all right good on the goal to know is there anything you have failed to reveal pc i think thats about all lrh all right ill check that on the meter on the goal to know is there anything you have failed to reveal got another one here pc um well that i will institute lots of um mechanics in order to know that board for example in the office uh for students goals so that i know what theyre doing or we know what theyre doing um this tv setup that i skinner i i should know you see where to put the various things but i have to get skinner to label them all very carefully so that i can use all these aids to knowing lrh mm all right on the goal to know is there anything that you failed to reveal pc well this um this works out as far as um somebody elses goal is in direct opposition to mine or apparently is in direct opposition and ive never revealed it either to myself or to anybody else quite how this works out because its extraordinary somebody has the goal not to be found out you see and my goal is to know lrh uhhuh pc and this opposite seems to apply quite lot in cases and uh ive always sort of felt shy of even examining this in too much detail you know because it might reveal something so as far as revealing it to myself that are you are you with on this lrh yes yes i got it pc good lrh all right check that on the meter again on the goal to know is there anything youve failed to reveal i dont think that read did you think of another pc the only thing i thought generally was that uh anything i dont reveal of course is an overt act so i should confess and i mean uh uh as you know from experience i mean take that customs business i darent lrh oh yes pc come through with anything because i would give we were thinking it was on impostor at the time but it actually is on this goal to know do you see lrh oh all right pc because id give the game away i cant really feel its an overt not to reveal that i know it you see lrh oh yes all right on the goal to know is there anything youve failed to reveal boy there isthere is something there now now pc well what i just thought of then was now there is dirty trick i just i just committed an overt on you you see im getting you involved in the customs theyd think you and i are running terrific customs racket do you see lrh okay all right on the goal to know is there anything you have failed to reveal i didnt get read on that one pc lrh thats clean now all right on the goal to know has anything been invalidated looks clean to on the goal to know has anything been suggested id say so pc oh um what fin getting now is theres notknow and know and uh if is notknow is higher on the scale than know or to know and then know and um that thats actually suggestion to i havent got firm reality on it myself but i can see the sense of it but ii started to look at it again thats something that has been suggested to and i sort of accept it lrh mm mm pc before i can have goal to know i must obviously have had goal to notknow or something to that extent lrh all right on the goal to know has anything been suggested there is another suggest pc well i suggested the goal was mine when we were on tv um when you upstairs when we found this goal lrh uhhuh pc i suggested it lrh all right on the goal to know has anything been suggested all right i dont think that was one okay pc uhhuh lrh on the goal to know has mistake been made i didnt get one there on the goal to know is there anything you have been anxious about yeah i think so pc well im bit anxious about whether this goal is in or out and whether it is my goal i mean the usual anxiousness that goes on with goals i suppose lrh all right on the goal to know is there anything youve been anxious about id say yes theres another one pc well im forever anxious i mean this is terrible anxiety all my life on not if i dont know anything but uh and i can see that many time i got arc broken just because i dont know people come and ask question if i dont know the answer i often find that im getting arc broken with them because they and then i accuse them of running notknow on you see uh and this happens so anx i mean thats one long anxiety with this goal ron lrh all right on the goal to know is there anything you have been anxious about i think there is another one doesnt have to be but uh pc well i id have to dig for it i havent got anything lrh you dont think all right let test it again i might have slipped on that on the goal to know is there anything youve been anxious about yeah there is one there pc um lrh youd better dig pc right um lrh there pc ii know i was bit anxious when peter was checking it um out for the first time on this lrh uhhuh pc bless his heart theres probably and i put it there little doubt as to whether it was reading do you see lrh uhhuh pc it was equivocal or something like this and so ive probably been bit anxious whether it has been in fact goal that should be run yes i think so lrh very good all right on the goal to know is there anything youve been anxious about well i didnt get thing there okay pc uhhuh lrh all right this needles getting cleaner by the way pc good lrh on the goal to know has anything been protested i have protest here pc i protested um that it should be run i think when we were messing around with something else on the begin beginning of the intensive with uh with peter lrh uhhuh pc uh and ive been protesting to know is very difficult goal to carry around on your shoulder i cant get anything else lrh all right on the goal to know has anything been protested thats equivocal can you think of another one all right im going to ask that again on the goal to know has anything been protested id say theres another protest in there someplace pc um well i think it its this comes down to protesting about um people whove got goal not to be found out letting everybody know everything and ive got goal to know and being very quiet about it lrh all right good enough reg on the goal to know has anything been protested thats nice and clean okay pc uhhuh lrh on the goal to know has anything been decided ah yes pc well i decided it was my goal to know all along soon as we got tick on td i decided thats mine thats the lot im quite certain on that lrh all right all right on the goal to know has anything been decided theres another decide i think pc yes this quite likely this is on what iiyou once said to that i was great decider and or something along those lines and i often wondered i have since wondered whether cognitions quote cognitions ive had have in fact been decisions lrh oh yes pc such as uh decide that this is heavy goal and it must be very difficult to carry this goal around and then uh this is the way it hits you whether in fact i sort of have look and decide these things so its quite likely theres lot of decisions on the on the line here lrh all right on the goal to know has anything been decided i dont think that did thing okay pc uhhuh lrh how do you feel about this now pc fine lrh all right lets get in the counter button just for fun here which is notknown on the goal to know has anything been not known pc hm i thought id be saying lrh hm pc um its not known exactly uh what will be the end result of being free of this goal i can im im not frightened of the end result that cant be anything but good uh that is quite there is analytical fear because i can see the way it holds one down it must be very nice to be free on this to know or not to know you know not have this terrific worry all the time and one would have better knowledge if it there but i havent known the exact feeling of the what what the end product would be lrh hm pc oh oh there theres another decision thats right that i if i could get that then the goal would blow if i could just get to know what it would be like without this goal then the goal wouldnt be there of course if i could visualize that really but uh so its unknown lrh all right all right on the goal to know has anything been not known thats equivocal on the goal to know has anything been not known ah theres there must be one in there theres another one pc i havent known tonight whether the goal when youve been saying it is reading and uh and of course theres lot of the items on the list are not known uh whether theyve rsed and so on and fair amount of mystery which im not complaining about on with the auditing but are things which i are not known lrh all right okay on the goal to know has anything been not known can you think of another one im rather prone ill test that one more time just to be sure on the goal to know has anything been not known id say there was another one there someplace pc uh what comes up here is that i dont um get bit foxed on knowing what notknow is and that is notknow its all to do with of course that comes before the goal to know lrh oh this is bothering you little bit pc yes this does bother bit lrh ah i see pc i get this conception i mean i can see that high higher up but this state in between knowing this presumably and then notknow and then to know just bewilders bit and that is certainly not known lrh all right pc and until your needles floating it would be lrh all right is there protest on the question pc lrh justjustjust is that concept pc oh its just that concept lrh all right all right sorry i misunderstood you pc thats fine lrh but i have understood you pc good lrh all right on the goal to know has anything been not known you know theres theres theres something sneaking around the edges and its probably that i am announcing an item somewhere on that bank there probably is an item wouldnt you say because im starting to get dirty needle on iti mean dirty read on it im going to leave that one alone if thats all right with you pc all right yes lrh all right okay now now lets take this up you can take take break there moment reg now lets take this up here weve cleaned up the goal were not going to bother getting the goal to fire right this minute well take that up in moment weve got here secrecy hm and i want you to indicate whats your last rs on the list now what is that word auditor thats question mark that was nei thats not an rs or an rr i checked that its invigilators and i missed the read it went off the meter or something i came back and checked it it never to my knowledge lrh all right auditor has done anything apart from that i didnt see it lrh all right now from page 12 forward now weve got this item dissemination where does that come on this list there it is well now look here thats on page 7 is that your actually your last rr on the list auditor mm lrh is it in actual fact the last rr on the list you got an rr here oh i see thats page 5 oh weve got one folded backwards pc ah auditor ah ah lrh ah thats on page 7 and thats the last rr on the list auditor all right now ii just had cognition now lrh now whats that auditor i wondered what you meant when you said there was an rr after it now i see lrh you had it folded backwards i didnt look to see what your page numbers were some auditors dont even number pages you know now that read didnt it and then did you to the list auditor dissemination lrh have you added to the list since you tested dissemination auditor lrh you havent auditor lrh and it read auditor it gave it went like this it gave ragged sort of rocket over and thats the best ive had lrh you mean this width auditor youre the youre the auditor lrh all right and thats the best what auditor thats thats when i called it in initially thats what it did it went it sort of it it took off like rocket but went and then did these little sort of jerks lrh well whats the rr afterwards auditor ragged thats got question mark after it because i wasnt sure and i lrh and then over here someplace it say adding to list auditor restarted list thats the next session in other words thats the listing i did in that session and then look im still getting i got little bit of ta there so the next session restarted lrh but this thing read this thing read this read auditor it gave ragged look i wrote on it ragged rocket read i got rocket read on the careful button when i ran the threeleft hand button prepcheck on it and next session i before the next session i had reg checked by brian and he was checked on tv and there was rocket read on there so the best weve had on it just calling it is is this ragged motion and i saw an rr on buttons and then i i in that session i then big tiger drilled it and it went out completely i couldnt get anything on it lrh all right in case like that there are two things wrong you have picked the wrong item off of your source list thats the only two things that can be wrong now see you picked the wrong item off of your source list or that is the item and its been abandoned auditor hmm lrh see thatsbecause it read and because it rred on td cant be anymore your list is adequately completed here how many pages beyond this have you gone seven eight auditor one two three three pages lrh see and you havent got another single read now you just sit there and count the number of items from dissemination to the end of the list count for auditor its fifty to there hundred do you want it exactly lrh gaa hundred other rr auditor right lrh and you go hundred and it read you understand how you work this out auditor yes lrh theres sense in prowling around the rest of this list why isnt there any sense to it this is 3m were talking about now not 212 see heres the item heres the item dissemination saw it fired fired on the drill the list has been completed completed completed completed all right we go back and sort out the number of things we can say all right secrecy is opposed wrong way to and weve got the wrong list or something of the sort but secrecy gave rrs of any kind whatsoever auditor right lrh so its deadend list auditor thats right so lrh we tested the only read on it that was anything it was nothing you saw drill it auditor uhhuh lrh so thats scrub so this says theres nothing can be done about this except thats the item or one more possibility because of just this these are just the only things you grabbed the wrong on off the source list or it could be one more thing wrong goal auditor uhhuh lrh see but thats highly unlikely because you are in the goals channel auditor hm lrh because you are getting rrs so if youre getting rrs that must be the item you understand i mean this couldnt be anything but the item its rred on td youve completed the list you did get secrecy checked out it did fire its been opposed obviously right way to auditor yeah well why doesnt that check out lrh i dont know we will very shortly find out all right do you understand the logic of this auditor yes i see that lrh yeah theres always that kind of logic see it cant be something else if that fired auditor hm lrh see because if something else fired it would mean your list was incomplete you understand auditor yes lrh only your list cant be incomplete because youve gone hundred beyond it with further read auditor hm im im pretty im very positive i didnt miss one well i mean i could have missed one but i that would be i was watching like hawk i was watching that meter particularly right from that moment on lrh oh were not worried much about that dont you see that you couldnt have missed one auditor yeah right lrh you see how it proves itself without your sweating yourself to death auditor uhhuh lrh you understand this logic youll see sooner or later youll see some auditor well that only read for little while so therefore well take over this list and we will check all of the things over and we will null everything on this list and the guys already extended the list hundred items so he cant extend it any further you know you cant extend these things more than about twentyfive and then maybe youll get another rr when you extend it and you extend it another twenty five after that rr youve just about had it auditor hm lrh it wont stand any more strain than that auditor hm hm lrh see you cant go on listing the way you do with 212 the brakes go on right at that point you understand auditor hm lrh and you did have one that did read auditor right lrh so we say pcpc very queasy we say pc very queasy pc suppress very easy pc have goal we want to know he doesnt know he wants to know we dont know auditor uhhuh lrh must be something like that going on furthermore secrecy and so forth theres oneone more faint possibility that somehow or another you got on the rr channel and you havent got the right goal auditor hm lrh see thats another faint possibility auditor hm lrh and we will see that possibility right now but because that fired on the list and because the list has been extended auditor hm lrh theres not another thing you can do about it now if that hadnt fired at all you would then go above and below and above and below to make sure that the rocket read hadnt been sort of transferring and youd test all of those items auditor uhhuh lrh and then youd null it on out to the end of the list and youd find out youd goofed one someplace and itd now fire you understand auditor right ron i do have confusion on this i ive got withhold now lrh what is your question auditor why could this why because that read couldnt there have been another one here reading lrh there cant be auditor i dont see that ive got to admit that lrh you went 100 beyond your last read auditor yeah but suppose id missed one lrh but you went 100 auditor yeah im being stupid i know but lrh its just too far auditor why lrh well all right supposing youd missed one supposing youd missed one auditor yeah lrh the list has not been added to auditor thats correct lrh so if two appeared on it the list would be incomplete auditor yes thats correct lrh this cant be incomplete the list would be one two now looka here heres the end of the list auditor uhhuh lrh and we go one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twentyone twentytwo twentythree twenty four twentyfive twentysix auditor it was just body motion so ii checked back and it was dead deader than mackerel lrh you understand but these are not added to auditor lrh you didnt add these to the list auditor i didnt how do i know that list is complete thats what i dont lrh youve gone for pages here without read auditor and there couldnt be just one read that i missed lrh all right if there was read youre sunk youd have to be stone blind auditor yeah oh in other words its chronically incomplete if theres one more lrh well it isnt chronically incomplete or anything else auditor if there was look i lrh we count on the fact that you were at least looking at your meter down the lines here auditor yeah well im damn sure i was lrh but youve gone on and on and on now because one thing has read auditor yeah lrh you understand if another one now reads after that your list is incomplete so that isnt it either you understand auditor i dont im sorry lrh yeah i had i had hard time getting this through mary sues head and everybody else has had hard time if theres two items on the list its incomplete auditor agreed lrh so if the second item occurs on the list that isnt it auditor the list is incomplete lrh so why are you monkeying with it auditor to complete it lrh well look this is either now the item auditor uhhuh lrh dissemination is the item auditor uhhuh yeah oh i see or the lists not about to complete is that it lrh thats nothing to do about it its simpler than that now theres the item and it seemedits been seen to fire auditor yes lrh you got it its been seen to fire correct auditor yes lrh so that if any item occurs all the way down here and all the way down here and all the way down here and all the way down here to that point since the list has not been added to since you tested that auditor yeah lrh the item is not on this list if that isnt it auditor right yes now i see that lrh you see that auditor yes lrh so the only possible test is then to make continued listing of twentyfive items auditor yes i get that lrh looking for an rr auditor i get that lrh this is the only possible way you can test the list auditor yes lrh so either dissemination is it auditor yep lrh or you add twentyfive to the list to see if you get an rr auditor right lrh and if you dont get an rr in that then dissemination was it and you go on and use it auditor right ii can see this now lrh you understand auditor yes lrh so the only actions to be undertaken here is dissemination to be checked to see if we cant pep up read out of it auditor uhhuh yeah lrh or if we cant add twentyfive to the list see if theres read on the twentyfive because in that space on 3m youll have gotten read see auditor yeah uhhuh lrh and if that meter doesnt flicker during that additional twentyfive auditor its wrong source lrh dissemination is it auditor oh dissemination is it or if it isnt wrong source yes it would be if it didnt if oh yeah yes yeah i see at twenty five it must be there lrh correct its the only thing thats been seen to read on the list auditor right yes yes yes lrh you follow auditor i do follow this now ive got it lrh youve got this auditor yes lrh so all this 3m well we saw that read and it only read for moment so now were going to null the rest of the ri list this would be true of source list youd go all over the darn thing you see you see youd say i well wed better null from that down on to the end dont you see and wed better do this and wed better do that you see how all that proves nothing auditor uhhuh absolutely nothing yeah lrh if you did find one from dissemination to the end of the list see the list has not been added to auditor yes thats correct lrh so if there is one there just so you understand there it cant be it auditor yes thats right i understand lrh so the action youre about to see undertake is what you would undertake on that im sorry reg pc thats all right lrh pick up the cans would you thats okay i beg your pardon im just looking this over to see exactly where we stand here im not trying to teach him anything im trying to whet this thing out you feel all right pc yes lrh is this upsetting to you in any way pc lrh all right are you im going to say your goal to know all right to know to know all there was was one tick and speeded fall okay pc all right lrh now lets take this item secrecy and make sure theres tick on secrecy were not looking for rocket read all we wants tick if its there secrecy secrecy pretty hard to tell secrecy secrecy i dont know whether thats reading or not secrecy secrecy looks like its reading auditor something is reading lrh all right on this item has anything been suppressed it shouldnt read rudiments in or not it just shouldnt read this is one of your test steps of 3m the way its been released auditor i checked this on friday it was null lrh and what happened auditor it was null lrh secrecy on this item has anything been suppressed pc um yes you said to that in the office you didnt think that um that dissemination was my item so then ii was suppressing that well thats something to do with secrecy its coming from secrecy lrh all right pc so i thought well if it isnt ill just find something else lrh all right pc so anyway there was suppression there lrh okay on the item secrecy has anything been suppressed pc im suppressing all the time using secrecy um im not getting anything right away on this that i specifically suppressed oh all right right away i suppressed my telephone number thats secrecy lrh all right very good pc to further secrecy lrh all right is that it pc uhhuh lrh all right on the item secrecy has anything been suppressed ive got another suppress here pc well this was uh what i got then was notsuppress because uh i i once since this items been found i havent withheld it or suppressed it from anybody lrh all right pc either or gone the other way you see im quite happy lrh all right all right thank you on the item secrecy has anything been suppressed somethings suppressed there pc well i suppressed arguing with you you had suggested that dissemination wasnt on the goal line and i suppressed arguing with you that it was i could well see that dissemination was on the goal line to lrh all right pc and i was quite happy about that and i thought well its silly to argue about it because its my cognition and not rons i mean we have varying cognitions on it and so that was suppressed lrh all right very good on the item secrecy has anything been suppressed id say theres another one pc well i think i suppressed admitting that i am an excellent suppressor i mean ive got wonderful excuse now that ive got this item yes this is what it is this item gives terrific excuse you see i can say well its all right i suppress its my item and this is rather dirty getout you see lrh oh all right pc i think thats gone on ive suppressed that lrh all right on the item secrecy has anything been suppressed there is one there pc uh this has lot to do with the term suppression which i have heard you say is forget um i look upon suppress as more overt than than forget forget seems to to be something that you havent got lot of control over at this stage of the game that one uh forget well theres lot ive forgotten which on that score has been suppressed but i cant think of anything that i have deliberately suppressed or forgotten lrh all right okay on the item secrecy has anything been suppressed well now its banging on suppress and the item is reading pc mmm lrh give another suppress pc um i wondered whether i suppressed the um its opposition when i came on tv in here the other night probably i must admit that i did but how i dont know when i was trying to uh get dissemination reading that is on the item suppress that is on the item secrecy you see dissemination is lrh was i going to i dont quite get quite how you suppressed this or where pc well here because it didnt read when it came to be checked out because it read for peter lrh oh thats right youve been on television elsewhere pc i beg your pardon yes i came in yes we came in here on friday brian was checking out we thought we were going to show them rocket reads you see lrh bells ring pc im sorry lrh all right very good on the item secrecy has anything been suppressed all right i still got reaction its another one however there pc well i think when i was listing it i suppressed um despair and even protest because the list seemed to be going on long while lrh oh really pc uhhuh lrh all right on the item secrecy has anything been suppressed boy there is suppress on that and you think that that is because the item itself means suppress is that right pc secrecy can mean suppress yes lrh is that what i understood you to say moment ago pc yes that would uh secrecy would be suppression lrh uhhuh pc it would be the big suppression you suppress everything into secrecy lrh all right on the item secrecy has anything been suppressed all right secrecy secrecy secrecy secrecy i dont know whether thats reading or not on the item secrecy has anything been suppressed boy there is suppression just pure gardenvariety of suppression on this item secrecy now what is it pc well im very secretive i dont know if this is it im very secretive out of uh fear very often that uh and the fear is one of these uh unexplainable things that i just dont know i might not come and tell you something that i dont want to keep to myself and yet when i come to tell it to you it just wont come out lrh hm pc thats why i say therefore i say well im secretive ii cant well the same thing to take it outside here to go and speak to my wife i get there and i just wouldnt be able to talk to her i cant and you know i pick up pen and i and i just cant pick up the pens to write i mean its this bad and its fear or something its one of these things i just cant explain but therefore im secretive and i feel this is wrong you see but um there you are lrh all right pc hell of suppression on on the well hell of suppression on my life over it is one big suppression lrh all right on the item secrecy has anything been suppressed all right there is different one thats another one pc uh lrh is this being protested pc uh it it seems terrific i can well believe its reading because there must be one there should an infinite number of suppressions on this item lrh uhhuh pc and uhuh i just it might be little while cleaning this up because uh to hear you say secrecy what to means suppression and thats making suppress all along all the time you see lrh uhhuh hm all right on the item secrecy has anything been suppressed on the item secrecy has anything been suppressed all right unless you can think of ready answer im going to drop that one pc right lrh all right pc uhhuh lrh all right pc yes lrh very good im just going to read it just straight here secrecy secrecy this is reading mr williams which probably gives us the source of our trouble that has not listed down your proper action is to continue that twentyfive items see if you find something else continue it maybe little bit further see if you find something else auditor uhhuh lrh if you dont find anything on those go back to the source list because theres something awful wrong on an item that wont list down auditor uhhuh lrh see how youd work that out auditor uhhuh yes i thought of that lrh yeah and it is reading the button shouldnt be charged on this thing auditor hm thats charge lrh your last action in desperation if you lost everything in all directions and you could find nothing else by extending your source list you know couldnt find anything and so forth why would be to try to carry on with this item because youve seen it rocket read auditor yeah lrh usually you dont get into this much trouble but early on early on goal thats having hard time firing see im amazed that this goals got tick on it or anything like that you see that might still be just greased out auditor uhhuh lrh as easy as that but he not knowing whether this is his item or not not knowing really whether secrecy is out or not or in you know disoriented on the thingis giving an example here because this needle is going back and forth here into perpetual godelpus you notice its been very hard to read its not your dirty needle you used to have you know thats not it this is just wild swing and its doing it constantly one way or the other and its smoother now than it was and what have i done ive drilled the goal to know i drilled secrecy tiny bit but actually that secrecy shouldnt be reading see it just shouldnt be reading we shouldnt have to tiger drill it to make it not read see you dont tiger drill these things you list them auditor uhhuh incomplete list lrh apparently simple now the chances of your having wrong_ goal here are very remote because it has been seen to fire and you havent got enough items yet to make this goal read well auditor uhhuh lrh itll take you as many as twentysix goals pardon items to run it out and it might just take five six seven accurately found instantly found you know very smooth easyonthepc items and the goal will be firing like crazy got that auditor yeah lrh so thats all there is to that auditor hm lrh all right you can straighten these out in due course now lets put in little bit of rudiments here shall we for the end of this demonstration pc all right lrh all right and were just going to put in the big mid ruds for the end of the demonstration okay in this checkout has anything been suppressed pc dont think so you can have my all except what ive suppressed on secrecy lrh all right all right in this demonstration has anything been suppressed all right i changed the word there from that to checkout to that in this checkout has anything been suppressed there has been something suppressed here pc uh yes you asked and i suppressed the nature of the paper i threw away lrh all right very good in this checkout has anything been suppressed pc i dont think so lrh all right ill check it again in this checkout has anything been suppressed all right thats clean in this checkout is there anything youve been careful of pc careful to cooperate thats about all lrh all right in this checkout ill check it on the meter in this checkout is there anything youve been careful of im afraid there is one there pc well i was very careful to try and follow the discussion between you and peter on this complete list because i was up here you see lrh all right in this checkout is there anything youve been careful of pc i was careful to look for answers and i dont get anything else lrh all right very good ill check that on the meter in this checkout is there anything youve been careful of there is another one pc oh careful to give good impression i think yes lrh oh all right pc yes lrh all right in this checkout is there anything youve been careful of ive got another one pc uh i was careful when i was speaking about peter not to accuse him of doing something wrong because i dont think he did at that time but i tried to wrap it up nicely when i came out with that one lrh all right in this checkout is there anything youve been careful of another one pc well i was careful i think at one stage not to mention somebody s name lrh yeah all right pc i hid that one for bit there but still lrh okay in this checkout is there anything youve been careful of i dont think there was anything there all right in this checkout is there anything youve failed to reveal pc well i didnt reveal all the suppressions thatobviously that were on that on the secrecy but on the other hand i couldnt say that ive revealed all that i was aware of put it that way lrh all right all right in this checkout is there anything youve failed to reveal pc lrh all right ill check that on the meter in this checkout is there anything you have failed to reveal ive got kick on that what is it pc well i was i failed to reveal to peter at times i didnt think he was speaking loudly enough to get into that microphone because hes over there and the microphones there you see lrh oh i see pc i was trying to give him signals at times perhaps i failed to reveal to him what i actually wanted was for him to speak up so that everybody could join in lrh all right in this checkout is there anything youve failed to reveal theres another one pc something to do with the fear of uh something to do with the fear of telling of of saying things oh that that it doesnt apply to everything theres some ive never been able to work out what the line is that i get scared about talking see to people about but its just something i and there doesnt seem to be common denominator i mean theres lots of things im quite open about and theres difficulty in talking to people about it some things and i havent sorted this out doubt it will come out in the goal to know when ill i run that out but its uh its certainly there and i think its something to do with showing myself up in bad light and so on and i didnt reveal all that ive just told you but thats as far as i know on that subject lrh all right okay in this checkout is there anything you have failed to reveal i dont think there was anything more on that pc good lrh okay now in this checkout has anything been invalidated i didnt get anything except latent something or other in this checkout has anything been suggested there is suggest pc you suggested you suggested one time you didnt mean it but i got the suggestion that id got dirty filthy needle there i was bit concerned about this lrh oh all right im sorry pc ive done bit of suggestingim bit uh i did notice that the tone arm was rather low and i and uh suggested there must be something wrong with being checked out on tv that gives this very low tone arm lrh uhhuh pc and i was bit puzzled about that lrh all right in this checkout has anything been suggested all right i dont think there was anything there in this checkout has mistake being made id say yes just to be careful pc oh yes its to do with murder or murderer and uh you found murderer and as you know i always disputed and protested this to some extent and you said you got witnesses and so on and i always had the thing where i couldnt pass it and when he came up with murder such as it was i said well that was the item it was murder not murderer i didnt mind but murder but murderer didnt never seemed i dont see any real reason for this but murder seemed to fit so much better do you see and so this was again mentioned and you said after peter said it was murder yod again said murderer do you see down the and uh when actually the item found was murder i dont know uh possibly bit of missed withhold i dont know whether you really appreciated the item that you found was murderer but the item peter ran was murder and uh theyre two different things lrh all right very good very good okay in this checkout has mistake been made all right i dont think there was one there in this checkout is there anything you have been anxious about oh i think so at guess pc anxious about tone arm anxious about peters speaking loudly enough uh anxious for peter sometimes that he wouldnt get on anxious that we got decent reac for them out on the other side uh c bit about uh anxious about mary sue because i took away her screens upstairs um oh i think thats the lot lrh all right very good in this checkout is there anything youve been anxious about oh dear let see let give that again in this checkout is there anything youve been anxious about i think there is one more pc yeah ive been anxious about this uh feeling of fear that comes up even in on these sessions on tv and i cant make it out because i cant see it seems uh ive ive sympathy for the students when they come here theres nothing and i and im quite happy to come and sit down here and do it and yet once i sit down here and you start asking rudiment questions and so on and yaaaa and i feel so filthy and secretive and so on and yet i i dont get this at all ive been anxious about that lrh all right in this checkout is there anything youve been anxious about do you think theres another answer there i couldnt make it pc i have i havent got one lrh all right let check it once more in this checkout is there anything youve been anxious about yes theres another pc i was anxious that that would read there because i thought we cleaned it you see and this always happens peter gets an equivocal and it always reads the next time lrh oh i see all right pc and i get anxious about it lrh in this checkout is there anything youve been anxious about i dont know anxious about there is another one pc i was anxious about the time once lrh oh yeah pc uhhuh lrh all right very good in this checkout is there anything youve been anxious about well i dont think that had anything on it at all all right in this checkout has anything been protested yes pc i was probably protesting um prepcheck or the drilling of uh taking suppress off secrecy lrh hm pc i dont know of any other protest at all lrh all right very good in this checkout has anything been protested that looked clean to and in this checkout has anything been decided theres one pc well you decided to set course of action in my case uh and i think ive decided something on this there must be something more on this question of fear i think decision lrh all right very good in this checkout has anything been decided i dont think there was anything there all right now how are you doing pc all right i feel quite uh quite perky as matter of fact as we went through these rudiments i did really come up quite bit lrh all right very good it would be unusual to put all these in in checkout but i thought you deserved them pc thank you lrh all right is there anything you care to ask or say before i end this checkout pc uh thank you lrh all right pc thank you very much for giving it to i appreciate it lrh good enough here it is end of checkout pc thank you lrh okay there we go well youve seen something of straightenup tonight on case and ive simply reviewed the case but the truth of the matter is is there is large read on this goal that doesnt at this stage of the game however mean thing if rocket reads are being actually observed and checked out on this case thats excuse not to go along and follow the thing through but it might be little more difficult than it first appears now the main difficulty which is being caused on this case and why thisi wanted to find out why peter here was writing down lots of question marks and having trouble on what read and that sort of thing now i see the reason for this the reason for this is that somewhere in 212 they must have kicked in some sort of needle pattern of some kind or another or the pc was upset about some incomplete package or upset about something there one way or the other and what i would do with this pc is to give good interested interesting approach which is nice smooth prepcheck and i would do that this way i would take goals listing auditing auditors something like this and id make this little list id make this little list and write it down and then i would assess it over here on the meter and id give it nice assessment and find out which one of these things went pow and then i would run an eighteenbutton prepcheck on it just like that and id be sure to give this pc very very very smooth auditingsmooth auditing session smooth auditing approach i would give them everything in the world to build up arc confidence squared up get anything hes worried about dont you see any one of these things you see id make him feel good particularly id pull any missed withholds from auditors and that sort of thing but i wouldnt pull it in any naggish fashion you understand id pull it very smoothly its not that this pc is in bad shape this pc isnt in bad shape but some of these 242 packages have apparently roughed this pcs needle up because i know this pcs needle and i have it smooth as glass and that doesnt mean that peter did anything wrong particularly or otherwise but something somewhere along the line here has roughed this thing up and i would try to get rid of that needle pattern and after that audit him on very smooth clean needle thats the first thing i would do that doesnt necessarily take long time that pays good heavy dividends dont you see because then youre operating with pc who has some good confidence in the auditor and so forth id go alongit wouldnt take too long take maybe at the absolute outside two threehour sessions i mean two twohour sessions because thats done rather rapidly then id come back here and id test list this item dissemination i would just simply go another twentyfive something like that watching this new clean needle we have here and make sure that we didnt have rocket read as we went that twentyfive and if we didnt have then i would take dissemination which has already done rocket read on checkouttiger drill but it wasnt checked out and i would take dissemination and i would establish whether or not it was terminal or an oppterm and i would list it down to new item and i think id find that we were approaching closer and closer into the bank that the goal would read better and better just go on down the spiral staircase as long as i could get rocket reads and that would be the criteria that is everything that i would do i wouldnt do anything new novel strange anything else i would just do find out what it is thats worrying this pc whether its goals or listing or auditing or auditors or whatever it is thats worrying him give him prepcheck on that particular subject good high arc with the auditor go back in list this thing the additional twentyfive items that proves it up read on the twentyfive items obviously dissemination is it take dissemination terminal or oppterm oppose it on down the line and of course the only thing about it would be if i never got new rocket read and the lists were all bare and something was dead wrong i would then assume something was awfully wrong with the source list and i would go back to the source list on the goal and i would sort that out and i would complete it and only assessing the new items that i put on the list completing it go over those and see what i could find thats everything i would do with the case but were looking too far ahead this case is perfectly all right and it probably will work out that dissemination simply has to be opposed and youll see that it wont take the auditor too long to do this but in actual fact this case has had too muchtoo many question marks thrown in his way hes worried little bit about this hes worried about that and of course hes stuck right here in this secrecy well this thing is still kicking the fact that its still kicking that it had been listed down in the session we agree possibly was clean well that was good enough but because it doesnt have an oppterm that thing is going to keep kicking dont you see thats enough to make it tick but its also enough to make one question whether or not the list was complete in the first place thats everything we know about it all right now thats it and thank you very much and good night
