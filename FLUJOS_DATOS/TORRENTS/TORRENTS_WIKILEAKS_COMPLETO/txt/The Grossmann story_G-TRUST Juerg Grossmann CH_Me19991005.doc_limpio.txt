to monika leder stutz jbfo zurich date 5 october 1999 from tia healy trust department telephon345 949 7212 fax 345 949 0993 subject g trust l investments ltd dear monika further to your email yesterday i have spoken with debra and ed and hope that the following will clarify why we are unable to proceed as suggested by the protector as matter of contract ie the loan agreements between l and mr g we could as directors of l agree to terminate the loans and say in the termination agreement that it was effective at certain date in the past the agreement itself would be dated when it was signed but could effect retroactive forgiving of the loans this would be binding on the two parties however from the trustees point of view which is not governed by the laws of contract it is not possible to say that the payments which were approved as loans are now distributions we can agree to forgive the loans made through l by distributing the full benefit of the loan effective whenever we decide to make the distribution therefore while from ls point of view we can contract now to forgive the loans as of date in the past from the trustees point of view we cannot and it is the trustees who must make the distribution now to enable the loans to be forgiven i understand that mr g might not want to receive capital distribution due to his current tax situation we could amend the terms of the loans and make them interest free and repayable on demand this way mr g would not have to receive the distribution and the repayment of the loans could be made at any time in the future or even on his death from our point of view we could use the opportunity to consolidate the loans and having them interest free should make the administration much simpler tia healy trust officer
