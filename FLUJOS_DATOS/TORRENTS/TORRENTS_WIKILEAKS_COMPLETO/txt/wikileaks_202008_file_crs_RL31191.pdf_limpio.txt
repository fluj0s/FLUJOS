terrorist acts as acts of war may legitimize the acts as lawful use of force and elevate the status of the perpetrators and terrorist networks to that of legitimate state actors and lawful combatants7 however it may be argued that an application of the law of war to terrorism does not imply lawfulness of the conflict nor does it imply that perpetrators are not criminals8 terrorists are not members of ar med forces for the purpose of the law of war9 and do not by definition conduct th emselves as lawful combatants10 under this view those who participate directly in unlawful acts of war including those with command influence11 may be treated as war criminals and if captured are not entitled to prisonerofwar pow st atus under the geneva conventions12 ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31191crs3 13 see

november 13 the president has the option to order the trial of accused terrorists whether captured overseas or on us territory by military co mmission it is argued by some that it would be unworkable for instance to tr osama bin laden in federal court under established rules of procedure and evidence public trial some argue could be used to the terrorists advantage by allowing them to force the government to release sensitive information trial of susp ected terrorists could also become an international media circus raising possible concerns fo r the safety of judge and jurors14 such trial could be lengthy and subject to multiple appeals during which conviction could be overt urned on technicality it might be impossible to empanel an impartial jury anywhere within the united states some observers have argued observers have expressed concern that in voking the law of war against terrorists in this instance could lead to the use of similar approach to combat other societal ills upon which rhetorical wars might be declared15 this tactic they argue could allow the government to establish military tr ibunals to try drug dealers for example without ordinary due pro cess of law other opponent s of using military commissions argue that secret trials could deny due process and that the resulting verdicts would lack legitimacy in the eyes of the international community review of legal precedents indicates that the authority of the commander in chief to try war criminals in occupied territory is well settled similarly there is substantial precedent for establishing military tribunals to try enemy belligerents who are charged with violating the law of war especially individuals captured overseas16 determining who qualifies as an enem belligerent for acts committed on us

defendant s convicted under criminal proceedings are continuedpresidents order appears to be broader than the authority cited by previous presidents and may cover aliens in the united states legally who are citizens of countries with which the nation is at peace it may also be seen as conflicting with certain acts of congress ancillary issues the presidents order raises some possibl related considerations for example section 1d of the order finds that the united states ability to protect itself and its citizens depends upon using the united states armed forces to identify terrorists and those who support them to disrupt th eir activities and to eliminate their ability to conduct or support such attacks does this finding authorize the military police to investigate certain crimes possibly implicating the posse comitatus act which restricts use of the military to enforce civilian law18 when civilian police are involved in terrorism investigations must they follow the same standards that they apply to criminal cases the use of military tribunals may also affect the united states ability to extradite terrorist suspects captured abroad the order may also affect the rights and treatment of aliens because the current state of hostilities does not involve an enemy foreign state as such the status of an alien as an enemy alien cannot be determined according to citizenship19 the question may arise as to whether aliens subj ect to the order may be treated as enemy aliens in which case the law of war may permit their internment but would also entitle them to the protections of the 1949 geneva convention iv20 under us law their detention may be authorizable only in accordance with the enemy alien act21 such an approach could also have an impact on

terror could also have significant foreig n policy repercussions sources and principles of the law of war as subset of the law of nations the w of war is composite of many sources and is subject to varying interpretations constantly adjusting to address new technology and the changing nature of war24 it may also be referred to as jus in bello or law in war which refers to the c onduct of combatants in armed conflict as distinguished from jus ad bellum law before war which outlines acceptable reasons for nations to engage in armed conflict25 the rules overlap somewhat but remain conceptually separate due to the cardinal principle that jus in bello applies to both parties in conflict without regard to the lawfulness of the inception of the conflict26 in other words the party at fau lt retains the righ ts and responsibilities of the law of war even if the armed conf lict itself is unjustifia ble under international law the law of war is also sometimes known as the law of armed conflict or international humanitarian law ihl27 the use of the terminology armed conflict reflects the applicab ility of the law to undeclared wars in recognition of the reality that formal declarations of war may be largely thing of the past the term ihl is favored by some to emphasize the humanitarian purpose of the law that is to protect civilians to the extent possible in the event

pursued in such way as to avoid needless nd disproportionate ffering and damages34 at the risk of oversimplifying the concept three principles derived from the law of war may be applied to assess the legality of any use of force for political objectives35 military necessity the use of force must be proportional in relation to the anticipated military advantage or as measure of selfdefense the principle applies to the choice of targets weapons and methods this princi ple however does not apply to unlawful acts of war36 there can be excuse of necessity if the use of arms is not itself justified in other words military necess ity can never be invoked to justify breach of jus ad bellum and it may not be invoked to justify use of arms if there is valid military advantage to be gained howeve r responsibility for collateral damage to otherwise unlawful targets may sometime s be excused by military necessity humanity lawful combatants are bound to use force discriminately in other words they must limit their targets to valid military objectives and must use means harsher than necessary to achieve that objective they may not use methods designed to inflict needless suffering and they may not target civilians it is also unlawful to target facilities such as nuclear power plants whose destruction would unleash even more destructive forces likely to cause unjustifiable civilian casualties and lasting environmental damage37 however there is an exception if the facilities are used to support regular significant and direct military operations38 especially if the facilities can be put out of production in such way as to avoid unleashing disproportionately structive forces39 chivalry combatants must adhere to the law of armed conflict in order to be treated as lawful

international law its original purpose was to define the rights and duties of states in wartime to facilita the determination of the legal responsibility of states for their breaches43 one of the more recent developments of the law of war is the notion of individual responsibility for conduct in war44 each soldier is bound to obey the law of war even if it means disobeying the direct order of superior45 soldiers who obey unlawful orders are responsible for the violation along with whoever ordered it46 conversely responsibility for war cr imes may not be imposed upon groups of individuals based on an unlawful act committed by member of the group47 the notion of individual responsibility and jus tice through individua l trials necessarily excludes the notion of collective guilt48

rules for convening military commissions to try enem saboteurs in which he clarified the applicability of some of the articles of war158 there was occasion to test the new order however when congress

constitutional war powers the validity of any military commissions that might be convened pursuant to the presidents milita ry order of n ovember 13 20 01 therefore will likely depend in large part on whether the defendants are legitimately classified as enemy belligerents and unlawful combatants or whether they are merely alien civilians analysis of presidents military order the military order issued by presid ent bush and the circumstances under which it was issued differ substantially from the world war ii precedent used in quirin perhaps the most obvious difference is that war had been formally declared by congress against foreign states it shoul d be remembered that the law of war has undergone significant changes since the quirin case was decided most notably with the 1949 geneva conventions while the impor tance of formal declaration of war has faded since world war ii the law regarding the treatment of enemy civilians and combatants has progressed significantly wartime basis

act on the other hand review of contemporaneous presidentia l proclamations shows that president roosevelt ordinarily cited specific stat utory authority to support actions taken169 president bushs

not involve hostile state as such the act is probably not applicable nor very practical since it would only allow the president to direct the treatment of natives citizens denizens or subjects of the

law of war and articles 81 and 82 of the articles of war as well as conspiracy to commit the foregoing186 therefore the possibility that the language hostile or warlike acts was meant to include offenses that were not already included in the term violation of the law of war possibly causing the proclamation to exceed the statutory limit on jurisdiction wa s not addressed president bushs mo is ambiguous as to which offenses may be tried by military commissions while the presidents authority to try as saboteurs those responsible for the september 11 attack s appears to be supported by precedent187 the mo could be construed as grant of aut hority to detain and perhaps try persons not suspected of direct participation or complic ity in those attacks the order allows the president to subject noncitizen to trial by military tribunal if he determines that person is or was member of qaida or committed participated aided and abetted or conspired in any terrorist act even those unrelated to qaidas campaign of terror against the united states the order appears to apply to any act of terrorism during the relevant time and anywhere in the world so long as damage or injury to

validly triable by military commission pursuant to 10 usc 36 under the rele vant circumstances which would sharply narrow the scope of the order such an interpretation would lead to the conclusion that the language in section 2 confines the offenses triable to only those war crimes that are committed by noncitizens who fit the definition in section 2 in other words the offenses in section 2 are not necessarily the offenses for which the defendant will be tried but rather are to be used by the president to determine whether an individual may be subject the order violations of the law of war by others could still be tried by military commission but such commission need not comply with the mo of november 13 if the order is interpreted to be consistent with the congressional authorization for the use of force and 10 usc 821 in corporating by reference the law of war the order would not permit the trial of i ndividuals for terrorist acts unless the acts occurred as part of the present armed conf lict including preparation therefor and they are violations of the law of war therefore the language at the relevant time in section 2a1 should probably be cons trued to mean during and related to the present armed conflict with terrorist forces emanating from afghanistan authority to detain the presidents order could be construed to authorize detention of persons for violations of statutes not expressly tr iable by military commission based solely on determination that the accused belongs to the class of persons subject to the order some language in the order could be construed to author ize detention of such persons even though they are not charged with any crime at all189 the authority to detain suspected war criminals is arguably implicit in the power to authorize their trial by military commissi on unless the authority is an inherent power of the executive it must flow either from statute or from the law of war although the language of the order coul d be construed to allow the indefinite detention of persons subject to the order without any charge an interpretation that incorporates the authority it cites would l ead to different conclusion the order could not consistently with 10 usc 821 authorize detention of persons who are neither unlawful combatants accused of violating the law of war nor persons accused of violating 10 usc 904 or 906 the law of war does not pe rmit punishment of enemy civilians non combatants or combatants even unlawful ones for crimes for which they bear individual responsib ility190 therefore their detention is likewise not authorized except as provided for by statute or convention it might be argued that congress implicitly allows the president to tain noncitizens without ex plicit statutory authority because the president is expressly prohibited by statute from detaining citizens excepthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31191crs32 191 18 uscs 4001 2001 provides citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the

mo at section 7b1 military tribunals shall ve exclusive jurisdiction with respect to offenses by the individual subject to the order 194 10 usc 821 see also newton supra note 86 at 21arguing that the entire scope of history and american ju risprudence compel the conclusion that article 21 grants jurisdiction only over violations of the international laws of warin accordance with statute191 however in this case such an argument may be less persuasive because congress in enacting the usa patriot act placed express limits on the authority of the president to detain aliens for national security purposes192 it is arguably insufficient for the president to issue determination that an alien is subject to the order unless th determination also contains an allegation that the detainee has committed violation of the law of war the interpretation of international law regarding responsibility for the acts of others through indirect participation may be necessary to justify detention of any alien suspected of conspiring with or aiding terrorists in ways that fall short of violating the law of war as an unlawful belligerent jurisdiction of other courts feature of the november 13 mo not apparent in the proclamation or military orders issued by president roosevelt is nguage that appears to divest the federal and state courts of jurisdiction over any offense committed by person subject to the order193 indeed the order appears to strip the jurisdiction of foreign courts and international tribunals to hear appeals even indirect app eals of persons detained or convicted under the orde r section 7b2iiiii to the extent that the order would affect the jurisdiction of state and federal courts over crimes especially those not triable by military tribunal under statute or the common law of war it may be judged to be overbroad congress acknowledgment of concurrent jurisdiction over certain cr imes to courts martial and military commissions does not imply that the president has the power to create exclusive jurisdiction in the military tribuna ls for offenses that might by statute be tried in another court the president would not seem to have the constitutional authority to regulate the jurisdiction of c ourts or convene inferi or tribunals unless so authorized by act of congress article 21 of the ucmj recognizes the military commissions jurisdiction to try only offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by military co mmissions provost cour ts or other military tribunals194 therefore references to offenses and crimes in the order most likely must be understood to refer to offe nses against the law of war and war crimes or to those offenses mentioned ex pressly by statute as triable by military commission

of planning and developing permanent judicial machinery for the interpretation and application of international penal law be tackled immediately and effectively the war crimes trials at least in western europe have been held on the basis that the law applied and enforced in these trials is international law of general application which everyone in the world is generally bound to observe on other basis can the trials be regarded as judicial proceedings as dis tinguished from political inquisitions227 there is some historical precedent from which an international norm regarding procedural rights for accused war crimin als might be derived the nuremberg tribunals provide good starting point228 as further refined by the international criminal tribunals for yu goslavia and rwanda229
