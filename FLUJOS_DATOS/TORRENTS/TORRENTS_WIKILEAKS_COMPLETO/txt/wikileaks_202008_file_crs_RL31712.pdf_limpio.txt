other supporting structures and for r esponding to challenges noted several problems with respect to the ccms10 these included difficulties in communication between the ccms and gl obal fund headquarters misperceptions within ccms about the roles and res ponsibilities of the ccm itself and of ccm members and in some ccms lack of information sharing and infrequent meetings however the gao report also not ed that the fund was addressing these problems through enhanced communication holding work shops including language describing the duties of ccms in gr ant agreements and other measures11 in july 2004 report the global fund acknowledged th at the membership of ccms continued to be dominated by governments that people living with the three diseases tended to be underrepresented and that few cc ms had followed guidelines on gender balance12 some in the ngo community and among aids activists have urged that the global fund impose set of requirements on ccms with respect to these and other issues insisting that ngo representatives be included in all ccms for example13 governments in recipient countries tend to oppose such requirements14 and at its june 2004 meeting the global fund board deci ded to continue to deal with these matters through recommendations15 however at its november 2004 meeting the board decided to impose some requirements on ccms to take effect with phase 2 renewals from june 2005 and for new gran ts from round 5 onwards under these requirements all ccms must demonstrate evidence of membership of people living with andor

submissions for possible integration into proposals to nominate principal recipients to oversee project implementation and to ensure that there is br oad range of stakeholders in the proposal development and grant oversight process when the principal recipient and the chair or vice chairs of ccm are from the same entity the ccm must have written plan in place to mitigate against the inherent conflict of interest16 the ccm submits single country coor dinated proposal ccp to the global fund where it is reviewed by the 22me mber technical review panel trp consisting of independent experts in the thr ee diseases as well as others with broader global health experience the trp is ta sked with identifying the proposals most likely to have clear and demonstrable impact in the fight against aids tb and malaria17 and refers those proposals to the bo ard for discussion and final decisions on approval within the recipient country projects are implemented by one or more principal recipients prs which shoul d be agencies or organizations that belong to the ccm the prs are responsible not only for carryin g out the project but also for managing its finances each pr must have an independent auditor acceptable to the fund18 but the work of the prs is also monitored by local fund agents lfas which represent the global fund within the recipient country and are regarded as the funds eyes and ears each lfa is expected to have an incountry presence enabling it to assess the capabilities of the prs and effectively evaluate their financial and program reports the identification and selection of lfas carried out in conjunction with the ccms was prolonged process but u ltimately private sector accounting firms management and consulting companies and the office for project services were recruited to fill the lf role in various countries19 the lfas are paid centrally through the global fund and their fees ar not deducted from the grants the gao notes that there are misunderstandings and resentments toward the lfas in some countries and that the global fund is tryi ng to address these by encouraging local participation in the work of the lfas the gao is also concerned that it may be difficult to maintain the independence of the lfas in poor countries where the ranks of trained accountants and other experts are thin in such situations lfas may have difficulty recruiting skilled personnel who are not already involved in the global fundsupported program in one way or another20
