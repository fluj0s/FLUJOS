conservation provisions in other farm bill titles or those that were in the conservation title of one of the bills but either were dropped in conference or move d elsewhere in the bill are listed in the introduction the conservation title reauthorizes many major conservation programs and authorizes new programs mostly thr ough fy2007 for existing programs the provisions make many policy adjustments and increase funding or raise enrollment ceilings the new programs enacted in the title provide additional conservation assistance for purposes or in locations th at policy makers belie ve were not being adequately served the largest of the new programs is the conservation security program the new law greatly increases total c onservation budget authority above current levels and funds more of th conservation effort as manda tory spending through the commodity credit corporation funding fo r most programs will increase from year toyear and will increase severalfold for some programs such as the environmental quality incentives program and the farmland protection program the congressional budget office issued ba seline for mandatory spending only in april 2001 that was used by policy makers to calculate future spending patterns in this legislation it determined that the baseline that is reauthorization of all programs with changes in policy and new programs for conservation programs was 116 billion over the next 6 years the new law will increase mandatory spending for conservation prog rams by 92 billion over the next 6 years to total of 208 billion according to the cbo farm bill conferees had to resolve many differences between the conservation titles of the two bills the house bill pr imarily reauthorized existing programs usually at smaller funding increases than the senate bill and included fewer new programs and less change to current conserva tion policy by cont rast the senate bill made more numerous and significant changes to existing programs and to conservation policies that ge nerally expanded the conservati on effort it also created many more new programs such as the c onservation security program among the most hotly debated issues over the farm bill was how much of the new funding should go to conservation programs rather than commodity programs for example and how that funding should be divided among the programs

funding in 2002 farm bill with proposed funding in farm bills passed by h u n d n n d pr io r l w 2 9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31486resource conservation title of the 2002 farm bill comparison of new law with bills passed by the house and senate and prior law introduction resource conservation progra ms were first enacted in the 1930s to reduce the effects of soil erosion on crop production they then were expanded in the 1940s and 1950s to help landowners manage water resources and control floods the approach to conservation th at developed with these earliest programs based on voluntary participation change d little until 1985 participants were attracted by the availability of combination of financial technical and educational assistance and results from related research starting with the 1985 farm bill c ongress rapidly expanded conservation programs beyond erosion control and wa ter management and beyond the goal of improving crop production programs acted in the 1985 1990 and 1996 farm bills protect and restore wetlands and wildlife habitat and recognize the need to improve air and water quality for example th 1985 provisions also increased producer interest by requiring that crop producers w ho wish to receive federal farm program subsidies meet certain erosion cont rol and wetland prot ection requirements since the 1996 law was enacted new issu have emerged including the role that agriculture might play in producing energy from biomass and in sequestering carbon protection and restoration of gr asslands reduction of non point water pollution caused by large confined an imal feeding operations and additional attention to other offfarm impacts the new farm bill addresses some of these issues as it expands the breadth and th magnitude of the resource conservation effort and as new conservation tools are added such as multiyear agreements to maintain conservation on nds in production through the conservation security program the expanded conservation effort is re flected in increasing funding in 1985 all conservation activities at usda received total of just over 1 billion and all funding was discretionary nd dependent on the annual appr opriations process the 1996 farm bill moved five c onservation programs to ma ndatory funding through usdas commodity credit corporation ccc mandatory funding is provided through the borrowing authority of the ccc while discretionary funding requires an annual appropriati on conservation programs now receive more than 3 billion annually about 125 billion in discretionary spending nd slightly over 2 billion in mandatory spending most of the sp ending growth since 1985 has been for land retirement and easements eg the c onservation reserve nd wetlands reserve programs while the other activities have grown very slowly if at all in real termshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31486crs2 the new farm bill will increase mandatory spending by total of 92 billion over 6 years to total of 208 billion according to the congressional budget office cbo this averages out to an add itional 15 billion each year but the increases will gradually grow and the amounts spent w ill be largest for most programs in the last year under the 1996 farm bill numerous programs were scheduled to expire at the end of fy2002 during several days of hearings in 2001 both agriculture committees gathered ideas for new farm bill as they considered how to extend existing programs beyond fy2002 farm groups generally suggested increasing funding for existing programs and incr easing compatibility between conservation activities and farm ope rations other interest groups while supporting some of the farmer proposals recommended more substa ntial changes including new programs and major shifts in policy that would increase environmental benefits demand to participate in most programs has greatly exceeded available financial and technical resources in recent years creating major challenge that conservation supporters said justified higher authorization levels the remainder of this report is two tables table 1 lists resource conservation provisions enacted in title ii of the 2002 fa rm bill

enactment 10910 of the miscellaneous title this report does not analyze or comment on the probable effects of the enacted conservation program changes on resource conditions or progra m management and delivery many of these changes are likely have significant effects because of their scope or scale and the places and natural resources that they could affect additionally the effects will be deter mined in part by the approaches that implementing agencies c hoose to follo w in undertaking changed or new responsibilities some of these provisions went through lengthy gestation period such as the conservation security and gr asslands reserve pr ograms developed by senator harkins staff and the nature c onservancy respectively development ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31486crs4 the conservation security program included test implementation by the department of agriculture staff and by others less analysis and information is availa ble about many of the other provisions these provisions include small or limited programs such as the grassroots source water protection program programs of limited geographic scope such as the conservation corridor demonstration pr ogram available only on the delmarva peninsula and proposals that appeared as the farm bill process was drawing to close to address an issue that emerged recently such as the klamath basin provisions which were introduced as freestandi ng proposal with many elements and incorporated into the senate bill and then were greatly altered becoming limited to an earmarking of funds from the new ground and surface water conservation program component of the environmenta l quality incentives program by the conference committee table 2 lists annual fundingenr ollment levels authoriz ed under the new current law through fy2007 in the first column and compares these with proposed fundingenrollment leve ls in both bills and under earlier law the house bill would have authorized programs through fy2011 while the sena bill would have authorized them through fy2006 unless note d most programs are first funded in the current fiscal year fy2002 although fe w will not be eligible for funding until fy2003 and one program is funded thr ough fy2008 the conservation title also contains numerous proposed changes in policy that do not involve fundingenrollment levels these changes which in some instances include how the funds are to be allocated ar not identified in table 2 the entry for each program notes whether the proposal would require mandatory or discretionary funding large majo rity of conservation funding although not necessarily majority of all active conservation programs already is mandatory and the portion of all funding using ccc resources will increase entries also indicate new smaller programs that would be funded using porti on of funds authorized for larger program and identify the relati onship between the recipient and the source program funding levels for many of the progra ms would increase gradually from year to year rather than jump to the highest authorized level in single year and then remain at that level through fy2007 higher f unding levels in outyears will allow the administering agencies to ramp up their efforts given the large magnitude of increases from current levels and the large number of programs where increases will simultaneously occur ramping up is widely viewed as having the potential to result in more efficient and effective implementation table 2 also provides the official estimate s in budget authority prepared by the congressional budget office cbo these cbo estimates are only for the mandatory programs they show projected increases above the baseline which was prepared in april 2001 by year this baseline is used b ecause although revised baseline was issued in ma rch 2002 and projected higher costs as the farm bill legislative debate was conc luding the congressional deba was based largely on the 2001 baselinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31486crs5 to summarize these cbo 2001 baseline estimates total c onservation funding for mandatory programs will amount to 208 billion over the next 6 years an increase of 92 billion this increase over baseline is somewhat closer to the estimate of the additional cost of the housepassed bill of 6788 billion through fy2006 and 15787 billion through fy2011 then for the senatepassed bill which would have raised spending by 11776 billion through fy2006 the conservation program increases are significant portion of the 735 billion increase in budget authority allowed by the fy2001 budget ag reement for all spending in programs under the jurisdiction of the agriculture committees while using the more recent march 2002 baseline would have had major effect on estimates of overall agriculture spending increasing the total from 735 billion to 828 billion total conservation spending was forecast to be only 500 million higher or 213 billion for several programs participation is limited by acres permitted to be enrolled rather than cap on funding levels for these programs cbo must estimate both the average cost per acre and the rate at which land would be enrolled cbo has developed the following factors for making cost estimates for these acreagebased programs for the crp 50 per acre annually for regular enrollment and 100 per acre for the continuous enrollment opti on and the conservation reserve enhancement program crep for the proposed grasslands reserve program 15 to 20 per acre annually and for the wrp 1000 per
