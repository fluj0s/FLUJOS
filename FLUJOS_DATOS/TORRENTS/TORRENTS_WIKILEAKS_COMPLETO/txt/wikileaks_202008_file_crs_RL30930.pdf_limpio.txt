tive research epscor of the national science foundation nsf was authorized by congress in 1978 partly in response to concerns in congress and the concerns of some in academia and the scientific community about the geographic distribution of federal research and development rd funds it was argued that there was concentration of federal rd funds in large and wealthy states and universities and that the continuation of such funding patterns might ensure dichotomy between the haves and havenots epscor began in 1979 with five states and f unding of approximately 10 million currently epscor operates in 25 states and the commonwealth of puerto rico and the us virgin islands to date the nsf has invested approximately 9200 million in epscor programs and activities when established it operated solely in the nsf epscor was expanded in the mid 1980s and early 1990s by 1998 seven other agencies had tablished epscor or epscorlike programs epscor is universityoriented program with the goal of identifying developing and utilizing the academic science and technology resources in state that will lead to increased rd competitiveness the program is partnership between nsf and state to improve the rd competitiveness through the states academic science and technology st infrastructure eventually it is hoped that those states receiving limited federal support would improve their ability to compete successfully for federal and private sector funds through the regular grant system some have questioned the length of time states should receive epscor support it continues to be called an experimental program after 28 years and observers have noted that state has yet to graduate or leave the program in august 2005 the nsfs committee of visitors cov released review of the epscor program for the period fy2000 through fy2004 one of the issues in the review was centered on determining when states would become independent of epscor resources the cov acknowledged that graduationprogression from the epscor program is challenging issue and it has become necessary to revisit what it means to graduate from the program on june 30 2008 the president signed into law the supplemental appropriations act 2008 pl 110252 hr 2642 the act provides an additional 625 million for the nsf in fy2008 report language directs that 50 million of the supplemental be available solely for epscor activities this report will be updated periodically httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30930g23g495g21g495g561g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149 g561g21g140g146g142g151g140g142g561g8g152g158g151

stimulate competi tive research epscor of the national science foundation nsf was authorized by congress in 19781 partly in response to concerns from congress and from some of those in academia and the scientific community about the geographic distribution of federal research and development rd funds2 additional concerns resulted from the practice of congressional earmarkingallocating funds for specific institutions or research projects 3 historical data revealed that there was concentration of federal rd funds in large and wealthy states and universities and that the continuation of such funding patterns might ensure dichotomy between the haves and havenots4 as designed epscor is to help achieve broa der geographical distribution of rd support by improving the research infrastructure of those states that historically have received limited federal rd funds while these states fall outside of the t op 10 states in receipt of federal rd support according to the nsf they have demonstrated commitment to improve the quality of science and engineering research and education conducted at their universities and colleges 5 the premise of the program is that academic research activity underpins every states overall competitiveness6 james savage writing in funding science in america describes epscors creation as type of affirmative action program designed to aid less

institutions has corner on the market of good ideas smart people or outstanding researchers13 epscor is joint program of nsf and selected states and territories its goal is to build competitive science by developing science and technology st resources through partnerships involving state universities industry government and the federal rd enterprise the program is partnership between the nsf and state to improve the rd competitiveness through the states academic st infrastructure the mission of epscor is to raise the capability of research institution or to assist in making lesscompetitive institution more research intensive 14 eventually epscor supporters hop those states receiving limited federal support would gain some level of equity in competing for federal and

programs in nsf24 to receive support for cofunding grant proposal must be among other things rated at or near the same level as the highly rated grants in the regular grant process the fy2008 estimate for cofunding is 360 million in the fy2009 request the cofunding strategy was proposed at level funding360 million the outreach funding mechanism of epscor prov ides support for nsf program directors and relevant personnel to visit participating researchers in epscor states and to further familiarize the states and researchers with nsf policies practices and programs also it allows agency personnel to become more cognizant of the availability of resources within the states and their institutions outreach visits take two forms t hose initiated by host of an epscor state or jurisdiction and those initiated by nsf program officers the visits may result in colloquia or seminars it is nsfs contention that the contact provided by outreach visits will lead to an increase in both the quality and quantity of grant proposals submitted by participating states 25 funding for the outreach strategy in the fy2009 budget request was 15 million an increase of 400000 over the fy2008 estimate of 11 million the increase will allow for expansion of activities that build regional and jurisdictional research infrastructure

strategies that led to improvement of the state and institutions research competitiveness the evaluation found that states rd competitiveness did improve and that epscor had contributed to this competitiveness the report stated that based on the observed changes in federal and nsf shares it can be concluded that the epscor states share of rd funding did increase relative to the shares of the other states to this extent epscor was associated with lessening of the undue geographic concentration of rd in the united states although the changes were small in absolute terms this was notable accomplishment in an era when research universities in nonepscor states also were thriving and upgrading substantially 27 the report noted that nsf epscor had facilitated the development of partnerships and linkages among institutions state and federal government and the private sector it also revealed that while state had graduated from epscor longer receiving epscor support many epscor research clusters had become fully competitive and longer sought epscor resources 28 the evaluators determined that for colleges and universities in epscor states the cluster strategy may have been more effective approach to improving research capability than that of supporting individual researchers or single research projects strategy used in the early years of epscor more recently an august 2006 report epscor 2020 expanding state participation in research in the 21 st centurya new vision for the experimental program to stimulate competitive research epscor finds that while some participating states and jurisdictions have developed st capabilities that address national issues they need to progress at faster pace in order to benefit more fully in national research agenda 29 the report states that the task now is to accelerate the positive trends in building research infrastructure and capacity in the states and to incorporate the expertise and capabilities of these states into the larger national research agenda as we move into time of doubling the federal commitment to basic research it is particularly critical an d appropriate to make new commitment to the epscor states that have been left behind in the st community it is imperative that all of nsfs science engineering and education programs adopt the concept of broadening geographical and cultural participation in nsf activities as part of their objectives programmatic planning should consider how best to include all states and their research institutions as potentially important st resources 30 the workshop that generated this report proposed that more flexible rii grant program should be instituted the position of the workshop participants was that since the states are heterogenous

most effective strategy for infrastructure improvement the current award structure is viewed as being longer adequate for some jurisdictions to achieve higher level of competitive science in some areas of research it was proposed that rii grants be awarded for period of up to five years in the amount of 30 50 million per year per state or jurisdiction the longer period of time for the grant would enable states to better implement their strategi c plans the increased level of funding would be related to the size of the jurisdiction and the extent of the st transformative challenge32 another suggestion from the workshop was to place the epscor program in nsf where its crossdirectorate interactions would be maximized and integrated into all of the cutting edge initiatives of the agency the fy2008 budget requ est for nsf did transfer the epscor program from the education and human resources directorate to the integrative activities in the research and related activities account the fy2008 budget submission states that the relocation will allow the epscor program greater leverage for improving the research infrastructure planning complex agendas and developing scientific and engineering talent for the 21 st century33 an additional recommendation of the workshop was for epscor states and jurisdictions to become test bed for new initiatives the re port notes that because epscor has matured as program it should expand its research capacity by developing expertise in areas of national importance such as homeland security and national defense cyberinfrastructure environmental observatories coastal and ocean issues and energy expenditures with the proposed flexibility to the rii grant mechanism the participating states and jurisdictions could pursue multiple strategies such as support for transformative research and innovation that has been outlined in nsfs strategic plan 34 the workshop participants maintain that developing expertise in topics of national importance will enhance success of proposals in other competitions35 g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 at the beginning of the epscor program some questioned the length of time required for state to improve its research infrastructure it was suggested to be five years but that proved to be continued jurisdictional heterogeneity that is jurisdictions vary in their current capacities and capabilities and hence in their relative positions on the trajectory leading to competitiveness written statement of sherry farwell 18 th epscor national conference puerto rico

concerning the length of time states should receive epscor support there are those in the scientific community who believe that some states and their institutions should assume more responsibility for building their research infrastructure and become less dependent on epscor funds they argue that some researchers and states have become comfortable with epscor funding and are not being aggressive in graduating from the program it continues to be called an experimental program after 28 years and state has yet graduated from the epscor program 37 the issue of graduation from the program has generated considerable congressional interest in august 2005 the nsfs committee of visitors cov released review of the epscor program for the period fy2000 through fy200438 one of the issues in the august 2005 review was centered on determining when states woul d become independent of epscor resources questions included what initiatives are there to promote graduation from epscor and mainstreaming in the regular grant making process what level of progress must state achieve to justify that it is longer eligible for epscor resources the cov admitted that graduationprogression from the epscor program is challenging issue and has been debated from the beginning of the program within nsf and among the various stakeholders and participating states and jurisdictions the review determined that it has become necessary to revisit what it means to graduate from the program because of the importance in developing mechanism or measure for graduation from the program the cov proposed the creation of dedicated epscor advisory committee external that would make recommendations for both eligibility for and graduation from epscor the report stated that clearly fixed definition of graduation woul d be moving target especially in an environment where jurisdictions are still being added to the epscor family the current office head has articulated vision of p rogrammatic graduationprogression which necessarily includes the evolution of the epscor programs themselves as infrastructure continues to grow this vision should be further developed vetted and eventually implemented 39 the issue of increasing the number of states seeking support through the program was addressed in the review the cov noted that the increase in the number of eligible jurisdictions has strained limited resources in fy2002 5595 proposals were received and 1511 awards were made with funding rate of 270 in fy2006 7037 proposals were received and 1489 awards were made with funding rate of 210 40 the report stated that given the likely budgetary constraints to be imposed on epscor in the coming years the program runs the danger of not being able to serve its core clientele with the limited funds available if the number of eligible states and institutions continues to increase at some point the foundation must more fully address infrastructure capacity and

for the foundation to re organize some of its existing programs in order to create an epscorlike program that used institutional competitiveness rather than state competitiveness as the primary definitional criterion for support 41 additional issues and questions were included in the august 2005 review by the cov the review found that the majority of epscor programs were capacity building based infrastructure the cov proposed that the significant number of capacity building programs should be supplemented with complementary programs for building capability and competitiveness42 the sbrc grant mechanism was cited as important to expanding the competitiveness building component of pscor also the cov report found that while epscors program portfolio was diverse and in cluded minority serving institutions community colleges and high schools it was determined that epscor jurisdictions should further strengthen the linkages between faculty at minority serving institutions and those at research intensive institutions an examination of the review process for large riitype proposals concluded that the review process should be more rigorous the cov proposed including site visits in the review process and in enlarging the pool of reviewers in the scientific and technical areas proposed for research the review noted that with the current re latively small number of reviewers of epscor programs there is insufficient injection of new viewpoints in the review process43 the report suggested that the pool of reviewers should be expanded by rotating in minimum of 250 new reviewers each year the report further proposed that epscor management use the review model employed by nsfs engineering research center s science and technology centers and science of learning centers many of the questions posed by the epscor cov following its review of the program are those that are being debated by the various stakehol ders in the epscor community in particular questions concerning the criteria used to determine when state or jurisdiction graduates from the epscor program may continue to receiv congressional attention during the 111th congress
