diplomatic approach around the world that emphasizes complementary economic interests chinas influence and image have been bolstered through its increasingly open and sophisti cated diplomatic corps as well as through prominent prcfunded infrastructure public works and economic investme nt projects in many developing countries meanwhile some rveys have indicated marked declines in the us international public image si nce 2002 some foreign observers have criticized us state diplomacy as bein g neglectful of smaller countries or of countries and regional issues that are not related to the global war on terrorism according to some experts us diplom atic and foreign aid efforts have been hampered by organizational restructuring inadequate staffing levels and foreign policies that remain unpopular abroad despite chinas growing influence the united states retains significant strengths including latent reserves of soft power much of which lie beyond the scope of government furthermore by some indicators chinas soft power has experienced some recent setbacks while the us image abroad has shown signs of possible renewal the united states exceeds the peoples republic of china prc in global trade although the prc is catch ing up and far surpasses china in gdp and foreign direct investment it continues to be the dominant external political and military actor in the

april 2008 3 the latin america and the carribean region is also referred to as latin america or western hemispherecomparing global influence chinas and us diplomacy foreign aid trade and investment in the developing world part one overview introduction1 in the past decade chinas soft power global influence attained through diplomatic economic cultura l and other noncoercive means has grown along with its international standing2 despite this development the united states remains the preeminent global force in many areas of soft power the united states exceeds the peoples republic of china prc in global trade and far surpasses china in gdp and foreign direct investment it continues to be the dominant external political and military actor in the middle east and political and economic influence in latin america3 it maintains robust formal allia nces in europe and asia and far outweighs china in military spending and capabilities however many analysts contend that us soft power has declined in relative terms and some studies show dramatic loss in global confidence in the united states foreign policies some experts argue that chinas rise poses serious challenges to us interests while others believe that its implications are limited and that us strengths remain formidable contrasting diplomatic styles the prc has captured the attention of many developing countries due to its pragmatic approach to diplomacy the ways in which the government links diplomacy commerce and foreign aid and the dramatic expansion of its global economic influence since the end of the cold war and the acceleration of chinas economic takeoff in the mid1990s be ijings winwin diplomatic style has featured greater accommodation and an emphasis on shortterm common economic interests in the past several years chinas proliferating trade investment and foreign aid accords with other countri made possible by its own rapid development have stressed mutual benefits through these agreements china has gained markets for its goods access to raw materials and intern ational esteem whilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34620crs2 4 global insight 5 for further discussions of us diplomacy see center for strategic and international studies csis commission on smart power smarter more secure america 2007providing other countries with foreign i nvestment and aid projects without imposing conditions such as political and ec onomic performance criteria chinas style of diplomacy and its foreign policy prin ciple of noninterference have been characterized as sensitive to local conditions rather than imposing standards many countries appear to appreciate this style chinas economic attractiveness even without beijings new brand of diplomacy many developing countries are attracted to china because of what its economy represents in southeast asia and latin america the united states continues to dominate trade and foreign dir ect investment however the prc which is expected to rival the united states in terms of total trade by 2011 promises its economic partners evergrowing oppor tunities for trade and investment4 china also is perceived as representing an alterna tive nondemocratic m odel of development finally many developing countries are drawn to chinas example of asymmetric power although the us governments projection of soft power has evolved to address new foreign policy challenges in the pos t911 world many ex perts believe it has been less adaptable than china to the chan ging needs of many developing countries the us emphasis on shared democratic values considered to be pillar of american soft power can be perceived in other countries as an obstacle to arriving at solutions to international problems5 foreign policy observers have raised several issues related to the us use of soft power tools some experts argue that the united states has neglected public diplomacy par ticularly in helping to shape foreign perceptions of american policy leaders in many developing countries assert that us bilateral and regional diplomacy has lacked sensitivity toward the local conditions in their countries and regions others lament that us foreign aid objectives and programs which have focu sed upon counterterrorism and democracy building have placed low priority on velopment some countries have found us criteria for foreign aid and free trade agreements to be too stringent prc and us soft power in five regions economics and diplomacy are the central mutually reinforcing components of chinas growing soft power in the regions discussed below trade investment and aid particularly that which involves gaining access to raw materials for chinas development are behind much of th prcs recent inroads throughout the developing world security and strategi c concerns and goals also play prominent roles in chinas soft power projections in central asia and southeast asia competition with taiwan for diplomatic recognition has spurred prc engagement with latin america and africa for the mediumterm chinese leaders appear to have accepted the military dominance of the ited states in southeast asia and the strategic roles played by russia and the united states in central asia they also recognize the longerterm us sphere of influence in latin america and us strategic role in the middle east sting ideologies and diplomatic

shared democratic values among the professional and leadership cl asses of foreign countries despite cutbacks during the 1990s us public di plomacy programs including ducational and cultural exchange activities continue to facilitate an understanding of am erican values and culture the sharing of ideas and access to many intellectual areas in which americans are world leaders the regions with the largest us public diplomacy efforts in terms of funding are europeeurasia and the west ern hemisphere latin america and the carribean6 likewise the us international mil itary education and training imet program seeks to promote democratic valu mutual understandi ng and professional and personal relationships in addition to military capacity chinas fledgling public diplomacy counterparts such as the c onfucius institutes place more emphasis upon teaching than intellectual exchange nd upon imparting an understanding of china rather than seeking common values throug h dialogue furthermore prc foreign military training programs do not emphasize the building of personal or cultural rapport between chinese nd foreign military officers while us public and military diplomacy programs have helped to build social layer of professiona ls academics policymakers military leaders and other opinion makers sympathetic to american id eals in many countries china also has made strides in the area of state diplom acy beginning in the mid1990s beijings ideological and isolationist foreign policy became more engaged and pragmatic the prc began to promote its trade and security interests through bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the past several years ma ny observers note chinas conduct of official bilateral ex changes has appeared to be more active than that of the united states especially with smaller deve loping countries through these meetings the prc has asserted itself as global leader china also has played prominent or leading role in new regional groupings that it has helped to establish such as the east asia summit eas the shanghai cooperati on organization sco in central asia the forum on chinaafrica cooperation foc ac and the chinaarab cooperation forum

ahead stating that overall the us image remains far less positive than it was before the war in iraq and at the beginning of the century12 foreign policy interests and implements of power13 while the challenge of chinas soft power does not alter vital us interests it affects the ways and means the united states uses to protect its interests and attain its strategic goals the rise of china political recidivism in russia and the war in iraq give rise to concerns about what th international power structure will be as we move through the 21st century the united states still is the worlds foremost military power largest economy technology leader and cultural magnet however the pull of the chinese model the ri of competing centers of power the emergence of challenges not easily resolved using cold war era implements of power the decentralization of security th reats unfavorable trends in world public opinion and burgeoning us financial pr oblems give pause to both scholars and policymakers the united states and china share the same vital national interests of security and prosperity although each has particular dditional interest and each defines its interests somewhat differently each seeks freedom from fear and want and to preserve its territorial integrity for the united states its particular interest lies in value preservation and projection of those values many americans view the spread of democracy and free markets as enha ncing national security and often seek improvements in human rights as part of their negotiating goals china has particular existential interest in regime preservation or the survival of the chinese communist party as the sole ruler of china this dovetails back into the chinese vital interest of economic prosperity th party needs

beijing consensus purports to represent the thinking of policymakers in china and under lies their approach to relati ons with countries of the developing world the essence of the cons ensus is that china india and other countries that ignored the washington c onsensus have succeeded while those who followed american advice or underwent wo rld bank or international monetary fund imf discipline have failed in many of their basic goals such as lifting their populations out of poverty the beijing consensus is skeptical about adopting wholesale western economic ideals of priv atization and free trade molding ones political system to conform to westernstyle democratic institutions and allowing markets to handle everything even thoug h china actually adopted many of these policies in the process of its development over the past quarter century the beijing consensus contends that nations can fit into the global system without abandoning their way of life or compromising their independence viz authoritarian government countries can choose the mo st useful aspects of the western model and avail themselves of foreign i nvestments and technology w ithout themselves becoming

the stream by feeling the way with ones toes policymakers can stay ahead of the chaos only if they pursue policy innovations as problems ccur central governments have to be strong and at times autocra

their own way without following prescr iptions that seem designed primarily to benefit advanced indus trialized economies measures such as restricting lifesaving medicines because of intellect ual property rights exposing infant industries to global competition saving old growth forests similar to those cut down long ago in developed nations or accepting macroeconomic strictures prescribed by

may not bring them into conflict with american values and interests37httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34620crs16 38 law enforcement is another means for wielding powerinstruments of hard and soft power the tool kit of us hard and soft power includes the military diplomacy economics and culture 38 along with several intangibles that result from us actions these include credibility trust and general amicability military forces include not only those actually engaged in combat but the threat of their use in offensive defensive and retaliatory operations diplomacy includes political forces nations system of governance alliances and in ternational relationships the economy includes nations economic pow er economic assistance trade foreign investment financial position and preferen tial trading arrangements cultural resources include the media information public dipl omacy communications and traditional propaganda figure 2 depicts these tools of power and illustrates various combinations of them that typically are used in accomplishing ends or goals in international affairs the percentages are not based on actual metrics but attempt to depict various combinations of the tools of power that can be used in different activities aimed at wielding power to change the behavior of other nations the figure begins with the least forceful ways by which implements of power may be used cooptation and proceeds through increasingly forceful ways until countries reach open warfare and occupation coopting other nations refers to proce ss of bringing them into international groupings or ways of thinking in order to align their interests with yours it is primarily nonaggressi ve strategy that relies heav ily on the use of information economics and diplomacy although military considerations are always in the background it is the fundamental premis behind many of th worlds alliances country groupings the world trade or ganization and other international institutions cooptation also works at corporate and individual levels corporations engage in international trade and inves tment and individuals work in businesses owned by foreign companies in these cases corporate and worker interests on particular issues can align more with fore ign than domestic interest groups it also is the theory behind the democratic peace hypothesis democracies tend not to fight each other because of shared values cooptation is particular ly important given the mocratization of security threats particularly terrorism if anyone in the world can pose potential security threat then any security strategy must include winning the hearts and minds of people who might opt to engage in such activity or those around them who might either support or repor t such activity to ppropriate authorities persuasion refers to process by which an entity is induced to behave in particular way primarily because of changes in its own interests or because of specific concessions offered by other nations he re diplomacy plays key role along with economic enticements political pressures information and the military in the background country may be persuaded to behave in more positive way without an overt external threat of use of military forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34620crs17 for deterrence the military plays greater role by changing the target nations perception of the costs and be nefits of taking or not taking certain actions the credibility of the military force becomes key but the issues usually are resolved through diplomacy threats of preemptiv strike or trade sanctions may be used so far china has been deterred from taking taiwan by force partly because of the negative military and political consequences that likely would ensue if deterrence by threat fails overt military action can be employed either to preempt or deny if that also fails war may ensue and the military may be used to retaliate in order to deter any similar adverse actions in

occupation depending on the extent of local resistance requires less and less military action and more political economic and informational activity policy issue for the united states may be to determine the proper mix of instruments of power for each activity and to ensure that the appropriate resources are available to accomplish each task should the military be more involved in nation building or should the state department provide more for its own security how best can the military diplomatic and economic tools be combined to pursue certain us objectives are there things ch ina does well that the united states needs to account for or emulate some of this policy debate already is being implemented the efforts of the us central commands combined joint task forcehorn of africa is case in point here the military is attempting to prevent conflict through humanitarian assistance that includes building health clinics renova ting schools and providing fresh water sources tasks usually done by aid agencies or non governmental organizations the provincial reconstruction teams in iraq are another exampl they consist of civilianmilitary teams intended to help provincial governments with governance economics infrastructure rule of law and public diplomacy 40 written by kerry dumbaugh specialist in asian affairspower prior to overt military action also may affect how both hard and soft power may be used after the battles end39 in summary many voices in policy circles in washington are calling for the united states to wield its hard and soft power in more coor dinated and articulated way this has arisen partly from the perceived successes of china in its attempts to win the hearts and minds of people in th developing world but perhaps more from the complications of the iraq war the threat of terrorism and the problems of globalization however app ealing this developing consensus appears on the surface though it faces the devil in the deta ils it includes the longrunning debate over the size of various means used to pr oject us power particularly the budget of the pentagon the specific capab ilities of the various instruments of power the appropriate mix of hard nd soft power and whether new institutions are necessary to cope with the challenges of the 21st century assessing chinas soft power40 although beijing has adopted more accommodating and multilateralist foreign policy and has not challeng ed the global status quo many experts disagree about the prcs capabilities and longterm intentions and as well as the implications of chinas rise some analysts warn that chinas growing soft power reflects set of wellfunded integrated foreign policy goal s developed to s ecure and advance chinas economic and security interests at the expense of the united states others argue that chinas rise is limited in scope vulnerable to domestic shocks and public backlash in foreign countries and represents trend toward greater integration in the global community furthermore this argument goes us military might foreign aid resources trade and foreign direct investme nt and intellectual and cultural influences remain

domestic focused on economic growth and social stability furthermore they argue beijing favors stable periphery and knowingly benefits from the u s role in helping to maintain global security to the extent that china may exploit its soft power for strategic ends it is to forestall possible containment rather than to pursue expansion41 many analysts believe that economic development rather than military supremacy is the primary objective for chinas international engagement for host of reasons not the least of which are to raise the living standards of its enormous population to dampen social disaffection about economic and ot her inequities and to sustain regime legitimacy after the demis of communist ideology as an acceptable organizing principle chinas annual ec onomic growth rates routinely are in the double digits in 2007 they reached an annual rate of 114 percent the highest since 199442 this rapid and sustained ec onomic growth has created voracious domestic appetites for resources capital and technology at the same time chinese growth has been driven by the developmen t of overseas markets for its goods these twin developments have served as powerful drivers of chinas international trade and investment agreements as well as foreig n aid key components of its soft power in energy sources alone for example china became net importer in 1995 it became net importer of oil in 1993 its energy demands are expected to continue increasing at an annual rate of 45 th rough at least 2015 compared to an annual rate of about 1 in industrialized countries43 china steadily and successfully has sought trade accords oil and gas contracts scientific and tec hnological cooperation and defacto multilateral s ecurity arrangements with countries both around its periphery and around the world access to energy resources and raw commodities to fuel chinas domestic growth has played dominant role in these relationships many of these activities are tied to prc pledges of foreign aid in pursuit of sustainable economic deve lopment china also is seen to have placed priority in keeping stable and relatively tensionfree relations with its primary export market the united states and with other countries and regions according to this view beijing calculates that even the appearance of more overt pursuit of its regional and gl obal interests could prompt the united states and other countries to strengthen their alliances or form other groupings to counterbalance and deter chinas international outreach such development in turn could fetter chinas economic growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34620crs20 limitations on chinese soft power chinas winwin approach to international interactions often is considered more symbolic than substantive easy things are taken care of first while in convenient and difficult things are postponed possibly indefinitely moreover win win strategy is slender reed for maximizing comprehensive soft power the soft power potential that the prc can hope to gain from such strategy many believe pales next to the national capacity and willingness of the united states to take on costly and difficult global tasks such as international disaster ai d to date they contend nothing in beijings current soft power approach suggests that it is willin g to embrace such altruism moreover chinas lack of transparency raises consis tent doubts about whether the levels of aid and investment triumphantly announced are the levels of aid and investment actually provided even with winwin strategy acquiring and maintaining an enhanced international presence brings with it certain complications among other things it provides almost innumerable opportun ities for internati onal misunderstandings resentment and reperc ussions cultural backlash may be heightened by the style that prc foreign investments and construction projects ve pursued to date involving the import of chinese workers instead of using the local population or providing substandard labor conditions for local workers chinese overseas operations already have begun to experience fallout from their activities prc oil drilling sites and wellworkers have been

altogether during the 1990s public diplomacy often wa s viewed as less important than political and military government functions and therefore was seen by some legislators as pot of money that could be tapped for other government activities many us policymakers now recognize the importance of how america and its policies are perceived abroad at the same time some observers believe that there are

assistance programs began in earnest in the mid1940s with fouryear 13 b illion investment in rebuilding europe under the marshall plan after the marshall plan ended in the early 1950s much of us foreign assistance of the 1950s and 1960s was provided to southeas t asia to counter soviet and chinese influence the focus of us foreign aid has chan ged with different world events and

of the organization64 some policymakers have expressed concern that new initiatives such as secretary rices transformational diplom acy and transforma tional development which place greater emphasis on us security and democracybuilding goals have taken resources away from traditional aid pr ograms particularly in countries that present fewer security threats to the united states or where governments do not meet various performance criteria other agenci and programs such as the department of defense the millennium challenge corporation mcc and the presidents emergency plan for hivaids relief pepfar also may have diverted funds from core programs and reduced coordination of us foreign assistance activities in general some analysts also argue that promoting democracy prematurely in some countries may waste aid or ev create backlash toward other us programs in that country65 funding the united states is the world s largest economic aid donor in dollar terms but is the smallest contributor among major donor governments in terms of percent of gross national income us foreign assistance generally declined for several decades to an alltime low of 014 of national income in the mid1990s due to the ending of the cold war and efforts to balance the federal budget in the late 1990s aid gradually increased to respond to in ternational disasters such as hurricane mitch in central america66 aid funding increased significantly in the 2000s largely due to the wars in iraq and afghanistan see table 2 and figure 5 however although the amount of spending for inte rnational

does not include loans which according to some experts is the main form of prc aid70 according to one source annual prc aid ranges between 15 billion2 billion71 when loans and statesponsored

assistance not including milita ry and multilateral assistance was 195 billion in fy2007 out of total foreign operations budget of 264 billion according to oecd data the united states oda budget is the largest among oecd member countries followed by japan the united kingdom france and germany chinas estimated aid levels are comparable to those of australia belgium or denmark73 another problem with calculating chinese foreign assistance is that it is often difficult to confirm when or whether aid and loan pledges were actually disbursed the unique characteristics of prc foreign aid often result in it being overlooked like japan but unlike most ma jor aid donors large portion of chinese assistance consists of interestfree or c oncessional loans up to 41 rather than grants which constitute only 3 according to one study74 debt forgiveness is also major form of prc foreign aid in add ition china often extends aid packages that include not only loans but also trade and investment agreements largely in the energy sector according to some analysts when these kinds of assistance are added china becomes one of the largest bilateral ai d donors in some countries and regions furthermore prc assistance often garners appreciation among foreign leaders and citizens disproporti onate to its costs 1 china offers assistance without the conditions that western donors frequently place on aid ie democratic reform market opening and environm ental protection chinas policy of noninterferencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34620crs34 75 chinas conditions on aid are often

continuedinternational trade flows118 for china international trade is playing key role in increasing its influence around the world and in enabling the country to import the technology resources food and consumer goods needed to suppor t its economic growth to finance the other aspects of its national power and to maintain the legitimacy of the communist party government the access that china has to foreign markets also has enabled it to attract foreign investment these foreignaffiliated companies not only play key role in generating economic growth nd employment but in the manufacture of worldclass products that account for more than half of chinas exports china is now the third largest trading nation in the world after the united states and germany and its commercial interaction is having major effect both on trading partners and on chinas own economy international trade differs from diplomacy foreign aid military exchanges and other bilateral inte raction that requires explicit government action and funding trade is largely selfmotivated and selfgenerated and the financial rewards are captured largely by private producers and c onsumers along with the chain of service providers who facilitate the transactions governments however benefit from the international trade transactions through tariff and tax revenue s economic growth increased economic efficiency and generally higher standard of living for residents government policy also influences tr ade flows either in negative eg protectionism or positive eg trade promotion manner international trade and financial transactions moreover generate spillover effects that carry over into political and security ties among nations trade also can be used as weapon as with trade sa nctions or it can be used to create interdependencies that may am eliorate hostile inte ractions or induce countries to take favorable political actions trade additiona lly creates interest groups within the trading countries who value stability nd abhor political disruptions to their commercial transactions academic studies have shown that among nations the greater the interdependence the greater the costs of exiting from an economic relationship the greater the probability that the nations will not seek political demands that could lead to conflict on the other hand economic interdependence also can be used as leverage to bolster political demands119 also the greater the extent that internationally oriented coa litions in country actors with interest in expanding foreign markets or in importing have political clout the more likely that outside economic incentives or sanctions will be eff ective in influencing policy in the country in question120httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34620crs44 120 continued d mansfield and

attempts to negotiate according to gold standard template for its agreements this high standard usually requires the partner country to open markets long protected for domestic po litical purposes or to enact legislation such as greater protection of intellectual property that may be politically difficult as result chinas ftas usually engender less resistance and tend to result in considerable

such as those in africa that are considered anathema to other nations these issues are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this memorandum this section on international trade provides an overview of

council is willing and able to use the cic as an instrument of soft power finally even if china has intention to project soft power globally via its sovereign wealth fund th investments made by cic may either enhance or diminish chinas global image nd thereby indirectly augment or reduce china soft power to date the cic is known to have ma number of investments both inside china and around the world however becau the cic does not generally release details of its investments it is difficult to determine when and how it has used its available capital some of its known major investments are140

trillion as of september 2007 146 james surowiecki sovereign wealth world the new yorker november 26 2007chairman lou jiwei said that the swf would be making longterm investments aimed at maximizing its returns with acceptable levels of risk142 however analysts and observers of chinas political economy speculated that there were other forces influencing the state councils decision to establish swf at this time some speculated that the d ecision to create separate semiautonomous corporation to invest porti on of chinas growing foreign exchange reserves was the result of power struggles between chin as major financial and economic policy institutions including the peoples bank of china pboc the ministry of finance mof and the national developm ent and reform commission ndrc143 others saw the move as making logical administrative separation between the state agency responsible for overseeing overseas fina ncial transactions and the institution managing the governments inte rnational inves tment portfolio it was also postulated that major reason the state council was setting up the cic was part of plan to alleviate inflationary pressures building up in china144 according to this theory chinas rapidly rising stockpile of foreign exchangereserves which had more than doubled between september 2005 and september 2007 was creating excess liquid ity in chinas money supply 145 in order to remove the excess money from circulation the pb oc was selling bonds to the public process often called st erilization however the chines bonds were offering higher yield than the pboc was earning on its investments in us treasury bonds some analysts viewed the creation of the cic as providing the chinese government an investment avenue by which it could eliminate the financial losses associated with the sterilization of its growing foreign exchange reserves there were also concerns raised that the chinese government had created the cic so it could purchase control over ke industries andor access to important natural resources some us commentator s raised the alarm that with over 14 trillion to invest china could acquire several major us companies and obtain the power to unduly influence the us economy146 others speculated that china may use the cic to obtain market power over ke natural resources petroleum natural gas iron ore etc or access to sensitiv technology

chairman lou also indicated that the cic will not invest in infrastructure148 chinas vice minister of finance li yong dismissed rumors that china would try to buy out european and ameri can companies in large numbers149 vice minister li also stated that the cic would not buy into overseas airlines telecommunications or oil companies150 an unnamed contact at cic was cited as saying that the swf also will not make investments in fore ign technology companies as means of obtaining advanced technology pointin g out thats political and we dont do that151 will and can china use the cic as an instrument of soft power even if the state council did not originally establish the cic to be used as an instrument of soft power once the sw f was in operation the state council could decide to use it as means of advanc ing chinas foreign policy objectives one possible indication that chinese officials recognized the soft power potential of the cic was their pattern of pointing out that the investments of swfs in ailing financial firms such as cics investment in morgan stanley were providing market stability at time when there was growing concern about globa l financial crisis there is also uncertainty about the ability of the state council to influence the cics investment decisions if it should decide it wants to use the swf as an instrument of soft power when the cic was established much was made of its autonomy from government influence in its investment decisions in addition the cic has reportedly begun vetting privat investment firms around the world as possible contracted fund managersfor the cic if the cic does subdivide its portfolio among group of independent fund managers it should signifi cantly reduce the state councils ability to influence the cic and use the swf as an instrument of soft power cics unintended soft power effects ironically even if the chinese governme nt has intention of using the cic as an instrument of soft power the investment

light cics purchase of morgan stanley shares at time when the firm was struggling could also be viewed as opportunistic and harm chinas global image both interpretations have been presented by outside observers in the same way different analysts had different interp retations of cic chairman lous statement comparing inve stment opportunities to farmer shooting big fat rabbits152 some commentators understood th comment to indicate cics willingness to jump on good investment opport unities when they occur others heard veiled threat in the statement likening us financial companies to game to be

major overseas investments the cic allegedly began accepting applications from investment firms to serve as contracted fund managers in april 2008 but there are confirmed cases of companies being

ways creating cultural and regional affinities but also breeding an existential southeast asian fear of potential prc domination but the prc has spent over decade actively courting southeast asian states with new diplomatic initiatives trade and investment and foreign aid in fact both china and the united states have strong ties to southeast asia and both draw upon considerable strengths in projecting soft power in the region despite widespread improvements in pub lic perceptions of china and parallel declines in perceptions of the unite d states the united states draws upon considerable security and di plomatic assets in southeas t asia and neither side can really claim to be the dominant power in the region some analysts argue that china seeks to create sphere of influence in southeast asia and to erode us dominance while others contend that the prc has not the will capability nor acquiescence of c ountries in the region to carry out such goal at least in the short to mediumterm155 according to many analysts southeast asian countries generally welc ome prc aid investment and friendship but do not want china to dominate the region militarily many citizens in the region support or accept the us military presence but feel that the united states has often neglected to engage them diplomatically or hear their concerns this void has been filled in part by chinas

world development and the cold war the 1980s brought gradual shift in chinese foreign policy in africa and elsewhere as beijings motivations increasingly came to be dominated by pragmatic economic and traderelated considerations this has increased in recent years with chinas outward investment push and its search for new sources of energy and natural resour ces china continues to support aid

post october 6 2007one potential area of concern for policymakers is chinas determined political courting of and growing econo mic support of african governments this may lead and in some cases has already led them to view china as desirable political ally and model for development247 chinas policy of noninterference in states internal affairs especially with respect to issues of human rights and democracy may prove attractive particular ly in contrast to wester n donor governments imposition on africans of political conditionalities in re turn for credit some africans see such western approaches as paternalistic and some african states when subjected to sustained western policy pressure have already turned to china while such realignments may not be permanent angolas rejection of relations with the imf in favor of access to chinese economic ties and zimbabwes ties to china have been interpreted as reflecting such views rapidly expanding sinoafrican economic cooperation and the percei ved relevance to africa of chinas rapid economic development may also lead africans to view china as more relevant political economic model than western democracies248 economic factors early in

forms trade agreements commod ity acquisition and production deals and scientific educationa l technological and in fe w cases security cooperation china is also offering increasing amounts of development aid to africa the dominant factor driving such ties is trade sinoafrican ties are underpinned by chinas prodigious demand for africas plentiful commodities notably oil and unprocessed metals and minerals to s upply its ra pidly growing economy and by african demand for chinese goods and services the peoples republic of china prc uses combination of political and economic means to protect this trade and foster bilateral ties as result economic relations are not carried out on purely commercial basis there is substantial amount of overlap between chinese deve lopment aid investments and business deals these are often underpinned by prc soft loans with terms ranging from cost ie grant basis to nearmarket rates prc financing and political backing are increasingly enabling chinese firms to attain dominant competitive position with respect to the demands of africas small but often rapidly growing markets which many view as having often been negl ected by developed country businesseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34620crs115 political factors chinas political goals in africa center on fostering support among african states for beijing s political economic and trade interests notable among these are longstanding efforts by china to isolate taiwan internationally in africa china has been increasingly successful in this respect only four of 48 subsaharan

by many african countries these include efforts to foster more multipolar international political system and to counter putatively dispr oportionate us global po liticaleconomic and military influence china also uses these forums to promote developing country interests in order to create new just and rati onal economic order and to influence international policymaking decisions that affect countries such as sudan in which china has important interests china is also proving attractive to ma ny for more direct practical purposes with the exception of its taiwan policy china unlike western official donors does not condition its financial offerings and political ties on improvements in governance economic reform or human rights conditions instead it expresses strong support for state sovereignty and noninterferen ce in countries internal affairs and stresses the mutual benefits of bilate ral ties and economic winwin cooperation such policies dovetail with those of many african go vernments both for economic reasons and because some like china have periodica lly been targets of foreign criticism regarding undemocratic governance and human rights responses there have been complex and varied reactions among analysts regarding the implications of chinese gagement in africa these range from enthusiasm and guarded optimism to concern over potential chinese strategic and economic threats to western or african inte rests some observers are concerned about the statecentric politicalcommercial mode of prc engagement in africa its potential negative impacts on us and west ern public policy goals and engagement in africa the competitive impact of increased prc imports of raw materials from africa and to lesser extent chinese co mpetition for current and future african market demand and the implications for us political interests and influence of the prcs undertakings in africa250 such concerns largely stem from the fact that chinas african undertakings are

of human rights and fundamental freedoms should be respected but that the politicization of human rights and the imposition of human rights conditionalities on economic assistance should be vigorously opposed to as they constitute violation of human rights emphasis added 253 examples commonly cited include prc sales of military materiel to governments accused of human rights abuses by western governments eg sudan and zimbabwe the use of continuedresponses to the conflict in darfur sudan251 western support for universal good governance and fiscal transparency and globalized economic competition china has an ostensible policy of neutrality and non interference with respect to countries internal affairs and does not link provision of bilateral aid and credit to apolitical or governance performance252 critics worry that this may weaken african governments motivation to pursue mocratization good governance and transparency reforms and adhere to unive rsal norms of civic and human rights and the rule of law in africa there are growing concerns among some observers over the prospective impact that chinas efforts to gain and ensure access to african energy and mined primary commodities might have on global energy markets similarly rising chinese investment in africa suggests to some analysts that china presents competitive threat to developed country investment on the continent many african and foreign observers are also concerned about grow ing prc political clout in africa sino african bilateral investment agreements ar the focus of criticism because they often fuse business political aid and sometimes military considerations these allow china to offer integrated package deals these may be more attractive to african governments than those offered by west ern country governments which exercise much less control over their private sect ors than the prc and often operationally separate their ai d military and dipl omatic initiatives in some cases according to critics prcafrican deals contain provisions that may conflict with international human rights transparency or environm ental norms or promote economic activities that do little to develop the

point to potential benefits to africa resulting from chinas involvement on the continent whic h bush administration officials have in some cases pointed to as positive outcome of sinoafrican engagement many also view chinas engagement in africa as reflection of chinas legitimate pursuit of political and economic self interest among the most often cited positive outcomes for africa are rising levels of chinese investment in africa particularly in infrastructure increases in african exports to china and chinese fulfillment of unmet african consumer demand china is also seen as providi ng african countries with new source of private credit and fi nance and as spurring global commercial interest in african resources and markets implications for us policy analysts are divided

emerging economic andor political competition between thetwo countries bush administration officials including the president have repeatedly stated that they do not view chinese engagement in africa as threat to us interests in the region 255 administration officials are however actively monitoring chinas activities in africa since it is widely accepte d that the breadth and diversity of these endeavors may present numerous potential issues for consideration by us policy makers one area for consideration is the impact of chinese engagement on african governments willingness to pursue mocratization good governance and transparency reforms and their adherence to universal civic and human rights norms and the rule of law another concern may include the potential for renewed rise in

foreign assistance chinese assistance china is providing an increasing amount of official development assistance oda ie aid that is at least 25 gratis to africa but the vast majority of chinese assistance to africa consists of large and growing amount of statebacked commercial and b ilateral credit that bolsters sinoafrican trade and investment ties this makes comparisons with us development assistance difficult much chinese credit is tied that is its recipients must agree to use such assistance to buy or accept goods servi ces or credit from china tied aid was long common feature of us and european aid to africa but with some exceptions in recent years many western donor governments have begun to provide most of their assistance to africa as grants levels of chinese oda are reportedly significantly lower than those of majo r developed country donor governments but this is in part due to the manner in which china offers assistance the prc describes variety of grants interestfree bilateral state loans and concessional lowinterest and market rate loans to and from state or stateowned enterprises soes that benefit or relate to africa as assistance and th resources are often merged conceptually and in practice in addition there is l ack of public data about them they are therefore difficult to reliably measure and disaggregate reportedly even for the chinese government there are some reports that china may develop unified official aid structure which would allow china to more effectively measure and assess the amounts and eff ectiveness of its aid aid structure key sources of prc assistance in africa include the stateowned exportimport exim bank of china which provides official prc bilateral concessional loans export credits and international loan guarantees the aid to foreign countries department of the ministry of commerce moc manages and executes prc bila teral foreign aid policy budge ting and project activities by controlling the bidding

provision of prc loans or aid but others pertain to gal tax and diplomatic ties chinas aid programs are designed to support goals of prc foreign policy large projects often consist of integrated packages of bilateral commercial and military aid andor political agreements however aid projects reportedly also tend to be designed and managed on countrybycountry basis larg ely in the absence of common defining functional or regional policy this somewhat piecemeal approach appears driven by the large operationally autonomous and some times rival nature of the ministries and firms that execute prc assistance projects and by tensions between prc foreign policy goals and the profitdriven incentive structure of the many chinese firms that execute many prc bilateral projects in africa prc business activities that may conflict with or undermine prc foreign policy goals in africa pertain to working conditions worker safety pay levels competition with african firms environmental abuses and alleged poor qua lity workmanship the prc is making some efforts to regulate chinese firms in africa and avoid such practices but these are reportedly limited by bureaucratic barriers conflicting chains of authority and political rivalries among prc institutions while prc business and foreign policy goals may in some cases clash in others they dovetail prc subsidies for soes for instance may prompt them to pursue projects that are economically inefficient but accomplish longterm strategic prc investment and commodity access goals such subsidies may allow commodity purchases at above market pr ices in order to guarantee supply or foster unprofitable bids for projects that seek to curry favor for future contracts or better bilateral ties prc african aid levels accurate uniform data on prc aid flows to africa are not available educated guesses as to the total annual level of these flows range widely in part because some try to break out oda and nonoda components while others do
