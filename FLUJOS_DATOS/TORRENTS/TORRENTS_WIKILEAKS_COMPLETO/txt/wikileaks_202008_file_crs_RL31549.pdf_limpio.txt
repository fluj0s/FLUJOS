and facilitation of legitimate travel and trade adequate funding and staffing efficient deployment of resources and successful implementation of recently enacted border port and transportation securityrelated legislation border management and transportation security in the past there have been many pr oposals to reorganize border management agencies prompted by concerns about illegal immigration and international drug trafficking7 the threat of terrorism however prompted the establishment of department of homeland security dhs and its directorate of border and transportation security dbts that integrates border management agencies today policy makers confront the real possibility that the world trade center and pentagon attacks were not singular events and that international terrori sts have planned will attempt and may successfully carry out attacks of similar magnitude against the united states in the future at the same time trade experts emphasize that shutting down borders in the event of terrorist attack on the united states would have detrimental and possibly catastrophic eff ects on the national and world economies8 hence the security and livelihood of the united states depends more than ever upon how efficiently federal agencies charge d with border manage ment achieve their respective missions border management and security border management entails regulating the flow of people and goods into the unite d states and in some instances from the united states border security is derived from how we ll border management agencies perform their missions that entails not only effective law enforcement in some cases but also prompt efficient and courteous service to the traveling public over the past halfcentury border manage ment evolved as balancing act between facilitating legitimate cross border commerce and travel and deterring illegal immigration and the smuggling of drugs and other contraband even before the september 11 terrori st attacks border management was emerging as public policy area of grow ing concern for congress the canadian and north american free trade agreem ents created perception among some observers that some interna tional borders were anachronis tic that they belonged to an earlier era of nationalism and that their usefulness was rapidly diminishinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31549crs4 9 stephen flynn america the vulnerable foreign affairs janfeb 2002 p 66 10 steven camarota census bureau eight million ille gal aliens in 2000 finding

seizure system federal authorities seized between 100 to 130 tons of cocaine per year for the last 5 years according to dea estimates federal authorities seized approximately 20 to 25 of the cocaine in transit to the united states either at the border or on the high seas 12 leslie glick guide to customs and trade laws fter the customs modernization act 2nd edition boston 1997 p 17while these agreements fostered international trade they did not cause the borders to disappear nor was that an intention instead the borders became in some ways more prominent as increased trade nd travel outpaced the institutions and infrastructures set up to accommodate and regulate those activities from 1985 to 2000 for example trade between the unite d states and canada increased from 1163 to 4098 billion yet the number of customs inspectors on the northern border reportedly decreased by about 259 despite significant increases in resour ces mostly deployed to the southern border particularly for inss border patrol an unauthoriz ed immigrant population of an estimated 7 to 9 million people10 and the continuing availability of illegal drugs of foreign origin11 were and continue to be clear i ndicators that current federal border management efforts ve had mixed results to date critics of the status quo pointed to fragmented authorities overlapping jurisdictions duplicated efforts and interagency rivalries consolidating border and tran sportation security missions the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 in effect makes counterterrorism the central mission for agencies tasked with bor der and transportation security prior to the homeland security act single government entity was charged with border management and trans portation security rather ndful of agencies was charged with what might be considered core bor der management missions those agencies included 1 the us customs service in the department of the treasury 2 the former immigration and naturalization servi ce ins in the department of justice and 3 the us coast guard in the depa rtment of transportation many other agencies like the bureau of consular affairs in the department of state and the animal and plant health inspection service aphis in the department of agriculture play integral roles in border ma nagement as well reportedly at least 40 federal agencies are involved in some aspect of border management since customs and other border management agen cies enforce over 400 laws on behalf of those agencies12 examination of the activities of these agencies indicates that federal border management missions can be broadly classified into fi ve overarching areas 1 immigration and nationality 2 international trade 3 environmental and health quarantine 4 port security and 5 border and coastal patrol as sixth categoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31549crs5 13 us commission on national security21st century roadmap for nati onal security imperative for change washington february 15

possibly dovetails with border mana gement missions as well the creation of the new department and its directorate of border and transportation security has raised questions among some analysts as to whether addressing border security from the an gle of counterterrorism alone without considering other federal objectives like stemming drug trafficking or facilitating legitimate cross border commerce is practical or reasonable clearly key challenge for policymakers charged with establishing the new department and its directorate of border and transportation s ecurity will be to develop an integrated strategic border management nd transportation security focus that effectively weaves counterterrorism into other federal border management nd transportation security related goals and activities13 building security law enforcement training and terrorism preparedness the homeland security act of 2002 also transfers several other federal entities to the directorate of bo rder and transportation security they include 1 the federal protective service fps formerly located in the general services administration 2 the federal law enforcement training center fletc formerly located in the department of the treasury and 3 the office of domestic preparedness odp formerly located in the office of justice programs at the department of justice the inclusion of fps fletc and odp will increase the new directorates responsibilities in the areas of federal building security training federal law enforcement officers and provi ding state and local first responders with training and assistance with special emphasis on terrorism preparedness these activities however are not viewed trad itionally as falling unde r either border or transportation security missions on the ot her hand locating them in the directorate of border and transportation security gives that directorate wider scope of responsibility that may permit new approaches in the area of combating terrorism ins consular affairs and immigration policy14 us immigration and nationa lity policy has historica lly balanced generous principles with restrictive priorities the generous principles emphasize the reunification of families the admission of immigrants with needed job skills the protection of refugees and asylees th promotion of opportunities for cultural exchange the facilitation of trade commerce and diplomacy and the diversity of admissions by the country of origin another principle of immigration and nationality policy is to pr ovide immigrants an opportunity to integrate fully into society along these lines immigrants legal permanent residents usually have the opportunity to become citizens through process known as naturalization the restrictive priorities of u s immigration law focus on pr otecting public health and welfare national security pub lic safety and labor marketshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31549crs6 15 for further analysis of the potential transfer of immigration

introduced in the senate both bills would have established separate immigration services and enforcement bureaus the senate bill however would have created an immigration director with ov erall

would have devolved to the respective bureau directors 17 it should be noted that any fy2002 numbers quot ed throughout the text of this paper are not actual final amounts reported for fy2002 these

washington wi nter 2002 p 105these principles and priorities are em bodied in the immigration and nationality act ina first codified in 1952 it is notew orthy that there is tension between the generous principles and restrictive priorities of immigration law this tension was difficult to reconcile in the daytoday operations of the two lead agencies charged with managing the migration of nonc itizens across us bordersjustices immigration and naturalization service and the state departments bureau of consular affairs this was in evid ence as congress considered proposals to establish department of homeland security while the homeland security act does not alter the fundamental tenets of us immigration and nationality policy the act abolishes ins creating separate bureaus for immigration enforcement and services it vests the secretary of home land security with responsibility for issuing regulations and policies related to visa issuance15 the former immigration and na turalization service ins t h homeland security act of 2002 pl 107 296 dismantles the ins and transfers immigration enforcement and service functions to dhs as two separate and distinct bureaus proposals to split ins had been considered by congress prior to the homeland security debate16 for fy2002 congress provided ins with 62 billion supporting 36117 funded permanent positions17 according to doj the fy2002 budget included 40 billion 26708 positions for enforcement programs over 14 billion 5707 positions for immigration services and 730 million 3702 pos itions for administration and s upport shared services18 the homeland security act establishes bureau of border security to be headed by an assistant secretary in the directorate of border and transportation security and it establishes bureau of citizenship and immigration services to be headed by director under the dhs deputy secretarys office the act explicitly prohibits the joining of these two bureaus in to single agency or the consolidationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31549crs7 19 section 471b of pl 107296 20 over 90 of border patr ol agents are deployed on the southwest border 21 according to the ins statistics office ins inspectors screened about 511 million persons for entry approximately 36 citizens and 64 noncitizens in fy2001 the noncitizens they found inadmissible number in the hundreds of thousands but represented less than 02 of all inspections annually 22 in the ins budget inspections was considered an enforcement program but organizationally inspections was considered an examinations or service program the homeland security act transfers the immigration inspections program to the bureau of border security in the dhs directorate of border and transportation securityof the functions or organizational units of these two bureaus19 the act also establishes director of shared serv ices under the deputy secretarys office coordination and information sharing between these two separate bureaus will be critical to the success of the directorates management of border and transportation security and the departments management of immigration and nationality policy immigration enforcement immigration enforcement functions previously carried out by ins include the following 1 patrol of the border between ports of entry 2 inspection of travelers seeking entr into the united states at ports of entry 3 investigation of violations of immigration law both at the border and within the interior of the united states 4 deten tion and removal of noncitizens found to be in violation of immigration law and 5 the collection of intelligence concerning immigrationrelated illegal activities the homeland security act transfers all former ins enforcement functions to the bureau of border security in the dhs directorate for border and transportation security between ports of entry the us border patrol formerly division of ins enforces us immigration law and other federal laws at the border border patrol agents often apprehend drug smugglers and others engaged in criminal activities but the principal focus of the border patrol has been to stem illegal immigration20 by compelling border crossers to present themselves for inspection at designated port of entry at ports of entry immigration inspectors formerly attached to ins examine and verify the travel documents of international travelers to determine their eligibility to enter the united states21 unlike other immigration enforcement functions the inspections function includes servicerelated activities as well for example immigration inspectors are often the first line of contact with the traveling public including noncitizens seeking to enter the united states for the first time on the other hand immigration inspectors sc reen foreign travelers by checking border lookout systems to determine whethe r they are listed as known terrorists or supporters of terrorist organizations22 special agents investigate immigration violations at the border since neither the border patrol nor immigration inspections has criminal investigations capability and in the interior of the united states as well such investigations include identifying criminal aliens for removal immigrationrelated document and benefit fraud alien smuggling and employer sanc tions federal law prohibits employers from knowingly hiring aliens who are unauthorized to work in the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31549crs8 23 term of art immigration officers in clude special agents immigration agents

visa entry reform act of 2002 pl 107173 116 stat 543immigration special agents inspectors and border patrol agents participate in interagency task forces like the joint terrorism task forces since only an immigration officer can determine immigrati on and nationality status as opposed to us marshal or fbi agent23 in addition small number of immigration special agents are stationed abroad immigration officers also oversee the tention and remova l of noncitizens many of whom cannot be released unde r the law until removed from the united states in recent years ins had come under intense criticism for not expeditiously deporting criminal aliens spite increased funding ins officials had maintained that the agency did not possess sufficient detention capacity to comply with the law furthermore immigration officers collect intelligence in regard to illegal immigrationrelated activities such as alien smuggling or largescale document and benefit fraud such inte lligence is often useful to other federal law enforcement agencies as well it is notable that immigration enforcement and service functions are linked for example immigration inspectors routinely query application processing databases maintained by former ins service programs in order to determine the immigration status of applicants for admission at in ternational ports of entry conversely immigration adjudicators routinely query immigration enforcement databases to determine whether noncitizen applicants for certain immig ration benefits have been or are in violation of immigration law in addition immigration adjudicators are also required to conduct criminal background and lookout system checks on certain applicants by checking with the fbi and the department of state along these lines moreover congress has recen tly mandated that all immigra tion databases service and enforcement systems be ma compatible interoperable24 immigration services the homeland security act transfers citizenship and immigration services previously administered by ins to bureau for citizenship and immigration services under the dhs office of deputy secretary the transferred functions consist of two major activities 1 the adjudication of immigration and naturalizationrelated benefits and 2 the consideration of refugee and asylum claims as part of the former ins adjudications and nationality program immigration adjudication officers and cl erks process familysponsored and employmentbased immigrant petitions to determine the eligibility of relatives of us citizens and immigrants legal permanent residents and employees of us businesses to be permanently admitted to the united states another significant workload for immigration adjudications officers is that associated with applications for adjustment of status to permanent residency for noncitizens who are already in the united states but who are otherwise eligible for immigrant status immigration officers also process temporary non immigrant employment and fiancee visahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31549crs9 25 in fy2001 ins received about 78 million applic ations and completed record 7 million but ins ended the year with nearly 49 million applications pending nearly 24 increase over the previous year 26 among other things section 221 of the ina 8 usc 1201 sets out that subject to limitations in the act and relevant regulations consular officers may issue immigrant and nonimmigrant visasapplications nonimmigrant visa adjustments and extensions of stay as well as many other immigration and naturalizationrelated applications25 the former ins office of international ffairs among other things oversaw the consideration of refugee claims abroad and asylum claims domestically essentially noncitizens are granted refugee and asylum status on the same basis under current law refugees and asylees are persons who are outside of their home country or the last country in which they bitually resided and are unabl to return to that country because of well founded fear of pers ecution on the basis of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion asylum applicants apply in the united states refu gee applicants apply from abroad located in eight offices around the country the asyl um corps previously part of ins accounts for small but high profile tion of the immigration services workload in addition immigration officers often asylum corps officers previously attached to ins are assigned to many foreign locations to consider refugee claims consular affairs ca visa and passport issuance the department of states bureau of consular affairs c manages three func tions two of which visa and passport issuance are related to border mana gement and security of these two functions however overseas visa issuance policy was the principal focus of border security proposals acted upon by congress the third function unrelated to border security includes services to us citizens abroad the homeland security act vests the secretary of homeland security with responsibility for issuing regula tions related to the granting or refusal of visas and for providing homeland security training to consular officers but limits that authority in that the secretary may not alter or re verse the decision of an individual consular officer to promote homeland security and pr ovide training to consular staff the act authorizes the secretary to station dhs staff at consular posts abroad by comparison the administrations proposal would have given the secretary of homeland security exclusive policy authority through the secretary of state over the granting or refusal of visas under section 104 of the ina unamende d by pl 107296 the secretary of state continues to hold the primary re sponsibility for the administration and enforcement of immigration law as it relates to the duties and functions of diplomatic and consular officers26 cas visa
