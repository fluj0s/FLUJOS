disabilities education act idea1 is both grants statute and civil rights statute it provides federal funding for the education of children with disabilities and requires as condition for the receipt of such funds the provision of free appropriate public education fape originally enacted in 1975 the act responded to increased awareness of the need to educate children with disabilities and to judicial decisions requiring that states provide an education for children with disabilities if they provided an education for children without disabilities 2 the statute contains detailed due process provisions including the right to bring suit in order to ensure the provision of fape idea states in part any party aggrieved by the findings and decision made under this subsection shall have the right to bring civil action with respect to the complaint presented pursuant to this section3 g14g152g160g142g155g561g5g152g158g155g157g561g6g142g140g146g156g146g152g151g156g561g146g151g561

disorder and in accordance with an individualized education program iep was placed in preschool with the concurrence of both his parents and the parma city school district when he was old enough for kindergarten his parents and school officials disagreed on his proper placement with his parents alleging that the schools proposed placement at pleasant valley elementary school was not appropriate to jacobs needs after rulings supporting the school districts determination by the hearing officer and statelevel review officer the winkelmans appealed pro to us district court the district court agreed with the administrative rulings 5 and the winkelmans appealed again without lawyer to the sixth circuit court of appeals the court of appeals issued an order dismissing the appeal unless an attorney was obtained within 30 days6 the winkelmans then sought and received stay of this order from the supreme court pending deci sion by the supreme court the supreme court granted certiorari on october 27 2006 and decided the case on may 21 2007 the sixth circuit decision in winkelman found that the preceding sixth circuit decision in cavanaugh ex rel cavanaugh v cardinal local school district7 was dispositive of the question of whether nonattorney parents of child with disability could represent their child in court cavanaugh held that parents could not represent their child in an idea action and that the right of child with disability to fape did not grant such right to the childs parents the sixth circuit in cavanaugh first noted that federal law allows individuals to act as their own counsel 8 but that parents generally cannot appear pro on behalf of their minor children because 1 20 usc 1400 et seq for more detailed overview of idea see crs report rs22590 the

parent or representative9 finding that this general principle was not abrogated by idea the sixth circuit observed that idea explicitly grants parents the right to due process hearing but in stark contrast the provision of the idea granting any party aggrieved access to the federal courts makes mention of parents whatsoever10 in addition the court observed that the intended beneficiary of idea is the child with disability not the parents and that although idea does grant parents some procedural rights these only serve to ensure the childs substantive right and do not provide the parents with substantive rights 11 g21g158g153g155g142g150g142g561g5g152g158g155g157g514g156g561g6g142g140g146g156g146g152g151g561g146g151g561

sixth circuits decision holding that parents have independent enforceable rights under idea and that they are entitled to prosecute idea claims on their own behalf in an opinion written by justice kennedy the court concluded that the rights idea grants parents encompass childs entitlement to free appropriate public education and that these rights are not limited to procedural or reimbursement issues justice kennedy observed that proper interpretation of the act requires consideration of the entire statutory scheme the argument made by the winkelmans was based on the premise that idea does not make parents merely guardians for their childrens rights but rather makes parents parties in interest in idea actions since the court accepted this premise it followed that the general statutory rule that party can represent his or her interests in court was applicable 12 therefore the court did not reach the issue of whether parents can appear pro on behalf of the interests of their minor children in idea cases in arriving at its holding the court examined ideas statutory language noting that one of the purposes of idea is to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected13 this language was found to refer to rights for both parents and children with disabilities similarly the court found that the establishment of procedural rights was required to ensure that the rights of children wi th disabilities and parents of such children are protected14 these provisions were found to support the finding that the parents of child with disability have particular and personal interest in the goals of idea and that idea includes provisions conveying rights to parents as well as to children these rights were found to be applicable not only to the administrative stage of an idea dispute but also to federal court procedures justice kennedy observed that the parents enjoy enforceable rights at the administrative stage and it would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme to bar them from continuing to assert these rights in federal court 9 cavanaugh ex rel cavanaugh v cardinal local school 409 f3d 753 755 6th cir 2005 quoting

only procedural but also substantive rights the fact that some provisions of idea specifically delineate certain rights for parents does not create an inference that parents are excluded by implication when child is mentioned finding that the text and structure of idea empowers parents to bring challenges on broad range of issues parents were seen as having an independent stake in not just the procedural guarantees but also the substantive guarantees justice kennedy concluded idea does not differentiate through isolated references to various procedures and remedies between the rights accorded to children and the rights accorded to parents it was argued that granting these rights would increase the costs to the states because parents may bring more lawsuits if they do not have the financial constraint of paying for an attorney however the court found that these concerns were not sufficient to support an argument under the spending clause that idea failed to provide clear notice before new condition or obligation was placed on recipient of funds in addition justice kennedy observed that idea specifically allows courts to award attorneys fees to prevailing educational agency when parent has brought an action for an improper purpose such as to harass to cause unnecessary delay or to needlessly increase the cost of litigation 15 justice scalia joined by justice thomas concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part these justices would have held that parents have the right to proceed pro under idea when they seek reimbursement for private school tuition or for violations of the parents procedural rights however justices scalia and thomas would not have allowed such suits when the suits sought judicial determination that the childs free appropriate public education was substantively inadequate g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 nancy lee jones legislative attorney
