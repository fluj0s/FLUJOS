vienna 1450 classified by mark scheland counselor for nuclear policy reasons 14 b and d 1 s summary hfac staffers richard kessler and david fite received from iaea secretariat november 10 information on the iran case that tracked with the tone of the subsequent director generals reporting on iran to the board of governors the staffdel heard that contact with iran over possible military dimensions of the nuclear program was at an absolute stalemate according to safeguards regional division director herman nackaerts iaea inspectors first visit to the enrichment facility under construction near qom had run predictably but without extraordinary responsiveness on irans part the secretariat was still trying to understand the motivation to build the plant as now designed nackaerts described the frustrating limitations of irans cooperation with the agency and the staffdel deduced that iranian officials held back because they were uncertain about what lines of inquiry the iaea was best equipped to exploit questioning thendg elbaradeis remark to media that the agency had found nothing to worry about in qom staffdel asked if the secretariat would report on how it judged the plant did or did not fit into irans publicly explained nuclear program nackaerts expressed appreciation for the precision and usefulness of ussupplied information in the qom case and generally 2 c summary contd on syria nackaerts said the secretariat had told damascus its first explanation for the presence of anthropogenic uranium at the miniature neutron source reactor was not credible further the secretariat still could not yet present the case for how what was being built at dair alzour fit in as part of syrian program or part of someone elses program on dprk iaeaexpos tariq rauf said the iaea when it could would ultimately have to go back to the early 1990s to reconstruct accountancy of plutonium and could not accept political compromise setting material off to the side to get to finding of diversion would take several years and extensive resources and forensics 3 sbu contd treating technical cooperation the staffdel received the same briefing on the safeguards departments project review process and internal database that was provided to gao review team in 2008 iaea external relations director rauf asserted we are not denial organization staffdel related how segments of the gao report had reduced congressional confidence in the efficiency of tc us national labs were afforded too little time to review projects for our national decisionmaking on their merit and proliferation risk secretariat also described hindrances it faces in having and national development officials recognize and integrate nuclear applications 4 sbu contd the staffdel also engaged p5plus1 heads of mission over lunch on the means to draw or impel iran to open up on its nuclear program and on dynamics in vienna between blocs of member states end summary fordowqom and iran pmd frustration but good support from the us 5 u house foreign affairs committee hfac majority staff director richard kessler and professional staff member david fite staffdel spent ninety minutes with iaea staff on november 10 principal issues were safeguards verification in iran and syria the screening of iaea technical cooperation tc projects for proliferation risk and tc department efforts to improve project design and integration into national and development activities staffdel affirmed to secretariat officials that the hfac under chairman berman was strongly supportive of the iaea put emphasis on counterproliferation issues in countries of concern indeed was weighing legislation to impose further us sanctions on iran had advocated an increase in nadr funding for extrabudgetary contributions to the iaea including for the safeguards analytical laboratory and supported getting the us up to date on payment of its assessments to the iaeas regular budget following the meeting at the iaea staffdel consulted ambassador and mission staff and had working lunch with p5plus1 heads of mission focused on iran and the dynamics of multilateral unvie vien 00000540 002 of 005 diplomacy in vienna staffdels unvie program followed day of consultations with austrian officials reftel 6 sbu iaea safeguards department operations b aor mideast south asia parts of europe the americas and all nuclear weapons states director herman nackaerts briefed staffdel on the inspection he had led few weeks before to the recently disclosed fordow fuel enrichment plant near qom in iran nackaerts said iranian officials had been open to allowing inspectors access the secretariat was still trying to understand he said why iran would build this facility scaled as it was for 3000 centrifuges in contrast to the much large natanz facility it was positive nackaerts pointed out that fordow was now under safeguards he noted that the iaea had at least two safeguards inspectors at work in iran every day of the year and would henceforth plan to visit fordow regularly asked how complete the plant was or when it would be operational nackaerts said the information we got from member states proved to be very precise on this point asked about permission to take samples at fordow nackaerts replied that iranian officials had permitted the inspectors to perform the same safeguards procedures they typically undertook at natanz 7 s staffdel asked if the agency enjoyed full access to the arak ir40 plant nackaerts related there had been access for 12month period but normal access in august and october 2009 however the iranians claim they cannot go back on the decision of their parliament and hence grant the iaea visit but do not call it design information verification on possible military dimensions pmd nackaerts said the secretariats approach was to follow lines of inquiry that could involve use of nuclear material for example the documents treating uranium metal or green salt the iranians he said in tone conveying his skepticism asserted the uranium metal document was mistakenly included in packet of information they received from the aq khan network but was nothing iran had asked for or used the green salt documentation iran dismissed as forgery indeed nackaerts went on iran replied basically on the form of documents not on their substance the secretariat had not been impressed by the 117page rejoinder iran had provided to the initial presentation of pmd documentation it had told iran the information hung together too much for it all to have bee fabricated and asked that if some of the documentation were doctored iranian officials should show the secretariat where the truth ends since august 2008 when ahmadinejad personally shut off nackaertss previously approved visit to workshops indicated in the documentation nackaerts concluded there remained highlevel decision not to cooperate staffdel member fite took from this that the iranians were holding back because they dont know where any opening will lead nackaerts agreed saying they knew that every question they answered would bring another question 8 s fite alluded to thendg elbaradeis remarks of few days before in us media to the effect that the inspectors had found nothing to worry about in fordow acknowledging the practical meaning of this remark that there were centrifuges or nuclear material present fite nevertheless regretted the headline and asked if the dgs formal report to board members note subsequently released as gov200974 deresticted by the board november 27 and available to the public at wwwiaeaorg would deal with how qom fits or does not fit into irans explained nuclear program nackaerts replied we will identify the issues were working he went on that understanding the timeline of fordows development was hindered by irans practice never to involve people who really know the facts or the governments intentions in discussion with the agency the officials with whom inspectors meet clearly are steered by unseen observers who send notes to the iranian interlocutors during meetings iran recorded the meetings he added but did not permit the iaea to do so further the secretariat never received original design documents but ones produced for the secretariat that were technically true to the facilities they found upon inspection against this iranian practice nackaerts added the secretariat received very precise information from member states that helped inspectors decide what to ask about the organization of this information was good and while the agency was satisfied it had inquired if more information could be shared with the agency not necessarily for release to iran he said syria stalemate unvie vien 00000540 003 of 005 9 sbu the syria case nackaerts said was starting to look like iran in that the government provided good cooperation on some areas but presented stalemate on others the secretariat challenged syrias proposed explanation for the presence of uranium at dair alzoural kibar ie that israeli depleted uranium munitions could be the source but the inquiry was at roadblock syrian officials had been told their first explanation for anthropogenic uranium at the miniature neutron source reactor mnsr was not credible and the agency had inquired what nuclear material syria could have had that was not previously declared overall the iaea still did not understand meaning it could not yet present the solid case for how dair alzour fit in as part of syrian nuclear program or part of someone elses program return to dprk safeguards in india 10 sbu asked how quickly iaea inspectors could resume work in north korea if readmitted by the government tariq rauf of iaea external relations and policy coordination expo observed that the last resumption had taken week for technical setup reactivation of cameras etc safeguards operations division had program set out for what steps to undertake under circumstances the dprk may let us back in rauf continued that the agency would to go back to the early 1990s plutonium revelation to reconstruct material accountancy when most recently in the dprk the iaea had been monitoring facility shutdown processes but not implementing npt safeguards on dprk material the agency could not accept political compromises that would set some nuclear material off to the side thendg elbaradei had called for implementation of the additional protocol in dprk but even if pyongyang cooperated fully it would take several years and much in the way of resources and forensics to be able to get to finding of diversion 11 sbu asked about progress toward safeguards implementation in india rauf confirmed the goi had submitted formal list of facilities that was not document the agency would characterize as formal declaration under its safeguards agreement india was under mandatory timeline to make its declaration as it was not an npt signatory comment raufs characterization was flat wrong mission had learned from the safeguards department three weeks before this meeting that india had officially notified two new facilities raps 5 and 6 under its 2008 safeguards agreement that surveillance systems had been installed and the facilities were under safeguards end comment scrutinizing and promoting iaea technical cooperation 12 u renaud chatelus of the safeguards division of information management sgim acquainted staffdel with iaea screening of technical cooperation tc projects for their potential to afford access to sensitive technologies grounded in 1979 agency information circular infcirc267 the practice is to focus on projects related to enrichment heavy water production reprocessing of spent fuel and plutonium or mixed oxide fuel chatelus said sgim reviewed projects submitted project approved individual procurement actions and overall implementation of projects reviews are conducted completely inhouse he said in reply to question using the same powerpoint slides that were presented to gao review team in 2008 chatelus illustrated with screen shots from the agencys staff accessonly database the system of flagging projects for compliance with infcirc 267 compliance with infcirc 540 additional protocol transfer of sensitive items on the nuclear suppliers group or dualuse lists general interest or possible relation to safeguarded facility in subsequent discussion of the impact of screening and member states sense of entitlement to tc expos tariq rauf affirmed we are not denial organization 13 u staffdel member fite observed that segments of the gao report treating transfers to state sponsors of terrorism as well as on program management had reduced congressional confidence about tc fite said he had approached appropriations staff about using supplemental funding bill unvie vien 00000540 004 of 005 to resolve slow us payment of assessments and do more for the agency but was rebuffed because the gao report on tc had poisoned the waters apart from political objections to certain tc recipients benefitting from us funding he added persisting achilles heel was that us national labs were afforded too little time to review projects for our national decisionmaking on their merit and proliferation risk tc department representative johannes seybold replied that the agency aimed to provide member states six weeks time for review but was also at the mercy of requesting states providing the relevant project information just the compendium of project titles and short descriptions became very thick document in each biennial cycle seybold went on and the agency was struggling with some member states national policies to be able to go beyond this level of transparency 14 u staffdels meeting with secretariat officials concluded in an exchange with seybold tcs section head for strategy and partnerships about the iaeas awkward position in development efforts coordinated by the or by developing countries national institutions seybold laid out the following the iaeas cooperation with tc recipient states occurs through national liaison officers generally in the atomic energy commission or government ministry responsible for nuclear power or radiological sources generally neither the iaea nor the corresponding national entity is participant in development team or host government deliberations about development in the recipient country twothirds of tc projects address development issues for which the iaea is not the responsible lead agency in the system eg water quality and availability food security climate in many cases national authorities and the team responsible for these areas in given country lack awareness of iaea capabilities andor they maintain distance from things nuclear seybold related agency efforts to integrate with these authorities through the undaf development assistance framework process and other partnering efforts staffdel expressed encouragement for bringing nuclear applications to greater impact in the development field p5plus1 ambassadors regret iranian paralysis on trr depict grim dynamic with g77nam 15 c staffdel was the guests of honor at lunch hosted by the ambassador with his counterparts from china germany russia and the uk and the french charge daffaires kessler and fite laid out hfacs interest and chairman bermans supportive posture toward the agency as they had for secretariat staff opening discussion of iran uk ambassador simon smith said the iranian answer on the elbaradeibrokered deal on refueling the tehran research reactor trr had to be yes or not waffling as it had been german ambassador ruediger luedeking posited that the us administration had confounded iranian internal processes and the latest eu3 proposal had cornered iran agreeing that iran faced an imperative between yes and luedeking observed they cant answer hfac staff director kessler noted the committee had tried to follow up larijani approach conveyed one year before for meeting with chairman berman but found that the iranians backed off 16 c russian ambassador alexander zmeyevskiy asserted that confidentiality was major concern for iran he noted its trr counterproposals either to keep its leu on its territory under iaea safeguards until released in exchange for fuel rods or to swap outgoing leu piecemeal for incoming fuel assemblies moving beyond the trr issue uk ambassador said he was severely disappointed that member states had been unable to apply consequences for the breaking of rules of the organization we needed to convince some other member states he continued that tolerating rule breaking as on qom and code 31 of the subsidiary arrangement of irans safeguards agreement risked bringing the organization into discredit staffdel member fite asked if irans arab neighbors were among the problem interlocutors in vienna he asserted that officials of arabian peninsula countries told the congress they see iran as an existential threat while they may seek the cover of international signals or sanctions imposed by others they say they do want action against iran 17 c segueing from iran to dprk chinese ambassador hu xiaodi said the main difference between the cases was that progress with dprk had been achieved when the north koreans unvie vien 00000540 005 of 005 wanted something specific whereas he hu had never heard iranian officials say that they wanted settlement or that they wanted anything specific although we did not at present know how to reach deal with iran hu concluded we were not in the worst situation in which iran explicitly does want something nuclear weapons asked if he genuinely thought the dprk would give up its weapons program for aid hu said hope as opposed to think ambassador davies seriously questioned that pyongyang would give up weapons capability in exchange for significant material improvement in our relations as the government would likely calculate it had been its possession of weapons that won the concessions 18 sbu ambassador turned the discussion to the dynamic between groups of member states as illustrated in the ongoing discussion of technical cooperation project to advance iaea use of results based management the german ambassador observed that nam positions on many issues were characterized by myths and they were clearly being dictated by iran and egypt ambassador davies asked if the dynamic was further charged by states beginning to suspect that the us seriously intends to strengthen the agency in all its functions with the uncertain shifts in practice and distribution of resources and clout that could mean staffdel lead kessler said the congressional perception was one of lightning change from the last administration to the present one in us approaches to the iaea to development assistance globally and to multilateralism german ambassador agreed and said this was complication for nam states that know they are the immobile ones now yet tc was sacred cow and the nams impulse was to reject illegitimate intrusion into its distribution 19 sbu french charge philippe merlin discouraged staffdel from expecting diplomatic gains say in the npt review through greater generosity on iaea peaceful use programs tc is the price we pay he said for developing countries acquiescence toward the safeguards regime the thing we really want fite asked if reasoned discussion with development officials in capitals about making tc deliver more impact could translate into different instructions to the obstreperous missions in vienna german ambassador took the view that any effort to change tc would be seen in capitals as per bad it was more advisable to advocate to nam states what their own interests in the safeguards regime were uk ambassador agreed there were points to be scored by asking nam capitals about tc effectiveness he added that the uk government doesnt give two hoots about tc given the small funding level from the uk energy ministry in comparison to britains official development assistance tc was also in the uk view the price we pay for the iaea we want 20 u staffdel did not review this report davies
