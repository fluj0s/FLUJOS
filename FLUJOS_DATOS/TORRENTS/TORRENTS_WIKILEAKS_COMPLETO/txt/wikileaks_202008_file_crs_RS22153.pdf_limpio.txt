specific safety components of the surface transportation infrastru cture eg hazardelimination investments or gradecrossing improvements traffic safety progra ms typically refer to efforts to improve driver or pedestrian behavior but sometimes these terms are used interchangeably according to nhtsa3 motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death in the united states for people ages 3 to 33 despite thes sobering statistics there is cause for optimism the lowest fatality rate ever recorded 148 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled was achieved in 20034 nhtsa reports that alcoholrelate d fatalities declined significantly in 2003 the first drop in that level since 19995 preliminary 2004 nhtsa data indicate further improvement over the 2003 fatality ra and the number of alcoholrelated fata lities furthermore survey data indicate that the national average safetybelt use rate hit 80 in 2004 the hi ghest level in the nations history nhtsa estimates that 15200 lives and 50 billi on in economic costs associated with traffic related crashes injuries and d eaths are saved every year when this high level of seat belt use prevails6 to help continue these improvements in safety trends and make progress toward many other national objectives the house and senate have pa ssed their respective versions of hr 3 these bills reaut horize various federal surface transportation programs including those that significantly affect diverse safety challenges as envisioned in these bills congress seeks to revise some of the existing highway and traffic safety grants that are provided to the states and to create some new grants affecting safety7 because many states and local govern ments are still struggling with tight budgets federal grants to enhance safety play an important role in promoting safety these bills also would catalyze significant changes in some federal safety programs and regulations because of their financial impacts and life savi ng potential legislative changes to federal grants and regulations are of fundamental importance to the states local governments industry and other users of th surface transportation system safety concerns resonate through numerous provisions of hr 3 essentially all groups support safetyoriented legislation th at saves lives but the means favored to accomplish this objective vary the diversity of interest groups and their safetyoriented goals is substantial this diversity is reflected by legislative provisions intended to improve driver education motorcycle safe ty rural road safety state traffic safety information systems and commercial drivers licensing programs and information systems as well as child transportation safety conference committee will try to reconcile numerous differences between the house and senate versions of hr 3 in specific this committee will specify funding levels for the core federal safety programs administered by the fhwa nhtsa and fmcsa also its members will decide on the purposes eligibility criteria and structure of various safety grants provided to the stat to large extent the final statute will determine the availability of federal funds provided to s upplement state investments inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22153crs3 8 the number of motorcyclist fatalities rose from 3270 in 2002 to 3661 in 2003 an increase of 12 with preliminary 2004 nhtsa da ta indicating 3927 such deaths 9 for example for the highway safety improv ement program specified under sections 130 and continuedhighway safety infrastructure as well as the resources for such traffic safety activities as sobriety road checks and safety belt buckle up campaigns of pivotal importance is the funding formula used to determine how mu ch money state receives from the federal highway trust fund to improve its highway in frastructure as well as the grant criteria that determine whether state qualifies to r eceive incentive funds to improve its occupant protection and alcohol countermeasur antidrunk driving programs in the reauthorization bill congress faces the challenge of providing the legislative framework to improve upon federal programs gr ants and regulations influencing specific areas of highway and traffic safety to different degrees the bills reflect the desire for continued efforts or improved laws to encourage more peopl to buckle up and to deal with repeat trafficsafety offenders who c ontinue to violate drivingwhileintoxicated dwi or drivingundertheinfluence dui prohibitions both versions of hr 3 include authority to establish new grant program to improve motorcycle safety the substantial increase in the number of fata lities of motorcyclists in recent years has underpinned support to enhance state motorc ycle training and outreach efforts with federal monies8 both bills also respond to those who seek changes in existing federal motor carrier programs and regulations by creating new grant program to improve traffic information safety systems both b ills respond to pleas from the safety community for resources that can enhance decision maki ng including improved safety data systems and driver records despite many similarities there also are major difference between the two bills for example the senate version of hr 3 specifically addresses the mobility and safety challenges posed by some olde r drivers and authorizes 2 million in each year of fy2006 through fy2009 for this purpose the house bill does not include this provision competition for f unds is intense among various sa fety programs key challenge will be to find additional funds to increase federal support for safe tyoriented activities and to find the appropria balance to meet such diverse objectives as improving safety retaining state flexibility and ensuring accountability decision makers also face the difficult hurdle of balancing funds primarily intended to promote safety against funds needed to meet other surface transportation objectives such as increasing mobility and reducing environmental impact s of highway operations key safety provisions included in hr 3 infrastructure and highway safety both versions of hr 3 authorize billions of dollars of federalhighwa program funds intended to imp rove the design throughput and overall performance and safety of the highway infrastructure these bills authorize increased transit funding that is intended to reduce the growth in the number of vehicles on the highway system and thus also impact traffic safety both bills authorize new grant program called the highway safety improvement program that would fund an array of safety investments including funds to enhance safety at highwayrail grade crossings and reduce road hazards9 both bills establish safe routes to schoolhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22153crs4 9 continued 152 the house version of hr 3 authoriz 630 million for fy2005 645 million for fy2006 660 million for fy2007 680 million for fy2008 and 695 million for fy2009 the senate bill authorizes for each year fy2005 through fy 2009 roughly 132 billion for its version of the highway safety improvement program specified under section 148 10 house version of hr 3 author izes specifically for the safe routes to school program 150 million for fy2005 175 million for each of fy2006 fy2007 and fy2008 and 200 million for fy2009 the senate version specifies that be fore apportioning amounts to carry out section 148 the highway safety improvement program fo r fiscal year the secretary shall set aside and use roughly 657million to carry out th safe routes to school program 11 under section 1403 the house version of hr 3 authorizes for the high risk rural road safety improvement program 105 million for fy2005 110 million for fy2006 120 million for fy2007 125 million for fy2008 and 130 million for fy2009 12 for example funds are used to formulate and implement various i nnovative traffic safety programs or campaigns sponsored by nhtsa these efforts seek to reduce impaired driving increase occupant protection collect and analyze sa fety data and sponsor demonstrations to test continuedprogram with funds for the planning desig n and construction of projects to encourage children to bike and wa lk to school safely10 both bills call for improved regulations regarding the safety of highway construction workers if the senate version prevails states also would be required to develop and implement strategic plan that identifies and analyzes highway safety problems and opport unities and that results in strategies or projects to reduce such problems under the senate bill states also would be required to adopt performancebased goals that focus resour ces on areas of greatest need and establish and implement schedule fo r conducting safety projects for hazards correction and prevention the house bill authorizes new high risk rural road safety improvement program11 the set aside for highway safety infrastructure projects now specified as part of the surface transportation progra m is proposed to be eliminated fhwas and other highway research and development activities affecting safety the conferees are debating the amount of funding authorized for fhwas and other core research development and technology deployment activities safety is an integral component of these ac tivities research and technical guidance and outreach activities regarding pedestrian grad crossing and intersection concerns and work to improve the visibility of road sign age are illustrative activitie s likely to be funded as envisioned in both bills the reauthoriza tion statute will include funding amounts for the local technical assistance program the national highway institute and the university transportation research or centers program each of these training or technical assistance efforts s important safety components nhtsas section 403 activity both bills would increase significantly the amount of funds authorized for nhtsas section 403 pr ovision which provides the working capital that this agency uses to addr ess behavioral as opposed to vehicular issues congress historically has provided separate authorization for these activities and in recent years that funding amount was roughl 72 million per year nhtsa uses section 403 funds for variety of purposes including to enter into cooperative arrangements with numerous partners to achieve common safe ty objectives or to increase fundamental knowledge regarding traffic safety12 there is much evidence that the studies andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22153crs5 12 continued or evaluate innovative safety measures nhtsa uses section 403 funds to help address key current issues in traffic safety such as those pe rtaining to older drowsy or fatigued drivers 13 see crs report rs21368 traffic safety reauthor ization of section 403 14 for section 403 the house version of hr 3 authorizes 75 million each year for fy2006 through fy2009 while the senate version au thorizes approximately 142 million each year during this period these amounts are not comparable for several reasons eg the senate bill would fund public information activities to support high visibility enforcement campaigns out of section 403 funds while this activity would be funded separately in the house bill 15 with these funds nhtsa issues new safety re gulations checks vehicles for compliance with its regulations investigates vehicle safety cerns conducts an array of crashworthiness tests studies various safety systems and determines its vehicle rollover ratings nhtsa investigators develop technical information that can help cons umers better evaluate aspects of vehicle safety performance the total amount of funding author ized and subsequently appropriated affects the ability of nhtsa to conduct these activities and t hus the quality of the consumer information the agency provides as well as the effectiveness of federal oversight of vehicle safety 16 for example an incentive grant can be awarde d to state if it adopts certain measures to improve occupant protection or state may lose some of its flexibility on how it can spend certain monies it receives from the federal highway trust fund eg state may be forced to transfer some of its highway construction funds into hazard elimination investments or alcohol impaired driving countermeasures if it does not enforce certain laws as penalty portion of states apportioned federal highway trust funds can be taken away if it does not enforce law which determines the threshold needed for some one to be convicted of drivingwhileintoxicated or an equivalent per offensetechnical assistance resulting from secti on 403 funds have improved state and local governmental traffic safety activities and have been used as basis for strengthening related laws13 the house and senate bills differ s ubstantially on the amount of funds set aside for section 403 funding and on specified purposes for these funds14 nhtsas vehicle safety and consumeroriented activities t h reauthorization statute may set funding level for nhtsas operations and research account which includes support for its vehicle safety programs15 s p r t f t h reauthorization process the conference committee is considering whether to require nhtsa to issue variety of vehicle safety regulations the administration maintains that congressional mandates take away nht sas ability to prio ritize its work while others maintain that such directives and d eadlines are needed and expedite the rulemaking process or help promote accountability traffic safety grants penalties and transfers strategies are incorporated into federal law to encourage states to adopt and maintain certain traffic safety laws or programs three approaches include incentives transfers or loss of certain highway monies16 the house and senate bills would modify the specifications for law regarding repeat intoxicated driver offense that any state must enforce to avoid transfer provision the senate bill also would extend transfer provision to affect any state not enforcing laws that impose certain penaltie s on an individual convicted of dwi or dui with blood alcohol concentra tion level of 015 percent or greater or driving with license suspended because of dui convicti on the senate bill w

provided for various grants to statesopen alcoholic beverage container or the consumption of any alcoholic beverage in the passenger area of any motor vehicle based on hr 3 congress is likely to change the amount of funding and the eligibility criteria for various traffic safety grants suppor t exists for increasing funding for the section 402 state and community tr affic safety section 410 drunk driving countermeasures and section 405 occupa nt protection enhancement grants17 the senatepassed bill places substa ntial emphasis on rewarding t hose states that adopt and enforce primary seat belt laws whereas the housepassed bill allows state to qualify for section 405 funding even if it does not enact and enforce such law motor carrier safety both the house and senate versions of hr 3 authorize on average slightly more than 500 million per year for fy2006 through fy2009 for the operations and the various grant programs administered by the fmcsa these bills also specify new required rulemakings affecting motor carriers and changes to agency enforcement authorities and programs18 the conference committee is now deciding the amount of federal funding to support federal and state progra ms or enforcement activities various programmatic changes to improve these efforts and future regulatory actions based on the bills passed the final reauthor ization law will set funding levels for grants for 1 the motor carrier safety ssistance program which supplements state funds for enforcement of commercial motor carrier safety regu lations and hazardous materials transportation
