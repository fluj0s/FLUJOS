d 1 u this is an action request see paragraph 2 2 snf post requests fbi recall information about jamiat ulemaiislam juif leader fazlur rehman noted in reftel reftel indicates that an individual fasil ul rehman believed to be associated with jamaateislami ji is behind the march 2008 bombing in islamabad reftel then suggests that fasil ul rehman refers to political party leader fazlur rehman of the juif post requests that fbi recall this information from all hardcopy and database records due to discrepancies and errors in the report 3 c prominent pakistan politician fazlur rehman is not associated with the ji but instead leads his own political party the juif from 20022007 the two parties allied with other religious parties in the coalition muttahida majliseamal mma however the juif and ji retained separate leadership structures as well as separate political objectives and methods 4 c fazlur rehmans juif is conservative deobandi religious party that recently has joined the new pakistan peoples party ppp led government rehman more politician than mullah has been prominent and legitimate figure in pakistani politics since the 1980s rehman has publicly denounced terrorist attacks but prefers to use negotiations rather than military force against militants although he is known to have contacts with taliban and their sympathizers he has negotiated with religious militants on the governments behalf garnering him criticism from the more hardline religious sectors rehman also has been frequent and cooperative interlocutor with post and professes his support for cooperation with the united states 5 c the ji is religious party that appeals to narrow sector of the educated conservative urban middle class ji which has vibrant student wing began as movement for social change based on sharia the ji party policy does not support violence as means to achieve their political agenda however the party quietly has supported jihad in afghanistan and kashmir by providing recruits from their student corps the party does not support violence perpetuated within pakistan such as the recent attack on the restaurant in islamabad in addition fasil ul rehman and fazlur rehman are extremely common pakistani names making it impossible to accurately identify the individual in reftel with the prominent juif politician bodde
