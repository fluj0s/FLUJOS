not for distribution outside cru 1cru strategic review summary of external input introduction as part of the first phase of the cru strategic review external input was solicited to aid in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of cru as perceived by external individuals input was also sought on issues to be addressed by the second phase current opportunities that arent being exploited future opportunities and future threats that need to be overcome series of questions on the following topics was designed current assessment strengths and weaknesses of cru 1 our research and data including monitoring activity 2 our postgraduate teaching and training activity 3 our identity relationships and reputation 4 our working environment forward looking development of climate science funding and cru 1 development of the climate science field 2 development of priorities for the funding of climate science 3 development of cru answers to these questions were sought in july 2002 from 30 individuals selected from the following sectors cru visiting fellows env uea national and international funding agencies and uknonuk based climate scientistsorganisations in each case individualswere asked subset of questions most appropriate to their particular sectorrelationship with cru it was stressed that all responses would be confidential to the strategic review team and cru board fifteen individuals have provided input to date and their responses are summarised in this document overview of responses the relatively high response rate and the considerable thought that most respondents put into answering the questions suggests that people feel positively about cru and its future this is also reflected in the overall nature of the responses which indicate that cru is widely and highly regarded taking all responses together the full range of crus past and current activities is acknowledged the responses are thus largely reassuring and do not contain any major surprises so far as our current strengths and weaknesses are concerned although number of interesting insights require some thought while there is good agreement amongst respondents on our strengths there is more disagreement on our weaknesses and issues suchas the optimal size of cru and our identity in relation to other climate institutions views on future developments are more diverse and in few cases contradictory or ambiguous they indicate that there are many future opportunities for cru but the strategy review team acknowledges that these will require careful thought and work if we are to take full advantage of them in general the more critical remarks about cru tend to come from within uearather than from respondents who are more removed from cru in all cases however the positive comments on both current and forward looking issues outweigh the negative thus while number of weaknesses are identified below each one was only identified by one or two respondents whereas the majority of respondents mentioned data provision for example as an area of valued researchnot for distribution outside cru 2cru strengths reputation and standing high national eg top 2 european eg top 5 and world eg top 10 rating cru as whole has good reputation although individuals eg key figures with long standing international reputations are also seen as important good involvement in eu projects and the ipcc which is what counts distinct reputation based on 30year history starting with lamb etc eg historical assets continuity and experience in studies of past climate reflects latest thinking on climate change and is seen as independent and good at critical interpretation reputation tends to be focused in specific areas but good links with other key institutions eg hadley centre enhance comprehensive image individuals who are members of nationalinternational expert and professional bodiespanels being part of 5 and multidisciplinary department valued research data being involved in collection collation analysis and dissemination gives added authority data sets instrumental palaeo climate model gcmrcm and scenario and expertise in these are all highly valued provision of the data people want eg at useful spatialtemporal scales ie global and regional definitive ukeuropean data sets but also data for lessstudied regions iepolar southern hemisphere nao and enso data sets historical and palaeoclimatology data and reconstructionanalysis strengths are in review and statistical analysis rather than physicallybased modelling climate scenarios including model evaluation and downscaling simple climate modelling links between modelling and impacts communities climate impacts and applied climatology eg insurance industry extreme events analysis of trends eg climate monitoring and extremes specific projects eg link tiempo ukcip98 and contribution to ukcip02 cru as communicator and interpreter of climate science good communicator of science to scientists and of key issues and facts to public ie contribution to public understanding of science and outreach efforts good publicity and excellent media presence maintain our public profile widelycited publications and reports important role in interpreting vast subject area for others eg small organisations excellent website not too many frills but easily accessible to scientists and others eg information sheets and posters centre of excellence for research training good phd culture and opportunity for studentsresearchers to work with key scientists postgraduate training essential for ensuring succession and improving international reputation and research output production of worldclass scientists now making contributions elsewherenot for distribution outside cru 3cru weaknesses reputation and standing tendency to be perceived as defensive territorial isolationist and dismissive seen as too academic with emphasis on papers rather than projects too complacent about reputation and identity difficulty of maintaining leading reputation against other bigger institutions eg tyndall centre and hadley centre crus input is not always acknowledgedcredited and this may worsen as attention moves to decisionmaking rather than fundamental climate research better recognition internationally than within uea research areas need to be more aggressive in promoting and obtaining core funding for data activities doubtful that cru can meet need for commercial data products difficult for cru to access and exploit business opportunities climate scenarios work is not promoted sufficiently work is less policyrelevant than in the past tendency to focus on past successes rather than on innovation strategic position and resources underresourced compared to bigger institutions lack of strategic alliances need to improve links with nerc atmospheric scientists in ncas particularly those involved in climate modelling eg provision of data for model validation failure to anticipate changes that have occurredare occurring in science and structures time spent searching for research funds means lack of time for wider activitiesperspective insecurity of contract research staff lack of strategic direction and planned programme of activity in part due to management structure failure to switch from reactive to proactive mode of operation as the competition has increased and the subject area matured identity confusion about relationships with other climate institutions ie tyndall centre hadley centre and ukcip and the university ie env cserge etc is maintaining separate identity possibleworth the effort or should relevant uea institutions merge eg to achieve economies of scale communication training and working environment website could be improved eg more transparent data provision better updating of historical data need to keep up with slicker sites eg data visualisation more general background on climate and climate change eg frequentlyasked questions the need to communicate effectively is underestimated in terms of effort and money particularly in face of activities elsewhere eg email newsletters produced by other groups publications are not significant in terms of editorials and review articles eg nature science new scientist research training activities strain resources poor communication at the srara level with uea scientists working in associated areas poor and expensive transport links to norwich are offputtingnot for distribution outside cru 4general threats identified as threats but some could be viewed as opportunities risk of cru research base becoming too narrow broader base is needed to develop the new generation of scientists and to keep up with the trend towards earth systems andmultidisciplinary research ie towards broaderbased research contrasts with risk of having shallow depth in lots of disciplines which accomplishes little climate change is dissipating as distinct area of research in terms of climate change policy fields are spreading beyond crus strengths eg into energy adaptation andmitigation sustainability and development as climate change becomes accepted research efforts may focus more and more on mitigation and adaptation and climate scenarios will become less important danger of marginalisation as other bigger more competitive and integrated climate centres develop eg development of escience and virtual transnational entities commercialisation of data and forecast products general opportunities potential business opportunities not defined by respondent offering training in current cru areas eg climate impacts climate statistics and extreme event statistics and new areas eg remote sensing model coupling and parameterisation data assimilation process modelling integrated modelling climate research management development of unrealised potential for cru with env would require less defensiveness and building of more partnerships use of nonacademic staff to develop more commercial activities networking of smaller groups and development of strategic alliances there will be room for institutions of all sizes especially with it developments bringing big science to small institutions increase in computer capabilities will open up new possibilities for higherresolution and longertimescale modelling potential development of funding greater importance of european funding agencies current nerc strategy should be favourable to cru for the next 510 years and nerc will continue to fund basic research smaller funding bodies may seek to collaborate to share funding costs already beginning to happen eg local authorities unfcc should have large funds available for research on mitigation and adaptation noninsurance finance organisations may grow more interested in funding research governments will focus on predicting the impacts of climate change increased stakeholder involvement involvement of social scientists will be sought by funders in any work resulting in public decisionmaking thus greater emphasis on crossdisciplinarity and sciencecommunication those with the highest international reputations should continue to be fundednot for distribution outside cru 5potential development of climate science in the future growth areas less emphasis on assembling datasets more on processes patterns and couplings and incorporating other elements of the earth system into models better integration of modelbased and empirical research use of new satellite datasets eg global environment monitoring in conjunction with model development for detection attribution and prediction earth system science will grow and become priority hence need to involve wider profile of researchers eg chemistry biology and human dimensions as well as physics more emphasis on system robustness rather than accuracy in modeling climate change impacts and hence less demand for high resolution climate scenarios more emphasis on socioeconomic aspects eg migration rural policy transport integrated impact assessment rejuvenation of applied climatology in the context of how societies use climate information greater emphasis on local knowledge and understanding what people want to know better integration of climate change with other sustainability and wider environmental issues information about extreme events on short timescales ie next 1020 years including scenario construction and probabilistic data greater emphasis on probabilistic and riskbased scenarios and assessments extreme events and impacts links with mitigation and adaptation rapid climate change and climate surprises seasonallongrange forecasting ie seasonal 1224 months decadal upper atmosphere ionosphere modelling continuing demands demand for climate monitoring and for palaeo and other data will continue but use of data will evolve proxy data and modelling will remain important and develop through processmodelling eg treering growth sedimentation of pollen historical period work will be extended using undigitised records existing data will be reassessed and enhanced use of models will expose gaps in the data development of gcms will continue over the next 10 years but models will become more intuitive and resultsthinking from other disciplines incorporated and there will be drive for more consistent model predictions critical mass for cru some respondents perceived cru as being too small others as the right size and saw benefits eg creativity and links with outside world in its current size in terms of the future having the right profile eg scientists ageexpertise is the important issue eg for assuring succession as is the development of appropriate strategic alliances national and international cru strategic review team 6 december 2002
