colorado utah and wyoming the resource potential of these shales is estimated to be the equivalent of 18 trillion barrels of oil in place retorted oil shale yields liquid hydrocarbons in the range of middledistillate fuels such as jet and diesel fuel however because oil shales have not proved to be economically recoverable they are considered contingent resource and not true reserves it remains to be demonstrated whether an economically significant oil volume can be extracted under existing operating conditions in comparison saudi arabia reportedly holds proved reserves of 267 billion barrels federal interest in oil shale dates back to the early 20 th century when the naval petroleum and oil shale reserves were set aside out of world war ii concerns for secure oil supply bureau of mines program began research into exploiting the resource commercial interest followed during the 1960s after second oil embargo in the 1970s congress created synthetic fuels program to stimulate largescale commercial development of oil shale and other unconventional resources the federal program proved shortlived and commercially backed oil shale projects ended in the early 1980s when oil prices began declining the current high oil prices have revived the interest in oil shale the energy policy act of 2005 epact identified oil shale as strategically important domestic resource among others that should be developed epact also directed the secretary of defense to develop separate strategy to use oil shale in meeting department of defense dod requirements when doing so is in the national interest tapping unconventional resources such as oil shale has been promoted as means of reducing dependence on foreign oil and improving national security opponents of federal subsidies for oil shale argue that the price and demand for crude oil should act as sufficient incentives to stimulate development projections of increased demand and peaking petroleum production in the coming decades tend to support the priceandsupply incentive argument in the long term the failure of oil shale has been tied to the perennially lower price of crude oil much less risky conventional resource proponents of renewing commercial oil shale development might also weigh whether other factors detract from the resources potential refining industry profitability is overwhelmingly driven by light passenger vehicle demand for motor gasoline and oilshale distillate does not make ideal feedstock for gasoline production policies that discourage the wider use of middledistillates as transportation fuels indirectly discourage oil shale development because the largest oil shale resources reside on federal lands the federal government would have direct interest and role in the development of this resource this report will be updated as new developments occur

that peak petroleum production may occur in the coming decades along with increasing global demand underscore the united states dependence on imported petroleum after hurricanes katrina and rita the spike in crude oil price and the temporary shutdown of some gulf coast refineries exacerbated that dependency with imports making up 65 of the united states crude oil supply and the expectation that the percentage will rise proponents of greater energy independence see the nationss huge but undeveloped oil shale resources as promising alternative 1 oil shales are prevalent throughout the united states their kerogen content is the geologic precursor to petroleum the most promising oil shale resources occur in the green river formation that underlies 16000 square miles of northwestern colorado northeastern utah and southwestern wyoming figure 1 approximately 72 of the land overlying the green river formation is federally held 2 the formation is estimated to contain more than 8 trillion barrels of shale oil in place however much of the formation has been considered too thin too deep or too low in yield to economically develop using older technology the former office of technology assessment ota estimated in 1980 that 18 trillio n barrels appeared marginally attractive to production based on deposits that would yield 15 gallons per ton and were at least 15 feet thick3 in more recent analysis the portion of the formation yielding greater than 10 gallons per ton was estimated to contain 15 trillion barrels4 because oil shales have not been proven economically recoverable they are considered contingent resources and not true reserves5 by comparison the conventional proved oil reserves of the united states are less than 22 billion barrels and saudi arabias are reportedly 267 billion barrels6 1 us doe energy information administration eia monthly energy review january 2006 table 17 overview of us petroleum trade at httpwwweiadoegovemeumerpdfpagessec1_15pdf

environmental challenges the hydrocarbon resource is bound up in the shale and is not free to flow like petroleum in previous attempts at production conventional subsurface nd strip mining methods were combined with hightemperature processing retorting to extract petroleumlike distillates not only was plentiful water supply required but certain processing methods had associated groundwater contamination issues unlike conventional petroleum production wherein crude oil is shipped or piped to an established refining and distribution center oil shale production would have required the vertical integration of resource extraction processing and upgrading to finished product ready for blending and distribution recent interests in oil shale look to overcoming the past technical challenges associated with mining by adapting oil field production methods unlike conventional crude oil oilshale distillates make poor feedstock for gasoline production and thus may be better suited to making distillatebased fuels such as diesel and jet fuel the cost of producing oil shale remains uncertain especially when compared with the economic fundamentals of extracting conventional petroleum reserves

diagenesis organically bound oxygen nitrogen and sulfur are released8 complete transformation to petroleum occurs during catagenesis the prolonged exposure to temperatures in the range of 122 to 392f generally occurring at depths of 4000 to 9800 feet the catalytic properties of the shale binding the kerogen contribute to the transformation the threshold for intense oil generation begins at 149f equivalent to depths of 4500 feet or more temperatures above 392f mark the metamorphic endstate of transformationultimate conversion to methane gas and graphite pure carbon oil shales have not thermally matured beyond the diagenesis stage due to their relatively shallow depth of burial some degree of maturation has taken place but not enough to fully convert the kerogen to petroleum hydrocarbons the green river oil shale of colorado has matured to the stage that heterocyclic ringlike hydrocarbons have formed and predominate with up to 10 normal and isoparaffins the range of hydrocarbons that includes natural gasoline 9 in comparison conventional crude oil may contain as much as 40 natural gasoline the kerogens rich hydrogencarbon ratio 16 is significant fact or in terms of yielding highquality fuels its 13 nitrogen content however may be problematic in terms of producing stable fuels petroleum typically contains less than 05 nitrogen as well as producing environmentally detrimental nitrogen oxides during combustion 10 to assess kerogens potential for yielding hydrocarbonlike fuels the processes of conventional petroleum refining synthetic fuel

configuration the slate of crude oils refined and the seasonal product demands of the market13 just as natural clay catalysts help transform kerogen to petroleum through catagenesis metallic catalysts help transform complex hydrocarbons to lighter molecular chains in modern refining processes the catalyticcracking process developed during the world war ii era enabled refineries to produce highoctane gasolines needed for the war effort hydrocracking which entered commercial operation in 1958 improved on catalyticcracking by adding hydrogen to convert residuum into highquality motor gasoline and naphthabased jet fuel us refineries rely heavily on hydroprocessing to convert lowvalue gas oils residuum to highvalue transportation fuel demanded by the market middledistillate range

an early process developed by friedrich bergius used catalyst to promote the reaction of hydrogen with coal liquids to produce lowquality gasoline during the 1960s the department of the interiors office of coal research sponsored research to directly liquefy eastern coal into substitutes for natural gas and oil synthetic liquid fuels 18 in competing process developed by german scientists fischer and tropsch lowtemperature catalysts were used to promote hydrogens reaction with coal gas and produce gasoline the south african oil company sasol later developed this technology further modern gastoliquids gtl technology based on the fischertropsch process converts natural gas to liquid fuels essentially both the bergius and fishertropsch synthetic fuel processes build up longer chain hydrocarbons from smaller molecules this is the opposite of hydrocracking the refining process that breaks heavierweight molecular chains and rings into lighterweight molecules using hydrogen and catalysts g17g146g149g561g21g145g138g149g142g561g20g142g157g152g155g157g146g151g144g561 oil derived from shale has been referred to as synthetic crude oil and thus closely associated with synthetic fuel production however the process of retorting shale oil bears more similarities to conventional refining than to synthetic fuel pr ocesses for the purpose of this report the term oilshale distillate is used to refer to middledistillate range hydrocarbons produced by retorting oil shale two basic retorting processes were developed early onaboveground retorting and underground or in situ retorting the retort is typically large cylindrical vessel and early retorts were based on rotary kiln ovens used in cement manufacturing in situ technology involves mining an underground chamber that functions as retort number of design concepts were tested from the 1960s through the 1980s retorting essentially involves destructive distillation pyrolysis of oil shale in the absence of oxygen pyrolysis temperatures above 900f thermally breaks down cracks the kerogen to release the hydrocarbons and then cracks the hydrocarbons into lowerweight hydrocarbon molecules conventional refining uses similar thermal cracking process termed coking to break down highmolecular weight residuum ota compiled properties of oilshale distillates produced by various retorting processes table 1 in general oilshale distillates have mu ch higher concentration of high boilingpoint compounds that would favor production of middledistillates such as diesel and jet fuels rather than naphtha19 oilshale

why have project sponsors dropped synthetic fuels projects gao answ ered that oil had become plentiful with about 8 to 10 million barrels per day in excess worldwide capacity and the trend in rising oil prices had reversed after early 1981 president reagans executive order 12287 had removed price and allocation controls on crude oil and refined petroleum products in 1981 for the first time since the early 1970s market forces replaced regulatory programs and domestic crude oil prices were allowed to rise to marketclearing level decontrol also set the stage for the relaxation of export restrictions on refined petroleum products oil demand had also declined due in part to energy conservation measures and worldwide economic recession more fundamental change had taken place in the way that oil commodities were traded prior to 1980 the price of crude oil was determined by longterm contracts with 10 or so of internationally traded oil exchanged on the spot market 29 by the end of 1982 more than half of the internationally traded oil was exchanged on the spot market or tied to the spot market price the most significant change occurred in 1983 with the introduction of crude oil

nonhydrocarbon multiring thiophenetype compounds that prove difficult to hydrotreat because the molecular ring structure attaches the sulfur on two sides although these compounds occur throughout the range of petroleum distillates they are more concentrated toward the residuum end so the problem is compounded when residuum is cracked to increase gasoline production improved hydrotreatment technology since the 1980s has incr eased sulfur removal and provided means to removing oilshale distillates excessive nitrogen content desirable in terms of producing stable fuels with low nox

higher crude oil prices the fuel savings advantage of diesel cars should become even more compelling diesel fuel demand is regulatory driven to an extent motor fuel taxes that favor diesel over gasoline offer one means of redirecting demand but the tax differential may need to be significantly higher than the current 6 per gallon differential favoring gasoline raising motor fuel taxes above the current federal level runs counter to current policy in the aftermath of hurricane katrina when gasoline prices surged above 3 per gallon some states suspended or considered suspending taxes on gasoline however advocates of energy conservation argued that the higher gasoline prices conserved fuel by discouraging driving thus the motor fuel tax should have remained or even increased if higher motor fuel tax stimulates the demand for more fuel efficient vehicles as the european experience suggests the inherent fuel efficiency offered by diesel passenger vehicle becomes more apparent if not desirable this in turn could act as an additional incentive for producing diesel or alternatives such as oilshale distillates

presidents goal to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from the middle east by 2025 indicates continuing concern63 recent high crude oil prices renewed interest in oil shale prompting congress to include provisions in the energy policy act of 2005 promoting the lease and development of federal oil shale holdings the act also identified oil shale as strategically important domestic resource and directed the energy department to coordinate and accelerate its commercial development the misconception persists however regarding oil shales fungibility as crude oil substitute it doesnt effectively replace crude oil as gasoline feedstock thus policies that attempt to foster oil shale development come into conflict with regulatory policies that favor gasoline as transportation fuel the best use of the resource appears to be as feedstock for producing middle distillate fuels regulatory policies that are acting to discourage wider use of middledistillate fuels thus may be acting as disincentive to oil shale production congress may wish to consider whether special case should be made for oil shale and whether to exempt the middledistillate fuels produced from regulatory policies that restrict their wider use as transportation fuels the presidents fy2007 budget request would terminate the energy departments oil technology research and the defense departments initiative to develop clean fuels from oil shale among other resources appears unfunded 64 whether oil shale can be economically produced even given the current high cost of conventionally recovered petroleum remains unclear however without longterm concerted effort to produce oil shale either through federal or private sectorsponsored enterprise the economic viability will remain questionable the expectation of initial high unit costs should be weighed against the offset in demand for imported products and the effect on lowering price that competition brings 63 president george w bush
