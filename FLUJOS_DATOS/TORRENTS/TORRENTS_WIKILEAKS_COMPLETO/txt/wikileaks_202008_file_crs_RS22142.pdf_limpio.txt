exports stopped because of declining output and oil company mergers about 7 of crude oil production from the alaska north slope ans was exported to south korea japan and china unfavorable public reaction to exporting domestic oil during times of high prices and tight us supply have from time to time focused renewed legislative atten tion on the alaska exports issue ans exports were banned wh construction of the tr ansalaska pipeline system taps was authorized in 1973 but an apparent glut of il on the west coast persuaded congress to lift the ban in 1995 however recent recordsetting prices

brief ib10136 arctic national wildlife refuge anwr controversies for the 109th congress by m lynne corn and bernard gelb background when the arab oil embargo began in 1973 oil development on alaskas north slope had been stymied since the prudhoe ba discovery in 1968 by lack of agreement on pipeline destination two plans were at loggerheads one favored by many policy makers envisioned the oil tr ansiting canada to chicag oarea destination proponents of this plan pointed out that the midwest d indigenous source of crude those opposing it cited the high cost of such lengthy and expensive pipeline construction project the other plan which ultimately became th transalaska pipeline system taps was to transport crude oil to the southern alaska seaport of valdez where it would be shipped to refiners by tanke r proponents cited large cost savings and the timeliness of the smaller construction project opponents of this plan contended that taps sponsors true intent was to export north slope cr ude contention denied by taps supporters midwest destination proponents sserted that exports would r counter to the principle that us oil should be used domestically nd remain available for consumption in the united states as matter of energy security pipeline from prudhoe bay required transitin g route where much of the rightof way was on federal lands legi slation was required to end wh at had become stalemate over the route the 197374 arab oil embargo brought new sense of urgency to the debate as gasoline shortage began to develop compromise the transalaska pipeline act pl 93153 wa s achieved this rightofway legislation enabled the shorter pipeline to valdez with the proviso that crude oil transiting the rightofway granted by congress would not be exported taps was completed in 1977 nd initial oil shipments bega n to flow by yearend with continued oilfield velopment on the north slope production climbed steadily for 10 years peaking at 20 million barrels per day mbd in 1988 in subsequent years alaska north slope ans output declined falling to 15 mbd in 1995 and continuing downward to current flows of under 900000 barrels per day bd much ans crude reached california which is the nations thirdlargest oil producer during the mid 1990s calif ornia produced about 800000 bd the combination of californias indigenous produc tion ans crude and foreign oil imports resulted in regional oil surplus the local glut depressed prices for both california and ans producers since more crude was available on the west coast than was needed there athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22142crs3 that time about 300000 bd of crude were shipped via the pana ma canal to the us gulf coast and us virgin islands congress lifts ans export ban the west coast oil glut elicited persistent expressions of concern from oil producers displeased with what they perceived as artificially depressed prices early efforts to achieve remedial action failed to establish traction until 1995 when low world oil prices relatively benign level of net oil imports 80 mbd in c ontrast to current level exceeding 12 mbd and supportive departme nt of energy doe coincided with renewed legislative efforts in both houses of congress june 1994 doe study exporting alaskan north slope crude oil benefits and costs found that exporting alaska crude w ould increase producer receipts for both california and alaska oil the increased producer receipts would be the result of transportation savings realiz ed by avoiding trip through the panama canal additionally doe predicted that larger pr oducer revenues at the wellhead would result in 100000 bd more output from alaska and ca lifornia than would be the case with continued export restriction absent conclusive case for the oils being needed in the united states and with forecast cost and substantial projected be nefits export ban repeal bills in the 104th congress hr 70 and s 395 passed by rge margins 32477 and 7425 respectively the clinton administration supported ans crude exports and the president signed pl 10458 in november 1995 with the export ban lifted ans exports totaling 36000 bd began in 1996 they grew to 66500 bd in 1997 dipped slightly to 52900 in 1998 and rose to high of 74000 bd in 1999 according to unpublished doe figures during 1999 korea 50 japan 36 and china 12 imported nearly all ans ex ports the list of customers for this oil remained the same throughout the period before ans exports stopped in may 2000 the result of ownership changes and falling output about 7 of north slope output was shipped abroad viewed relative to total domestic consumption of 193 mbd in 2000 these exports comprised less than one half of one percent net pe troleum imports at the time we re about 10 mbd these exports amounted to the equivalent of threequarters of one percent as an absolute quantity these numbers were not pa rticularly significant while the export ban was unde r debate during 1995 the united states was already exporting nearly 900000 bd 28 in the form of petroleum coke which is used in making steel other exports were crossbor der exchanges of refined products as well as some crude with canada and mexico trade in petroleu m coke plus exports to canada and mexico accounted for 69 of ll us oil exports at the timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22142crs4 1 petroleum administration for

hawaii 2 march 24 2000 p 1impact of exports on west coast prices alaska oil production peaked at 20 mbd in 1988 creating crude surplus on the west coast by 1995 when export legisla tion was enacted output had declined to 15 mbd when surplus of 300000 bd reportedly ex isted further declines lowered output to present levels of about 900000 bd coupled with declines in californias indigenous production and growing demand for petroleu m products whatever surplus had existed diminished on separate track from crude supply gasoline pump prices in pad district 51 began to diverge from the nationwide av erage in 1995 energy information administration eia data showed west coas t pump prices to be only 5 cents per gallon above the national average but by 1999 west coast gasoline was 15 cents per gallon higher when crude exports stopped in 2000 th average divergence for the full year was 12 cents it narrowed further in 2001 nd 2002 to 10 and 7 cents respectively could the 74000 bd that were exported befo re may 2000 have been causal factor contributing to the west coast gasoline price differential of that time while the oil exported represented less than 3 of regi onal consumption and was likely replaced by imports at equivalent prices exports could have contri buted somewhat to the price disparity highly inelastic oil markets can experience large price swings in response to small changes in supply when alaskan il exports ceased the gasoline price differential between the west coast and the national average did decline at least for few years platts oilgram price report2 described the market dyna mics that might have been operative during the late 1990s and early pa rt of 2000 platts estimated the various producers market shares placing bp amocos share at 470000 bd arcos at 360000 and exxonmobils at 246000 six other firm s held minor ans production shares bp amoco was apparently the only oil exporter arco and bp amoco have merged and as part of that transaction arcos ans busin ess was sold to phillips phillips became the secondlargest producer of ans crude accountin g for more than onethird of production the platts article stated further the bp amoco spokesman said even though shipments to asia only averaged 60000 bd the company was satisfied with the export program because it assisted in weakening the grip of what he called captive market for its crude in california this statement could suggest that california refiners had been or without exports would have been pa ying lower than world market prices for ans crude but for this contention to be valid local petroleum markets would have to be not fully competitive why else would west coast refiners have paid world market prices there was other choice for fore ign oil and belowmarket prices for ans crudehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22142crs5 3 platts op cit 4 doeeia website at httpwwweiadoegovlocal competitive conditions if better unde rstood might help better explain the reasons that producers have f ound it economic in the past to export ans crude but as part of the bp amoco deal to buy arco arcos ans properties were sold to phillips which planned to use the oil in the united states and said it had plans to resume exports3 and bp amoco acquired and now operates what had been arcos substantial california refineries and now refine s the previously exported ans crude in addition to crude supply and price th ere are many other factors contributing to higher west coast gasoline prices among them are worsening shortage of refining capacity and tough local envir onmental standards for fuel these factors should have had significant bearing even during the period of crude exports in more recent years absent crude exports they have become ke factors related to the price differential current west coast oil exports oil export still remains controversial issue on at least two counts concerns about us petroleum expor ts during time of need and high prices concerns that the environmentally sensitive anwr could be opened for production on the grounds of energy security but instead produce oil for export with regard to current oil exports dur ing 2005 only about 243000 bd of petroleum were exported from pad district 5 which comp rises the western states including alaska and hawaii crude oil at all was exported during 2005 98000 bd of petroleum coke and 52000 bd of residual fuel oil were sold abroad petroleum coke comprising 40 of exports during 2005 is used in making st eel and is not really fuel residual fuel oil about 21 of exports is not widely used on the west coast some refineries have difficulty fully converting this heavy fuel in to other products and this oil seeks market abroad some likely leaves the country as fuel for ships engaged in international commerce only 9000 bd of gasoline was exported the united states does export total of about 11 mbd of oil and oil products last year only 41000 bd was crude oil the amount of exports is significant enough to cause concern among those fearful that the country is exporting oil in time of high prices when that oil is needed at home virtually all crude oil was trad ed with canada in 2005 about 17 of total petroleum is traded w ith canada 25 with mexico canada and mexico are among the nations most impor tant suppliers of crude oil in 2005 they supplied 22 mbd and 16 mbd of the nations gross total imports of 135 mbd4 any exports to these countries are likely related to geographic considerations involving ease of transport and they are more than offset by the great importance of canadian and mexican oil supplies to this countryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22142crs6 changing supply and demand f undamentals in pad district 5 played role in the end of alaskan crude exports production in alaska fell by 600000 bd between the repeal of the export prohibition in 1995 and 2005 most of that drop took place in the 19952000 period california production also declined albeit by smaller amount than alaskan output increasing west coast demand demand for refined products increased steadily from 1995 through 2005 eia data show that total pad district 5 demand rose 15

aska production since the lifting of the export ban totaled nearly 800000 barrels pe r day for both states combined with the demand growth during this period the incremental need for imported oil has increased by 11 mbd this suggests strong pad district 5 demand for il and suggests that market forces would provide powerful incentive to use any extra cr ude oil production in west coast refineries
