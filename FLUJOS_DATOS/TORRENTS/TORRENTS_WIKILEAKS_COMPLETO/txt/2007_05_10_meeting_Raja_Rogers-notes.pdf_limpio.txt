he said but its brought the stronge st wave since weve established the call center jane can the call center mention the price raja rogers we tried instituting that policy and certain people were vehemently against it were short of people now because we had the howard stern event and we put bobby roths book on the tm website weve had five fold increase in leads due to that at some pt we want to refine the call center and customize whether we talk about the price or not now we discuss the price if people ask or get close to asking because certain people all over the country feel they can do better job talking about the price jeff m other changes in other domains raja rogers every domain with the possible exception of raja michael has changed raja wynne had 8 states and now has 4 raja

stay there everything is easy to do due to the internet and modern communications for regine the school project the policy will be that lynch founda tion will only pay for people in the 7 and 8 grades now 6 graders are in junior high too they will be able to start at that reduced rate but the lynch founda tion wont be paying for that jane if its mixed group of 6 7 and 8 graders could the school still apply for the funding for 7 and 8 graders and find other funding for the 6 graders raja rogers yes regine these children in the 6 grade are the only people allowed to have this special rate except for recipients of the lynch founda tion grant right how to present the concept of discount raja rogers yes but only if the 6 graders are in the school with the 7 and 8 graders jane we call it scholarship reduced fee is lacking in dignity according to dr dillbeck regine thank you very much for pursuing this jane you could say lynch founda tion will provide full scholarship for 7 and 8 graders and there will be an internal partial scholarship for 6 graders and 6 graders will have to find funding for the 625 ruth we are working predominantly in fl but some people come to us from ga
