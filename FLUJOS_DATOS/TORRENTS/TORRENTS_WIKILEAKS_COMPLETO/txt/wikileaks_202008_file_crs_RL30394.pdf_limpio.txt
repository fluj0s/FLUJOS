problem with very negative consequences for the russian economy authoritative studies estimate russian capital flight to have totaled 150 billion from 19921999 recent reports of russian money

and have draw n greater attention to the problem they have been the subjects of recent congressional hearings and have focused the attention of members of congress and others on us interests in russia some legislation has been proposed as result of concern over the these scandals and russian capital flight capital flight deprives the russian ec onomy of critical financial resources that could be used for investment tax revenues restructurin g pensions and other social security programs more importantly capita l flight indicates lack of confidence by russian and foreign investors and resident s in the russian ruble in the russian financial system and more ge nerally in the russian economy itself capital flight is sign that russias transition to mark et economy continues to be incomplete an analysis of the rationale for russian capital flight suggests that to reverse capital flight the russian economy will ve to provide an environment that motivates asset holders to keep their wealth in rubles and repatriate assets that they have sent abroad to do so the russian policymakers will have to take significant steps to establish and maintain macroeconomic stability and to complete the partial economic restructuring postcold war us policy has reflected number of national security foreign policy and economic interests us policy has aimed to decrease the russia military threat and at the same time encourage the development of democracy in russia in the economic sphere us po licy has focused on establishing economic stability and on developing the institutions required for market economy the united states also views russia has burgeoning trade partner and source of investment opportunities it can be argu ed that without sound economy russia will find it difficult to achieve political stability which in turn might increase the national security threat posed by russia continuing capital flight is an indicator that russia has yet to realize functioning market economy in the near term us economic policy on russia is likely to focus on the issue of whether to delay or move forward with pending imf assistance however whether russia undertakes complete economic reform will be determined by russia alone key question in us polic is whether it can persuade russian policymakers to proceed with economic re form this report w ill be not be updated but will remain available

launder proceeds from illegal activities russian capital flight is longstanding problem with very negative influences and consequen ces for the russian economy1 it deprives the russian economy of critical financial resources th at could be used for investment tax revenues and restructuring pensions and other social security programs more importantly capital flight indicates lack of confidence by russian and foreign investors and residents in th russian ruble in the russian financial system and more generally in the russian economy capital flight is sign that russias transition to market economy continues to be incomplete and far from sustainable recently reported russian money launde ring and other fi nancial scandals involving the russian central bank the ba nk of new york othe r

congressional needs russian capital flight capital flight is an abnormal conversion of financial assets from the national currency to assets in more stable currenc usually in response to or in anticipation of heightened financial risk the term is generally applied to abnormal capital flows out of the country but has also been app lied to hard currency assets withdrawn from the domestic economy by way of intern capital flight or dollarization4 what distinguishes capital flight from normal capital transactions is the motivation behind the outflow normal capita l transactions are part of daytoday business transactions where the investor seeks to accrue future income under conditions of acceptable risk within this normal category would be portfolio investments in stocks bonds and government securities nd direct investments in foreignbased manufacturing facilities on the other hand capital flight entails fl ows of financial asse ts that result from the holders perception that capital is subject to an inordinate level of risk from devaluation hyperinfla tion political turmoil or expropr iation if retained at home in domestic currencies the holder seeks in th is negative environment safe haven for the funds such as the conversion of local currencies into dollars or deutsch marks and holding them or placing them in foreign bank accounts capital flight represents assets largely unavailable to the source country for investment necessary for restructuring nd growth and necessary to generate tax revenue sufficient for government budgetary support it usually occurs in countries at low stages of economic growth and development russia suffers from the perversity of substantial net capital outflow at time when its development needs call for more massive net capital inflow httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30394crs3 5 see footnote 9 6 jack andrew the tricks russians use to funnel cash abroad the financial times august 27 1999 p 2 7 for example russian first deputy finance nister oleg vyugin estimated that in 1999 russia capital flight was valued at around 17 billion of which 6 billion is illegal chase bank next week october 1 1999 p 20 russian capital flight has taken various forms according to authoritative studies5 an apparent significant amount occurs as internal capital flight internal capital flight is often referred to as the dollarization of the russian economy because it has generally been in the form of russian residents conversion of rubles into dollars for use as currency on the black market or as means of savings for later conversion back into rubles it results fro m citizens distrust of the russian banking system and fear of inflati on currency revaluation or ex propriation average citizens do not have the option of sending their sa vings abroad but their distrust of the financial system mirrors that of the rich external russian capital flight has taken va rious forms some of the capital flight had been carried out especially du ring the early period of partial reform by directors of newly privatized companies selling raw materials such as oil and metals during this period domestic prices of russian commodities were still substantially below world market prices some russian firms bought the commodities on the domestic market exported the commodities and kept the profits offshore in so doing the directors avoided russian ex change controls and russian taxation another form of external capital flight occurs when russian firms arrange to have offshore affiliated or branch clients overbill the company for expenses the russian firm sends payment in hard curre ncy abroad and the difference between the real and fictitious expenses are kept offshore the exce ss is counted as expenditures and escapes russian taxation illegal ru ssian capital flight has also occurred as unrecovered import advances and export subsidies russian residents pay for imports in advance but never receive the imports instead the payments are made to an offshore entity with ties to the importing firm the domestic firm writes off the loss as bad debt that escapes taxation6 similarly russian firms have exported goods but have kept the payments offshore distinction should be made between cap ital flight that involves the transfer of legally obtained funds nd capital flight that involve s funds obtained from drug trade or other criminal activities the latter category includes money laundering activity which has been the focus of recent investigations pertaining to money processed through accounts at the bank of new york and other alleged activities of questionable legality see discussion in th appendix because the illegal activities by their nature escape conventional accounting mechanisms estimates of what portion of capital flight is m oney laundering is difficult at best however several experts have estimated that approximately onethird of capital flight involves illegal activity7 because the distinction between capital f light and other capital flows is one of motivation rather than form measurements of capital flight are rough estimates athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30394crs4 8 some

cumulatively to be within the 60 b illion150 billion range or roughly 1025 billion per year 9 more recent estimates provided by other an alysts fall within this range and thus seem to confirm the

conditions in russia but it also reenforces poor economic c onditions as it deprives the economy of the critical investment and budgetary resources to build sustainable economic growth and finance social welfare programs poor economic conditions are measured by indicators of overall performance they have been the product in part of ine ffective monetary and fiscal policies that were implemented early in russias transition to market economy but the poor economic performance has continued largely due to the incomplete or partial institutional and capital restructurin g of the economy which undermines achievements made in macr oeconomic policy and estab lishes perverse economic system that encourages capital flight russian economic performance past present and prospects russia has

had predicted that th russian economy would continue to deteriorate in the wake of the crisis however preliminary da ta for 1999 show some improvements with low infla tion relatively stable rubl exchange rate and modest growth in gdp this growth has been primarily as result of ruble depreciation that has made imports more expensive thus encouraging russians to consume importcompeting domestically produced goods19 the russian economy has also benefitted from higher world oil prices major russian export tax revenues have increased because of the jump in oil earnings and also because of more efficient tax collection but large share of increased oil profits may go into cap ital flight to avoid taxation20 however these positive trends may be only temporary and not sustained

resulting in an economically negative motiva tional system that has stimulated capital flight four shortfalls have been especially critical in maintaining perverse system retention and expansion of security forces and administrative bureaucracy government administrative system operating under old inefficient rules of the game is major contributing factor to russias incomplete reform starting in 1991 the failure to reform russias security forces and administrative bureaucracy puts heavy burden on the state budget and has b een an incentive to inefficiency and corruption retention of the old bureaucr atic structure and staff is especially deleterious to fina ncial reform the central administrative civilian bureaucracy has doubled since 1991 to 12 million operating within much the same

manufacturing plants infrastructure and other produc tive capacity russia requires infusions of capital for investment to rebu ild outdated infrastructure to modernize its industrial base and to

social instability29 12 billion is roughly equivalent to 50 of the federal government budget for russia in 1999 estimated at 24 billion using 24r1us exchange rate30 debt shortages of investment funds

capital flight reversal the discussion above suggests that in orde r for capital flight to slow or reverse the russian economy will have to provide an environment that motivates asset holders to keep their wealth in rubles and to repatriate assets that they have sent abroad to do so the russian policymakers will have to establish and maintain ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30394crs10 program of macroeconomic stability and of economic re structuring but to do so will require broad political consensus s upporting legislation nd policy action to date the rate of capital flight has continued perh aps increasing after the 1998 financial crisis the first indication of pr ogress would be slowing of capital flight major changes in the system would be needed to reverse the flow at minimum an effective economic program to move toward functioning market economy with prospects for sustai ned growth would include the following developing and maintaining sound fi scal and monetary policies that would keep inflation in tow and provide sufficient currency flows to allow for economic growth and permit sufficient level of government expenditures to maintain necessary social safety net competent civilian administrative system and national security forces scaling down and restructuring the civilian bureaucracy and the national security forces along with reforming the legal and regulatory framework to reduce incentives for corruption reforming the tax code and tax administration in order to move to balanced budget regime by improvi ng tax collection and increasing revenues and also to ma ke taxation more equ itable thus reducing disincentives to productivity and incentives for tax evasion reforming the banking sector to re structure or eliminate unprofitable banks and implementing internationally accepted operating standards to raise confidence in the system as holder of deposits and conduit for investment capital with the development of an independent central bank able to effectively regulate the banking system and developing rudimentary commercial legal and regulatory system to protect contracts and property ri ghts and to guarantee shareholder rights to improve corporate gove rnance all of which would help to raise investor confidence in th economy and reduce motivation for capital flight this list is by means complete but it represents fundamental changes that russia still needs to undertake by doing so russian policymakers could help ensure slowdown in capital flight which would he lp to build foundation for sustainable economic growth this in turn would increase motivation for investors to return capital to russia thus reversing the vicious downward spiral of the recent past and creating virtuous cycle leading to sustained economic growth successful economic reform has been st ymied in the past by among other things the failure of russian policymakers to reach the strong political consensus that must be in place for fundamental refo rms to take place there had been lack of consensus between the yeltsin gove rnment and the russian parliament politically fractured state duma was dominated since 1995 by factions from thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30394crs11 33 crs report rl30266 op cit russian communist and agrarian parties nd by nationalists who have been critical of economic reform policies and of the role played by western countries and international organizations particularly the internati onal monetary fund imf in promoting economic reform in russia in addition there had been lack of consensus between the yeltsin government in moscow and the regional governments divisions emerged between those russian regions that have been more successful in moving toward reform and those who carry an especially large burden of the soviet legacy and thus are dependent on subsidies from the federal government divisions over economic reform also ex isted within the yeltsin government itself influence has shifted within the government between ardent reformists such as yegor gaidar chubais nd nemtsov and those such as former prime ministers primakov and chernomyrdin who favor more moderately paced reforms economic reform has also suffered th strong influence of the socalled oligarchs who have vested interest in the statusquo as they have been able to take advantage of political connections and the incomplete reforms to gain control of valuable assets extract wealth and send it abroad in the form of capital flight in addition economic reform wa s hampered by political certainty associated with yeltsins frequent changes of prime nisters and with his physical health33 one of the first tasks that the new russian president vladimir putin will have to undertake is building new political cons

due in 1999 and 2000 38 us and multilateral assistance to russia has drawn criticism over time from various quarters questioning the effectiven ess of the aid in light not only of the apparent failure of russia to complete the transition to market economy some of the criticism has been leveled against the socalled washington consensus that is the policy adopted in 1991 by the united states other major creditor countries and the imf that presses russian economic reformers to move ahead emphasizing macroeconomic stabilization tight fiscal and monetary policies and liberalized exchange rate policy and immediate privatization of stateowned assets before appropriate tax regimes commercial gal system banking system and other economic institutions could be established39 the conditions contained under the most recent imf credit program seem to respond to this criticism by highlighting structural reform requirements including financial reform but recent reports of money laundering nd other financial s candals have raised questions about the appropriate ness of any assistance at all to russia added to this is criticism of russias military actions in chechnya and the possibility of restricting us and multilateral assistance as sign of us displeasure40 in examining us options in encouraging russia to proceed with economic reforms it is crucial to first measure the strength of us leverage because it is through the multilateral institutions especially the imf that most of the assistance for economic restructuring and stabilization is channeled it is us leverage in the imf that would likely be the major tool for influence on russian economic policy us influence within the imf is substantial the vote of each member in imf decisions is weighted based on the size of that countrys imf quota therefore the us vote counts for 1756 of the total votes giving the united states an effective veto in process which requires 85 super majority to approve decisions furthermore the united states position as the most influential financial center in the world adds bulk to its authority within the imf41 in effect imf decisions on assistance or other matters must take into account

december 19 1999 then how important is the imf to ru ssia as mentioned earlier the russian budget has been increasingly constrained by the growth of debt servicing obligations with close to 40 of its 1999 budget target ed for interest payments on foreign and domestic debt while the current imf package of 45 billion is small amount compared to the annual volume of capital f light and the russian investment capital requirements without it russia faces the choice of defaulting on imf loans constraining expenditures possibly withholding payments to workers and pensioners or financing the budget deficits by prin ting money thus precipitating inflation russia negotiating with the paris club creditors to get its sovietera debt rescheduled or forgiven but failure to receive imfs imprimatur might derail such attempts although russia successful negotiated rescheduling agreement with the london club according to one financial analys t failures to receive timely imf tranches could lead in the year 2000 to severe russian balance of payments crisis threatening russian defaults and closure of international capital markets to russia for the foreseeable future imf leverage and therefore us financial leverage would appear to be powerful at this time42 how should the united states use that leverage in the near term us economic policy on russia may focus on two options relating to russian foreign policy actions and imf assistance one woul d be to maintain assistance the other would be delay assistance the clinton administration appears to be following the first option but leaving itself open to move toward the second43 arguments for maintaining assistance are that it would help to maintain us russian relations and us leverage in russian policy especially on the new parliament elected in december 1999 nd the new president elected in march 2000 more directly it is argued that th financial assistance will help russia face serious balance of payment and budgetary crises and avoid going into default on some major loans which could undermine its transition to market economy and prolong capital flight on the other hand delaying or d iminishing assistance may c onvince the russian leadership that their best interests lie in conforming to widely accepted human rights standards nd cooperating with western industrialized nations in making transition toward democratic market society at the same time it could encourage russian leadership to undertake the politically tough steps at completing economic reform which in the long term would help to ensure economic stability and growth and would help to reverse capital flight in the end whether russia undertakes fficient economic reform to develop functioning market economy w ill be determined by russia alone the test of us policy lies in its ability to persuade russian policymak ers to precede with economic reform that restructures the system and leads to slow down and eventually reversal of capital

involved the russian ce ntral bank rcb from the end of 1990 through 1996 the rcb and its predecessor organization the soviet gosbank was involved in channeling assets through an offshore entity the financial management company fimaco the transactions in cluded the transfer in 1996 of rcb assets offshore which resulted in an understating of russian foreign reserves because of concerns raised that the transactions might have involved in ternational monetary fund imf credits the imf requested and received an independent audit of the activities by pricewaterhousecoopers the udit confirmed that the transfers had taken place the imf concluded that while the transfers did not involve imforigin funds they did result in undervaluing ru ssian foreign reserves that might have affected imf decisions on di sbursing credits to russia44 the second scandal involves alleged money launde ring between october 1998 and march 1999 around 42 billion was pro cessed at the bank of new york through
