law division james mccarthy resources science and industry division april 9 2008 abstract on february 8 2008 the dc circuit decided new jersey v epa unanimously vacating two epa rules under the clean air act caa regarding emissions of mercury from electric utility steam generating units egus the two rules had the eﬀect of shifting epa regulation of powerplant emissions of mercury from the more stringent and less ﬂexible regime under caa section 112 governing hazardous air pollutants haps to the less stringent and more ﬂexible one under caa section 111 authorizing national emission standards for new stationary sources the court decision unless reversed or circumvented by epas properly removing egus from section 112 will mean that each individual egu will have to meet strict maximum achievable control technology standards and that capandtrade program will be authorized setting such standards might take time however as epa gathers information on current emission levels and the eﬀectiveness of control technologies delaying the eﬀective date of national mercury emission standards for egus to as late as 2014 according to knowledgeable observers legislation has been introduced

power plants joining two other recent court decisions to similar effect2 the two epa rules struck down in new jersey v epa would have had the effect of shifting the regulation of powerplant emissions of mercury from the more stringent and less flexible regime under caa section 1123 governing hazardous air pollutants haps to the less stringent and more flexible one under caa section 1114 authorizing emission limits for new stationary sources the first rule removed coal and oilfired egus from the agencys list of stationary sources w hose hap emissions are regulated under section 1125 the second rule set performance standa rds for new coalfired egus under section 111 and established tota l mercury emission limits for states and certain tribal areas along with voluntary capandtrade program for new and existing coalfired egus6 this second rule was called the clean air mercury rule some familiarity with the roles of sections 112 and 111 in the caa regulatory scheme is useful for the most part the caa allows emission limitations for individual stationary sources power plants factories etc to be set by the states rather than epa state has considerable flexibility in this task as long as the cumulative effect of the emissions within its borders does not cau exceedance of national ambient air quality standards set by epa or other caa require ments the act has two major exceptions that are relevant here however situations where stationarysource emission limitations are set by epa rather than the states for particularly harmful pollutants the aforementioned haps section 112 requires epa to set unifo rm national standards for each category of stationary sources listed by epa simila rly under section 111 ne wly constructed and newly modified stationary sources are subject to epaprescribed new source performance standards nspss states may prescribe standards of performance for any existing source for any air pollutant to which an nsps would apply if the existing source were new source7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22817crs3 8 caa 112n1 42 usc 7412n1events leading up to new jersey v epa the new jersey v epa case has its roots in the 1990 clean air act amendments whereby congress narrowed epa s discretion in implementin g section 112 pertinent here congress required epa to meet certain conditions before adding egus to the list of regulated hap sources in section 112c1 the epa administrator shall perform study of the hazards to public health reasonably anticipated to occur as result of emissions by egus of pollutants listed under subsection b of this section which include mercury after imposition of the requirements of this act the administrato r shall regulate egus under this section 112 if the administrator finds such regu lation is appropriate and necessary after considering the results of the study8 after completing the study in 1998 epa announ ced in 2000 that it was appropriate and necessary to regulate coal and oilfire d egus under section 112 because among other things mercury emissions from egus present significant hazards to public health and the environment epa therefore added coal and oilfired egus to the section 112c1 list of source categories also in 2000 under consent agreement this listing required the agency to propose maximum achievable c ontrol technology mact standards for those facilities by december 15 2003 and fi nalize the standards by march 15 2005 when 2005 arrived however epa adopted ve ry different tack it removed egus from the section 112c1 list and regulate d mercury emissions from new coalfired egus under section 111 concluding c ontrary to its 2 000 announcement that regulation under section 112 was not appropriate and necessary claiming authority in section 111 it also established national rcury emissions cap for new and existing egus allocating each state and certain trib areas mercury emissions budget and created voluntary capandtrade program had the dc circuit not vacated the rule creating this program the final cap would ve been 15 tons of emissions nationwide in 2018 about 70 reduction from 1999 levels wh achieved there would also have been an intermediate cap of 38 tons in 2010 this intermediate cap would not have actually limited emissions however since the agency projected emissions at 31 tons in 2010 even if 99 of the generating units installed mercury control equipment the caps would have been implemented through an allowance system similar to that used in the acid rain and clean air interstate rule cair programs through which utilities can either control the pollutant directly or purchase excess allowances from other plants that have instituted controls more st ringently or sooner than required as with the acid rain and cair programs early reductions could have been banked for later use which the agency said would result in utilities delaying compliance with the full 70 reduction until well beyond 2018 as they us ed up banked allowances rather than installing further controls the agencys an alysis projected actual emissions to be 243 tons less than 50 reducti on as late as 2020 full comp liance with the 70 reduction would have been layed until after 2025 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22817crs4 9 because the court found ambiguity in section 112c9 there was need for it to defer to epas contrary interpretation judicial deference to an agencys interpretation of statute is not required under chevron usa inc v natural resources defense council 467 us 837 842 43 1984 when congress has directly spoken to the issue and congress intent is clear 10 in contrast epas authority to estab lish capandtrade program under section 111 is arguable the agencys rationale is at 70 fed reg 28606 28616617 may 18 2005the new jersey v epa decision in rejecting epas delisting of egus unde r section 112 and the agencys substitute mercury rules under section 111 th dc circuit showed little hesitation it agreed with petitioners that epa in delisting egus had evaded the delisting procedure set out in section 112c9 that provision says that epa may delete any source category from the section 112c1 list whenever it finds that emissions from source in the category exceed level which is adequate to protect public health with an ample margin of safety and adverse environmental effect will result from emissions from any source this is tough standard to mee t one can see why an administration seeking nonsection112 approach to re gulating mercury from power plants might look for laxer delisting threshold but in the courts view section 112c9 demands that delisting occur only after epa makes the findings there stated which epa had not done for egus9 so the court vacated the agencys delisting decision vacating epas delisting decision the cour t concluded also required vacation and remand of its section 111 regulations for rcury emissions from new and existing egus as for existing egus epa had conceded that if egus remain listed under section 112 as they do under the courts above ruling th its section 111 regulations for existing sources must fall as for new egus the court vacated the regulations because they hinged on assumptions as to the nonapplicability of section 112 that were longer true epa has motioned the dc circuit for reconsideration of its decision with suggestion for rehearing banc petition for certiorari to the supreme court is always possible however the unanimity and complete certainty of the circuits decision make epa success in these prospects unlikely next steps unless the dc circuits ruling is revers ed or epa is able to delist egus under section 112c9 epa will have to regulate mercury emi ssions from egus under section 112 according to which the agency will be required per 112d to impose maximum achievable control technolog mact standards on each i ndividual egu otherwise stated section 112 does not appear to give epa authority to establish capandtrade program10 developing these mact standards will require some deliberation the agency proposed mact standards in december 2003 as an alternative to its capandtrade approach but did not promulgate them in the intervening four years there have been significant advances in the technology ava ilable to control egu mercury emissions and according to the institute of clean air comp anies 89 electric generating units now havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22817crs5 11 institute of clean air companies commerc ial electric utility mercury control technology bookings february 4 2008 at http wwwicaccomf ilespubliccommercial_hg_equipment _020408pdf the institute of clean air compan ies represents companies working in the stationary source air pollution control and monito ring sector the survey reports 82 bookings some of which cover more than one egu 12 the five multipollutant bills introduced in this congress would establish capandtrade programs for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxi des and carbon dioxide but not for mercury 13 broader mact hammer in section 112j whic h would apply to existing as well as new and modified sources does not apply to the egu ca tegory because it was not among those listed by the administrator at the mact programs inceptionsigned contracts for mercury control equipment11 as result epa is likely to have to promulgate more stringent mact standard s than those the agency proposed in 2003 setting such standards might take as long as three years as epa gathers information on current emission levels and the effectiveness of cont rol technologies delaying promulgation to as late as 2011 and the eff ective date of the standards to 2014 according to knowledgeable observers in order to speed epas deliberations and to eliminate the uncertainties regarding the timing of new regulations senator carper has intr oduced s 2643 which would require the administrator to propose mact regulations for egus by october 1 2008 the bill would require mercury emission reductions of not less than 90 percent from new and existing egus under the mact in the house legislation introduced last year by representative eddie bernice johnson hr 1087 would require the promul gation of mercury mact standards for egus to take effect one year after the enactme nt of the legislation unlike the carper bill the johnson bill does not discuss the level of emission reductions to be required in the absence of such discussion it would defer to the acts requirements in section 112d3 these require new sources to meet standard not less stringent than the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source and existing sources to meet standard that shall not be less string ent and may be more stringent than the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources there are also five multipollutant bills introduced in this congress bills that would regulate sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emissions from egus in addition to mercury most would requi re 90 reduction of mercury emissions from egus with the compliance deadlines varying from 2011 to 201512 for further discussion of these bills see crs report rl34018 air quality multipollutant legislation in the 110th congress in the meantime while the agency considers whether to appeal the courts ruling or to develop new regulations in response to the courts remand and congress considers whether to legislate new coalfired electric generating units and modifications of existing units will be required to obt ain permits under provision of the law known as the mact hammer section 112g213 under this provision if applicable emission limits have been established for category of listed hap sources pe rson may construct new major source or modify an existing major source in the category unless thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22817crs6 administrator or the delegated state agency determines on casebycase basis that the unit will meet standards equivalent to the maximum achievable emission controls thus if the courts ruling stands it would appear to guarantee that all new and some existing egus will be subject to more stringent mercury control standards in the immediate future
