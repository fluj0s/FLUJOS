if these activities are to continue tpafasttrack renewal may be central issue in the 110 th congress within the debate major issue is expected to be whether to include as principal negotiating objective in trade agreements enforceable core labor standards two tpafasttrack authorities have incorporated labor provisions the first the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 otca which expired in 1994 included the broad general objective to promote worker rights the north american free trade agreement with its labor side agreement was negotiated under otca th second and current tpa authority with labor provisions the trade act of 2002 includes protections for labor modified by protections for country governments businesses and investors seven free trade agreements ftaswith chile singapore australia morocco bahrain oma n and the dominican republic and central americawere negotiated under this authority all have only one enforceable labor requirement that each country not fail to enforce its own labor laws in manner affecting trade between the parties in contrast to this the usjordan fta negotiated in 2000 and approved in 2001 without tpafast track authority includes enforceable labor provisions major options for labor provisions in renewed tpafasttrack authority focus on whether principal negotiating objectives should include enforceable core labor standards supporters argue that including these could help 1 slow the offshoring of certain us jobs 2 protect foreign workers against exploitative corporate behavior 3 support the ability of workers to share in the gains from internatio nal trade and 4 fend off an international race to the bottom based on labor costs opponents argue that 1 core labor standards should be promoted by the international labor organization not by trade agreements 2 as countries develop they adopt higher labor standards on their own 3 str onger worker protections could discourage international investment and 4 labor standards are disguised protectionism history shows that with or without ftas trade will likely continue to grow this report examines issues relating to tpafasttrack labor provisions in the larger context of global labor issues it 1 identifies the players and their positions 2 tracks the enforceable labor provisions in tpafasttrack laws and the ftas negotiated under them 3 presents some legislative options for new tpafasttrack labor provisions and 4 sets out arguments for and against enforceable core labor standards finally it looks at possible outcomes and implications of the

promotion authority tpa formerly known as fast track authority is scheduled to expire july 1 2007 with it will expire the authority that congress grants the president to enter into certain trade agreements and the authority for congress to consider implementing legislation for them under expedited procedures the administration is still negotiating number of trade agreements that may not be completed before the tpa is set to expire thus tpafasttrack renewal may be central issue in the 110 th congress if these activities are to continue1 within the tpafasttrack renewal debate major issue is expected to be which labor provisions to set forth as as principal negotiating objectivesthat is which labor provisions to set forth as priority for negotiators to seek in trade agreements2 two sets of provisions are probable candidates one supported by labor advocates is expected to be to ensure that party does not fail to enforce core labor standards in manner affecting trade related provisions could 1 identify set of mutually agreed upon core labor standards defined in the next section and 2 provide that violation of these standards would be subject to enforcement under the single set of dispute settlement procedures that would be applicable to all disputes an alternative is expected to be the current principal negotiating objective to ensure that party does not fail to enforce its own labor laws commonly referred to as the enforceyourown standard this provision would be enforceable under current dispute settlement procedures that call for treating principal negotiating objectives equally the difference between the two approaches reflects criticism by labor advocates that in general labor provisions in ftas negotiated so far 1 lack the enforceability of commercial provisions 2 clearly fail to meet some congressional negotiating objectives for trade agreements and barely comply with others 3 represent big step back from both the usjordan fta negotiated and approved during hiatus when tpafasttrack authority had expired and from us unilateral trade preference programs such as the generalized system of preferences gsp and 4 completely exclude obligations for governments to meet such international standards as worker rights 3 the issue of including enforceable core labor standards as principal negotiating objective also reflects strategy to change the way labor interests are mirrored in trade agreements by tightening the blueprint for them opponents argue that provisions in ftas negotiated under the current tpa 1 are the strongest labor provisions attached to ftas to date 2 are the product of bilateral negotiation and 3 both depend on and reflect mutual agreement by negotiating countries over which provisions to include opponents also argue 4 that enforceable core labor standards would raise sovereignty issues 1 for general discussion on tpa renewal see crs report rl33743 trade promotion authority tpa issues options and prospects for renewal by j f hornbeck and william h cooper 2 the trade act of 2002 does not specifically define principal negotiating objective however the conference report hrept 107624 p 229 defines it using the words quoted above 3 see for example us chile free trade agreement report of the labor advisory committee for trade negotiations and trade policy lac february 28 2003 p 3 the lac consisted of 58 members of various unions

responses by opponents it does so in the larger context of how and where enforceable labor provisions in tpafasttrack authority and the trade agreements negotiated under them intersect with global labor issues thus it first identifies the stakeholders who care positively or negatively about enforceable labor provisions and their positions on the issue after that it 1 tracks the enforceable labor provisions in tpafasttrack laws and the ftas they have spawned 2 presents some legislative options for new tpafasttrack provisions relating to enforceable labor provisions and 3 sets out arguments for and against enforceable core labor standards from the perspective of the parties that could be affected by the standards finally it looks at possible outcomes and implications of the various legislative options for an overview of most recent developments on this issue please turn to the last section before the appendix

authority include as principal negotiating objective for trade agreements handful of enforceable core labor standards or internationally recognized worker rights the terms internationally recognized worker rights or core labor standards are technically defined in separate ways by us trade law the trade act of 1974 sec 507 and the international labor organization ilo united nations organization4 both definitions are almost identical and share four standards or rights 1 the right to organize 2 the right to bargain collectively 3 prohibition of forced labor and 4 protections for child labor including the worst forms of child labor5 they differ on the fifth standard us law identifies it as 5 labor standards pertaining to minimum wages maximum hours and occupational safety and health ilo conventions define it as 5 freedom from employment discrimination 6 in recent years these terms have become somewhat confusing because the current tpa law included in the trade act of 2002 and trade agreements negotiated under it have adopted the us list of internationally recognized worker rights as the definition of the term core labor standards consequently this report will use the term core labor standards to refer to either list and will mention ilo core labor standard s us internationally recognized worker rights or us list only when referring to standards defined by either specific source 4 for the ilo definition of core labor standards and table of countries that have signed onto each see the ilo table of ratifications of the fundamental human rights conven tions by country at httpwwwiloorgilolexenglishdocs declworldhtm which includes direct links to the texts of each core labor standard 5 the worst forms of child labor include the employment of children for purposes including prostitution pornography drug trafficking armed conflict and forced labor 6 the trade act of 1974 refers to the us list as internationally recogn ized worker rights the ilo refers to its list as core labor standards the current tpa authority in the bipartisan trade promotio n authority act of 2002 title xxi of the trade act of 2002 combines the ilo name and the us list defining the us list as core labor standards

some type of enforceable core labor standardsone international and the other domestic internationally the objective of labor advocates seemingly is humanitarian to promote the protection of workers around the world particularly those in developing countries where global investment converges to take advantage of cheap labor in such countries adults or even children may have to work long hours under unhealth and unsafe conditions with few personal or hygienic freedoms for low pay moreover they may not be permitted the basic right to form unions and bargain collectively with their employers to improve those conditions7 domestically the objective of labor advocates is seemingly more economic to help level the playing field between us and foreign workers so that us workers can compete with those in developing countries on more equitable basis more equitable playing field they argue would provide at least some incentive for businesses to find ways to remain andor expand in the united states instead of looking for ways to offshore parts of their operations to countries where labor costs are cheaper estimates on us jobs lost to international trade and offshore outsourcing are hard to come by however jobs at risk have expanded from blue collar to white collar and from the manufacturing to high end service sector and research and development jobs and now include in addition to call center and data entry jobs higher skill professional jobs in fields such as engineering computer chip design nanotechnology and medical test analysis that have become important in the knowledgebased economy g4g158g156g146g151g142g156g156g561g9g155g152g158g153g156g561 opposite labor advocates are many business groups whose main objective is typically to support the passage of tpafasttrack authority in order to facilitate the expansion of us multinational corporations abroadtheir most important ave nue for continued growth both tpafasttrack authority and trade agreements typically include many protections for investors for eight years between 1994 and 2002 however the issue of whether or not to include any kind of enforceable labor provisions in trade agreements was major point of contention in the debate over renewal of tpafasttrack authority during that time some tpafasttrack renewal bills would have prohibited some types of labor provisions in trade agreements negotiated under them8 ultimately 2001 report prepared for the us trade representative by the business roundtable made up of chief executive officers from roughly 200 major companies led the way 7 for summary on working conditions in various countries see the state departments country reports on human rights practices updated yearly each year the volume updates reports on worker rights conditions

and environmental objectives in trade and investment negotiations the united states must grant our trade negotiators the flexibility to negotiate it stressed that international labor and environmental issues have emerged as the principal stumbling blocks the business roundtable believes that the issue is longer whether they should be addressed in international trade and investment negotiations but rather how to address them constructively9 g6g142g159g142g149g152g153g146g151g144g561g5g152g158g151g157g155g146g142g156g561 developing countries care about how enforceable core labor standards affect either positively or negatively their ability to attract investment in 1996 at the world trade organization wto singapore ministerial meeting of ministers of wto members developing countries which formed majority there voted down the us proposal for committee to study the relationship between worker rights and trade they did so because they were afraid formation of such committee could lead to the imposition of enforceable labor standards that could undercut their comparative advantage in lowcost labor as result of these votes the singapore declaration the final document summarizing what they decided named the ilo as the competent body to set and deal with international labor standards 10 the ilo has as its main enforcement mechanism the tools of consensus and persuasion

of the ftafasttrack laws has shifted with various presidents and various circumstances it typically mirrors the interests of the party it represents the clinton administration was supportive of enforceable labor standards in trade agreements first it negotiated the labor side agreement to the north american free trade agreement nafta then it pushed for studying the link between worker rights and trade at the 1997 singapore ministerial as mentioned above next it promoted worker rights protections at the subsequent 1999 ministerial in seattle washington the conference there was cut short

standards in the body of the agreement however in an exchange of letters jordans ambassador to the united states and the us trade representative agreed to resolve any disputes that might arise without

the first tpafasttrack law to include labor provisions as principal negotiating objectives was the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 otca pl 100418 its full list of labor principal negotiating objectives is included in the table a1 most importantly these include the general but vague requirement to promote worker rights this requirement led to the first labor provisions attached to bilateral or regional trade agreement 13 the agreement was nafta and labor provisions were included in labor side agreement not in the body of the agreement itself the labor side agreement included 1 labo r provisions with limited enforceability detailed below 2 its own dispute resolution procedures for labor issues and 3 dollar cap on penalties the labor provisions in the nafta labor side agreement required that each party the united states mexico and canada enforce its own labor laws and standards only two of the five core labor standards however were to be enforceable and one of these is only partially enforceable the enforceable standards are for child labor protections and b two components of labor standards minimum wages and occupational safety and health among standards not enforceable under the nafta labor side agreement were countrys own laws protecting the rights of workers to organize and bargain collectively

eightyear hiat us when there was tpafasttrack law 1994 2002 during this time the administration negotiated and congress approved the usjordan fta this agreement included number of labor provisions in the body of the agreement that were technically enforceable through the agreements single dispute resolution procedure some of these provisions were later echoed in the bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2002 discussed below the most important such labor provision specified that parties shall not fail to effectively enforce their own labor laws through sustained or recurring course of action or inaction in manner affecting trade between the parties labor laws were defined as the us list recognizing the right of each party to exercise enforcement discretion parties also agreed to strive to ensure that both ilo and us core labor standards are recognized and protected by domestic law and b recognize the right of each party to establish modify and improve its labor standards for

g3g144g155g142g142g150g142g151g157g156g561 the second tpa law with principal negotiating objectives for labor was the bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2002 title xxi of the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 which is set to expire july 1 2007 its principal negotiating objectives for labor repeated in table a1 include 1 to ensure that party does not fail to effectively enforce its own labor laws and 2 to strengthen the capacity of us trading partne rs to promote respect for core labor standards modifying these provisions are others in the list of principal negotiating objectives for labor that offer protections for governments businesses and investors 3 to recognize that parties to trade agreement retain the right to exercise discretion in the allocation of enforcement resources and 4 to ensure that labor practices of the parties do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against us exports or serve as disguised barriers to trade under this tpa seven trade agreements have been negotiated and approved 14 these are with chile singapore australia morocco bahrain oman and single agreement with five central american countries costa rica salvador guatemala honduras and nicaragua and the dominican republic known as caftadr in addition this tpa has facilitated agreements with two other countries peru and colombia which are awaiting congressional action15 labor provisions in the various agreements are detailed in table a2 for dispute resolution the principal negotiating objective is 5 to seek provisions that treat allie including those for labor and those for commercial disputes us principal negotiating objectives equally with respect to the ability to resort to dispute settlement and the availability of equivalent dispute settlement procedures and remedi in what is seen by labor advocates as departure from this language two characteristics stand out first each of the seven trade agreements has only one labor provision subject to the agreements dispute settlement process that each country must enforce its own labor laws second procedures for labor disputes differ in several respects from those for commercial disputes and include cap on monetary penalties opponents argue however that the treatment of labor and commercial disputes is equal because the procedures and remedies are equivalent 14 crs reports addressing these ftas include

when discussing legislative options for renewal of the tpafasttrack authority it is important to keep in mind several things first tpafasttrack authority represents statutory requirements for presidential negotiation of ftas rather than requirements for ultimate provisions in the ftas second number of factors may converge to determine the ultimate labor provisions in ftas including 1 the labor agenda of the negotiating parties 2 the ability of the united states to persuade potential partner countries to agree to various provisions 3 the political makeup of the congress which must vote the agreements up or down and 4 the level of acceptance of labor provisions by the business community while there may be any number of possible legislative options to address the issue of enforceable labor provisions in tpafasttrack renewal four are discussed below

prohibition on amendments to ftas and its requirement for limited debates some argue foreign countries may be less inclined to negotiate trade agreements with the united states this is because foreign countries would know that anything they agreed upon could possibly be amended by congress and sent back for further negotiation on the other hand congress would be more involved in negotiating any agreements the administration desired to pursue

enforceable core labor standards be included as principal negotiating objective is likely to be the main labor issue for congress to consider in tpafasttrack renewal if the answer to this question is yes the followup question would be which definition or definitions of core labor standards should be included while the aflcio and other labor advocates argue in favor of ilo core labor standards or their equivalents the us council for international business uscib argues against this position saying it could require that us laws be changed to comply the model of the usjordan fta offers third option in the arguments below those against enforceable labor standards as principal negotiating objectives are generally in favor of continuing the enforceyourown labor standards in the current tpa the ilo is not represented in this debate it typically does not take position on specific legislation including tpafasttrack renewal this is because its official role is that of promoting worker

agreement20 the uscambodia textile agreement rewards compliance with local labor laws and international standards with an increase in export quotas to the united states labor advocates traditionally argue that enforceable core labor standards in trade agreements can define the line between comparative advantage and social dumpingcompeting by denying worker rights such denial they argue ends up in race to the bottom as workers all over the world compete against each other for scarce jobs they also argue that labor standards do not interfere with natural comparative advantage in developing countries because labor standards are only one basis for comparative advantage others are abundance of available workforce b skills and education level of the available labor force c infrastructure d level of technological development of the country and natural resource base 21 g3g144g138g146g151g156g157g561 the uscib is the american affiliate of the international chamber of commerce the international organization of employers and the business and industry advisory committee to the oecd its membership includes some 300 leading us companies professional services firms and associations it argues for the continuation of the enforceyourown standard and against enforceable core labor standards as principal negotiating objective this is because it supports and promotes an open system of global commerce in which businesses can flourish and contribute to economic growth human welfare and protection of the environment 22 those against principal negotiating objectives that call for enforceable core labor standards in trade agreements also typically argue that the enforceyourown standards model provides more direct less encumbered path to economic growt h in addition most developing countries have few resources to devote to labor standards enforcement given the many competing needs for use of scarce resources meanwhile once developing country is more economially developed and relatively near full employment workers typically have the clout to begin to demand better protection from their governments on their own imposing core labor standards on developing countries too soon some argue could 1 interfere with their comparative advantage in cheap labor and 2 amount to protectionismthe imposition of an additional set of nontariff barrierswhen the purpose of trade agreements is to reduce trade barriers and stimulate trade and investment 20 crs conversation with carol pier op cit the uscambodia textile agreement provides for 6 minimum annual quota increase for cambodia textile imports but allows the united states to raise quota limits up to an additional 18 if working conditions in that sector substantially comply with local labor laws and

labor advocates argue that principal negotiating objective calling for enforceable labor standards can help level the playing field for us workers and make them more competitive internationally g3g144g138g146g151g156g157g561 others argue that there are better ways to help u s workers than to try to level the playing field which at best may only slow the offshore movement of some us jobs better way they argue may be to expand trade adjustment assistance benefits educational benefits or other training and retraining programs to cover all displaced workers and help them transition into new careers regardless of whether the job loss resulted from trade or technology still others might argue that the need or desire to earn living is often incentive enough to encourage workers displaced by offshoring to find new employment g3g155g144g158g150g142g151g157g156g561g20g142g149g138g157g142g141g561g157g152g561g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g25g152g155g148g142g155g156g561

labor advocates argue that in order for workers to become consumers they must share in the gains of increasing productivity and economic expansion and that enforceable core labor standards can help promote these gains g3g144g138g146g151g156g157g561 opponents argue that real gains in standard of living come from rising productivity not artificially imposed labor standards including minimum wages in addition some workers do not want enforceable core labor standards because these they argue could limit their ability to maximize their earnings through overtime hours opponents also argue that enforceable labor standards are not needed in principal negotiating objectives because other resources besides trade agreements are available to encourage countries to help raise labor standards to protect foreign workers these include 1 us trade preference programs which require that beneficiary countries either currently afford or be taking steps to afford their workers internationally recognized worker rights 23 2 the ilo which offers technical support to countries to help them adopt and enforce core labor standards 3 international labor groups which serve as watchdogs bringing abusive labor conditions to light in the radio print and filmvideo media 4 evolutionary forces in countries characterized by workers themselves 23 us trade preference programs include the generalized system of preferences gsp the caribbean basin economic recovery act cbera the caribbean basin trade partnership act cbtpa the andean trade preference act atpa and the african growth and opportunity act agoa in some cases the us government has withdrawn or is anticipating withdrawal of preferential trade status from countries after an fta with them has gone into effect

us law would particularly need to be amended the uscib argues in such areas as forced labor minimum age for employment and employment discrimination this conclusion was reached through number of

enforceable labor provisions in the jordan fta included in table a2 negotiated and approved when there was tpafasttrack coverage represent third option for the definition of core labor standards the jordan fta carries what many observers consider the strongest labor provisions yet all labor provisions are located in the body of the agreement and all are fully enforceable 28 under the usjordan fta parties agree to 1 reaffirm obligations under the ilo and strive to ensure that both these labor principles and internationally recognized worker rights are recognized and protected by domestic law parties also 2 agree to not fail to effectively enforce their own labor laws in manner that affects trade between the parties 3 agree to strive to ensure that they do not waiver or derogate from their own labor laws in order to encourage trade with the other party 4 recognize the right of each party to establish adopt or modify its labor laws and regulations and strive to ensure that its laws provide for labor standards consistent with us defined internationally r ecognized worker rights and 5 recognize that each party retains enforcement discretion with respect to other matters deemed to have higher priority others argue that while the dispute resolution procedures for the jordan agreement do not preclude broad array of sanctions for noncompliance most of the obligations in the jordan agreement are hortatory or strongly urged rather than mandates thus there is only one obligation that may be enforced and party wishing to complain over the existence and administration of labor laws would need to make the more difficult case that government conduct severely distorts the balance of trade benefits or substantially undermines fundamental objectives of the agreement 29

as efforts are made to find compromise position if enforceable core labor standards were to be adopted as principal negotiating objective in tpafasttrack authority and if enforceable core labor standards were then to be negotiated into trade agreements approved by congress the inclusion of the enforceable standards could move tpafasttrack authority along its evolutionary path to new level of protection for us and foreign workers business advocates however could continue to hold concerns that such standards could interfere with their economic efficiency the economic effects of any enforceable core labor standards in any tpafasttrack renewal on us workers foreign workers and businesses however would likely be small and would depend on number of factors including 1 the extent to which enforceable core labor standards were adopted and implemented in trade agreements 2 the number of trade agreements affected 3 the magnitude of us trade with countries affected by any such agreements and 4 the extent of actual enforcement of any such standards in trade agreements in addition the effects from any of these four factors could be dwarfed by any shifts in the value of the dollar that might occur relative to other currencies if enforceable core labor standards were to be included in any renewed tpafasttrack authority and were then to be included in trade agreements negotiated thereunder many challenges would remain with regard to enforcement foreign governments typically have many competing needs for scarce resources besides protecting the health and safety of their workers in addition the office of the us trade representative and the commerce department working together to process trade disputes would have to choose which disputes to pursue in order to make the best use of scarce agency resources if core labor standards were to be enforced businesses would then have to face decision as to what impa ct if any this would have on their investment decisions if enforceable core labor standards were adopted as principal negotiating objective in tpafast track legislation whether or not the united states would need to make any changes to its labor laws could depend on which definition of core labor standards were to be adopted it is likely that if enforceable core labor standards were to be identified as principal negotiating objective they would be defined in such way that changes in us law might be required if tpafasttrack authority is not renewed or if it should be renewed without enforceable core labor standards number of ways remain to promote labor standards and protect worker rights these include standards currently incorporated into us trade preference programs continuing efforts of the ilo to promote core labor standards the efforts of various labor advocates and international labor watchdog groups economic development forces in various countries which eventually lead to protections of the rights of workers codes of conduct guiding the actions of corporations in protecting the rights of international workers and us government trade capacity building grants which help to improve labor standards in developing

objectives and in trade agreements negotiated under them chairman rangel at hearings featuring us trade representative ustr susan schwab indicated that he was interested engaging in continuing dialogue with the administration over the issue of enforceable labor standards to see if compromise might be worked out on may 10 after much negotiation congress and the administration announced shift in labor trade policy pending us trade agreements would be amended to incorporate key democratic priorities to expand and shape trade in ways that spread the benefits of globalization here and abroad by raising standards the release also announced that this policy clears the way for broad bipartisan congressional support for the pending ftas key provisions of the agreement include fully enforceable commitment that fta countries will adopt maintain and enforce in their laws and practice the five basic international labor standards as stated in the 1998 international labor organization declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work 31 new fully enforceable binding commitment prohibiting fta countries from lowering labor standards new limitations on prosecutorial and enforcement discretion fta countries cannot defend the failure to enforce laws related to the five basic standards due to resource limitations or decisions to prioritize other enforcement issues and

the template language incorporating these concepts was then inserted into trade agreements with peru panama colombia and south korea under agreement between the united states and the respective countries at issue was how core labor standards would be defined the concern was to avoid any possible need to amend us law to conform w ith any strict definitions of ilo core labor standards that might be incorporated into language in the trade agreements the final template language solved this problem by defining core labor standards as set of principles only rather than as set of ilo c onventions or detailed requirements specifically the language specifies that each party shall maintain in its statutes and regulations the rights as stated in the ilo declaration of fundamental
