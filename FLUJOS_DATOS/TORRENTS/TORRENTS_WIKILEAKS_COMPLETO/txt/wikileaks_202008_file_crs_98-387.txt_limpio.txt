amendment hjres 78 david m ackerman legislative attorney american law division summary on march 4 1998 the house judiciary committee voted to report hjres 78 the religious freedom amendment to the house the proposal is the latest in long chain of constitutional amendments that have been introduced since the supreme courts school prayer decisions of engel v vitale1 and abington school district v schempp2 but this is the first time constitutional amendment concerning church and state has been ordered reported by house committee the scope and effect of hjres 78 are also considerably broader than the school prayer issue that has been the focus of most previous proposals and in that respect the measure appears to build on the debate on churchstate issues that occurred in the 104th congress this report summarizes legislative developments on the proposal and briefly analyzes its likely legal effect if added to the constitution legislative background on march 4 1998 the house judiciary committee ordered modified version of hjres 78 reported to the house on partyline vote of 1611 the proposal would add the following language to the constitution to secure the peoples right to acknowledge god according to the dictates of conscience neither the united states nor any state shall establish any official religion but the peoples right to pray and to recognize their religious beliefs heritage or traditions on public property including schools shall not be infringed neither the united states nor any state shall require any person to join in prayer or other religious activity prescribe school prayers discriminate against religion or deny equal access to benefit on account of religion 1 370 us 421 1962 2 374 us 203 1963 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 hjres 78 was originally introduced on may 8 1997 by rep ernest j istook rokla and currently has 153 cosponsors the subcommittee on the constitution of the house judiciary committee held hearing on the proposal on july 22 1997 and on partyline vote of 84 on october 28 1997 forwarded it to the full committee the measure as ordered reported by the judiciary committee differs in three respects from the proposal as it was originally introduced 1 the sentence neither the united states nor any state shall establish any official religion has been added 2 the phrase neither the united states nor any state has been substituted for the government at the beginning of the last sentence and 3 the phrase prescribe school prayers in the last sentence originally read initiate or designate school prayers the changes were all made by the subcommittee on the constitution in substitute proposed during markup by rep hutchinson rar the full committee approved the measure without further change democratic members offered number of amendments to the proposal in both the subcommittee and full committee but all were defeated largely on partyline votes proposed amendments in the full committee markup were as follows 1 proposal by rep scott dva to strike the last phrase or deny equal access to benefit on account of religion rejected 914 2 an amendment by rep nadler dny to strike as well the part concerning the recognition of religious beliefs heritage or traditions on public property rejected on voice vote 3 an amendment by rep scott dva to deny public funding to any religious institution that discriminates on racial grounds rejected on voice vote 4 another proposal by rep scott dva to add the word unreasonably before infringed and to change the words prescribe school prayers to prescribe religious activity rejected on voice vote 5 an amendment by rep jacksonlee dtx to change acknowledge god to freedom of religion rejected 718 6 proposal by rep conyers dmich to bar public schools from authorizing prayer over public address system rejected on voice vote and 7 proposal by rep watt dnc to strike the text and replace it with the language of the religion clauses of the first amendment rejected on voice vote hjres 78 is the latest in long succession of constitutional amendments that have been proposed since the supreme court handed down its school prayer decisions of engel v vitale and abington school district v schempp in 1962 and 1963 but the proposal addresses broader range of churchstate issues than its predecessors and appears to build on competing constitutional proposals that emerged during the 104th congress late in the first session of that congress both rep hyde rill and rep istook introduced proposals to amend the constitution with respect to matters of church and state hjres 121 also introduced in the senate by sen hatch as sjres 45 and hjres 127 respectively3 but the two proposals addressed different aspects of the supreme 3 the religious liberties amendment hjres 127 proposed by rep istook provided as follows to secure the peoples right to acknowledge god according to the dictates continued crs3 courts churchstate jurisprudence and competed for support among proponents of amending the constitution in this area of the law late in the second session of the 104th congress rep armey rtex introduced modified proposal in an effort to unify proponents of changing the constitution in this area of the law hjres 1844 but that effort also proved unavailing thus proposal to amend the constitution with respect to the law of church and state either emerged from committee or came to vote in the house or the senate during the 104th congress but that formal inaction masked what was in fact vigorous examination of churchstate concerns moreover the proposals that were introduced marked significant broadening of the debate about constitutional amendment as they addressed not only the longstanding issue of prayer and other religious practices in the public schools but also such concerns as public aid to religious institutions and the display of religious symbols on public property the only previous vote in the house on constitutional amendment concerning church and state in recent decades occurred in 1971 when the house voted in favor of hjres 191 school prayer proposal by rep wylie roh by margin of 240162 but that was twentyeight votes short of the necessary twothirds majority that measure came to the house floor not by means of committee recommendation but through discharge petition5 constitutional implications 3 continued of conscience nothing in this constitution shall prohibit acknowledgments of the religious heritage beliefs or traditions of the people or prohibit studentsponsored prayer in public schools neither the united states nor any state shall compose any official prayer or compel joining in prayer or discriminate against religious expression or belief the religious equality amendment proposed by rep hyde hjres 121 and by sen hatch sjres 45 provided as follows neither the united states nor any state shall deny benefits to or otherwise discriminate against any private person or group on account of religious expression belief or identity nor shall the prohibition on laws respecting an establishment of religion be construed to require such discrimination 4 also called the religious freedom amendment hjres 184 proposed by rep armey provided as follows in order to secure the right of the people to acknowledge and serve god according to the dictates of conscience neither the united states nor any state shall deny any person equal access to benefit or otherwise discriminate against any person on account of religious belief expression or exercise this amendment does not authorize government to coerce or inhibit religious belief expression or exercise 5 for full recounting of congressional action on school prayer and related proposals see crs report 96846 school prayer the congressional response 19621996 oct 16 1996 crs4 hjres 78 with some modifications essentially consolidates the hyde and istook proposals of the 104th congress into single measure if adopted it would not repeal but would coexist in the constitution with the religion clauses of the first amendment which provide that congress shall make law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof nevertheless hjres 78 clearly is intended to alter number of judicial interpretations of those clauses particularly of the establishment clause much of the legislative history of the proposal is yet to be written of course but at this point in the measures consideration its likely constitutional effects appear to include the following 1 public aid to sectarian institutions hjres 78 appears to loosen considerably the existing constitutional limitations on public aid to sectarian institutions particularly of direct aid the proposals concluding words neither the united states nor any state shall discriminate against religion or deny equal access to benefit on account of religion likely would require government to include even pervasively religious entities in grant and contract programs currently the establishment clause allows direct public aid to religious entities if their secular functions can be separated from their religious ones and the aid is channeled only to the entities secular functions but it bars direct aid if the entity is so pervasively religious that the aid cannot be confined to secular neutral and nonideological purposes6 under hjres 78 pervasively religious entities could not be excluded from participation in direct public aid programs for which they would otherwise be eligible and existing supreme court constructions of the establishment clause that require such exclusion would be overridden7 the proposals impact on indirect aid programs such as voucher and tax benefit measures would not be quite as dramatic current interpretations of the establishment clause allow such indirect aid to flow even to pervasively sectarian entities so long as the primary recipient of the benefit has genuinely free choice about where to use it and is not channeled by government toward religious entity8 hjres 78 would not change that interpretation but under current law government can include nonreligious private entities in indirect public aid programs and exclude religious ones hjres 78 appears to mandate the inclusion of private religious entities including pervasively religious ones in any indirect assistance program that also includes nonreligious private entities with respect to both direct and indirect aid programs hjres 78 would also override state constitutional provisions that bar the funding of religious entities 2 religious activities on public property less certain is hjres 78s effect on the supreme courts jurisprudence concerning religious activities in the public schools and the display of religious symbols on public property the court has construed the establishment clause to prohibit government from sponsoring or promoting religious 6 committee

and zobrest v catalina foothills school district 509 us 1 1993 crs5 activities or doctrines in the public schools9 and from sponsoring or displaying quintessential religious symbols by themselves on public property10 but it has in addition interpreted the establishment free exercise and free speech clauses to provide substantial protection to private religious expression private religious speech far from being first amendment orphan is as fully protected under the free speech clause as secular private expression the supreme court has said11 thus the court has held the first amendment to require public universities to allow student religious groups to use campus facilities on the same basis as nonreligious student groups12 it has upheld as well the equal access act13 extending the same right to students at the secondary school level affirmed released time programs of religious instruction14 and implicitly approved the constitutionality of properly drafted moment of silence statute15 in addition in number of decisions it has held the first amendment to protect private religious expression on public property including privately sponsored displays of quintessential religious symbols16 to the extent that the sentence in hjres 78 stating that the peoples right to pray and to recognize their religious beliefs heritage or traditions on public property including schools shall not be infringed is read to apply only to private religious expression it appears to be largely consonant with and not to alter existing constitutional law but much of the ferment over the law of church and state has been stimulated by the courts decisions concerning government sponsorship and endorsement of religious expression and the legislative history of hjres 78 to date seems to make clear that it is intended to undo at least some of that jurisprudence rep istook has testified for instance that his proposal would overturn engel and abington to the extent that they disallow group classroom prayer on voluntary basis reverse lee v weismans restriction on prayer at graduation ceremonies annul stone v grahams prohibition on the posting of the ten commandments on classroom walls cancel county of alleghenys ban on the display of creche by itself on public property negate lemon v kurtmans restriction on government acting with religious purpose and supersede number of lower court decisions barring religious symbols on government seals and logos but he has also said that hjres 78 would retain the first amendments existing bans on government 9 engel v vitale supra

mandating religious activity prescribing the content of prayer and designating an official religion17 hjres 78 in short does not appear to be limited to protecting private religious speech but would allow the government to play an affirmative role but in the present state of the proposals legislative consideration the scope of governments role with respect to religious speech does not appear to be entirely clear greater clarity may emerge once the judiciary committee issues its report on the proposal 3 acknowledge god hjres 78s opening words to secure the peoples right to acknowledge god according to the dictates of conscience would introduce specifically religious term into the constitution for the first time unlike most state constitutions and unlike the declaration of independence
