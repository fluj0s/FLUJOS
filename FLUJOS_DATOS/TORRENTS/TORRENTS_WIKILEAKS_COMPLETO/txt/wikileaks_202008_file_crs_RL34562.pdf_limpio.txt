l reserve the fed broad operational independence it retains overs ight responsibilities to ensure that it meets its mandate congress has given the fed dual mandate to maintain maximum sustainable employment and price stability at times these goals can conflict the economy may have reached such point with slow growth and rising inflation in 2008 economists are divided over whether the fed has r ecently placed too much emphasis on responding to the economic slow down at the risk of jeopardizing price stability since september 2007 the fed has ggressively reduced interest rates and lent to the banking system to stimulate the economy and to stabilize the financial sector these actions have been descri bed as risk management approach to monetary policy in which low rates are employed to insure against lowprobability but highcost events such as financial crisis even at the cost of higher shortterm inflation to date an ec onomic recession has been voided but inflation has accelerated when the fed believes the economy to be on sound footing many expect it to gradually reverse much or all of the recent rate cuts since they maintain that given economic conditions current rates are inconsistent with price stability in the long run some economists believe this monetary easing must be removed quickly to avoid persistent and unwanted increase in inflation past experience suggests that once higher inflation becomes entrenched costly reductions in economic output may be required to reduce it thus some s hortterm loss of output may be seen as desirable in order to mainta in longterm price stability other economists argue that current policy is appropriate because higher inflation is not pressing problem they argue that inflation has only risen because of temporary factors there is enough slack in the economy to offset inflationary pressu res and inflationary expectations remain well grounded httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34562contents s l w g r w t h 1 i l p r i c s

congress has given the fed dual mandate to maintain maximum sustainable employment and price stability policy of pursuing maximum sustainable employment would also tend to minimize the upward and downward swings in the business cycle price stability refers to low and stable rate of price inflation throughout the business cycle at times these goals can conflict the current environment appears to be one of those times slow growth figure 1 shows growth in real gross domes tic product gdp by quarter since 2000 begi nning with the fourth quarter of 2007 there appears to have been significant slowdown in economic growth the real gdp growth rate was 06 in the last quarter of 2007 and 10 in the fi rst quarter of 2008 between the beginning of the current expansion in the last quart er of 2001 and the third quarter of 2007 the growth rate had been 29 although the possibility of recession has been widely discussed thus far econo mic output has not fallen there has been an increase in the unemployment rate however and employment has been falling modestly since the beginning of 2008 recessions are not declar ed at their onset so the recent changes in the labor market may be sign one will be officially declared at some point in the future economists have identified three main economic shocks that explain why the economy has slowed rapid increases in the price of oil significant declines in housing prices and liquidity crunch1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34562crs2 2 households may also choose to pay higher energy costs by reducing saving instead of cutting back on other kinds of spendingsource department of commerce bureau of economic analysis oil prices changes in oil prices have much greater effect on the economy than do changes in the prices of most ot her goods and services sudden increase in the price of oil has direct effect on the cost of energy consumed by households energy accounts for close to 10 of the tota l market basket of prices measured by the consumer price index other things being equal large increase in the cost of energy can have significant effects on house hold budgets higher energy prices may encourage households to consume less energy as well as fewer of those goods and services whose prices are directly affected2 to the extent that energy takes up larger proportion of household budgets ther will be less demand for other goods and services reducing output and employ ment in the rest of the economy energy is also an important input in the production of other goods and services when its price rises it pushes up producti on costs raising prices and slowing demand in response production of thos goods which require relatively more energy tends to fall reducin g both output and employment the effects of an oil price increase on output and employment are temporary but it may take while for the compositi on of both demand and output to adjust to the new price in the short run policymakers are s till faced with slowdown in economic growth and an increase in unemployment housing prices following years of appr eciation na tional house prices leveled off in 2006 and have since fallen falling prices had

marc labonte and edward murphyfalling house prices also influence household consumption via wealth effect households save in order to accumulate wealth to finance retirement as well as to be able to weather unforeseeable rd times asset appr eciation may be seen by many households as substitute for savi ng and so they may cut back on saving as their assets appreciate in value this process may also work in the other direction decline in house prices may cause househol ds to increase their saving and reduce their consumption spending whic h would be drag on the economy some who bought or refinanced houses near the peak of the housing boom and anticipated continued house price appreciati on may face some fina ncial distress if the values of their houses fall below the am ounts of their loans and the interest rates on their mortgages go up they may have limited refinancing op tions and less access to other kinds of credit households in th at situation might be forced to consume less than they otherwise would the liquidity crunch the decline in housing pr ices also had consequences for the financial sector partly because of falling house prices and high initial loan toprice ratios the rate of loan defaults increased falling prices led to higher default rates because homeowners could not rid themselves of loans they could longer afford by selling their houses those loans might become unaffordable either because the borrowers barely qualified at the start and their economic situation deteriorated or because they were adju stablerate loans and borrowers could not afford the financing costs when the rate was raised the rising number of mortgage loan defa ults caused the prices and liquidity of mortgagebacked securities mbs to fall and those financial institutions that held them to suffer significant losses this had direct effect on the availability of credit in mortgage markets and also spread be yond mortgage markets to affect the overall availability of credit demand for treasury securities rose in flight to quality and that tended to push up interest rates for other kinds of cr edit liquidity dried up in several asset markets retarding efficient financial intermediation3 accelerating inflation coincident with the slowdown in economic growth the inflation rate has been accelerating figure 2 shows two commonly cited measures of inflation one line shows the annual rate of change in the llitems consumer pri ce index for all urban consumers cpiu this measure is sometimes referred to as headline inflation the other line tracks the allite ms index less food and energy prices both of these show the annualized sixmonth rate of chan ge the index less food and energy prices is sometimes used in an attempt to discer n the underlying trend rate of inflation which may be masked over short periods of time by changes in food or energy prices which tend to be more volatile than the prices of other categories of goods and services change in the index which leav out food and energy prices is sometimes referred to as the core rate of inflationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34562crs4 4 another concern is that the large deprecia tion in the dollar in recent years will result in higher import prices that will feed through to higher overall inflation 5 for an overview see crs report rl30354 monetary policy and the federal reserve by marc labonte and gail makinensource department of labor bureau of labor statistics as the chart shows changes in the allitems index are much more variable than are those in the core index it also indicates that change in the core index now is not much above what it has been for much of the period since 2000 the allitems measure of inflation however is higher now than it has been for most of the last eight years and shows an upward trend since 2005 it is this increase in overall inflation that is becoming more of concern for the federal reserve4 recent fed policy the fed influences economic activity by ch anging its target for the federal funds rate an overnight interbank interest rate when the fed lowers the federal funds rate it leads to increases in interestsensitive spending which includes business capital investment in plant and equipment residential investme nt spending house building and consumer spending on certain durable goods such as automobiles lower interest rates would also be expected to reduce the foreign exchange value of the dollar all else equal which would tend to boost ex ports and importcompeting goods as result overall spending in the economy rises as does inflation when the fed raises the federal funds rate ove rall spending and in flation tend to fall5 since september 2007 the fed has aggressi vely lowered the federal funds rate from 525 to 2 as of the june 2008

turmoil federal reserve policy res ponses by marc labonte 7 alan greenspan risk and uncertainty in monetary policy remarks at the meetings of the american economic associati on san diego california jan 3 2004 8 ben s bernanke the logic of monetary policy remarks before the national economists club washington dc dec 2 2004 9 based on statistical analysis presented in bank of international settlements 78th annual report june 2008 p 62several new facilities in order to lend directly to the banking system and for the first time since the 1930s the investment banks6 one useful framework for understanding th current stance of fed policy is the riskmanagement appro ach described in 2004 by thenfed chairman alan greenspan as greenspan explained it given our inevitably incomplete knowledgea central bank needs to consider not only the most likely future path for the economy but also the distribution of possible outcomes about that path7 for example if the economy faces the risk of severe economic downturn then the fed would using this approach take precautionary steps to prevent it even if there were only low probability it would occur in current chairman ben bernankes words greenspans riskmanagement approach sens ibly reflects the fact that the entire distribution of possible outcomes not ju st the average or most likely expected outcome matters for policy choice8 this approach appears well suited to explaining recent fed actions turmoil in financial markets could have led to financial crisis that would have caused sharp contraction in output throughout the ec onomy and resulted in sharp increase in unemployment scenario where financial turmoil resulted in crisis may not have been the most likely outcome but the fed nevertheless responded with sharp easing of policy to prevent it more easing than would have been expected based on past experience9 if that explains current policy expected inflation is likely to be somewhat higher than desirable as re sult since policy is not based on the most likely outcome policy approach focuse d on the most likely outcome might have called for more modest monetary easing instead since headline inflation has recently been above the feds selfdefined comfort zone and rising the fed has tended to focus on core inflation which omits food and energy in recent years for policymaking purposes however and this measure has been more stable with federal funds rate that is curren tly lower than the inflation rate the cost of overnight bank borrowing is negative in real inflationadjusted terms if this policy were to persist inflation would tinue to accelerate and this would conflict with the feds goal of price stability the june 2008 meeting was the first since september 2007 that the federa l funds rate was not reduced it was kept constant in the statement issued after the june meeting the fed said although downsidehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34562crs6 10 federal open market committee federal reserve board of

recurrence by brian w cashell and marc labonterisks to growth remain they appear to have diminished somewhat and the upside risks to inflation and inflati on expectations have increased10 it is widely expected that the fed will begin to reverse recent in terest rate reductions once it believes that the threat of recession has passed but the right time to begin monetary tightening has been widely debated economists sympathetic with the risk ma nagement approach have applauded the feds aggressive rate cuts and the creation of new lending facilities they argue that without them the probability of financial crisis would have been too high and the housing crash would likely have been deeper they caution that it is too soon to raise rates because financial markets are still fragile with demand for mortgagebacked securities and other highrisk securities still depressed and financial institutions unable to withstand another market decline they believe the economy to be in or close to recession in 200811 and argue that rate incr eases should be postponed until economic growth is on sound footing again they argue that the recent rise in inflation will not persist because weak economy will depress infl ationary pressures normally inflation decelerates in recession as workers respond to rising unemployment by lowering their wage mands and firms res pond to falling demand by lowering product prices ironically th is means if fed policy succeeds in avoiding recession it raises the likelihood that inflation will become problem other economists have argued that the fe d should begin to raise interest rates soon or should have already started they argue that the fed should not focus too much on avoiding economic downturns when it jeopardizes price stability there is only so much that the fed can do to offset recessionary pressures even if the economy were to enter recessi on it has shown th ability to bounce back in the past in the current case some might argue that the large market adjustments now underway in housing nd financial markets must run their course and there is nothing the fed can do to insulate the economy from these forces in contrast they argue that price stability is precious commodity that once lost can be difficult to gain back for exampl the 1970s are remembered as the decade of stagflation when high inflation becam so ingrained that it remained high even when economic growth was sluggish12 it was not until paul volcker became chairman that the fed decided to stamp out inflationary pressures at any cost the federal funds rate rose to r ecord highs and inflation did not fall to low levels until the economy had suffered its worst recession since the great depression thus some would argue that mild recession today w ould ultimately be less costly than if inflation were allowed to get high enough that deeper recession would be needed to get it to fall againhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34562crs7 according to mainstream economic theory the persistently high inflation of the 1970s was caused by the feds decision to t federal funds rate target that was consistently negative in real terms ie lower than the inflation rate from 1974 to 1977 and again in 1979 as figure 3 illustrates the only other time that the inflationadjusted federal funds rate has been consis tently negative since 1970 was from the end of 2002 to 2005 and again since the beginning of 2008 negative federal funds rates we re not as negative in this decade as in the 1970s however sources board of governors of the federal reserve system department of labor bureau of labor statistics notes nominal federal funds rate is the market rate real federal funds rate is the market rate less actual consumer price index inflation expectations economists have pointed to inflationary expectations as an important reason why it was so costly to stamp out the high inflation of the 1970s once households and i nvestors begin to expect inflation to be high it can take drastic change in po licy and economic conditions to convince them that fed commitment to lowering inflation is credible on the other hand if the public be lieves that the fed is committed to low inflation th inflationary expectations may not rise quickly when th fed lowers interest rates in response to negative economic shocks if the fed keeps interest rates low for too long however inflationary expectations may begin to rise again if that were to happen any attempt in the future to reduce inflation might well be more costly temporary rise in the measured inflation rate becomes more difficult policy problem if that higher rate comes to affect the rate of inflation that is expected in the future inflation expectations affect investment decisions as well as wage negotiations in labor markets the survey research center at the university of michigan asks consumers each month what they expect the inflation rate to be over the next 12 months figure 4 shows the median expected price change from that survey1970 1973 1977 1981 1985 1989 1993 1996 2000 2004 2008505101520 nominal realfigure 3 federal funds rate in real and nominal

bank for example increased its benchmark interest rate by quarter of percent to 425 on july 3 2008 in order to combat inflation th ere george frey ecb raises key rate to 425 associated press report available at httpbizyahoocomap080703source university of michigan survey research center as the chart shows the survey suggests recent spike in the expected rate of inflation the history of this survey also shows that this has happened in the past without proving to be permanent shift in ex pectations if however even part of the recent spike persists that will present complication to the fed in its efforts to maintain low and stable rate of infl ation another measure of inflationary expectations the difference between the yield on infla tionindexed and nonindexed treasury bonds does not yet show similar spike13 the policy dilemma the recent upward trend in overall inflation has been driven by rapid increases in food and energy prices price shocks like these leave the fed with dilemma should they tighten policy to offset the infl ationary effects of these shocks or ease policy to offset the negative effects of the shocks on growth in recent years the fed has focused more on keeping core inflati on which excludes food and energy prices stable and tolerated increases in headline inflation14 in the current context the fed2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 20080123456figure 4 expected price change for the next 12 monthshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34562crs9 14 continued europe_interest_rateshtml 15 there has been some debate on whether th rise in food and energy prices should be considered strictly exogenous shock or partly influenced by the feds monetary policy the general upward trend in food and energy prices has been largely determined by world supply and demand most analysts have concluded it is because the s upply of f ood and energy has been growing more slowly than demand with the biggest increases in demand occurring in rapidly growing developing econom ies demanddriven price increases can be caused by the world economy growing at an unsustainable pace but if that were the case the feds monetary policy would be only one sma ll part of that story according to the international monetary fund imf world ov erall inflation has risen from 36 in 2006 to projected 47 in 2008 16 for the debate on whether core or headline in flation is more appropriate for policymaking see crs report rs22705 inflation core vs headline by marc labontehas not seen higher food or energy prices as reason to reverse its policy of monetary easing as was shown in figure 2 long period of rapidl rising energy prices resulted in number of years where headline inflation was higher than core inflation the feds rationale for allowing headline inflation to rise bove its comfort zone is its belief that onetime increases in infl ation caused by food or energy shocks will have lasting effect on futu re inflation the fed might argue that the inflationary effects of these types of shocks are larg ely beyond its control and therefore should not be taken as sign that it is neglecting its price stability mandate15 critics argue that price shocks lasting for years s hould not be considered transitory and persistently accommodating these shocks will eventually raise inflationary expectations and feed through to higher co re inflation after all goods related to food and energy are significant portion of the average households budget to date core inflation has shown only slight incr ease thus an evaluation of whether the fed has paid sufficient attention to the price stability part of its mandate depends mainly on which measure of inflation is appropriate for po licy purposes some studies have cast doubt on the idea that increas in headline inflation will not persist as long as core inflation remains stable16 the choices facing the fed today can be compared to those of the 20012003 period mild recession in 2001 was followed by an initially sluggish recovery in which employment did not start rising until the second half of 2003 from 2001 to 2003 the fed reduced the federal funds rate to 1 where it remained til june 2004 when the fed felt confident that the economic recovery wa s selfsustaining it then gradually began rais ing the federal funds rate wh ich remained negative in real terms until 2005 while prolonged monetary stimulus may have ensured that the nascent economic recovery did not peter out in hindsight critics have argued that low rates helped spark housing bubble which is largely responsible for the economys current predicament if the fed had started raising rates earlier then inflation might not have shown the upward trend it did fro m 2003 to 2005 if the fed waits too long to raise rates at present they argue the current inflationary trend may feed into expectations of future inflation and beco more difficult and costly to reversehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34562crs10 even if the fed has correctly responde d to current economic weakness case can be made that the current policy dilemma could have been avoided or at least made more palatable if the fed had not previously allowed inflation to climb during the economic expansion had inflation been lower when the economy slowed in 2007 the fed might arguably have been able to implement the monetary stimulus it did without having to worry bout its inflationary effects conclusions in recent weeks fears of financial crisis or that the us ec onomy will enter recession have somewhat subsided as result some economists have shifted their emphasis more toward the possibility that inflation is currently on higher than desired path hindsight is 2020 and if in flation proves to be bigger concern than economic weakness it is not proof that the fed eased policy too much the potential fallout from the liquidity crunch was uncerta in and could have been severe higher than optimal inflation today may have been price worth paying to avoid worst case scenario as the threat of financial turmoil s ubsides however there is the danger of complacency about rising inflation it may be some time before the fed feels confident that the economy is steadily expa nding again and it may decide to leave interest rates low in the meantime but lags between higher interest rates and their effects on the economy may not give the fed th luxury to wait and see there is fear that inflation could accel erate further as happened th last time the fed kept the federal funds rate low earlier in the decad while acknowledging that the risk of recession has not passed it may be less costly to bring inflation down now than in the future an evaluation of whether the fed has maintained price stability depends first of all on whether one accepts the primacy that the fed has given to core inflation for policymaking purposes overall inflation has recently risen to levels that many would deem unacceptably high but core inflation has remained relatively stable
