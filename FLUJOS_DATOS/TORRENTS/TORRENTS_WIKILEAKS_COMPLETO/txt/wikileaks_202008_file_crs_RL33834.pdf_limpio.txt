interested in costs under the defense base act dba the dba requires that many federal government contractors and subcontractors provide workers compensation insurance for their employees who work outside of the united states21 the us army s logcap covers costs for dba insuran ce and includes significant overheard and other costs beyond the costs of the actual insurance claims in september 2007 the usaaa us army audit agency released its audit report of dba costs under logcap and uncovered rising program costs and wide fluctuations in insurance rates in ear ly 2007 an audit of the dba program was initiated by the us army audit agency usaaa due to severa l factors including the growing complexity of the dba prog ram rising program costs and wide fluctuations in insurance rates22 the audit report stated that the costs of dba insurance charges were paid through the armys logcap contract with kbr chairman waxman offered the following testimony on the dba financial transactions under th logcap contract on september 282007 the army audit agency issued report examining dba payments under the single largest contract in iraq kbrs 27 billion contract to provide meals housing laundry and other logistical support to the troops also known as the logistics civil augmentation program logcap the findings in this aud it provide an illustration of the waste in the dba program in its audit the army audit agency reported that the army had reimbursed kbr for dba charges of 284 million made by its insurance company aig through fiscal year 2005 of this amount the auditors reported that aig would be required to pay out only 73 million in actual claims the auditors observed that the cost of dba insurance substantially exceeded the losses experienced by the logcap contractorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33834crs8 23 aig stands for american international group inc 24 us congress house oversight and govern ment reform committee hearing defense base act insurance are

committee received from aig indicate that expenses in providing dba insurance are typically 40 of premiums using this estimate aigs expenses under the logcap contract would be 114 million and its underwriting profit w ould be 97 million the army audit agency concluded that aigs rate s appear unreasonably high and excessive warning of an increased risk that the army could be overcharged the audit report found that there is high risk that the contractor may have been paying more than necessary for this insurance and that significant annual increases insurance companies made to dba insurance rates dont appear to be consistent with th risk army auditors also raised concerns about the co stplus nature of these charges as the auditors stated because the logcap contract is primarily cost reimbursable contract the cost of this insurance is ultimately passed on to the government as result there is little incentive for kbr to control its costs for dba insurance to the contrary under the logcap contract kbr itself is paid its fee as percentage of these dba costs ranging from 1 to 3 meaning that kbr may have r eceived between 28 million and 84 million on top of aigs23 profits although the army auditors found that army personnel at all levels app ear to be aware of and concerned with the high cost of dba insurance they concl uded that sufficient action hadnt been taken to scrutinize these costs the auditors also warned that we believe similar problems could exist on ot her contracts outside the logcap arena24 background awarding of defense contracts in most cases

service contracts have grown with the tec hnical requirements however the size of the federal contractor workforce has decreased there is now an imbalance there are fewer federal contracting officials

contracting experience51 two former ofpp administrators steven kelman and allan burman stated that the current contracting situation creates crisis here they offer their assessment hiring contracting officials is hardly the way to dress for political success who wants to bring in more bureaucrats but there cant be well managed contracts without people to manage them the current situation creates vicious circle overstre tched people make mistakes producing demands for more rules creating additional burdens giving people even less time to plan effective procurement and manage performance52 it is important that both civilian and military procurement sectors have qualified and experienced cont ract professionals in the case of service contracts having professionally traine d contracting

contract was because 1 kbr had been paid 19 million to draft contingency plan to design the guts of the c ontract including the process budget and other details and 2 selecting kbr for the fiveyear

uncontrollable dod has argued that iraq contracting costs are expensive because of the uncerta inty of warrelated requirements for goods and services government contingency contracting in times of war has often favored using programs such as logcap because it enables contracting officials to move quickly to secure contractors who in turn can be deployed quickly into the combat theater while full

to lag in proportion to the decline in the size of the overall defense budget in general and to the acquisition portion of the defense budget in particular at that time congress and dod were at odds over the need for further reductions in the defense acquisition workforce reducing the defense acquisition workforce had been viewed by the congress in the past as necessary requirement for eliminating wasteful spending and pr oviding dod with increased funding for other priorities staffing shortages in the defense contracting personnel to oversee iraq contracts have become part of larger systemic problem within dod75 in reducing the size and shape of the federal acquisiti on workforce an unanticipated result has been the increase in the growth of the private sector service contracts with the growth in service contracting the increase in the number of complex billion dollar contracts and the decline in the number of federal acquisition workforce employees some officials have asserted that ther are not enough dod contracting officials onsite in iraq who are available and expe rienced enough to manage the complexities of the new acquisition programs or oversee private sector contractors it appears to some that dod has downs ized the federal acquisition workforce particularly those that oversee largescale contracts like logcap to dangerously low levels they note that the past downs izing of the defense acquisition workforce has resulted in the loss of technical pe rsonnel and talent drain on dods ability to meet its mission and objectives there are concerns

concluded with the following observations as stated below in the cases we investigated pressu re from the contracting community and buying commands for favorable opinions to support contract negotiations impaired the independence of three audits involving two of the five largest government contractors in additi on dcaa management pressure to 1 complete audit work on time in order to meet performance metrics and 2 report favorable opinions so that work could be reduced on future audits and contractors could be approved fo r directbilling privileges led the three dcaa faos to take inappropriate short cuts ultimately resulting in noncompliance with gagas and internal dcaa cam guidance although it is important for dcaa to issue products in timely manner the only way for auditors to determ ine whether prices paid by the government for needed goods and services are fair and reasonable is by performing sufficient audit work to termine the adequacy of contractor systems and related controls and contractors compliance with laws regulations cas and contract terms further it is important that managers and supervisory auditors at the three locations we investigated work with their audit staff to foster productiv professional relationship and ensure that auditors have the appropriate training knowledge and experience80 potential options for congress congress may choose to consider the following options when examining dod contracts for troop support 1 imple menting of the gansler commissions recommendations 2 broadening of the ju risdiction of the sigir to include dod contracts for troop support services like l ogcap contracts 3 convening of study of the federal employee and contractor workforce 4 requiring more detail to give congress better information to perform its oversight role and 5 establishing dedicated office to conduct audits and investigation of dod contracts httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33834crs24 81 ibid p 16 82 senator collins works to extend the term

the creation of an enhanced contingency far to simplify the rules governing contingency cont racting sigir lessons in contracting and procurement july 2006 p 97option 1 implementing the gansler commission recommendations perhaps the most significant recommendation of the gansler commission is that the army address some institutional and cultural issues that may provide an obstacle to moving forward the commission interviewed number of knowledgeable army officials and conclude d with the following observations about the challenges that the army will face in making significant improvements in its business operations as desc ribed here in the report those charged with getting the job done have provided valuable insight into the doctrine policies tools and resources needed for success clearly the army must address the repeated and alarming testimony that detailed the failure of the institution both the institutional army and the department of defense to anticipate plan for adapt and adjust acquisition and program management to the needs of the operational army as it has been transformed since the end of the cold war into an expeditionary force the institutional army has not adjusted to the challenges of providing timely efficient and effec tive contracting support to the force in operation iraqi freedom more than half of which is contractor personnel essentially the army sent skeleton contracting force into theater without the tools or resources necessary to adequately support our warfighters the personnel placed in that untenable position focused on getting the job done as best they could under the circumstances where support is needed in matter of hours or at best days they used their knowledge skill limited resources and extraordinary dedication to get contracts awarded alarmingly most of the institutional deficiencies remain fourandahalf years after the worlds best army rolled triumphantly into baghdad81 option 2 expanding the sigirs jurisdiction another option is to give the sigir th authority to audit and investigate dod logistical s upport contracts in iraq the sigir has already established presence in iraq and has issued more than 150 reports including audits and investigations his efforts ve largely resulted in the arre st of five people and the convictions of four of th em with more than 17 m illion in assets seized82 the sigir has made several reco mmendations related to his audit and investigation of contracts under his jurisdiction his observa tions and insights ma be relevant and appropriate for the contract administration and oversight of dod contracts for troop support services83httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33834crs25 84 on april 18 2008 dod announced that the army had awarded contracts to three companies under logcap iv each company will compete for task ordersoption 3 convening study of the federal employee and contractor workforce congress may want to convene study of the federal employee and contractor workforce the study could examine thr ee important questions 1 is there an appropriate balance of federal employee nd contractor roles 2 is there an appropriate federal role and presence in the oversight area and 3 is the federal government attracting the right ty pes of acquisiti on professionals congress could require separate report from each military service on the size scope costs and structure of its acquisition workforce including military civilian and contr actor personnel option 4 requiring more detail for better oversight congress could require dod to provide more details for better congressional oversight there are five questions that congress could consider 1 should dod move to limit solesource or limited competition for iraq contracts 2 should dod use more fixedpriced contracting in iraq 3 should task nd delivery orders have certain dollar constraints 4 should task orders be subject to public notice and 5 should larger contracts be divided into smaller contracts with betterdefined discrete tasks to create more transparency and openness in defense acquisitions regarding contract administration costs and perfo rmance congress could require separate report from each military service each repor t could include data on the size scope costs and structure of all contracts particularly nobid so lesource and costs reimbursement contracts congress also could require that specific criteria be met before certain contract arrangements can be approve d by dod or by congress in addition congress could require periodic recompetition of certain types of contracts like logcap that have the potential of spanni ng for many years congress could also require for example that task orders bey ond certain size be treated as separate contract and thus subject to competition among multiple contractors and finally congress could require that large defense contracts be subject to competition and that minimum of three contractors be selected for contracts beyond certain size84 some have suggested based on available press accounts that some contracts for services in iraq might have been segregated into smaller contracts and opened for competitive bidding financial oversight might be more manageable in administering smaller contracts small businesses may have more of an ability to compete for contractshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33834crs26 85 lessons in contracting and procurement sigir july 2006 p 95 86 from the dod inspector ge nerals website at httpwwwdodigosdmilmissionhtmoption 5 establishing dedicated office to conduct audits and investigation of dod contracts one of the recommendations of the sigi r is to designate single unified contracting entity to coordinate all contracting in theater85 one way to accomplish this is to establish contingency c ontracting corp dod initiative currently underway is studying the issue that will deploy to iraq and establish standing presence however what additional resour ces might be necessary in order to provide better contract manage ment and oversight of dodappropriated funds given that the mission of the dod inspect or generals office is to promote integrity accountability and improvement of department of defense personnel programs and operations to support the partments mission and to serve the public interest86 should the dod inspector general have stronger presence in iraq given the many problems associated with logcap contracts oversight agencies like the dod ig could have pivotal role in preventing future contractor waste fraud or mismanagement congress may want to consider creating singularly dedicated office for the audit and investigation of dod c ontracts for troop support serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33834crs27 appendix selected reports during the
