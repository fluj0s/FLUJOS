retransmission of network programming under the satellite home viewer act summary of the primetime 24 decision kevin b greely legislative attorney american law division summary on may 12 1998 the federal district court in miami florida issued preliminary injunction ordering primetime 24 distributor of satellite television programming services to terminate the retransmission of network television signals specifically the programming of the columbia broadcasting system cbs and fox television networks to many of its customers nationwide the court predicated the issuance of the injunction on its finding that primetime 24 had violated provisions of the satellite home viewer act which limit the retransmission of network television signals to customers residing in unserved households because of the number of satellite television subscribers affected and the potential inability of many such customers to receive any network signals after the scheduled termination dates the court orders have generated considerable attention and questions regarding the need to modify the standards governing the transmission of network signals by satellite carriers in an effort to remedy the effect of the court orders and to address other issues related to the satellite transmission of broadcast programming congress approved the intellectual property and communications omnibus reform act of 1999 s 1948 on november 19 1999 attached by reference to the consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year 2000 hrept 106479 the act amends the satellite home viewer act to provide specific relief to subscribers whose satellite television network service was subject to termination as result of the injunctions modified the standards used to determine subscriber eligibility to receive network signals and authorized satellite carriers to provide new programming services to subscribers background the satellite home viewer act the satellite home viewer act shva seeks to

provided compulsory license to retransmit the programming of network stations to subscribers residing in unserved households for private home viewing1 the act defines the term unserved household as household that with respect to particular television network cannot receive through the use of conventional outdoor rooftop receiving antenna an overtheair signal of grade b intensity as defined by the federal communications commission of primary network station affiliated with that network and has not within 90 days before the date on which that household subscribes to receive the satellite television service subscribed to cable system that provides the signal of primary network station affiliated with that network2 the federal communications commissions fccs grade b intensity standard is an objective measure of the strength of television stations signal3 to ensure that retransmission of the network stations signal is limited to those households for which such distribution is authorized the act requires satellite carriers to submit to the network affiliated with the station list identifying all subscribers to which the retransmission is made4 in addition satellite carriers are prohibited from willfully altering the content of the particular program or any commercial advertising or station announcement transmitted by the network station5 violations of the act are actionable as an infringement of copyright and subject to the remedies set out in the copyright act including injunctive relief actual or statutory damages attorneys fees and under certain circumstances criminal sanctions6 in addition satellite carriers engaging in the willful or repeated delivery of network programming to unauthorized subscribers are subject to permanent injunction barring the retransmission of any station affiliated with the network and statutory damages of up to 250000 for each six month period in which the unauthorized retransmission was

network programming through the provision of three service packages primetime east consisting of programming from cbs abc and nbc affiliate on the east coast primetime west comprising network affiliates on the west coast and foxnet which offers programming from the fox network subscribers may purchase all three of the service packages 9 f supp 2d at 1336 11the questionnaire inquired into whether the subscriber intends to use the programming for residential use whether the subscriber has subscribed to cable in the last 90 days and whether the subscriber receives an acceptable signal over the air id 12id at 1338 the limited license provided satellite carriers to retransmit distant network signals solely to unserved households was intended both to facilitate the delivery of network programming to so called white areas in which such signals could not be received and to preserve the exclusive program distribution arrangements between the television networks and their affiliate stations8 the exclusive right to deliver network programming in the local market is particularly important to the continued financial viability of the local affiliate which derives substantial portion of its revenue from the sale of commercial spots on such programming as the price of commercial spot is dependent upon the size of the program audience the importation of duplicate network signal into the local market reduces the affiliates audience and consequently the value of the time to be sold to advertisers primetime 24s delivery of network signals and the district courts decision at issue in the primetime 24 litigation was the validity of primetime 24s delivery of network programming to satellite subscribers and whether the satellite carriers retransmissions exceeded the limited license granted under the act9 primetime 24 retransmitted the programming of an affiliate of each of the television networks to satellite subscribers nationwide10 in its attempt to comply with the unserved household limitation in shva primetime 24 required its distributors to ensure that its services were provided only to eligible subscribers however the carrier did not independently verify whether such subscribers were able to receive signal of grade b intensity rather service was provided based on the prospective subscribers responses to primetime 24 questionnaire11 in bringing its copyright infringement action cbs and fox asserted that primetime 24 failed to adequately ensure that its retransmissions were limited to subscribers unable to receive grade b signal and as result provided service to number of households which were not unserved households as defined in the act12 specifically the networks claimed that primetime 24 accorded too much weight in making service decisions to subscriber assessments of the picture quality received from over the air signals while failing to conduct its own investigation of the subscribers over the air signal strength or the location of the household to determine whether grade b signal could likely be received under the objective standards set out by the fcc according to the networks primetime 24s failure to limit its retransmissions to unserved households caused ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20057crs4 13id 14id at 1338 159 f supp 2d at 133943 16id at 1339 17id 18id at 1340 19id at 134344reduction in the viewing audience for local affiliated programming and consequently loss of advertising revenue to its local affiliates13 in defense of its actions primetime 24 maintained that its consideration of potential subscribers picture quality in determining whether to provide service was consistent with congressional intent in enacting the shva according to the satellite carrier congress enacted the satellite home viewer act to provide clear reception of network signals to viewers unable to receive such signals14 in addition primetime 24 argued that fcc regulations do not adequately define grade b signal for purposes of the shva that typography maps and signal strength tests used to support the network claims were unreliable and that its actions did not amount to willful and repeated violation of the act15 in granting the injunction the court rejected the notion that congress primary intent was to base the provision of service on existing picture quality noting that the statutory language does not discuss clear reception and expressly adopts the fccs objective definition of grade b signal to determine whether household is an unserved household16 in addition the court found that the legislative history indicated that congress considered and rejected proposal to tie the provision of network programming to subjective subscriber assessments of over the air signal quality17 similarly the court concluded that the fccs objective standard although inexact in estimating the presence of grade b signal in individual households was specifically endorsed by congress in the statutory language and as indicated in the legislative history18 with regard to whether primetime 24s actions constituted willful and repeated violation of the act the court cited evidence demonstrating that the satellite carrier knew of the governing legal standard but simply chose to ignore it19 the courts preliminary injunction required primetime 24 to terminate its delivery of cbs and fox programming to subscribers not residing in unserved households who signed up for the satellite service after march 11 1997 the date the action was originally filed while service termination was to take effect originally later than october 8 1998 the court delayed enforcement of the order until february 28 1999 pursuant to an agreement between the parties to await the conclusion of fcc proceeding to modify the definition of grade b signal for purposes of the shva in addition to cbs and foxs lawsuit other actions were brought against primetime 24 alleging violations of the satellite home viewer act by the carrier on august 19 1998 the

december 30 1998 the federal district court in miami issued permanent injunction against primetime 24 ordering the carrier to terminate its provision of cbs or fox programming to any customer that does not live in an unserved household unless it obtains prior written consent to provide such service from the affected local network affiliates or provides the stations with copies of signal intensity tests showing that the household cannot receive an over the air signal of grade b intensity from any station of the relevant network22 in obtaining the written consent primetime 24 was required to seek authorization from each television station of the relevant network that is predicted to deliver signal of at least grade b intensity to that household 23 in addition the carrier was required to give affected stations 15 days advance notice prior to conducting any signal intensity testing the courts order required primetime 24 to terminate the service of customers who subscribed
