are absent fro m sharemax syndications since similar disclosures ar absent and the investing public is kept essentially uninfo rmed cipro 8 companies act act 61 of 1973 section 441 d 4 condoned sharemaxs skimpy disclosure philosophy ma ny times by wrongly registering prospectuses that did not contain the disclosures required in paragraphs 6 h and 26 of the companies act in doing so cipro unwittingly became useful agent for closed society practitioners s uch as sharemax investors many acting on the advice of their broke rs were in the same situation as someone buying horse wi thout

not only to abstain fr om stating as facts that which is not so but to omit one fact within the ir knowledge the existence of which might in any degree affect the nature or extent or quality of the privileges and advantages which the prospectus hold s out as inducements to take shares 9 none of the regulators involved with sharemax can r ightfully claim that they had not been alerted at various sta ges to the pertinent nondisclosure of the information require d by paragraphs 6 h and 26 first there was my warning in my answering affidavi t the nondisclosure is material and there is direct co rrelation between profitability and the valuation of properti without the profit history of property it is difficult to assess how realistic profit forecasts are10 these court papers were served on

from any regulator although all th regulators had been recipients of the letter noone repudiated my contentions more seriously neither did they act the registrar of companies continued to regist er prospectuses without the required disclosures and sharemax retained its status as financial service provider extreme laizes faire thinkers may argue that harm was done by the nondisclosures and sharemax will argu that investors did make profits when it sold certain pro perties i will show in appendix 131 how investors were preju diced by the nondisclosures the problem arose when sharema x syndications failed to achieve the optimistic profi t forecasts in its various prospectuses this makes kindersley s earlier statement pertinent in understanding what was happening here it is usef ul to compare the position of listed company with that of an unlisted company listed company will register prospectus in compliance with the jses listings requirements it also has to comply with the compan ies act and its third schedule but in many cases the listi ngs requirements will require more information the pro spectus will be analysed by brokers and analysts and soon t he market will form view of the company the company will file socalled sens announcements to keep shareholders updated with material information and reports of pertinent events this will include profit updat and the publication of results thereafter the annual repor t will be freely and publicly available making the filing of financial statements with cipro somewhat academic one may very well ask is it possible for cipro to impose these same standards on unlisted public companies the answer is yes and yes in that certain disclosures are 7 mandatory in terms of the companies act as far as that is concerned cipro has serious legal duty to maintai n high standards the timeous registration of accurate and complete prospectuses and financial statements are both striking examples the answer is also because some companies choose the unlisted route because they know they can get away with substandard disclosure the fact that currently cip ro is incompetently directed and staffed is an opportunit for fraudsters to prosper willie botha is case in point practice note 1 in appendix 9 to the companies act requires that pro spectus contains additional information such as details of relevant previous experience of directors in relation to bo thas history with dw promotion and oude molen18 failure to disclose his relevant previous experience is materi al19 certainly the fsb and the consumer affairs committe should have passed note to cipro about bothas hi story when sharemax went regulatorhopping in 2003 it is rather strange that botha has to this day not seen fit t disclose these details in prospectuses and it is even stra nger that cipro has done nothing to enforce this requirement in 1994 the then chairman of the standing advisory on company law judge richard goldstone addressed the broader issue of compliance in letter to trevor m anuel who was then minister of trade and industry however it should be appreciated that if offences of the companies and close corporations acts are merely overlooked and n ot prosecuted where necessary it would simply result in the fact that eventually these two acts would become unenforceable and superfluous the sequences will be rapid deterioration of investor confidence which ur country so desperately aspires for at this moment white collar crime whi ch has already reached unacceptable proportions will also escalate 20 judge

investors and creditors are protected by the registrar21 ive alluded in chapter 7 to sharemaxs shocking st and in 2005 in relation to the filing of financial stateme nts the fact is that in 2005 for five months after the due date financial statements were filed during that time c ipro failed to make its presence felt by asking for the financi statements although the debate about sharemaxs n disclosure was in the public domain more than decade earlier in 1993 the topic also featured when i addressed an international conference on com pany law i do not wish to point fingers but i think the cur rent disclosure requirements of the companies act should as first step be prop erly enforced before new regulation is dreamed upthe registrar of companies or similar institution should be equipped with the very best staff and tec hnological infrastructure to enforce disclosure the price tag to this is in my view an essential price22 in fairness i must add that the acting registrar in 2005 marumo modiba was very helpful and treated with courtesy when i finally approached him after the fr eedom front had handed financial statements to him23 since 2006 sharemax has indeed filed some financial statements but what the real motivating factor mig ht be i do not know the pressure factor must have featured in some way but unlike listed companies these financ ial statements are not freely available investors are mailed skimpy abridged financial statements and if mem ber of the public is considered to be the enemy he or sh will have to go through the pain of approaching cipro t

of the file were and are literally kept together with infamous ly pink coloured ribbon often referred to as red tape if it was an old company the file would easily consist of severa l volumes if you

is one i can remember vividly who would usually grudgingly oblige the culture and atmosphere was distinctly bureaucra tic and quality service to customers was not highly valued by the nature of its activities it was paper factory par excellence where even the rather primitive technology that was available in the prebill gates era played second f iddle to manual methods nevertheless it contributed to south africas publ ic record and in some instances it is and was the only public record of the history of famous and infamous public companies in 1998 i ventured the following opinion at confe rence on company law in johannesburg 10 how cynical you might be about the publics socalled right to know i certainly believe that disclosure and the free flow of information are the best checks and balances in an open society to protect the interests of inv estors and other stakeholdersthe registrar of companies in my book has for years been basic contributor to the doctrine of disclosure despite all the criticism levelled at the institution by many obser vers including myself its structures and resources are far from perfect but at least we still have an office somewhere in the centre of pretoria upholdin g the principle even if it is only in theory24 by perusing company files i have uncovered many interesting documents over prolonged period ill highlight three fairly representative examples in 1985 i found rather mysterious additional pag inserted into the financial statements of kofkor an unlisted public company playing to the sentiments of urban afrikaners who had desire to own piece of far m the company made highly optimistic forecasts for its co ffee farms in prospectuses and marketing material25 the additional page showed the expenses of the co mpany although it was not part of the official financial statements i soon established that it was authentic it revealed that almost third of the funds being invested by share holders were actually being paid out as sales commissions26 the second example is from 2001 when i discovered t hat the directors of leisurenet had long before the li sting in 1994 established about 20 unlisted public companie s they raised funds through interestfree debentures from gym members in fact the debentures were supposed to nsure gym membership for investors for 40 years27 instead of using these funds to finance future comm itments to gym members they were swiftly moved out of the public companies with onceoff rental premiums being paid to private entities controlled by the directors 24 basson deon overcome

corpora governance and all the other good business things they were obliged to make good the 10year history of n disclosures by duly filing financial statements for 20 companies for period of ten years the pile could easily have filled up wheelbarrow back in pretoria i was confronted with loads of pap er i was amused by some freshly stamped financial statements going back decade at least i could then follow the picious forensic trail of these quasihidden unlisted publi c companies the final example is from 1996 when i discovered fi nancial statements for an unlisted public company named bal lito heights it didnt raise investments from the publi c and was in later years converted to private company it w as and probably still is the owner of dr louis luyts hou in ballito bay the financial statements for 1983 showed that the c ompany spent r667 684 in 1982 and r228m in 1983 on improvements to the ballito property in those days it was small fortune and was funded with shareholder loans by luyt llg beherende beleggings other family compan ies and family members28 ballito heights was purportedly registered as pub lic company to undertake share block developments but t hese never materialised the fact that it was registered as public company made filing of financial statements obligatory until conversion to private company oc curred over time the public area on the 5th floor of the zanza building became too small and new and bigger area was allocated on the ground floor but the number of vi sitors and 28 ballito heights limited financial statements 198 3 12
