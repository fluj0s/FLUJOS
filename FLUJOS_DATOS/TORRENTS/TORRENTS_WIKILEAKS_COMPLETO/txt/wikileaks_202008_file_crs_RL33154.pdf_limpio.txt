hurricane katrina on the state budgets of alabama louisiana and mississippi introduction and overview the gulf coast region has endured sign ificant disruptions in economic activity in the aftermath of hurricane katrina state and local governments in the affected region along with their citizens will face c onsiderable financial obstacles during the recovery period in the short run the ex pected drop in economic activity likely will be accompanied not only by an increas in public spending on wages of public employees working overtime but also the accompanying costs of providing benefits to the unemployed and sick in addition repairing public infrastructure will strain state budgets the combination of lower revenues and increased spending will likely create substantial short term budget problem s for state and local jurisdictions the anticipated budget problems will be exacerba ted by state and local balanced budget rules which prohibit these entities from f unding current expenditures with debt historically the federal government has provided ssistance to state and local governments following national crises arising from economic downturns natural disasters and large scale terrorist attacks most recently congress provided states with 20 billion in fiscal assistance in 2003 and 20041 and throughout the 1970s and 1980s congress provided state and local governments with direct aid through general revenue sharing pr ogram congress is currently studying the amount and format of alternative fe deral response proposals to the katrina disaster2 each county or parish in the federally declared disaster area contributes tax revenue to its state government tax re venue may disappear completely in some jurisdictions in others tax payments ma be delayed or significantly reduced because the swath of destruction wrought by hurricane katrina is so broad and in the case of new orleans louisiana s continued for such an extended period tax revenue loss to the state may be particularly dramatic displaced economic activity that remains in each state however reduces the potential revenue loss arising from dislocated state sales taxes the economic activity would still generate revenue for the state although it would shift from one part of the state to another the loss in personal income taxes may be significant as many workers in the coastal region may not have jobs to return to and will elect tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33154crs2 3 for this report the counties whose residents are eligible for individual and public assistance comprise the disaster

statistical area msa indicated with an asterisk in table 2 represent about onethird of personal income and little ss than onethird of retail sales budget issues the louisiana budget will be strained by the unexpected jump in expenditures and fall in revenues arising from the destruction of hurricane katrina one news report has the cost of environmental cleanup alone tagged at 615 billion which includes 35 billion to restore wast ewater treatment f acilities and 25 billion to clean up hazardous waste4 before katrina the louisiana budget was in deficit with fy2004 operating shortfall of 11 million5 clearly the drop in revenues and anticipated cost of rebuilding public infrastructure will create serious strain on the louisiana state budget the budget process balanced budget ru expenditure limitations and state budget stabilization funds will ll be critical elements in the states response to the katrina disaster following is brief review of these elements in louisiana budget process louisiana employs an annua l budget cycle that begins on july 1 in september the governor sends budget guidelines to each agency agencies then submit requests to the governor in november the governor submits the budget to the legislature in february or march and the legislature adopts the budget in june the timing of hurricane ka trina will very likely alter that budget schedule when the legislature is not in session the louisiana interim emergency board ieb may appropriate up to 01 of total state revenue from the previous fiscal year according to the louisiana executive budget for fy2006 total general fund revenue in fy2005 was 68 billion6 the cost to the state of the response and recovery effort will substantially ex ceed the ieb appropriation amount consequently the state legislature will likely hold special session to address the spending needs related to postkatrina recovery state balanced budget ru and debt limits all states except vermont are required to balance the budget for each budget cycle either by state constitution or by statute in louisiana the rule is both statutory and constitutional states like louisiana have two options to finance spending beyond current revenueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33154crs5 7 national association of state budget officers budget processes in the states november 2002 p 38 hereafter cited as nasbo budget processes in the

processes in the states p 59additional debt or higher ta xes the latter option higher taxes would seem the less viable following major disaster after which economic activity has declined and the state tax base narrowed borrowing to finance response and rec overy spending seems the more likely option for louisiana without legisla tive action however additional borrowing to finance an operating budget shortfall could violate state balanced budget rules in addition like many states louisiana imposes debt limit that could be constraining given the magnitude of the katrina disast er in louisiana for example the constitution requires that the debt service cost general obligation debt be more than 6 of total revenue taxes licenses and fees of the same fiscal year7 total revenue by this definition in louisian for fy2004 was just over 8 billion and the debt service cost was 152 million or just 1888 the latest available louisiana treasurer report projected that in addition to the state being able to issue 425000000 in the 20042005 fiscal year the state can issue 425000000 each year ther eafter and remain within the state debt limit based on the projection model9 the restrictions would likely prevent louisiana from financing reconstruction on statebacked debt alone the federa l government would be likely more to augment rather than replace state finance of recovery and reconstruction what is unclear however is what portion of r econstruction should nd could be the responsibility of the federal government budget stabilization or rainy day fund states typically maintain fund to access during unanticipated budget shocks such as natural disasters in louisiana at the close of fiscal 2004 the budget stabilization fund had 2393 million10 according to the national association of state budget officers nasbo in louisiana up to onethird of the f und can be used with legislative approval11 the fund will likely provide tempor ary liquidity for the stat to meet some immediate spending needs though the balance is likel insufficient to address the potential long term cost of postkatrin repair and recoveryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33154crs6 12 louisiana

constitutional in contrast the debt limits in mississippi are constitutional thus exceeding the debt limits in mississippi would entail amending the state constitution the debt limits in mississippi are applied to general obligation go debt and shortterm debt for go debt the limit is 15 times total revenue this type of limit based on the relationship between the outsta nding debt and tota l revenue is unlike the louisiana method which is based on debt servicing costs not the amount outstanding when interest rates are relatively low the volume based limit is more constraining than the louisiana method shortterm debt in mississippi is limited to 5 of general f und appropriations according to the mississippi department of finance and administration total go debt outstanding in fy2004 was 2997341000 and the state had established constitu tional debt limit of 842905500017 thus it appears there is some flexibility for mississippi to borro w without amending the state constitution nevertheless using debt to finance current operating expenditures may require statutory changeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33154crs9 18 national conference of state legislat ures appendix rainy day funds

bond investors howev er may be less willing to lend to mississippi if the economic infrastructure is judged permanently impaired the increased risk associated with mississippi debt may in turn increase debt servicing costs on the other hand the increased economic activity associated with rebuilding and recovery could compensate at least in part for the likely increase in debt servicing

budget rules estimated revenue loss by state if affected states must borrow critical first step is determining how much to borrow the description of state budgets and the data detailin g the relative economic impact form the basis for the following estimate of the potential revenue loss arising from hurricane katrina the general assumption is that the hardest hit counties and parishes will generate sign ificantly less tax revenue from the dislocated economic activity occurring after hurricane katrina more specifically the estimates are based on the revenue that would have been ra ised in september 2005 the estimate will overstate the longterm sales tax revenue loss for the following reasons 1 some portion of retail sales and accompanying sale s tax will shift to nother part of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33154crs12 25 us congressional budget office the macroeconomic and budgetary effects of hurricanes katrina and rita an update sept 29 2005 state 2 some retail sales will be delayed not eliminated and 3 some parishes and counties on the outer ring of the affected area may actually realize an increase in retail sales as relief workers and recovery efforts stimulate economic activity and thus increase tax revenue state personal income tax collections will also decline although as with retail sales its unclear if the loss in tax revenue would be as permanent larger employers could retain employees and tinue to make schedul ed payroll deposits although the tax payments would likely be delayed the states have granted employers extensions through january 3 2006 to comply with individual and corporate income tax payments the state w ill likely receive significant rise in tax payments both personal and corporate in late 2005 and early 2006 as postponed tax payments are made before the extension expires other taxes such as the louisiana severance tax though not tied directly to personal income or retail sale s will likely decline in the short run but will rise c onsiderably as natural resource extraction activities rebound recent congressional budget office cbo publication estimated the revenue loss of the state of louisiana at 3 billi on to 6 billion local governments in the affected region of louisiana generate bout 31 billion in sale s and property taxes in mississippi local governments in the affected region gene rate about 225 billion to 23 billion in sales and pr operty taxes and in alabama local governments in the region generate approxima tely 510 million in sales nd property tax revenue25 the cbo report did not provide estimates for state revenue losses in alabama or mississippi estimation methodology as noted above the estimates in table 5 are based on the assumption that after hurricane katrina economic activity will sl ow and tax revenue decline the amount of lost sales tax re venue is estimated using the amount of retail sales that occurred in the affected counties parishes relative to the rest of the state the percentage of retail sales was then multiplied by the amount of sales and use tax revenue generated in the entire state in september of 2003 2004 for alabama this approximation does not adjust for the likely increase in prices and corresponding rise retail sales amounts since 2003 the bottom three rows provide estima tes of the revenue loss under three different assumptions on the percentage of lost economic activity in the most extreme scenarios all revenue for the mont h of september is lost though likely in some areas its unlikely that all of the counties and parishes designated as eligible for individual and public assistance would lose 100 of state tax collections nevertheless the amount doe s provide an upper limit to the potential revenue loss the two other scenarios 50 and 25 loss would seem more likely because smaller portion of alabama was affected it is probable that economic activity shiftedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33154crs13 to other parts of the state the result is the state of alabama would likely be on the low end of the estimated tax loss assumption in the short term using the 50 loss assumption louisiana and mississippi could have lost appr oximately 1706 million and 1080 million of tax revenue in september 2005 using the 25 loss estimate alabama could have lost just over 18 million of tax revenue in september 2005 the revenue loss in october 2005 will likely decline for many of th disaster designated counties the long term prospects for tax revenue loss are exceedingly difficult to assess given the nature of the disaster and the long term prospects for returning economic activity to prehurricane levels in ddition the degree to which economic activity increases as rebuilding begins may actually increase tax revenue above prekatrina levels table 5
