anthony andrews resources science and industry division summary how to safely dispose of wastes fro m producing nuclear weapons has been an ongoing issue the most radioactive porti on of these wastes is stored in underground tanks at department of ener gy doe sites in idaho south carolina and washington state there have been concerns about soil and groundwater contamination from some of the tanks that have leaked doe propos ed to remove the pumpable liquid waste classify the sludgelike remainder as waste incidental to reprocessing and seal it in the tanks with cement grout doe has argued that closing the tanks in this manner would be costeffective and timely way to address environmental risks questions were raised as to how much waste would be left in the tanks and whether the grout would contain the waste and prevent leak s after considerable debate the 108th congress included provisions in the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fy2005 pl 108375 authorizing doe to grout some of the waste in the tanks in idaho and south carolina congress did not provide such authority in washington state this report provides background inform ation on the disposal of radioactive tank waste analyzes the waste disposal authority in pl 108375 discusses the implementation of this authority and examines relevant issues background doe is responsible for managing fense nuclear waste and cleaning up contamination at sites involve d in the past production of nuc lear weapons among these challenges are the management and disposal of radioactive waste stored in underground tanks at sites in three states hanford in washington savannah river in south carolina and the idaho national laboratory inl the production of radioactive materials for nuclear weapons generated 53 million gallons of radioactive waste stored in 177 tanks at hanford 37 million gallons in 49 tanks at savannah river and nearly 1 million gallons in 11 tanks at the inl some of these ta nks are deteriorating and are known or suspected to have leaked cont aminating soil and groundwater of greatest concern are the tanks at hanford 67 of which are known or suspected to have leaked radioactive waste that hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21988crs2 1 42 usc 10101 et seq 2 doe order 4351 radioactive waste management see crs report rl32163 radioactive waste streams waste classification for disposal by anthony andrewsmigrated through groundwater into the columbia river however recent monitoring data indicate that the level of radionuclides in the columbia river meets federal and state water quality standards there are similar c oncerns about the possible contamination of the snake river in idaho and the savannah river in south carolina how to decommission ie close the tanks in costeffective and timely manner that mitigates environmental risk and potential exposure of workers has been the subject of controversy doe has argued that removi ng all of the waste in the tanks would take too long to respond to environmental risk s from leaking tanks doe favors removal of the pumpable liquid waste and immobilizing ie binding up the sludgelike residual waste by filling the tanks with cement grout to prevent leaks the waste removed from the tanks classified as highle vel would be stored for future disposal in deep geologic repository see below potentially affected states and environmental organizations raised questions regarding how much waste would be left in the tanks and whether the grout would thoroughly mix with the residual waste to solidify and contai n it safely although the sludgelike consistency of the residual waste likely would not be as prone to leakage because of its semisolid form whether pockets or layers of liquid waste may exist within the sludgelike residues and present greater risk of leakage is uncertain although removing all of the waste in the tanks would eliminate the risk of contamination this lternative poses other risks and ch allenges doe has argued that methods to extract the residual waste after the pumpable liquid wast is removed would generate new hazardous waste stream that would need to be managed and disposed of safely to protect the environment doe also asserts that there would be significant risks of exposure to workers who would remove th residues and manage and dispose of the resulting new waste stream once tank is cleaned there would be additional risks to workers who would extract the tank from th ground and there would be environmental risks from the management and dispos of the contaminated tank metal applicability of the nuclear waste policy act how to dispose of the tank waste is furt her complicated by the legal issue of how much of the waste is highlevel under the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 nwpa1 highlevel radioactive waste must be di sposed of in deep geologic repository consequently the tank waste classified as highlevel must be removed from the tanks processed and stored for disposal in such repository in july 1999 doe issued internal agency order 4351 to classify residual tank wast as waste incidental to reprocessing rather than as highlevel2 in effect this order would exempt the residual tank waste from nwpa requirements for disposal in geolog ic repository doe proposed to dispose of the residual tank waste at hanford savannah river and the inl by grouting it in place as discussed above sealing tank using this method woul d depend on state concurrence as doe must obtain approval from the state where the tank is located before it can be closed with further action to be takenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21988crs3 3 67 federal register 160 4 nrdc v abraham 271 f supp2d 1260 1266 d idaho 2003 5 nrdc v abraham 0335711 2004 wl 2480949 nov 5 2004 for case to be ripe there

c contains the greatest c oncentration of radionuclides doe grouted residual waste in two tanks at the savannah river site in 2000 with state concurrence in 2002 doe issued r ecord of decision to apply order 4351 to the closure of the remaining 49 tanks at the site and to grout the residual waste it classified as incidental to reprocessing3 the natural resources fense council nrdc legally challenged does authority to dispose of the waste in this manner the state of south carolina and others filed as friends of the court due to concern that states would not have role under order 4351 in determining how much of the residual waste would be left in the tanks in 2003 federal district court determined that doe does not have the authority to classify any of the waste in the tanks as other than highlevel nor to dispose of it permanently on site through grouting or other means4 doe appealed the 2003 ruling and in 2004 th us court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the above di strict court opinion ruling that the challenge to order 4351 was not ripe for review5 the court noted that doe had planned to implement order 4351 to grout the 49 tanks but had not yet done so thus the court determined that doe had not violated the nwpa because it had not yet taken such action the circuit court opinion resulted in allowing doe to pur sue activities under order 4351 and nrdc or others then could bring it if they believed actions taken by doe violate the law waste disposal aut hority in pl 108375 prior to the appeals court decision doe d asked congress to enact legislation to clarify its authority for order 4351 and allo w it to proceed with grouting the waste in tanks at hanford savannah ri ver and the inl after considerable debate the 108th congress included provisions in section 3116 of the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fy2005 pl 108375 au thorizing doe to classify some of the tank waste in south carolina and idaho as inci dental to reprocessing and to grout it in place congress did not provide this authority in washington state where most of the leaking tanks are located although this targ eted authority is perm anent unless repealed by congress funding to implement it is subj ect to annual authoriz ation and appropriation an examination of provisions in section 3116 of pl 108375 follows section 3116a authorized th secretary of energy in consultation with the nuclear regulatory commission nrc to classify tank waste in south carolina and idaho as other than highlevel upon making certain dete rminations these determinations are 1 that the waste does not require permanent is olation in deep geological repository as is required for highlevel wast and 2 that highly radi oactive radionuclides have been removed from the waste to the maximum extent practical assuming these requirements are met the secretary must determine if the radioactivity of the waste will exceed concentration limits fo r class c lowlevel waste6 however the waste could behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21988crs4 7 10 cfr part 61 subpart c 8 there is court precedent regarding the lack of state authority to regulate radionuclides for example see united states v co mmonwealth of kentucky 252 f3d 816 6th cir 2001disposed of according to class c performance objectives for human exposure 7 regardless of whether the concentration exceeds allowable limits if the concentration does exceed allowable limits the secretary must consult with the nrc to develop plan for the disposal of such waste in any case dispos also would be subj ect to stateapproved closure plan and state per mit authorized under other law the performance objectives for class c wa ste require reasonable assurances that concentrations of radioactive materials that may be released into the environment do not result in human exposure to specific levels of radiation the ability of the grout to accomplish this objective would depend primarily on the extent to which it mixes with the residual waste to prevent leaks from the tank however even if tank leaks the performance objectives could still be met if th radioactivity decays to allowable levels before contamination migrates and results in human exposure the objectives also require that protection of individuals from inadvertent intrusion be ensured after institutional controls are removed sealing the tanks w ith cement grout could provide barrier to intrusion and institutional control of the gr outed tanks presumably would continue as long as the savannah river site and the inl remain federal facilities although grouting of the residual waste would be subject to state approval the authority of states is limited to the hazardous component of the waste8 thus south carolina and idaho presumably would not have the authority to prevent th grouting of tank based solely on objections to the radioactivity left in the tank as l ong as class c performance objectives are met in effect section 3116a authorizes doe to grout the residual waste in tanks in idaho and south carolina if it consults with the nrc in making the determination that the waste is not highlevel and if it meets the performance objectives for disposing of class c waste section 3116 b requires the nrc to mon itor does implementation of this authority in coordination with idaho and south carolina if the nrc determines that doe is not in compliance it is directed to inform doe the state and the congressional committees with relevant jurisdiction s ection 3116c clarified that the waste classification authority in subsection w ould not apply to any material transported outside of covered states wh ich are defined as idaho nd south carolina in section 3116d in effect the law does not allow doe to reclassify waste shipped out of south carolina or idaho as incidental to reprocessi ng and to dispose of it as lowlevel waste in other states section 3116e addre ssed the effect of the entire section on other laws and regulations and their application within ida ho and south carolina this provision stated that the authority in section 3116a shall not impair alter or modify the full implementation of any federal facility agreement and consent order or other applicable consent decree for doe site these documen ts specify federal and state requirements applicable to waste disposal and cleanup and establish gally binding time frames for disposal and cleanup actions thus it app ears that section 3116 leaves the existing agreements for savannah river and the inl intact and would not permit doe to leave more waste in the tanks than previously ag reed to other provi sions in section 3116ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21988crs5 9 71 federal register 68813 10 71 federal register 3838 11 national academy of sciences tank waste retrieval pro cessing and onsite disposal at three department of energy sites april 2006clarified that the authority in subsection is binding only in idaho and south carolina and that it does not override certain other statutes rele vant to waste disposal section 3116f clarified the av ailability of judicial revi ew under the administrative procedure act apa for any determination made by the secretary or any other agency action taken by the secretary pursuant to this sectionand for any failure of the nrc to carry out its monitoring and reporting re sponsibilities although section 3116 does not require public notice of acti ons taken pursuant to it doe may be required to provide notice under other federal laws such as th national environmenta l policy act and the apa the disposal of the ta nk waste is also subject to stateapproved closure plan the preparation of which may provide opportunity for public notice under state law waste determinations in implementing the authority in sec tion 3116 doe must first determine what portion of the tank waste is classified as othe r than highlevel and is therefore not subject to disposal in geologic repository in november 2006 doe deter mined in consultation with the nrc how much waste would be left in the tanks at the inl9 but doe has not made such determination at savannah river where the re moval of the tank waste is not as far along however in january 2006 doe did determine the portion of the retrievable waste at savannah river that would be classified as other than highlevel10 this waste would be solidified and disposed of in vaults on site rather than in geologic repository although the nrc concurred with doe in i ssuing these waste determinations the two agencies have disagreed about their respectiv roles in making futu re determinations of the tank waste that has yet to be classified for disposal national academy of sciences study to inform decisions to dispose of the tank waste section 3146 of pl 108375 authorized doe to arrange for the national cademy of sciences nas to study disposal alternatives at savanna h river the inl and hanford the nas released its final report in april 200611 the nas concluded that does overall approach to remove most of the waste from the tanks and to grout the residual waste in place is workable however the nas noted that clear definitive answers to certain questions were not possible because of insufficient information and tec hnical economic and regu latory uncertainties such as the lack of explicit authority for grouting tank waste in washington state the nas acknowledged that using cement grout is likely the most effective method currently available to immobilize the waste left in the tanks after all retrievable waste is removed but noted that the long term performance of the grout to safely contain the waste left in the tanks is uncertain and necessitates further research however the ability to reliably predict performance until all radioactivity decays to harmless levels appears doubtful likely leaving some uncertainty for substantial period of time despite efforts to assess performance over the longtermhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21988crs6 12 doe savannah river site highlevel waste tank closure final environmental impact statement doeeis0303 may 2002 p s21 13 in february 2006 doe issued notice of in tent to prepare new environmental impact statement for tank closure and wast management at hanford see 71 federal register 5655the nas also noted that many of the facilities to process the retrieved waste are not constructed or have ong oing problems and that the regu latory deadlines for tank closure are years away from 2016 to 2032 the nas c oncluded that enough time likely remains to explore ways to remove more of the wa ste from the tanks before closing them the nas recommended that doe delay the grouting of tanks with greater amounts of residual waste to allow for the development of technol ogies to retrieve larger portion of the waste accordingly the nas recomme nded 50 million annually over 10 years for research program to develop more effective methods to re move the waste from the tanks and to ensure the immobilizati on of residues left in them upon closure the john warner national defense authorization act fo r fy2007 pl 109364 hr 5122 authorized 10 million for doe to establish such program subject to appropriations potential implications for environmental cleanup doe estimates that the cleanup of the sava nnah river site will be complete in 2025 at cost of 321 billion the inl in 2035 at cost of 153 billion and hanford also in 2035 at cost of 600 billion the disposal of the tank waste at these sites is among the greater challenges to completing cleanup along with remediation of existing soil and groundwater contamination the authority in section 3116 of pl 108375 has implications in terms of cost and pace of cleanup at both savannah river and the inl based on 2002 assessment doe estimated that grouting residual tank waste at savannah river would cost between 38 million and 46 million per tank compared with cost of greater than 100 million per tank to remove and dispose of all of the waste and to clean and remove the tank12 the per tank closure costs at the inl likely would be lower because the tanks there contain less waste than those at savannah river doe continues to assess alternatives and costs for the disposal of the tank waste at hanford under other authorities but fina l decision has not been made13 grouting the tank waste also has implications in terms of environmental risk if the grout is effective in solidifying the residual waste and containing it safely this disposal method could provide less costly and faster means of addressing risks on the other hand the possibility of future leaks and re sulting environmental c ontamination remains if the grout does not mix thoroughly with the residual waste to solidify it completely as potentially affected states and environmen tal organizations ve noted whether contamination resulting from tank leaks could migrate and present potential risk of human exposure would depend on many factors including the hydrological conditions of the site and the effectiveness of any engineered or natural geologic barriers to migration if grouted tank leaked and contamination resulted the federal g overnment would remain liable for cleanup according to applicable fede ral and state requireme nts depending on the extent of contamination potential risk of human exposure and remedial actions selected to address such risk the time and costs to clean up contamination from tank leaks could offset the initial savings from grouting the residual waste
