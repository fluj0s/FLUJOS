ombudsman and advocacy offices summary federal complainthandlin g ombudsman and advocacy offices have different forms capacities and designations this report which reviews the state of research in this field and the heritage of such offices examines and compares them along with recent legislative deve lopments and past proposals to establish government wide ombudsman in so doing the report id entifies the basic characteristics of these offices recognizing differences among them with regard to their powers duties jurisdictions locations and resources as well as control over them this study covers only ombudsmanlike offi ces at the federal level th at deal with the public sometimes known as external ombudsmen it does not cover internal ombudsmen that is offices created to handle complaints from employees and resolve disputes between them and ma nagement ombudsmanlike offices in the private sector or similar entities at other levels of government in the united states or abroad except to note differences among them legislative interest albeit sporadic in establishing governmentwide ombudsman or standardizing individual offi ces acrosstheboard dates to the early 1960s these efforts extended in the 1970s to proposals to establish an independent office of consumer representation or consumer affairs plan that president jimmy carter later endorsed nother initiative emerged in 1993 when president william clinton through an executive order setting customer service standards directed executive departments and agenci to make information service and complaintsystems easily accessible and provide means to address such complaints the order also called for agencies to set customer service standards survey customers report to the president on thos surveys and publish customer service plans subsequent governmentwide cu stomer satisfaction survey incidentally found similar range of satisfaction be tween the private and public sectors notwithstanding these efforts over the past five decades comprehensive acrosstheboard transformati ons have occurred noneth eless numerous individual offices have been established or modifi ed by administrative directives and public laws including several in the 110th congress this piecemeal approach reflecting different demands in both the government and society over time and across policy areas has resulted in variety of

position has been described as follows an independent highlevel officer who re ceives complaints who pursues inquires sic into the maters sic involved and who makes recommendations for suitable action he may also investigate on hi s own motion he makes periodic public reports his remedial weapons are persuasi on criticism and publicity he cannot as matter of law reverse administrative action3 in brief the concept of ombudsman has come to mean in the words of former senator edward long guardian of th peoples rights against abuses and malfunctions by government its programs and its officials sort of watchman over the laws watchmen4 the us federal government has not adopted the classic ombudsman instead the government has multifarious fo rms of ombudsmenlike offices even the entities that carry the same title of om budsman for example differ in their powers functions duties activities jurisdictions independence and resources in comparison to one another for instan ce some offices are limited to receiving complaints or grievances from the public and passing them on to relevant units within the agency without necessarily following up on them other complaint handling entities do follow up on such charges examine the agencys operations and in some cases mediate or resolve dis putes between the aggrieved party and the agency still other entities may be proactive that is they seek out certain clientele groups to tify them about relevant government services assist them in gaining access to these and ensure that such services are delivered properly and fully separate from these functions and duties some ombudsma nlike offices issue reports periodic andor episodic to agency fficials congress andor the public while others have such obligation or practice several recent

distinct division between individuals gr oups and organizations with access to and skills and resources in using the internet versus those without these attributes congressional hearings were held in

ways to increase internet access skills and resources among the poor minorities and rura l residents the groups most likely to be on the disadvantaged side of the divide proposed legislative remedies center on increasing computer skills and resources for the disadvantaged in general rather than on internet access to specific governmental operations and services in particular including complaint handling despite this orientation such legislative efforts indir ectly contribute to better understanding of the impact of the internet on complain thandling and accessing information about government programs opera tions and activities in addition two crs memoranda in 2000 did look into the use of the internet in the context of complaint handling26 complainthandling offices and congressional casework implicitly and often explicitly proposals to blish governmentwide ombudsman have generated concerns about its impact on congressional casework in an earlier era it was not entirely clear what effects the creation of ombuds men or complainthandling offices in the executive had on congress in terms of the casework function of legislators the question had been complicated in the past

seminal study home style house members in their districts this activity is recognized as an essential albeit timeconsuming ingredient in securing the legislators elected office according to fenno casework is highly valued form of activity not only is the constituent service universally recognized as an important part of the job in its own right it is also universally recognized as powerful reelection medicine29 this and supportive findings elsewhere may help to explain the general reluctance among legislators to relinquish congressiona l casework to an administrative officer who is not under their immediate control nd direction this feature of executive ombudsmen is in stark contrast to casewor kers in member offices in the latter staffers are hired and promoted by the members who also determine the caseworkers duties and assignments nd can insist on their responsiveness to constituent requests as consequence casework is wellinstitutionalized in member offices and sometimes beyond it is even directly aided and reinforced by executive agencies that provide casework resources noticeably in highdemand highprofile areas30 testimony on the earliest ombudsman propos als of representative henry reuss raised concerns that legislators would continue to act on public complaints by themselves leaving the om budsman underutilized in defendi ng the 1965 incarnation of his legislation to create an ameri can ombudsman reuss countered criticism by stressing the heavy workload brought bout by casework and its adverse impact on other congressional functions and

personnel and powers to pursue complaints and inquiries via congressional offices or directly from the public effectively and efficiently the ombudsmans reporting requirements to congress in representa tive reusss view could aid its oversight endeavors32 at about the same time however opposin g views gained currency in congress these centered on the projected tangible costs of an overarching executive branch ombudsman as well as the intangible co sts to congressional responsibilities and interests special joint committee on the organization of the congress reporting in 1966 addressed an ombudsman plan33 after hearing from some legislators in favor of such governmentwide office and recognizing its adoption in other countries however the bipartis an bicameral panel determined that such an entity at the federal level in the unite d states would be expensive both in its funding and its impact on congress the extent of the problem in the united st ates is such that the adoption of the proposal would require creation of large office or department the joint committee after caref ul consideration decided against recommending creation of such an office at this time we believe that casework is proper function of the individual member of congress and should not be delegated to an administrative body34 executive sources the executive has also conducted research and

complainthandling mechanisms at the federal level differences in the current collection of offices and positions that respond to complaints grievances concerns and stions from the public arise along

reflected in their titles federal student aid ombudsman medicare beneficiary ombuds man taxpayer advocate ombudsman at the federal deposit insurance corporati on federal recovery coordinators and

and reco mmending changes to the senior procurement executive if these are seen as neededservices and public liaisons constr uction metrication om budsman and privacy and civil liberties officer or alternatively civil liberties and civil rights officer57 reasons for differences the variations among the complaint handling offices have emerged for number of reasons these include the piecemeal fashion in which the offices were created the unique set of circumstances associated with each establishment and different establishing mechanisms eg legi slation or administrative directive issued by the agency head at his or her own volition or in response to presidential directive additional reasons for differe nces are the varied rationales accompanying each construct these range from protecting individual rights and liberties to safeguarding the health and welfare of the public to assisting in determining an individuals tax obligations to the governme nt the rationales also extend to aiding selective clientele such as small busine sses in obtaining government contracts and private firms in converting to the metric system to meet federal construction specifications in addition to these reasons are different expectations for each office ranging from simply receiving and passing on complaints to relevant units within an agency to investigating such complaints inde pendently to reaching out to the public proactively other explana tions for the variations are the absence of philosophical consensus underlying the classic ombudsman c oncept as applied to the united states opposition to the creation of some ombudsma nlike offices and conflict over certain powers authorities and responsibilities these conditions have on occasion resulted in initial compromises or later changes in the offices structure location independence and resources consequently existing federal complainthandling offices vary with regard to their basic characteristics including pow ers and duties jurisdiction location controls neutrality resources and communications these differences in turn affect independence autonomy and capacity powers and duties the complainthandling office could be empowered only to receive complaints and pass them on to the organization in the agency responsible for the program or operation by comparison the office could be authorized to follow up on grievances making recommendations for resolving problem or determining whether the agencys response is satisfactory s till other ombudsmanlike entities beyond beinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34606crs17 passive recipients of complaints might dopt proactive approach they could for instance be authorized to conduct survey s among persons or groups who receive government service or who are affected by an agency action in order to identify perceived problem and termine how widespread and serious it is the environmental protection agency p ublic liaison can conduct independent investigations into cases that prompt cerns of improper agency action the office does not have legal force but it publishes its findings offering the public more transparent view of the epa separately complainthandling office could be authorized or required to perform additional duties to educate th public and keep the agency head and congress informed these could include notifying the agency head not just the bureau or program director immediately bout serious or widespread concerns issuing periodic reports summarizing th offices findings actions and agency responses to the agency head congress and the public and testifying before congressional committees about the offices findings recommendations if any and subsequent actions jurisdictions the jurisdictions of complainthandling offices also differ depending upon the range of agencies and programs covered an offices jurisdiction could be limited to particular program administered by si ngle bureau within an agency or expanded to all programs administered by the entire agency the jurisdiction could also encompass set of related programs or ope rations that are carried out by several federal agencies the complainthandling offices jurisd ictions could differ on other grounds including whether they extend into the private sector jurisdiction could be confined to the agency per thus dea ling only with complaints and concerns about the conduct of its employees and its admin istration of progra ms or it could be extended where appropriate to private sector organizations or firms that the agency is regulating locations the specific locations of complainthandling offices could also vary offices could be placed within agencies as most are now or exist independently of the agencies where they have jurisdiction like the citizenship and immigration services ombudsman some ombudsmanlike offices operate out of centralized federal government location like the fede ral deposit insurance corporation fdic ombudsman while others have decentralized regional offices like the environmental protection ag encys superfund ombudsmen single ombudsmanlike office could be granted governmentwide jurisdiction and located in the executive

benefits while at the same time raising concerns benefits the potential of the internet for making complaint handling more efficient and effective is significant ideally government we b portals could provide one stop for inputting and accessing comp laintrelated information for an entire agency or at least particular office or program this in turn could lead to increased sharing of information and data within and among federal agencies between the federal government and state and local governments and between the federal government and priv ate sector organizations and the general public this development might also encourage standa rdization in receiving and responding to complaints as well as other operational and organizational characteristics of ombudsmanlike offices including resources and independence concerns nonetheless concerns exist with regard to the inclusiveness accessibility and availability of internetb ased information and the governments responsiveness to complaints reflective of this is the digital divide which sees the population separated into haves and venots in terms of internet access and use82 this divide separates those with requisite computer skills

access from those without these the latter group lacks the capability to issue complaints and comments through this medium and to discover what information is held in in ternetbased data banks another concern about reliance on the inte rnet for complaint handling is that it might be manipulated for instance an organized interest group might encourage its membership to flood website with compla ints substantiate d or not witnessed firsthand or not about particular ag ency or program although this same problem could arise by way of other m eans of communications mail or telephone for example these traditional avenues w ould be more cumbersome more difficult and possibly more costly to use in effect it would be easier to mount massive attacks through the internet than through more traditional communications media use of the internet as source for collecting public complaints also prompts worries about maintaining the anonymity of the complainant these worries might be mitigated to degree through the ri in tollfree hotlines and centralized websites like usagov which coul d allow for anonymous reporting concluding observations although there is authoritative comp rehensive detailed survey of current federal complainthandling offices earlier studies even if dated and limited along with the coverage here provi useful information with which to describe examine and compare them one

preemptive efforts that is they intervene on behalf of clientele from the beginning to the end of service th ereby reducing if not preventing problems while most do not the variations among the
