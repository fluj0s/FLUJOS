120 b brussels 159 c brussels 268 classified by useu political mc chris davis for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary swci ambassador clint williamson and european union eu counterterrorism coordinator gilles kerchove discussed kerchoves upcoming whitepaper for the eu council on detainee issues and its relevance for developing common eu position on the topic the two also spoke about which governments are open to accepting detainees and how if possible to mitigate member state concerns regarding detainees freedom of movement in the schengen zone kerchove is in favor of an eu blessing of bilateral negotiations between member states and the us on detainee transfers and said there is an eu precedent for placing travel restrictions on residency permit holders one possible solution to schengen concerns 2 c williamson also met with the eu parliamentarians responsible for the now ratified eu joint resolution on guantanamo congratulating them on receiving support from across the political spectrum separately the ambassador sat down with riina kionka javier solanas personal representative for human rights she suggested stronger public information campaign on the nature of the detainees at guantanamo and expressed concern that eu member states were under intense chinese pressure not to accept uighur detainees end summary kerchoves eu perspective 3 c on his tenth day of travels within the eu ambassador williamson met in brussels february 17 with eu counterterrorism coordinator gilles kerchove the ct coordinator briefly discussed his upcoming whitepaper on detainee issues which was tasked to him by the eu council it will include 15 noncontroversial principles to guide eu consensus building as well as lessons learned from the church of the nativity resettlement ref information on previous us policies and the new executive order and potential resettlement options outside and within the eu ambassador williamson provided general information on the number of released detainees who had reengaged in terrorism as well as the distinction between cleared for release and cleared for transfer designations by the usg 4 c on forming an eu position kerchove indicated that favorable scenario would be consensus agreement allowing individual members to accept detainees provided transfers are not forced on any unwilling eu member williamson noted that the czechs in their capacity as eu president were committed to developing this consensus position the two then went on to discuss concerns over former detainees freedom of movement in the schengen zone williamson stated that it is common concern among eu members and floated the possibility of former detainees having restrictions placed on their travel stipulation that some of the detainees and their lawyers have consented to in principle kerchove replied that precedent existed for such restrictions which he felt could help mitigate schengen concerns of member states though they would be difficult to enforce in practice the ambassador cited the february 26 2009 justice and home affairs informal meeting as an important nearterm milestone in building momentum towards an eu position kerchove was of the opinion that it was bit early to expect an official position given the complex nature of the issue he had hoped discussions would occur first among ambassadors within the committee of permanent representatives however the czech presidency insisted on moving forward with discussions among justice and interior ministers 5 c conversation then shifted to the usg process moving forward williamson described two parallel us review processes 1 review of the files of all 242 detainees at brussels 00000269 002 of 003 guantanamo and 2 review of policies involving detention guantanamo and related issues files must be collected from multiple departments agencies and locations for review by an interagency team including doj prosecutors and representatives from the state defense and homeland security departments as well as the intelligence agencies the us will prioritize cases of detainees being considered for resettlement by eu governments 6 c williamson and kerchove agreed to consult further after the february 26 jha informal meeting and before anticipated travel by jha commissioner jacques barrot czech interior minister langer and kerchove to washington in mid march we need better pictures 7 c during subsequent meeting on february 17 with riina kionka high representative javier solanas personal representative for human rights ambassador williamson briefed on the process called for by the presidents recent executive orders on closure of guantanamo detention facilities and exchanged views on the state of play regarding eulevel efforts on acceptance of guantanamo detainees 8 c while emphasizing that eu counterterrorism coordinator gilles kerchove had the lead on this issue kionka raised few specific concerns and ideas she told us that member states have been under intense pressure from china not to accept uighurs and that some are concerned about possible repercussions in bilateral and eulevel relations with china if they accept detainees she acknowledged that this pressure was not unusual from china but did not know if it would affect member state decisionmaking 9 c kionka also highlighted the gap between public perceptions of the kinds of detaines at guantanamo and the reality that many ar very low risk she felt that this was message the us had to carry and urged the administration to plainly explain to americans and thus europeans that while some detainees are very dangerous many of them do not pose serious threat kionka also commented that whenever european newspaper ran story on guantanamo they ran the typical picture of hunchedover detainee in an orange jumpsuit she said that we need better pictures and urged us to turn the story around by showing lowrisk detainees in better light parliamentary support 10 c amb williamson hosted lunch for three members of the european parliament mep who were the principal authors of recent resolution supporting us efforts to close guantanamo and eu efforts to assist with detainee resettlement meps ursula gacek epped poland baroness sarah ludford alde uk and jan marinus wiersma pse netherlands told us that the results of the vote 542 in favor 55 abstaining 51 opposed show the broad bipartisan support that the ep has for european resettlement efforts they said that it was difficult to craft text that all parties could support but that the ep felt it was important to express helpful sentiment williamson expressed appreciation for their efforts in securing passage of the resolution and indicated that it sent positive message to eu states considering resettlements 11 c the meps were careful to point out that the support was not unqualified legal issues surrounding the admission of detainees into the schengen zone needed to be resolved to the satisfaction of member states not accepting detainees they said mep ludford known to be somewhat outspoken drew criticism from her colleagues when she spoke of her personal opinion that member states who participated in alleged cia brussels 00000269 003 of 003 rendition operations to guantanamo had particular ethical responsibility to accept detainees if it would contribute to the closure of the facility she noted that the ep would adopt resolution on cia flights at that weeks plenary session 12 u ambassador williamson has cleared on this telegram murray
