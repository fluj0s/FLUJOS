statutory and regulatory pr ovisions during disasters is often tool used to expedite funding while little is known about the long term implications of such waivers many schol ars believe that waivers nd generous federal disaster assistance creates disincentive for state and local governments and homeowners to undertake hazard mitigation measures31 congress may wish to consider the imp lications of using hmgp funds for program designed to compensa individuals directly for disaster losses the hazard mitigation program was developed to implement long term mitigation strategies to prevent future losses32 historically the impleme ntation of fe derally funded mitigation activities relied upon the involveme nt of local jurisdictions in the coordination of mitigation projects such as buyouts should hmgp funding be made available to the road home program the role of the local jurisdiction would be reduced significantly since the federal f unding would be passed directly from the state to the individual homeowner hazard mitigation activities reduce property damage and potential injuries and loss of life from future disasters re ducing the impact from disasters also reduces the level of

development economic development initiatives generally encompass recovery projects that prom ote redeveloping and rejuve nating the economic base of communities by comparison fema progra ms generally fall under the auspices of shortterm recovery needs and hazard mitigation and do not necessarily seek to make communities whole the focus of most fema assistance is to provide for the immediate shelter needs of individuals and restore critical infrastructure such as power water and sewage syst ems and postal services fema grant programs have traditionally been considered reimburseme nt programs in which individuals and communities are partially reimbursed for losses and damage to properties hap is essentially compensation program in which the state is attempting to compensate individuals for damage to their property some of the struggles associated with hap program funding is the effort to align tw different recovery philos ophies nd two different program goals in single stat implemented disaster housing assistance program implementing disaster recovery measur often involves coordination between several federal state and local government agencies the role of each agency is often determined by the cation scope and nature of the disaster issues of bureaucratic discretion will continue to arise in future disasters and will influence the type of coordination and disaster assistance that is needed congress may wish to consider evaluating the role of lead agencies for different disaster assistance areas such as housing infrastructure repair and fiscal incentives to determine how those roles could change depending on the scope and nature of the disaster state sovereignty in disasters the road home program is state housing program as such the state

in future disasters as with many disaster s the nature and scope of the disaster often plays role in the level of federal invol vement in disaster response and recovery congress may wish to consider

concerned with the redundanc and inefficiency of home inspections single home may be inspected as many as five times by different entities including fema sba private insurers road home officials and
