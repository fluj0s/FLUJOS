invoke cloture or end debate on measure or matter in the senate reducing the number of us troops in iraq and afghanistan the legislation that would reduce the number of us troops falls into two groups one set of proposals calls for withdrawal of us troops from iraq starting at specific point in time with some bills setting either binding deadline or nonbinding goal for completion of the drawdown most of these bills exclude from the withdrawal requirement any us troops assigned to certain limited missions including the defense of us facilities and the conduct of targeted antiterrorist missions of limited duration second set of proposals would indirectly compel reduction in the number of us troops in iraq by prohibiting the deployment of units that did not meet certain standards of combatreadiness by requiring that units be deployed for longer than the maximum length of time allowed by the policy of their parent service and by barring the return to iraq of units previously deployed there unless they had minimum period of time at their home station or dwell time before the second iraq deployment the army is unable to sustain its current level of deployments in iraq unless units are deployed for longer periods andor are redeployed after shorter dwell times than army policy dictates moreover the tempo at which units have to return to iraq has reportedly inhibited most army brigades from meeting some of the established readiness criteria crs6 the first version of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill hr 1591 included both types of troop reduction requirements it required withdrawal to proceed according to one of two alternative timetables depending on the extent to which the iraqi government met certain benchmarks of security and political reconciliation it also prohibited the deployment of units that did not meet readiness standards and the deployment of any unit for longer than was called for by its parent service 365 days in the case of army units and 210 days for marine corps units an amendment to hr 1591 introduced by senator cochran that would strike the language setting timetable for redeployment was defeated in the senate by
