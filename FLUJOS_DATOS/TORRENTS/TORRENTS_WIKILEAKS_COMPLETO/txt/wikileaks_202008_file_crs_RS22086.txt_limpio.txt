reductions to food stamp spending were not included in the final measure what is budget reconciliation the annual congressional budget resolution provides blueprint for all federal revenues and spending over multiyear period although it does not require the presidents approval the budget resolution does establish limits for all discretionary and mandatory spending for the coming fiscal year once approved the discretionary spending total is allocated to the appropriations committees where it is subdivided among their various subcommittees the resolution also might require reductions in mandatory spending particularly in years when the federal deficit is expected to be large when this occurs the resolution issues reconciliation instructions to various authorizing committees requiring them to report changes to legislation to reduce spending on mandatory programs under the committees jurisdiction the reported language from each committee is then sent to its respective budget committee by date specified in the resolution where it is packaged with language from other committees into an omnibus reconciliation bill which is taken to each chambers floor for consideration each chambers approved reconciliation bill is then sent to conference committee and final conference measure must be approved by both chambers and signed by the president before it becomes law for more on budget reconciliation procedure see crs report 98814 budget reconciliation legislation development and consideration by bill heniff jr and crs congressional research service the library of congress crs2 report rl30458 the budget reconciliation process timing of legislative action by robert keith usda mandatory spending defined approximately threefourths of total spending within usda is classified as mandatory which by definition occurs outside the control of the annual appropriations process currently accounting for the vast majority of usda mandatory spending are the farm commodity price and income support programs the food stamp program and most child nutrition programs the federal crop insurance program and various agricultural conservation and trade programs legislative authority for these programs is under the jurisdiction of the house and senate agriculture committees1 hence any reconciliation instructions that are delivered to the agriculture committees could potentially impact spending for any or all of these programs all of the farm commodity support programs and mandatory conservation and trade programs are funded through the borrowing authority of usdas commodity credit corporation ccc not by an appropriation to the programs2 the ccc has 30 billion httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22086 line of credit with the us treasury that it taps to provide the annual required funding of these programs as well as for other purposes because the ccc typically spends more than it takes in its losses must be replenished annually through congressional appropriation so that its 30 billion borrowing authority is not depleted administration and congressional budget forecasters estimate each year the projected cost of the commodity support programs however because farm crop prices are highly variable and difficult to estimate these programs ultimately receive such sums as necessary under their farm bill authorization regardless of budget estimates the mandatory conservation programs for the most part have fixed authorization level each year stated either in dollars or enrolled acreage as mandated by the 2002 farm bill with funding from the ccc not from an appropriation like the commodity support programs crop insurance also receives such sums as necessary regardless of budget estimates its funding comes through an indefinite appropriation to the federal crop insurance fund fund separate from the ccc the mandatory usda food and nutrition programs food stamps and child nutrition programs receive an annual appropriation but funding levels ultimately are determined by the eligibility rules established in current food and nutrition laws 1 the one exception is the child nutrition programs which are under the jurisdiction of the committee on education and the workforce in the house and the agriculture committee in the senate 2 the major mandatory farm commodity price and income support programs include those for wheat feed grains oilseeds cotton rice peanuts sugar and dairy the largest mandatory conservation programs include the conservation reserve program the environmental quality incentives program the conservation security program and the wetlands reserve program for more background see crs report rs20848 farm commodity programs short primer and crs report rl32940 agriculture conservation programs scorecard crs3 cbos baseline budget for usda each year the congressional budget office issues baseline budget for all federal spending under current law over 10year period projected spending in the baseline budget represents cbos estimate at particular point in time of what federal spending and revenues will likely be under current law if policy changes were made over the projected period the cbo baseline serves as benchmark or starting point for future budget analyses for example whenever any new legislation is introduced that affects federal mandatory spending its impact is measured by cbo as difference from the baseline table 1 below represents cbos most recent official baseline march 2005 estimate for the major mandatory usda programs it represents cbos estimates under current law eg the 2002 farm bill for the commodity support and conservation programs given current cbo projections for economic and market conditions for the next five years budget reconciliation instructions that are given to the agriculture committees are measured against the cbo baseline this means that any legislation that the committees are required to report will be scored by cbo against the baseline to determine whether httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22086 the committee is in compliance with the reconciliation instructions table 1 cbos march 2005 baseline budget estimates for selected mandatory usda

office fy2006 budget resolution reconciliation instructions the house and the senate approved the conference report hrept 10962 on the fy2006 budget resolution hconres 95 on april 28 and april 29 2005 respectively the approved resolution contained reconciliation instructions that require the house and senate agriculture committees to report legislation reducing spending on mandatory usda programs by 173 million over oneyear period fy2006 and by 30 billion over fiveyear period fy2006fy2010 the resolution did not mandate how the crs4 agriculture committees were to achieve the required spending reductions instead those decisions were left to the committees agricultural cuts in the fy2006 reconciliation act pl 109171 the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 s 1932 includes net reductions of 27 billion over five years for usda mandatory programs the final law actually contains 37 billion in gross reductions to usda programs however conferees also adopted twoyear extension of dairy income support program at twoyear cost of nearly 1 billion which brought the net usda reductions to 27 billion included in pl 109171 is 17 billion reduction in farm commodity support programs achieved primarily through change in the timing of payments 934 million reduction in conservation spending 620 million reduction in mandatory research program and 419 million cut in rural development programs as scored by cbo over fiveyear period fy2006fy2010 houseproposed reductions to food stamp spending were not included in the conference measure the process of determining the specifics of the usda spending reductions began httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22086 earlier in 2005 when the house and senate agriculture committees submitted to their respective budget committees their recommendations for cuts as required by the fy2006 budget resolution the net usda cut of 27 billion in the final law is below both the housepassed 35 billion and senatepassed 30 billion levels the following text and table 2 provide comparison of the usda provisions in the final law to what was recommended in the house and senatepassed bills farm commodity programs pl 109171 achieves most of its reductions to farm commodity spending by changing the timing of farm commodity direct payments without reducing the overall level of payments to farmers current program law allows recipients of direct payments to receive up to 50 of their payments in advance of the end of the crop year pl 109171 reduces the advance payment rate to 40 in the 2006 crop year and 22 in 20073 the agreement also includes the elimination of the upland cotton step2 program effective august 1 2006 in response to brazils successful challenge of the program in the world trade organization wto offsetting just over onehalf of the 17 billion in farm commodity program savings is provision in pl 109171 that reauthorizes the expired milk income loss contract milc for two years until september 30 2007 extension was supported by small to moderatesized dairy farms which are the primary beneficiaries of this program that makes payments to dairy farmers when market prices fall below target price some farm commodity groups were opposed to milc program extension as long as its estimated 998 million cost had to be offset with comparable reductions in other usda programs for more information on milc see crs issue brief ib97011 dairy policy issues 3 advance deficiency payments for the 2006 crop year were already disbursed by usda by the time pl 109171 was enacted in february 2006 hence the required reduction in the advance payment rate s from 50 in 2005 to 40 in 2006 could not be achieved this means all of the estimated savings of 1452 billion is recognized in 2007 when the advance payment rate falls to 22 as required by pl 109171 crs5 not included in the final law is an acrossthe board cut in farm commodity payments which was recommended at different levels in the house and senatepassed bills see table 2 senate provision to extend the authority for the farm commodity programs for four years crop year 2011 as means of preserving baseline spending beyond 2010 at the higher prereconciliation level of spending was also deleted by conferees some policymakers were concerned that extension of the commodity programs now could signal that the us is not committed to reducing domestic farm subsidies in the doha round of wto negotiations also deleted in conference was an assessment on sugar loans conservation programs among the programs affected by an estimated 934 million reduction to mandatory usda conservation spending in pl 109171 are the conservation security program csp the watershed rehabilitation program and the environmental quality incentives program eqip spending for the csp is limited to 1954 billion over five years 20062010 and 565 billion over 10 years for savings of 649 million over the fiveyear horizon of the reconciliation bill pl 109171 also prohibits the carryover of any unused mandatory funding for the watershed rehabilitation program that was available as of october 1 2006 but does not include house provision to reduce fy2007 or future year funding eqip funding is reduced from 13 billion per httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22086 year to 127 billion in each of fy2007fy2009 conferees also extended authority for the csp through fy2011 and eqip through 2010 senate provision to reduce the conservation reserve program and house provision to eliminate fy2007fy2010 funding for the agricultural management assistance program were both deleted by conferees for background on these programs see crs report rl32940 agriculture conservation programs scorecard energy and rural development programs pl 109171 recognizes savings of 469 million by either reducing or eliminating funding for five mandatory rural development programs and an energy program all six of these programs were authorized by the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 and have had some or all of their annual mandatory funding prohibited by annual agriculture appropriations acts over the last several years see table 2 below and crs report rl31837 an overview of usda rural development program for
