employees including us postal service employees are stationed in the following non foreign areas outside the contiguous united states alaska hawaii guam the commonwealth of northern mariana islands cnmi puerto rico and the us virgin islands usvi these employees receive nonforeign costofliving allowances colas in addition to their regular pay nonforeign colas which are authorized by 5 usc 5941 and executive order 10000 as amended were first enacted in 1948 to aid federal whitecollar job recruitment in nonforeign areas outside the contiguous united states or in the alaska territory where living costs are substantially higher than in the district of columbia nonforeign colas have faced legal ch allenges because they create differences in pay between employees who receive nonforeign cola and employees within the contiguous united states who instead receive localitybased comparability pay three plans to replace the nonforeign cola with locality pay have been proposed on may 30 2007 the office of personnel management opm released proposal to phase out the nonforeign cola system the federal managers association fma released plan to eliminate the nonforeign cola shortly after the opm plan was unveiled on may 13 2008 senator daniel k akaka and others introduced s 3013 bill to provide for retirement equity for federal employees in nonforeign areas outside the 48 contiguous states and the district of columbia and for other purposes all three plans would repl ace the nonforeign cola program with locality based comparability paymentsor combination of localitybased pay and cola the most prominent differences among the three plans are th length of time each allots for the cola phase out the length of time colas are paid once the transition period is completed and the percentage of every cola dollar removed from an employees pay for every dollar of locality pay added to it nonforeign colas and locality pay are differen t in several ways first nonforeign colas are based on opm surveys that determine costofliv ing differences between nonforeign cola areas and washington dc in contrast locality pay is based on bureau of labor statistics research that determines costoflabor differences between federal and nonfederal workers in the same geographic area second nonforeign cola is not added to an employees basic rate of pay when calculating retirement benefits life insurance and premium pay locality pay is counted toward those benefits finally pursuant to 25 usc 912 nonforeign cola may not be taxed at the federal level while locality pay is federally taxed

schedule gs is the primary pay system for federal whitecollar employees as of june 2008 the gs and gsrelated pay systems covered nearly 126 million of the 193 million employees in the federal workforce1 most gs employees in the contiguous united states receive localitybased comparability payments in addition to their basic pay with the amount of locality pay based on differences between federal and private sector pay rates for particular sets of jobs within particular pay areas 2 locality payments are federally taxed as regular wages and are considered basic pay when determining an employees retirement benefits3 life insurance and premium pay4 in contrast most gs and other whitecollar employees in nonforeign areas outside of the continental united states do not receive locality pay instead they receive costofliving allowances colas which are based on differences in the cost of living in those areas when compared to the washington dc area 5 the current nonforeign areas are alaska hawaii guam the commonwealth of northern mariana islands cnmi puerto rico and the us virgin islands usvi nonforeign colas were initia lly authorized in 1948 as way to attract employees to and retain employees in remote areas in consistent manner as of june 2008 more than 41000 federal employees in those areas including employees in the us postal service received nonforeign colas of up to 25 of basic pay with total annual nonforeign cola program payments estimated to be more than 544 million 6 in contrast to locality pay nonforeign colas are not federally taxed and are not considered basic pay in determining an employees retirement benefits life insurance or premium pay according to media reports federal employees may choose to leave nonforeign area and work within the contiguous united states in their final years of federal service in order to receive locality pay and thereby increase retirement benefits 7 differences in pay between the nforeign cola and locality pay authorities have prompted litigation against th nonforeign cola program in addition some executive branch employees and private organiza tions claim that continued use of the colas may lead to recruitment and retention problems in nonforeign areas8 1 us office of personnel management central personnel data file available at httpwwwfedscopeopmgov fedscope does not provide detailed location

senatewere introduced that would phase out the nonforeign cola program and convert federal nonforeign employees to locality pay9 the office of personnel management opm and the federal managers association fma also have sent transition proposals to congress the three plans primarily differ in three ways the length of time allotted to the transition the length of time colas are paid once the transition is completed and the percentage of every cola dollar removed from an employees pay for every dollar of locality pay added to it in all three transition proposals colas would be removed from nonforeign employees pay at rate that is lower than the introduction of locality pay employees who transitioned to locality pay therefore could concurrently receive both cola and locality pay the continued cola payment is meant to offset federal tax payments for the employee who historically would not have paid federal taxes on his or her cola the employee would have to pay taxes on locality pay the legislative proposal requires three years to phase in locality pay would continue cola past the transition period and removes 65 of each cola dollar for each dollar of locality pay added to an employees pay 10 the opm proposal would phase in locality pay over seven years continue cola payment once the transition was completed and remove 85 of each cola dollar for each added dollar of locality pay11 the fma proposal would switch to locality pay in one year eliminate cola payments in the second year and remove 75 of each cola dollar for each dollar of locality pay added this report explores the history and current status of nonforeign colas identifies and describes proposals to change the cola system including the possibility of instituting locality pay and analyzes the potential effects of keeping the existing system or adopting one of the three nonforeign cola phaseout plans continued 29 2008 available at httphsgacsenategovpublic_filesfitzgeraldtestimony052908pdf and us office of personnel management costofliving allowances nonforeign areas partnership pilot project 61 federal register 59175 nov 21 1996 9 s 3013 hr 6516 similar bill to s 3013 was introdu ced in the house but was not reported from committee this report focuses on s 3013 which has passed the senate and was referred to the house committee on oversight and government reform 10 none of the proposals state the assumed flat tax rate instead each proposal selects cola offset rate which represents the percentage of each cola dollar that would be removed for each dollar in locality pay that is added to an employees pay the remaining cola percentage was designed to cover increased tax payments for employees switching from colas to locality pay if the cola offset rate is 65as it is in the legislative proposalthe bill assumes 35 flat tax rate for federal employees 11 in both the opm proposal and the legislation colas would continue to be paid after the transition is completed to ensure that nonforeign area employees do not have reduction in their takehome post federal tax pay the continued cola in other words is designed to make certain nonforeign area employees do not experience reduction in their paychecks because of the transition to locality pay the cola that remained after the transition was completed aims to be roughly equal in value to nonforeign area employees

ii in response to concerns about inequities in federal pay between employees working in nonforeign areas and those working in the contiguous united states during the war various agencies began offering pay differentials in certain areas to aid employee recruitment pursuant to the brookhart salary act of 1930 and the meadramspeck act of 1940 13 in 1977 william l camp thenarea manager of the us civil service commission now the office of personnel management opm testified about the post war period saying that because agencies acted independently often with varying degrees of legal authority employees of the various agencies could and did receive significantly different compensation treatment in the same geographic area14 in 1946 president harry s truman asked the civil service commission now the office of personnel management and the bureau of the budget to conduct jointly study of pay differentials and related compensation problems in the federal service outside the states15 the study recommended creating standardized pay scale for all federal employees working in nonforeign areas and basing that structure on two factors regional costs of living and desirability of living conditions both the legislative and executive branches used this study to shape contemporary nonforeign cola management and operation in 1948 representative richard bowditch wigglesworth introduced an executive office appropriations bill hr 5214 80 th congress which would have among other things given the president authority to establish higher rates of pay in areas outside of the contiguous united states on february 4 1948 the house committee on appropriations reported the bill stating its desire to create uniform standard applicab to all agencies for payment to all federal employees serving in agencies or companies operating outside the contiguous united states16 the committee report noted that handful of departmentsincluding state war and navy already paid employees living outside of the continental united states additional compensation and that the goal of the legislation was to extend the practice to other federal employees living in the same geographic areas the bill capped the intended pay supplement at 25 of an employees salary 17 12 the term nonforeign area was not used until 1985 eo 12510 this report however will adopt the use of the term nonforeign throughout 13 46 stat 1003 and 44 stat 614 executive orders 8657 and 8955 also governed federal civilian employee pay prior to the implementation of nonforeign colas the executive orders authorized the war department and the department of the navy to award pay differentials to federal civilian whitecollar employees who worked in alaska or atlantic naval bases the pay aimed to increase recruitment in those areas 14 us congress committee on post office and civil service cost of living allowance hearings 95th cong 2nd sess july 8 1977 washington gpo 1977 p 13 this testimony examined

the bill that same day representative joseph rider farrington stated that differentials in pay for areas outside the continental united states originally came about through the necessity of moving great many people to those areas for the purpose of prosecuting the war and also because of the high cost of living in those areas18 the pay differential should be extended to all federal employees living in nonforeign territories outside of the continental united states farrington said because it would be unfair to allow certain employees living in an area to receive 25 increase in pay and prohibit others from receiving the same the appropriations bill was amended and brought before the house for vote where it passed 339 to 10 19 the bill then was received by the senate and referred to the committee on appropriations which held several days of hearings on the legislationfrom march 2 through march 5 1948 during the hearings some concern over the pay differential was expressed by harry see the national legislative representative of the brotherhood of railroad trainmen in his testimony see discussed fears that the 25 cap on the pay differential would operate to the disadvantage of the federal government and its employees outside the continental limits 20 see asked that federal railroad employees be excluded from the provision most of the comforts and many of what the people in the united states regard as necessities are not available in alaska on the other hand as the last war amply demonstrated alaska is of vital importance to the united states and our defense program requires that we have large numbers of federal employees continuously in the territory not only would it be unfair but it would be impossible to induce people to go to alaska as federal employees if some provision were not made to adjust wage scales to the higher cost of living and without some incentive in the form of additional pay 21 according to his testimony see did not disagree with the adoption of pay supplement instead he wanted congress to eliminate the 25 ceiling on the pay supplement because he believed alaska was already operating at an even larger costofliving disparity when compared to the continental united states in spite of sees testimony the senate reported the bill on march 15 1948 with several requested amendments but none that exempted railroad workers from the new pay differential22 the senate and house passed the bill on april 12 1948 and president truman signed it on april 20 194823 on june 8 1948 representative wigglesworth introduced hr 6829 80th

this costofliving allowance on june 19 1948 the house and senate agreed to the final conference version of hr 6829 the president signed the bill into law on june 30 194825 the second law applied to all persons stationed outside the continental united states or in alaska whose rates of basic compensation are fixed by statute pursuant to the law these qualifying federal employees could receive addi tional compensation as recruitment incentive if their living costs were substantially higher than in the district of columbia26 the president was still charged with establishing the additional

numerous efforts have been made during the past 60 years to change or eliminate the nonforeign cola program for example legislation was introduced in 1965 hr 7401 88th congress and 1966 hr 8390 89th congress that would have eliminated the nonforeign cola program neither bill was enacted in 1973 representative spark m matsunaga introduced bill hr 2062 93rd congress that would have permitted qualifying employees in nonforeign areas to receive both full post differential32 and full nonforeign cola concurrently under current statutes an employee who is eligible for both nonforeign cola and post differential may receive both provided the supplementswhen added togetherare capped at 25 of the employees basic pay33 representative matsunagas bill was never reported from the house committee on post office and civil service an identical bill was reintroduced in the 94th congress hr 1916 and also was not reported from the committee in 1976 the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office recommended eliminating the nonforeign cola program in favor of more equitable means of compensation34 according to the gao report the designated nonforeign areas had witnessed rapid population growth and steady increases in both employment and per capita income as result gao said the nonforeign cola program had outlived its usefulness and was longer an appropriate means of compensation35 gao also recommended modifying the calculation of nonforeign colas in variety of ways includi ng incorporating an employees family size income level and state and federal taxes into the computation another recommendation called for the creation of more specific nonforeign cola areas to be carved out within existing ones to recognize cost differences across larger nonforeign areas36 the civil service commission now opm took position on gaos recommendations concluding that reform of the nonforeign cola program should be part of larger reform of the federal pay system 37 in 1992 congress required opm to report on the practices of nonforeign area employers other than the federal government as well as analyze the options and alternatives to the nonforeign cola program that would take into account all costs of living38 opm was also instructed to examine possible effects of implementing any alternative system on recruiting and retaining federal employees in nonforeign areas congress then froze nonforeign colas through continued regulations governing additional compensation and credit granted certain employees of the federal government serving outside the united states 66 federal register 18399 apr 9 2001 32 post differentials are granted to employees working in extraordinarily difficult working conditions excessive physical hardship or notably unhealthful

locality pay phasein would occur over threeyear period starting january 2009 when introducing the legislation senator akaka called it the latest step forward toward determining the best way to ensure retirement equity for federal workers in the nonforeign areas 76 the bill seeks to phase in locality pay over three years in each of those three years onethird of the locality pay rate would be added to federal employees pay concurrently with the introduction of locality pay the nonforeign area employee would have his or her cola reduced pursuant to s 3013 for every dollar an employee received in locality pay 65 cents in nonforeign cola pay would be removed from his or her pay after the three year phase in the nonforeign employee would receive full locality pay in addi tion to cola the cola

flat tax rate it does stipulate 65 cola offset factor because only 65 cents of every cola dollar is removed for every locality pay dollar added to the employees pay 35 cents of the cola continues to be included in the employees paycheck this 35 cents is meant to offset the federal tax payments for the transitioning nonforeign area employee who historically has not paid federal taxes on his or her pay supplement locality pay can be taxed on the federal level and under s 3013 locality pay will increase throughout the transition an employee who goes through the transition therefore would be paying more in federal taxes than if the transition had not occurred the remaining cola pay is what s 3013 assumes the employee will have to pay in federal taxes the 65 cola offset factor therefore

locality pay was worth more than the cola according to crs calculations colas in anchorage could be paid through 2017 under this proposal s 3013 concurrently attempts to ensure that nonforeign area employees take home pay is unaffected by transition and that the employees retirement and other benefits are calculated identically to those of federal employees who work within the contiguous united states by maintaining the cola even after the transition is completed however employees in the contiguous united states may receive less in take home pay than similar employee living in nonforeign

pay98 the phasein would occur over sevenyear period and colas would continue to be paid when the transition was complete opm director linda m springer stated that the proposal aimed to stem the growing perception that total pay and retirement benefits of the whitecollar civilian federal employees in nonforeign areas have eroded gradually in relation to the pay and retirement benefits of similarly situated employees in the 48 states and dc 99 springer also said that the perception of disparity in pay between the nonforeign cola areas and the contiguous united states has made staffing for nonforeign federal agencies more difficultespecially retention of federal employees who are nearing retirement

increase for nonforeign employee therefore opms proposal would concurrently increase federal taxes and retirement benefits column g estimates the hypothetical employees federal taxes as they increase with the phase in and beyond while the opm proposal does not directly state that it assumes 15 flat tax rate it does stipulate an 85 cola offset factor be cause only 85 cents of every cola dollar is removed for every locality pay dollar added to the employees pay 15 cents of the cola continues to be included in the employees paycheck this 15 cents is meant to offset the federal tax payments for the transitioning nonforeign area employee who historically has not paid federal taxes on his or her pay supplement locality pay can be taxed on the federal level and under opms proposal locality pay will increase throughout the transition an employee who goes through the transition therefore would be paying more in federal taxes than if the transition had not occurred the remaining cola pay is what the opm proposal assumes the employee will have to pay in federal taxes each year the 85 cola offset factor therefore assumes 15 flat tax rate for all nonforeign area federal employees column h shows what the employees take home pay would be after the 15 assumed tax rate is removed from his or her total pay this column is the difference if column g is subtracted from column d 102 in 2015

could concurrently increase federal taxes and retirement benefits column g estimates the hypothetical employees federal taxes as they increase with the phase in and beyond while the opm proposal does not directly state that it assumes 25 flat tax rate it does stipulate an 75 cola offset factor be cause only 75 cents of every cola dollar is removed for every locality pay dollar added to the employees pay 25 cents of the cola continues to be included in the employees paycheck this 25 cents is meant to offset the federal tax payments for the transitioning nonforeign area employee who historically has not paid federal taxes on his or her pay supplement locality pay can be taxed on the federal level and under opms proposal locality pay will increase throughout the transition an employee who goes through the transition therefore would pay more in federal taxes than if the transition had not occurred the remaining cola pay is what the opm proposal assumes the employee will have to pay in federal taxes each year the 75 cola offset factor therefore assumes 25 flat tax rate for all nonforeign area federal employees column h shows what the employees take home pay would be after the 25 assumed tax rate is removed from his or her total pay this column is the difference if column g is subtracted from column d 113 us congress senate committee on homeland security and

it while s 3013 would phasein locality pay over three years the opm proposal would do so over seven the federal managers association plan switches to locality pay in one year and eliminates the nonforeign colas in the second year of implementation for both s 3013 and the opm proposal the percentage of nonforeign cola pay that remains and the length of time it would continue to be paid after the phasein is complete would vary by location as stated earlier opm estimates that nonforeign colas could continue to be paid between 10 and 30 years after enactment of the sevenyear transitiondepending on the location all three proposals could increase federal personal income tax collections g22g146g150g146g151g144g561g152g143g561g18g145g138g156g142g556g146g151g561 phasing in locality pay over several years may prompt certain employees to postpone retirement as noted earlier charles d grimes iii deputy associate director for performance and pay systems at opm said that the longer phasein periods may reduce an older employees incentive to retire quickly so he or she could ensure they receive the largest retirement benefits possible the postponed retirement could save the federal government large retirement benefit costs shorter phasein times like the threeyear proposal of s 3013 or the oneyear proposal from fma could precipitate earlier retirements we believe it is not advisable to exacerbate staffing problems by creating an incentive to retire as might be the case if there were shorter phasein period the phasein period also reduces the financial impact on agency budgets caused by higher employer retirement contributions s 3013 though welcomed as step forward in resolving these issues would cost significantly more due to the shorter phasein period and reduced offset 116 115 information provided to the author by fma on oct 22 2008 116 us congress senate committee on homeland security and governmental oversight subcommittee on oversight of government

federal workers cola after the transition is completed the continued cola is meant to offset the federal tax payments for nonforeign area employees who historically have not paid federal taxes on their colas but must now pay federal taxes on their locality pay these ongoing cola payments however may prompt concerns of pay equity between employees living in nonforeign areas and those living in areas of the contiguous united states with similar labor costs employees within the contiguous united states who have similar labor costs would not receive cola offsets but could face similar federal

pay than they would have if the proposal had not been enacted the continued cola attempts to cover the fede ral taxes nonforeign employee would pay on his or her locality pay that he or she had not paid on cola 65 cola offset like the one proposed in s 3013 therefore assumes that nonforeign employee will pay the remaining 35 of his or her cola in federal taxes the cola offset therefore assumes 35 flat tax rate for all nonforeign employees if the federal tax rate estimate is too high nonforeign area employees may receive more federal pay than needed to maintain their takehome pay too low of an assumed federal tax rate may force some federal employees to owe more in fe deral taxes than they received in their cola offset leaving nonforeign employees with less takehome pay than they would have had if the transition had not occurred s 3013 assumes 35 federal tax rate which is federal tax bracket for workers who earn more than 357000 per year federal whitecollar employee on the gs scale

higher than 15 under this proposal many nonforeign area federal employees would pay more in federal taxes than provided by the cola offset to ensure the transition did not affect their takehome pay the fma proposal assumes 25 federal tax rate employees who earn between 32550 and 78850 are in 25 federal tax bracket under this proposal some employees in the lowest grades may receive more money than necessary to ensure their take home pay is not reduced as result of the transition federal employees above the gs13 step 6 level however may not receive cola large enough to ensure the transition

result in an increase in federal personal income federal tax collections this increase in personal income federal tax collections is the result of several factors first the shift from excluded nonforeign cola payments to federal taxable locality pay would increase federal taxable income and in turn increase federal tax collections directly secondly the inclusion of locality pay that is creditable for retirement purposes would likely result in an increase in federal taxable retirement benefits in turn this would also result in direct increase in federal tax collections finally both of these increases in federal taxable forms of income may interact with the alternative minimum federal tax amt and other federal tax provisions resulting in an indirect increase in federal tax collections 121 g5g152g151g140g149g158g141g146g151g144g561g17g139g156g142g155g159g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 congress created both the nonforeign cola and the locality pay authorities to help attract and retain federal workers to specific locations nonforeign colas attempt to compensate for high living costs locality pay on the other hand attempts to narrow the pay gap between federal and nonfederal workers who live in separate designated areas three proposals have been introduced that would replace nonforeign co with locality pay the proposals would place federal employees who work in nonforeign areas in the same pay system as federal employees in the contiguous united states congress may choose to adopt any of the proposed transition plans or it may maintain the current cola system if none of the proposals were enacted and the nonforeign cola program were maintained federal employees in nonforeign areas may continue to be concerned with the differences in how their supplemental pay is calculated in comparison to federal employees in the contiguous united states regardless of fluctuations in nonforeig n cola rates nonforeign area employees may believe their pay and benefits are not equal to pay and benefits of federal employees in other areas if locality pay were phased in some nonforeign areas may see reduction in the rate percentage of their supplemental pay in honolulu for example the nonforeign cola rate is currently 25 opms estimated locality pay rate for honolulu is 203846 lower than the current cola rate the rate reduction however would be supplemented by continued use of cola pay to attempt to ensure that the takehome pay of nonforeign employees is not affected by transition according to opms estimates on annual locality pay increases honolulus locality pay rate could reach 25 by 2013 if transition were implemented under s 3013 honolulu resident may receive more total pay and greater retirement benefits than if the transition did not occur because he or she would receive both locality pay and cola concurrently if the locality pay rate in honolulu did not increase at the opmestimated 1 per year however the employee may 120 ibid

current cola rate 25 in anchorage however the opmestimated locality pay rate in 2011 3024 is 624 higher than the current nonforeign cola rate 24 the cost of each of the three transition plans may also be concern to lawmakers in 2014 nonforeign area employees in honolulu hi woul d be receiving both nonforeign cola and locality pay if the locality pay rates increase one percentage point per year the federal government could pay nonforeign cola to honolulu employees until 2017 or longer123 the total transition time to phase in locality pay under s 3103 therefore could last nine or more years124 if locality pay did not continue to increase the federal government could pay employees nonforeign colas in perpetuity under opms transition proposal nonforeign area employee in honolulu hawaii would continue to receive nonforeign cola rate until 2017125 this transition to locality pay could last nine or more years like under s 3013 the federal government could pay employees nonforeign cola in perpetuity under the opm proposal if the locality pay did not continue to increase as noted earlier opm estimates first year phasein costs for its transition plan at 157 million second year costs are estimated at 314 million126 according to cbos 22 billion cost estimate for the transition opms estimate may be low if locality pay were instituted in full in one yearlike in the fma proposalsome agencies may struggle to pay benefits to retirees the pace of any locality pay phasein may affect federal retirement rates in nonforeign cola areas employees who plan to retire may do so soon after acquiring high 3 average basic salary that includes locality payand in some cases both locality pay and cola more rapid transiti on to locality pay therefore may encourage employees to retire as soon as three years after locality pay is fully implemented agency budgets may need to be increased or programs streamlined to ensure that retiring employee receives his or her earned benefits longer transition period may spread retirements out over the phasein period but may also cause challenges for federal employees who served government and planned to retire before the longer phasein were completed 122 if locality pay increased 1 per year as estimated by opm honolulu employees would receive continued cola through 2017 under the opm transition proposal 123 crs estimate using s 3013 124 three years of transition and six years to eliminate the cola 125 crs estimate using opms transition provisions the estimate assumes locality pay will increase opms estimated annual increase of 1 per
