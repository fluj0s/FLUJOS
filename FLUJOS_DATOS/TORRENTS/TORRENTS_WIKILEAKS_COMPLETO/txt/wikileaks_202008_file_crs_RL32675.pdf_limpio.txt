the standards for defining new england city and town areas nectas which are conceptually similar to cbsas the 2000 standards supe rseded those for defining metropolitan statistical areas in the 1990s cbsas consist of counties and countyequivalents in the united states and puerto rico each cbsa must contain at least one urbanized area of 50000 or more persons metropolitan statisti cal area or at least one urban cluster of 10000 to 49999 persons micropolitan sta tistical area cbsas have one or more principal cities and central counties outlying counties are included in cbsas on the basis of commuting data counties that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in cbsas are classified as outside core based statistical areas nectas are classified similarly to cbsas and designated as either m etropolitan or mic ropolitan nectas omb issued effective june 6 2003 the actual lists of cbsas the titles of the areas with their principal city nd county components nectas and their components are listed as well the lists were derived by applying the omb standards to population and commuting data from the 2000 decennial census conducted by the bureau of the census each year until 2010 omb will announce any revisions to cbsas that are justifie d by the census bureaus annual population estimates the most recent revisi ons were announced on february 18 2004 in principle standard metropolitan area definitions are to be used solely for descriptive statistical purposes in practi ce however they have other applications including their use in formulas for allocating federal gr ant program funds straightforward procedure exists fo r calculating the exact amount of money distributed through all federal grant programs that use metropolitan area definitions or for determining the effects of changes in these definitions on the total amount of funds allocated to specific jurisdiction even identifying comprehensively which programs use metropolitan area designations would require reviewing the statutes regulations and formulas associated with the programs assuming that such an identification were feasible it would be only the first step toward determining whether inclusion in or exclusion from particular metropolitan area or its components directly translates into an in crease or decrease in the federal funds particular jurisdiction might receive from all federal grant programs that rely on these designations again the question would have to be addre ssed on programby program basis and posed to depar tment or agency program staff this report will be updated to

standards and discusses the difficulty of ascertaining how metropolita n area designations affect federal funds allocation brief history of metropolitan area standards standard metropolitan area definitions represent an attempt to describe systematically the linkage between larg population concentration and the territory surrounding it these definitions came about because of the realization during the 1940s that the value of metropolitan da ta produced by federal agencies would be greatly enhanced if agencies used si ngle set of geographic definitions for the nations largest centers of population and activity at the time agencies were defining variety of st atistical geographic areas at the metropolitan level using different criteria applied to different geographic units the result was that one agencys statistics were not directly comparable with another agencys statistics for any given area1 accordingly in 1949 the bureau of the budget issued the first standard definitions of metropolitan areas the bur eau and then its successor omb have been in charge of designating these areas since 1949 except for the period from 1977 to 1981 when this responsibility rested with the office of federal statistical policy and standards in the departme nt of commerce in addition to the 2000 revisions the standards underwent modifica tions in 1990 1980 1975 1971 and

management and budget omb announced the standards for defining tropolitan and micropolita n statistical areas in the current decade3 these areas together are termed generically core based statistical areas cbs as core refers to large population concentration that is integrated with surrounding territory this term like micropolitan is new the 2000 standards superseded those dopted in 1990 for defi ning metropo litan statistical areas the december 27 2000 notice also containe d the standards for defining new england city and town areas nectas which are conceptually similar to cbsas omb issued effective june 6 2003 lists showing the actual delineations of cbsas the titles of the areas as well as their principal city and county components4 nectas and their components ar listed too producing these lists involved applying the omb standards to population nd commuting data from the 2000 decennial census conducted by the bur eau of the census hence although omb sets the criteria for defining metropolitan areas the identification of the specific areas is census based the designations matter to congress because they matter to congressional constituents omb noted that th metropolitan and cropolitan statistical areas defined through these standards repr esent areas in which people reside work and spend their lives and to which they attach considerable amount of pride5 cbsa designations also can influence deci sions by businesses about where to locate or how to identify their markets thus variables like the territory included in an area the territory excluded and the areas title can generate great interest among diverse constituents including local officials business groups and nonpr ofit organizations this interest is heightened insofar as th standards are used in ways unintended by omb especially to implement nonstatisti cal programs and allocate program funds the 2000 standards in detail core based statistical area is geographic entity associated with at least one

components c ounties use cbsas in new england following are the highlights of the 2000 standards metropolitan and micropolitan categories each cbsa must contain census bureau defined urbanized area of at least 50000 population or census bureau defined urban cluster of at least 10000 population urbanized areas and urban clusters are collectively called urban areas8 cbsas are categorized as metropolita n or micropolitan according to the criteria below metropolitan statistical areas have urbanized areas of 50000 or more persons micropolitan statistical areas have urban clusters of at least 10000 but fewer than 50000 persons they represent an acknowledgment th at certain entities while less populous than metr opolitan statistical areas resemble them in some characteristics and are not well desc ribed as simply nonmetropolitan new england city and town area is classified similarly to cbsa and is designated either metropolita n or micropolitan necta principal cities of cbsas

combined statistical areas together with changes in the titles of certain areas and principal cities17 intended and unintended uses of the standards the success of standard metropolitan area definitions omb pointed out is evident from their widespread application including to inform the debate and development of pub lic policies 18 omb emphasized however that the purpose of the standards is strictly statistical to provide na tionally consistent definitions for collecting tabulating and publishing federal statistics for set of geographic areas the definitions are not in othe r words intended or approved for other purposes omb does not take into account or attempt to anticipate any nonstatistical uses that may be made of the definitions nor will omb modify the definitions to meet the requirements of any nonstatistical program thus the definitions should not be used to develop and implement federal state and local nonstatistical programs and policies without full consideration of the effect s of using these definitions for such purposes these areas should not rve as generalpurpose geographic framework for nonstatistical activities nd they may or may not be suitable for use in program funding formulas19 an acknowledgment ne vertheless followed omb recognizes that some legislation specifies the use of metropolitan statistical areas for program purposes including the allocation of federal funds and will continue to work with the congress to clarify the foundations of these finitions and the resultant often unintended consequences of their us for nonstatistical purposes20 notable unintended uses of metropolitan area designations occur in certain federal grant programs to establish applicant or beneficiary eligibility for instance or as an element in formula

certainty every program in the catalog of federal domestic assistance that in some way uses metropolitan area definitions to distribute money the general program descriptions in th cfda do not present all the variables used in determining applicant and beneficiary eligibility for assistance programs in other words the descriptions do not give the user enough detail to determine every factor that might figure into awarding grant funds for example conducting search with the phrase metropolitan statistical area or the abbreviation msa yields fewer than dozen hits however since the cfda search involves program descriptions not the statutes regulations and variables in mathematical formulas associated with the programs this small number of hits does not accurately reflect every instance when program relies on some feature of metropolitan area definitions related limitation is that certain federal programs have subprograms not presented separately in the cfda other strategies finding comprehensively which programs use metropolitan area designations would require reviewing the st atutes regulations and form ulas associated with the programs the government accountab ility office gao conducted partial review using the terms metropolitan statistical areas and msa to search the us code for report issued in june 2004 on the 2000 standards and their possible impact on certain federal programs23 gao identified 32 programs noted in the code that use these terms in determining program eligibility and mentioned briefly how the new standards might affect the distribution of program funds24 gao cautioned that its search was limited to the united states code and was not intended to serve as an exhaustive list of federal programs that refer to metropolitan statistical areas25 although gao did not repeat its search strategy with the code of federal regulations cfr combining the results of code and cfr searches might yield longer list of these programs an alternative approach would be to c onsult the program sta ff at the department or agency administering each program the cfda provides contact information for every federal assistance program ong with the program
