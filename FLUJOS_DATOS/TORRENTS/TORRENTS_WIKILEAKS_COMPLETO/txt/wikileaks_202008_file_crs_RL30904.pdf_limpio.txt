government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30904why is the amount of curr ency in circulation rising summary currency is typically the small change of the monetary system in the sense that it is used for small transactions the continued spread of banking electronic innovations in finance such as atms nd the widespread use of credit cards have or should be expected to have reduced the need for currency an examination of the data shows that this is not true dividing the amount of currency in circulation by the population of the united states shows that on per capita basis currency rose from 32 in 1929 to more than 2000 at the end of 2003 if these data are adjusted for inflation the per capita increase rises fro m 320 to 2000 this allocates to the typical family of four in 2003 about 8800 in currency the growth in currency holdings has been especially rapid in the period subsequent to 1970 byproduct of this devel opment has been literature suggesting that these dollar holdings are used to finance va st underground or irregular economy in the united states as well as other countries the transactions in this irregular economy are both legal and illegal the legal ac tivity conducted by cash it is argued is designed to avoid taxation the illegal ac tivity conducted by cash is to avoid the paper trail left by checks thus making it harder for law enforcement authorities to detect the activity while estimates of the underground economy made in the late 1970s and 1980s varied they suggested it wa s sizeable they implied that widely used measures of macroeconomic performan ce such as the rate of economic growth the unemployment rate and the inflation rate derived from official statistics were seriously deficient the united states was better off than the official data suggested however using the estimation methodology popular in the 1970s to estimate the size of the irregular economy today yields an economy that is implausibly large nearly threequarters the size of official gdp two developments caused some economis ts to question this methodology in which currency plays crucial role fi rst large and growing percentage of currency now estimated by the federal reserve to be up to 70 of the total does not circulate in the united states thus it is not being used to finance the irregular economy in america second the recorded statistics on bank deposits also used in this methodology understate th actual deposits used to transact business and this understatement is growing it has re sulted from the innovative ways devised by bankers to get around the prohibition of paying interest on corporate checking accounts thus an argument can be made that th growth in currency outstanding really tells us very little about the us economy of importance currency comprises very large part of one of the monetary aggr egates the monetary base that various economists have argued the federal rese rve should control in order to control aggregate spending this report suggests that this advice may not be warranted congress should be alerted to the possib ility that studies about vast underground economy massive amounts of uncollected taxes from this economy seriously deficient national statistics relationships between monetary aggregates and income etc may be based more on vi vid imagination than on

vault cash while this is counted as their reserves it is not include d in this study as currency in circulation 2 the sources of the data and their manipulati on for the purposes of this study are explained continuedwhy is the amount of currency in circulation rising currency is typically thought of as th small change of the monetary system of most developed countries it is ge nerally used by households and perhaps by small businesses for such purchases as fa st food products sold in vending machines gasoline laundry and dry cleaning grocerie s movies etc increasingly however these purchases seem to be done by co mbination of creditdebit cards and checks originally the growth of deposit banking and the use of checks were major force expected to decrease the use of currency this was reinforced by the development and use of credit cards in addition th widespread availability of atms made possible by the electronics revolution should reduce av erage currency holdings as result one might expect currency to be increasingly chased out of the monetary system supplanted by easier mean s of making payments yet this does not seem to be the case in 2003 some 646 billion in currency and coin were in circulation this amounted to more than 2200 per resident of the united states if this were taken litera lly it would mean that the typical family of four held approximately 8800 in currency and as explained in the pages to follow the amount of currency in circulation has been gr owing rather than decreasing it appears that currency is far from becoming the really small change of the american monetary system the analysis in this report suggests however that all is not quite what it appears to be in fact currency in circulation in the united states is becoming the small change of the american monetary system the behavior of the currency stock figure 1 shows both the nominal value of the actual st ock of currency and the value of that same stock expressed in real or 1999

disposable incometo make expenditures these data are shown in figure 3 they reveal that in 1929 currency holdings were about 47 cents per do llar of disposable income this means that if households disposable inco averaged 1000 year it would hold on average over that year about 47 dollars in currency by 2003 households were holding about 80 cents per dollar of disposab income or about 70 more than they held in 1929 notice that currency holding relative to disposable income was particularly high during world war ii and in the decade after the end of the war this includes the korean war period source federal reserve bea these data reveal that th amount of currency held re lative to disposable income continued slow decline into the mid1980s then the amount held began to rise and by 2003 it had increased by more than 50 the development and widespread use and availability of credit cards and atm machines might have been expected to have reduced these holdings considerably the final comparison shown in figure 4 consists of currency holding relative to all types of checking deposits in 1929 the public held about 17 cents in currency for every dollar held as checking deposit this number rose dramatically during the great depression because of the banking crisis nearly doubling by 1933 it then began to decline only to rise again during world war ii in 1945 35 cents in currency was held for each dollar of mand deposits relative currency holding then began steady decline into the 1950s it remained relatively stable from the early 1950s into the late 1960s from that point on it began to rise with the rate of increase being especially rapid during the 1990s these data show that by 2003 the public held about 108 in currency per each dollar held as demand deposit this is startling development it suggests that americans individuals and businesses hold more in currency than they do in ch ecking accounts the increase in currency holding per dollar of demand

major use made of these data has b een to draw inferences about what is variously called the undergr ound subterranean or i rregular economy there was and still is belief that in the united states and elsewhere legal and illegal economic activity flourishes that is financed or facilitated by the use of currency currency it is argued is used in the c onduct of legal activity primarily to avoid taxation it is used in conducting ch illegal activity as money laundering gambling drugs etc to escape detection by law enforcement authorities in the 1970s the size of this irregular economy began to interest economists an early if not the earliest measure of the size of this economy was made by professor peter guttman3 guttmans measure of the 1976 economy depended on four assumptions 1 the irregular economy uses only currency as means of exchange 2 during the period 19371941 there was irregular economy this is then his base period 3 the ratio of currency to demand or checkable deposits during this base period is regarded as normal or the ratio that would prevail thereafter were it not for the growth of the irregular economy 4 dollar of currency supports the same amount of ec onomic activity in both the regular and irregular economy using the data available at the time and applying this methodology guttman estimated from the amount of demand deposits in existen ce that the size of the irregular economy was about 104 of the fficially recorded gross national producthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30904crs7 4 guttmans work was not without its critics for an early critical review of his methodology see robert d laurent c urrency and the subterranean economy economic perspectives federal reserve bank of chicago marapr 1979 pp 36 other economists at the federal reserve banks

hoarding demand for currency quarterly review of economics and business vol 30 1 spring 1990 pp 7589 5 guttmans paper and methodology are not the only attempt to estimate the size of the unofficial economy another notable effort wa s made by professor edgar feige an early paper by him is how big is the irregular economy challenge novdec 1979 pp 513 feiges approach is somewhat less restrictiv than guttmans among his less restrictive assumptions is that 75 of the transacti ons in the irregular economy are effected by currency and the remaining 25 by checkable deposits feige also uses different methods to measure the economic activity in the irregular sector these methods have changed over time the simple application of his met hodology produces an estimate of the irregular economy in the 1990s that is about twice as large as that estimated using guttmans methodology feiges estimates decline by about onehalf when they are adjusted to reflect the us currency that circulates abroad see his the underground economy and the currency enigma public finance vol 49 1994 pp 119136 another good collection of papers on this subject can be found in the underground economy in the united states and abroad ed vito tanzi lexington books 1982 see especially part ii and us congress house committee on ways and means subcommittee on oversight underground economy hearings 96th cong 1st sess 1979 useful critique of these methods for estimating the size of the irregu lar economy can be found in richard d porter continuedgnp he then drew number of infe rences from his study about the number of people employed in the irregular econom and the unreliability of the recorded statistics on gnp and unemployment because of the rapid growth in the currencytodeposit ratio recorded in the period subsequent to guttmans study especi ally the sharp rise during the 1990s the application of his methodology to current da ta yields quite different results using revised data the period 19371941 yields some 212 in currency to every 1000 held as demand deposits if this ratio is app lied to the data on mand deposits for 2003 it yields about 127 billion that would ve to be held as currency to make transactions in the offici economy the remaining currency then according to guttmans methodology is used to finance the irregular economy actual currency holdings in 2003 averaged about 646 billion suggesting that about 519 billion was used for the irregular economy if the to tal of demand deposits and currency used in the regular economy 127 600 genera ted gross domestic product of 10988 billion the 519 billion in currency assumed to be used in the irregular economy would generate an irregular gdp of about 7844 billion this is about 71 of the official economy as recorded in th national income and product accounts4 some basic evidence can be offered to suggest that the estimate for 2003 is wide of the mark if employment per dollar of income in both sectors is the same there would not be enough labor in the united states even if the entire labor force were employed to produce combined gdp of 188 trillion in 20035httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30904crs8 5

as much continuedalternative explanations for the trend in the currency data as noted above the size of the i rregular economy in 2003 using th guttman methodology is implausibly large there have been developments in financial markets and in the use of currency which cause estimates such as those above to be of questionable value some of the innova tions in financial markets have affected the use of demand deposits by businesses bank account sweeps while interest can be paid by financial institutions primarily commercial banks on checking deposits owned by individuals and some business and govern mental units it cannot be paid on the checking deposits held by most businesses especially t hose organized on corporate basis see us code 371a in order to attract and re tain those deposits ba nks have devised number of means to in effect pay interest on them in doing so they affect the amount of those deposits recorded on the books of banks at the close of the business day it is from the accounts at the close of th business day that the official statistics are recorded common way to get around the prohibiti on is to allow business firms to make use of their demand deposits during the day but to sweep the accounts of their funds at the end of the day and put them in form on which interest can be paid these are often money market deposit accounts mmdas in addition the high interest rates during the late 1970s and early 1980s led bus inesses to devise number of money management strategies that allowed them to effect the same volume of transactions with smaller average holdings of dollars most of which would have been in the form of demand deposits thus combination of banks desiring to pay interest on the demand deposit holdings by businesses and better money management t echniques by businesses has resulted in much slower rate of growth in demand deposits in the recorded statistics this in part can explain the sharp rise in the ratio beginning in the 1990s shown in figure 4 thus the currencytodeposit ratio is of questionable value in calculating the size of the underground econom and with it the value of transactions involved in money laundering illegal gambling and the illega l drug trade it does not explain however why the amount of cu rrency in circulation has been rising currency held abroad even more damaging evidence against this methodology is the admission by the federal reserve that perhaps as much as two thirds of the currency in circulation does not circulate within the united states 6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30904crs9 6 continued as twothirds of all federal reserve notes in circulation are now held abroad oct 8 1998 in march 2003 the federal reserve put the total held abroad at around 60 see us treasury the use and counterfeiting

overseas dollar holdings what do we know board of governors of the federal reserve unpublished january 2001 8 this is not to say that the united states does not gain from foreigners holding us currency these holdings represent an intere stfree loan from foreigners to the united states if currency were not held abroad the us treasury would have had to issue an equal amount of interestbearing debt for more on this issue see crs report 98998 euro currency how much could it cost the united states by gail makinen 9 for the actual computations see ri chard porter and gretchen weinbach currency

comparison of bea estimates of personal in come and irs estimates of adjusted gross continuedofficial estimates exist only for the 100 nomination notes held abroad counting only 100 notes abroad about onehalf of us currency is now held abroad as shown in figure 5 the fraction would be higher if smaller denomination notes abroad were included7 this represents an increase of about 66 over the 10year period 1989 to 1998 since 1998 the percent of total currency held abroad has stabilized this admission casts considerable doubt on the interpretation to be attached to the data contained in figures 24 above8 in fact when currencytodeposit ratio is calculated that considers both sweeps and the currency that is estimated to circulate abroad it does not display the sharp rise during the 1990s that is evident in figure 4 the revised ratio reaches peak in about 1980 and then tre nds downward through the 1990s the revised ratio is highly corre lated with the yield on fiveyear treasury securities the correlation coeffi cient is 08 and fairly high ly correlated with the yield on threemonth treasury bills the correlation coefficient is 0639 this suggests that the ratio is highly sensitive to the opport unity cost of holding wealth in the form of money rather than to the possible activ ities in the irregular economy thus it is both reasonable and prudent to conclude that early estimates of the size of the underground economy drawn from the growth of currency in circulation are now much too large this is not to suggest that an irregular economy does not exist illegal activity flourishes and the internal revenue service points to the large disparity between its computations of adju sted gross income of individuals by type of income and the estimates of personal income made by the bureau of economic analysis from the national income and product accounts this disparity also suggests that tax avoidance exists the debate is over the relative size of these activities and how best to estimate their size10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30904crs10 10 continued income survey of current business apr 2004 p 8 11 the last survey that collected data on currency holdings was conducted in may

holdings at little more than 11811 there is then considerable amount of currency held domestically that cannot be explained some have creatively called this the case of the missing money nothing precludes some of this money from being held to finance an undergr ound economy the federal reserve has an ongoing research effort to explain thes holdings as well as to provide more comprehensive estimate of the amount held abroad currency by denomination not only has the amount of currency in circ ulation risen drama tically but so has the percentage of the total consisting of 100 denomination notes the largest notes in circulation these notes constituted 252 of the total in 1972 they rose to 418 in 1982 and to 563 in 1992 in 2003 th ey were 708 of the total those who believe in vast underg round economy cite this growth as evidence in support of their view httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30904crs11 12 while it is doubtful that the federal reserve ever conducted monetary policy by manipulating the growth rate of monetary aggregate it did in the period subsequent to 1973 set monitoring ranges for three measures of the money supply m1 m2 and m3 it terminated the range for m1 in 1990 and fo r m2 and m3 in 2000 this reflected the fact that the growth rates of these aggregates di d not bear close and stable relationship with the growth rates of money spending the controversy over the relationship of these aggregates to spending is still far from over for recent discussion see milton friedman continuedpart of the increase in the share of 100 b ills in circulation may reflect the effect of inflation however inflation not only s an effect on the amount of currency held by the public but it can also affect the composition of currency holdings suppose for example that the price level increased tenfold between period 1 and period 2 individuals who held 10 bill to make transaction in period 1 would now need to hold 100 to make the same transaction th is could be done with ten 10 bills or one 100 bill physical constraints such as the size of the wallet or purse would argue in favor of the substitution some evidence supporting substitution can be found in the fact that over the 21 year period 19792000 the amount or face value of currency in circulation rose about 400 while the number of notes in circulation of denomination 1 through 100 increased by about 176 thus consumer s held 400 more currency to finance transactions in 2000 than they did in 1979 but they held only 176 more notes this is possible only if the average value of th notes rose ie larger denomination notes were substituted for multiple smaller denomination notes this substitution was undoubtedly aided by inflation over this 21year period the consumer price index rose about 140 thus the mere presen ce of more higherdenomination notes in circulation need not indicat much about the size or growth of an underground economy it may be more suggestive of th effect inflation has on the physical ease of making transactions currency and the conduct of monetary policy there has long been debate among academic ec onomists over the tool the federal reserve should use to conduct monetary policy for most of the past 20 to 30 years the federal reserv has conducted monetary po licy by manipulating short term interest rates in pa rticular it has manipulated th federal funds rate which is an overnight rate that banks charge each other for the use of excess reserves this rate typically influences other shortterm interest rates and the current and expected shortterm rates influence th behavior of longterm ra tes number of economists have argued that this method has gotte n the federal reserve into trouble from time to time better way to conduc t monetary policy they argue is to target the growth rate of the money supply if stable and predictable relati onship exists between the money supply and money spending they argue the latter could be controlled more closely through control over the suppl of money than by manipulating interest rates this group of economists engaged in research strategy to show that such stable relationship exists for several di fferent measures of money and money spending12 unfortunately for their policy recommendations the stable andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30904crs12 12 continued monetarist thoughts journal of economic perspectives vol 14

percentage of the total monetary base in 1964 the first year in the postworld war ii era th at the federal reserve reported currency held abroad the domestic base was about 92 of the total base by 1998 it had declined to about 56 of the total roughly where it has re mained through 2003 if foreign holdings of smallerdenomination currency could be estimated to the satisfaction of the federal reserve and thus included in the flow of funds estimates the domestic base would probably have fallen to about 40 of the total base in 1998predictable relationship shown by their empi rical studies broke dow n for at least two of the popular monetary aggregates13 increasingly this group has come to focus on the relationship between the socalled monetary base nd money spending14 it is curious that the monetary base money spending growth relationship is stronger than for the other monetary aggregates since more than 90 of the base is composed of currency the re mainder consists of the rese rves of the banking system and an increasing proportion of the currency component over the past 20 years is held abroad this suggests that developments abroad have stronger relationship to aggregate spending in the united states than do domestic measures of money in which currency plays much smaller role it also suggests that the historically stable relationship between this m onetary variable

the total base less the amount of curre ncy represented by 100 denomination bills that are estimated to circulate abroad is contrasted with the growth rate of the total monetary base for the period 19802003 th two measures of the base have different turning points and rates of chan ge over the 23year period alt hough their movements are quite similar from 1998 to 2003 this follows since the

is correct it is used for minor household and business tr ansactions it may even be held to provide safety against an uncertain future this being the case it is hard to explain the large amount of us currency in circulation at the end of 2003 which would amount to about 8800 per family of four more than the average demand deposit held by indivi duals and businesses this is hardly small change for that reason individuals including economists have investigated the uses made of this currency they once concluded that it financed or facilitated vast undergr ound ec onomy where both legal and illegal activities flourish this underground activity supposedly costs the government tax re venue and casts doubt on the meaning to be attached to national statistics that measure the macroeconomic performance of the economy these conclusions are now suspect b ecause the underlying methodology used to estimate the size of the underground economy assumes that all this currency circulates and is actively used in transac tions in the united states this is untrue substantial and growing amount circulat abroad estimates by the federal reserve suggest that currently this may account for much as 70 of the currency in circulation while other data and thodologies suggest that an underground economy exists especially that related to illegal activity it is considerably smaller than that estimated by cu rrencybased methodologies given the diminishing proportion of the to tal currency stock that circulates in the united states the commonsense perception that currency is indeed the small change of the american monetary system appears to be correcthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30904crs14 appendix the data sources and their manipulations disposable personal income bureau of economic analysis

the data for 19291940 are taken from table a1 in the monetary history of the united states by milton friedman nd anna j schwartz for the period 19592003 the yearly observations are the average of the currency in circulation in december of the year in question and december of the preceding year for 19291958 it represents the currency in circ ulation as of the end of june of the relevant year in either case the currency estimate is centered on midyear demand deposits the data for 19291940 are taken from table a1 of the monetary history of the united states the data for 19412003 are taken from the board of governors of the fe deral reserve they have been manipulated in the same way as the currency numbers above it s hould be noted that the demand deposit data for the period 19592003 are not strictly co mparable with th data for 19291958 the former series omits some deposits in cluded in the later series thus the 1959 2003 data are slightly smaller each ear than those for the earlier
