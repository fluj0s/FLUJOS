summary number of congressional proposals to dvance programs that reduce greenhouse gases have been introduced in the 108th congress proposals r eceiving particular attention would create marketoriented greenhouse gas reduction program along the lines of the trading provisions of the curre nt acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 clean air act amendments one b ill s 139 focuses directly on reducing greenhouse gas emissions while two others s 366 and s 843 incorporate carbon dioxide reduction schemes into an overall framework to reduce pollution from power plants this paper includes sidebyside comparison of the major provisions of those bills under an agreement reached between s 139s sponsors and the senate leadership s 139 will be brought to the nate floor this fall for deba and vote the sponsors have the right to introduce an amendment to s 139 the only amendment allowed under the agreement the sponsors have announced that they will propose an amendment to their bill to strike the second phase of the reduction program this report will be updated if events warrant introduction climate change is generally viewed as global issue but proposed responses generally require action at the national leve l in 1992 the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which called on industrialized countries to take th lead in reducing greenhouse gases1 over the pasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21581crs2 1 continued 2 for further information see crs report rl30692 global climate change the kyoto protocol 3 most of the programs outlined in the report in volve research technical assistance information gathering or technical assistance programs in itiated by the federal government or voluntary emissions reduction programs c oordinated by the government 4 the regrets policy was one of establishi ng programs for other purposes that would have concomitant greenhouse gas reductions therefor only those policies that reduced greenhouse gas emissions at cost were considereddecade variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states including monitoring of utility carbon dioxide emissions improved appliance efficiency and incentives for developing renewable energy sources in 2001 president george w bush reject ed the kyoto protocol which called for legally binding commitments by developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions2 he also rejected the concept of ma ndatory emissions reductions since then the administration has focused us climate change policy on voluntary initiatives to reduce the growth in greenhouse gas emissions this focus is particularly evident in the administrations 2002 climate action report car sub mitted under the provisions of the unfccc of the over 50 programs summarized in the 2002 car only six are described as regulatory3 these regulatory programs were generally implemented to achieve energy or environmental goals other than the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions but produced conco mitant emissions reduction in this sense they could be considered the results of regrets4 policy where climate change effects resulting from related air quality and energy policies are included in the decisionmaking process on new or modified rules number of congressional proposals to dvance programs that reduce greenhouse gases have been introduced in the 108th congress these effort s have generally followed one of three tracks the first is to improve the monitoring of greenhouse gas emissionsas basis for resear ch and development and for any future reduction scheme the second is to enact marketoriente d greenhouse gas reduction program along the lines of the trading provisions of the curre nt acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 clean air act amendments the third is to enact energy and related programs that would also have the added effect of reducing greenhouse gases an example would be requirement that electricity producers generate portion of their electricity from renewable resources renewabl portfolio standard th is report focuses on the second category of bills specifically comparing the major provisions of bills introduced in the senate proposed senate legislation in the 108th congress three bills have been introduced that would impose controls on emissions

eenhouse gas emissions s 139 introduced by senators mccain and li eberman would cap emissions of the six greenhouse gases specified in the united nations framewor k convention on climate change at reduced levels from the electric generation transpor tation industrial and commercial sectors sectors that account for about 85 of u s greenhouse gas emissions the reductions would be implemented in two phases with an emissions cap in the year 2010 based on affected facilities 2000 emissions for any tity that emits more than 10000 metric tons of greenhouse gases carbon diox ide equivalent and furt her reduction cap imposed in the year 2016 based on affect ed facilities 1990 emissions the program would be implemented through an expansive allowance trading program that would allow cross sector trading increases in carbon seque stration and limited acqui sition of allowances from foreign sources5 under an agreement reached between the b ills sponsors and the senate leadership s 139 will be brought to the nate floor this fall for deba and vote the sponsors have the right to introduce an amendment to s 139 the only amendment allowed under the agreement the sponsors have announced that they will propose an amendment to their bill to strike the second pha of the reduction program the other two bills incorporate carbon diox ide reductions into an overall framework to reduce pollution from power plants these bills reflect an interest in finding mechanisms to achieve public health and environmental goals in simpler more cost effective ways specifically these bills use multipollutant strategy framework based on consistent set of emissions caps implemented through emissions trading6 during the 108th congress two multipollutant bills that ve been intr oduced in the senate include carbon dioxide among the emissions to be reduced7 s 366 introduced by senator jeffords is modified version of the multipollutant bill s 556 reported out by the senate environment and public works committee during the 107th congress placing emission caps on nitr ogen oxides sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide s 366 would require electric generating facilities 15 mw or greater to meet an aggregate carbon dioxide emissions cap in the year 2009 the national carbon dioxide emissions cap would be set at 1990 emissions levels for electric generating facilities would be implemented through tradeable allowance program and would include significant penalties for noncompliance in addition to these emission caps s 366 would place facilityspecific emission limitations on mercury s 843 introduced by senator carper is modified version of s 3135 which he introduced in the 107th congress placing emission caps on nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide mercury and carbon dioxide s 843 would require electri c generating facilities 25 mw or greater to reduce carbon dioxid emissions in two phases 1 capping emissions at 2006 levels by 2009 and 2 further reducing emissions to 2001 levels

httpwwwepagovglobalwarmingpublicationscarindexhtml2013 the program would be implemented thr ough tradeable allowance program and would include significant penalties for noncompliance using the 2002 climate action report8 car for projections to the year 2010 table 1 compares estimates of us gree nhouse gas emissions for s 139 s 366 and s 843 as indicated in table 1 although s 366 only addresses carbon dioxide emissions from electric generating facilities its reductions would be deeper and occur earlier than those estimated for the other bills advocates of the senate bills described bove believe that the failure of voluntary programs to rrest the rise in us greenhouse gas emissions during the 1990s under the previous bush and clinton administrations does not bode well for the future effectiveness of the cu rrent administration s voluntary program it should be noted that through 20102012 none of the proposals would be sufficient to reduce us emissions to the voluntary level agreed to under the unfccc phase two of s 139 has 2016 reduction requi rement for affected sources in line with the emissions target set under the unfccc return to 1990 levels however as noted earlier it is expected that the bills sponsors will am end s 139 to eliminate this second phase table 1 year 2010 comparison of proposed legislation percentage change relative to business as usual 2010percentage
