6507c27 shspec65 stages of release one of the interesting things about releases is that we have been making them for years and auditors have been going on by them running more processes there were probably releases being made in 1951 from 1957 on when lrh made lots of keyedout clears at an acc the 19th american acc 6jan14feb58 tech bulletins vol iii p 204 auditors should have observed what was happening the longer they cleaned cleans the more upset the pc became in exoneration they didnt realize that it is not ok to run process beyond floating needle this goes from ground zero to clear our main problem is overrun if someone got an fn on selfanalysis it would be goof to run more recalltype processes the first level of the case is recognition of the environment so if you asked person to look around and spot where he was and the needle floated you cant run any cchs or if you got an fn on the first objective process the rest of them are null and void if you go on you are cleaning clean this is the groundwork for quickie grades even on power if the needle floats even if the expected ep isnt there you end off fortunately you can run the rest of the power processes but when one process goes free thats it for that process our main problem is overrun this has happened many times to lrh lrh says he was overrun so much that he must have been running other peoples banks r6 is the exception to ending off when you get an fn because all other processes deal with keyout of the r6 bank whereas r6 is total erasure this doesnt apply to gpms when you get an fn you cant contact them and you are in trouble r6 is the only process which is dealing with total erasure all others deal with locks on r6 the levels ultimately begin with the reactive bank theres just the guy and the possibility that he could get aberrated on top of that the r6 bank is built and then on top of that is built tremendous accumulation that we know as end words and on top of those is erected whole series of whole track incidents and other types of gpms known as implants see fig 28 the latter prevented permanent releases by restimulating the original bank the r6 bank engrams are among and on top of implant gpms secondaries are on top of those with locks on the top engrams are restimulations of endwords endwords are restimulations of the r6 bank the whole trick in running r6ew is to get only endwords not to pick up r6 material itself surrounding the lot is the physical universe which could also be considered sort of bank figure 28 structure of the bank graphics inserted what you are doing with pc is carving away at this stack of stuff it contains significances and masses spaces and energies it is also plotted against time but that is all there is in it the machinery and circuits in it are just combinations of energies and significances and as such they are just special case of the above this combination of energies and significances comprises mass that sits there in its own madeup space plotted against the pcs experiential track known as time there is nothing else in the bank although the bank says there is freud and psychoanalysis were popular because they had more r6 in their technologies than other systems they had some written endwords on which they were basing everything by transference freud meant that the pc flipped into another valence the freudians recognized recovery in terms of release of affect by which they meant an emotional discharge especially grief they didnt recognize other emotions besides grief nor did they recognize underlying engrams all anyone has ever been trying to do when he was sincerely trying to help somebody with his mind was reduce the effect of this thing called the reactive mind or the subconscious mind or the unconscious mind upon the individual himself there are many such psychotherapies on the whole track if anyone discovered scientology by himself he probably freed himself and took off there is trace of such an occurrence in the bank however there are many instances on the track where people attacked the gpms of the r6 bank chewed an item or two out or crushed one or some such they would take picture of the area where someone had been and hit big clapstick in front of the photograph to make it look like it exploded they did this when the thetan was anaten or comatose the thetan would get the idea and take his own picture of his misemotional or painful experience and smack it with couple of beams and snap out of it that is what psychotherapy was in the galactic confederacy there were also suppressive technologies which are easily mistaken for helpful technologies implanters developed techniques to have effects on people there are many technologies calculated to have an effect on people when suppressive studies scientology he does so from the viewpoint of trying to have an effect on someone the sp evaluates his action as an auditor by how much effect it had on the pc not by whether it made the pc better the whole subject of alchemy was devoted to throwing the whole r6 level into restimulation throwing the guy into his r6 bank and letting the guy cook thereafter the alchemists had other goal their books writings and practices make it obvious it was the lead of human beings that they wanted to transmute into the gold of spirit transmutation of metals had nothing to do with alchemy it was transmutation of life that they were talking about their books are full of r6 dichotomies if you get one of the guys who has been into alchemy on power and all that comes off is dichotomies he has been plowed into r6 since time immemorial you will have to find the practice that got him into it and fish him out hypnotism is another practice that is only intended to make people more compliant not to better them you have to wake people up to make them better not put them to sleep you dont want suggestibility you want selfdeterminism some states on the whole track had thought tower to pick up hostile thoughts and record them so that the person indulging in crimethink would be turned in for brainwashing this is swindle there never was such thing person was implanted with that idea and placed under compulsion to report to the police if he had bad thought there was another idea on the whole track for controlling thetans you would take piece of thetan and keep it in lab if the thetan escaped they would touch the piece of thetan with hot rods this was also swindle the rule still holds that processing pc who is determined to succumb wont work because there isnt enough agreement in the session that is why you have an argument with hypnotists your purpose is different from theirs the common denominator of suppressive technologies is lies the common denominator of good technology is truth the whole test of sincerity is is the fellow doing what he says hes doing or is he doing something else these two questions have to be answered about any government movement or individual is there falsity on the line all these downgrade subjects have falsity on the line they say they are trying to make people well but their statistics show what is really occurring people assume that the psychiatrist is there to help the person and he isnt its an apparency as mentioned above the question is with psychiatry in charge is the world saner their stats are not just down they are runaway down since psychiatry has entered the field of criminology crime is fabulously on the increase theres falsity on the line what you understand hes doing is not what hes doing psychiatric research is done by deepsixing every scrap of data that doesnt agree with the theory being pushed if you tried that in engineering bridges and buildings would collapse but if some scientist is telling you oh well you have to be very learned to know about this you may swallow it if you are not careful this is also true in the field of art as an auditor you know that when the pc finds and articulates the problem it blows saying that it is something else wont do it so you see that the basic crime in this universe isnt making or destroying things it is altering truth any subject has few alterises in it otherwise it would just disappear but how many alterises does it have that is the question if it has many it will harm instead of helping people it will prove to be striving to create effects on people subjects with lot of alteris are harmful and subjects with relatively little alteris are helpful evil practices are identified by the falsity that is connected with them the worse off pc is the more he thinks hes got in his mind he gets on an additive line he collects and accumulates therapies like pack rat the medical student who gets every disease he reads about is on an additive line and in the direction of additive we actually approach evil on the direction of subtraction we approach good therefore scientology is based on truth the isness not the alterisness is what we care about it is what is in the mind not why is it in the mind cleaning clean brings about the manifestations of evil because since theres not anything there to be cleaned the pc has to put something there you are therefore adding it is adding because there is nothing there to be cleaned therefore the pc and the auditor have to put something there before anything will happen there are only five or six kinds of things in the mind when you are out of one of them you have to put something there to run it out there is reactive mind with certain elements when you have disconnected the pc from that class of element he has ceased to be an effect of it and you can regard it as gone the r6 gpms wont disappear by someone changing his mind or postulates because the r6 bank is tangle of boobytrapped postulates there wouldnt be anything else in the mind if the r6 bank werent there there would be thing or isness pc gets full blanks time track with solid locks because it all relates somehow to some secondary or engram somewhere on the track you start with the r6 bank then on top of it you get wogginess and wooziness on the subject of postulates he accumulates r6ew locks then his own goals as locks get stacked up on this and implants are overlaid on top of this then you get whole track engrams then secondaries then locks eventually with time when the thetan finally became human everything was lock on something earlier in the bank and he made picture of it yesterday runs like an engram he couldnt look at anything in the universe right now without it hanging up on some experience hes had that he didnt like theres the bank so the thetan gets full time track the thetan is also surrounded by the physical universe which gives him problems additionally there are other peoples universes which are different experientially this can also give him ptp that doesnt have anything to do with mental image picture or reactive bank but it can restimulate the reactive bank and thus be harder to solve ptp can exist as such independent of the bank if you get your hand caught in clothes wringer it is ptp it doesnt necessarily have anything to do with the bank the fact that thetans attention is stuck on ptp keeps him from putting his attention on anything else so he makes gain you can usually handle the problem on the basis that it is problem because he doesnt think he can handle it he has entered lie into it so he doesnt try to do anything about it so it continues to be problem the lie in problem is 1 that it exists and is problem or 2 that one can do nothing about it to handle it if the auditor could get the pc to confront the problem to take it apart and get its elements and take the lies out of the problem the pc could probably confront it and it would cease to be problem however the problem isnt necessarily entirely in the pcs mind every time an arc break is situation where the pc feels under some sort of attack from an unknown source in its inception an arc break is actually an incomplete cycle of action in all likelihood there is some big lie entered into it but the main upset is that the pc couldnt complete what he was doing pc isnt auditable when he is in an arc break because he cant put his attention on anything else it is presence of time that makes ptp as human beings all of us have to some degree an underthegun existence the amount of duress that person is under is proportionate to the degree that he thinks it threatens his survival you can tolerate quite bit of it unless you are on the skids already when the pc is upset the auditor cant get away with making mistakes when the pc is feeling good he can get away with some if you have managed to get the pc disconnected from his arc breaks ptps etc and then go on auditing him on them you are invalidating his ability to confront you are giving him the idea that he ought to be bothered by them when you see the fn dont give two more commands dont get him to itsa some more send him to the examiner let the pc have his win one more command and you are cleaning clean he is out of that outrud the connectors to the bank are gone in that area in trying to find an overrun after the fact youre looking in the goneness for the what wentness and youre looking through mass of it wasnt there anywayness afterwards release isnt just disconnected from the bank he has erased stratum of it in rehabbing you are getting rid of additives third stage release grade va leads the pc through the physical environment contact with the bank and ends up cutting off the r6ew top just going off the top of those floating endwords you can get the pc off of what pins him into those endwords you can just separate that each of the grade v and va processes is run to fn there are four processes on va one having to do with people one with where the pc has been etc power processing is very close to the truth therefore it must be run very standardly after running va there is nothing between the pc and the r6 bank itself now of course he can dive off the shade of this and he has protective coating between him and the r6 bank it stands there naked and raw hes got the r6ew spans that are lying in and amongst the gpms etc he can run those like shot r6ew can run to fn there is actually fourth stage release on r6ew running gpms one can go to fn thus getting fifth stage release by running gpms but these arent important the state of clear is what is important you dont want to go free of the body and leave some of the bank around to key in later in rehabbing you get the liability that you may find yourself working on the next stage up and the rehab process is not calculated to handle the next stage
