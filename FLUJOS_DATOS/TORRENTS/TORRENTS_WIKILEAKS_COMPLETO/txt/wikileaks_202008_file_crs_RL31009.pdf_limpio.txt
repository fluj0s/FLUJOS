total funding level of 1126 million consisting of 8437 million from fy2002 fee collections and 2823 million from carryover of prior year fees according to the conference report the fy2002 level falls below the administrations requested level due to the decrease in the filing of trademark applications since 1990 appropr iation measures have limited the patent and trademark offices use of the full amount of fees collected in each fiscal year this is an area of controversy opponents argue that since agency operations are supported by payments for services the total amount of these collections should be available to provide for those services in the year the expenses are incurred proponents of the current approach maintain that the fees are necessary to balance the budget and that the level of fees appropriated back to the uspto are sufficient to cover operating expenses8 for fy2002 president bush requested total of 3063 billion for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration

appropriations committee noted that the judiciarys budget request for fy2002 estimated that 226 million would be available in fee collections and carryover balances the committee stated that if additional nonappropriated funds became available in fy2002 either through savings in fiscal year 2001 or increased fee collections the committee expected the judiciary to apply these funds to its fy2002 financial plan to meet the highest priority needs of the courts also the house committee said it understood that the workload of the courts was continuing to escalate due largely to the expanding jurisdiction of the federal courts through legislation passed by the congress as well as to significant increases in funding provided to the department of justice in recent years for investigating and prosecuting crimes in fy2001 the committee noted it was able to fully fund the staffing needs of the courts for the first time in three years the committee cited approvingly the judiciarys allocation of staffing resources based on formulas recently updated by the administrative office of the us courts which according to the committee equitably allocated staff based on the

it said it expected the judiciary to allocate its fy2002 staffing resources using the formulas approved by the judicial conference 16 in its report on the senate cjs bill s 1215 the senate appropriations committee said it was concerned about increased plea bargaining limits on jury awards new powers of judges to screen evidence presented to jurors and the increasing number of jury verdicts being overturned by federal appeals courts these developments the committee said were diminishing the traditional role of the jury and were part of trend which promises to undermine individual confidence in the jury system and in the courts themselves the committee directed that the judiciarys study to be prepared by the administrative office of the us courts later than february 1 2002 include recommendations for judicial reform to ensure that juror and citizen confidence are not eroded 17 these mandatory adjustments included pay and benefit adjustments for federal defender organization personnel and funding for increased case representation workload of federal defender organizations and panel attorneys 18 more precisely the court requested 42114 million 123 increase over fy2001 funding while the house administration committee has approved 42066 million 121 increase most of the requested fy2002 increase represented base adjustments ie required increases in salary and benefit costs and inflationary increases in fixed costs in continuedlanguage requesting that the judiciary conduct study for the appropriations committees on whether changes in the jury system may be necessary16 for the judiciarys defender services account congress approved the house passed amount of 5007 million 153 increase over fy2001 funding of 4340 million earlier the senate had approved 4638 million 68 increase while the judiciary had requested 5215 million 201 increase the defender services account funds the operations of the federal public defender and community defender organizations and the compensation reimbursement and expenses of panel attorneys the latter are private practice attorneys appointed by the courts under the criminal justice act cja to serve as defense counsel to indigent individuals accused of federal crimes while most of the defender services increase requested by the judiciary consisted of mandatory adjustments to base17 351 million was sought to fund an increase in the rate of pay for panel attorneys to 113 an hour for fy2001 congress had funded hourly pay rates for panel attorneys of 75 incourt and 55 outofcourt in most locations which the judiciary said were well below the amounts the attorneys need just to cover their overhead costs in response housesenate conferees following the recommendation of both appropriations committees agreed on an fy2002 increase in panel attorney pay to 90 per hour both in and out of court effective later than may 1 2002 the budget request of the supreme court for fy2002 as customary was in two parts for its first account salaries and expenses congress as provided in the senate bill approved 400 million 66 increase over budget authority of 375 million for fy2001 earlier the court had requested and the house approved 421 million18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31009crs36 18 continued addition 22 million over base adjustments has been requested to fund eleven positions and three program increases with most of these increases related to technological improvements in automation and security 19 in its report the senate appropriations committee had noted disapprovingly that various offices theatre gift shop and mail handling have all been built out into the hallways of the court in direct violation of fire codes the courts expected renovation the committee continued would only exacerbate space problems for the foreseeable future therefore the committee said its recommendation defers staffing increases for the court until it is clear that there is room for additional personnel 20 separate from this 375 million appropriation it should be noted the supreme courts building and grounds account received 3125 million from the emergency response fund established by congress in response to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states see preceding discussion in this report under the heading the judiciarys response to the terrorist attacks 21 in prepared testimony before the house appropriations subcommittee on commerce justice and state on march 21 2001 justice anthony m kennedy explained that modernization of the building would include the installation of protective life safety systems such as fire detection and sprinklers and the ability to purge smoke from the building in the event of fire the mechanical electrical and plumbing systems are so out of date that disruptive and possibly dangerous system failure is more likely every year that the proposed modernization is postponed 22 in its report on hr 2500 the house appropriations committee stated that the court building has serious deficiencies in its life safety security mechanical electrical and plumbing systems these obsolete systems create the risk of an emergency to the health and safety of the justices the court staff the supreme court policy and the nearly one million visitors to the building each year to correct these deficiencies the architect has proposed the buildings first significant upgrade in its 65year history the committee believes that continuedin their report housesenate conferees directed that the court continue to provide the appropriations committees with information regarding the courts hiring practices in selecting law clerks and to make efforts to expand its pool of applicants in manner to ensure fairness in hiring the conference report however said it did not adopt language in the senate report regarding the containment of mandatory costs and additional personnel19 for the courts second account care of the building and grounds congress approved 375 million instead of 700 million as provided in the house bill and 75 million in the senate bill20 at the beginning of the appropriations process the court had requested 1177 million for this account 1102 million over fy2001 funding of 75 million the purpose of this extraordinary increase as requested was to modernize the courts building by upgrading its basic life safety security and utility systems this would be the first major renovation of the court building since its opening in 193521 the conference agreement while reducing the earlierapproved house amount by almost 50 adopted by reference language in the house report related to the security and renovation needs of the court building22 the conferees noted that theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31009crs37 22 continued each day this project is delayed dramatically increases the potential for the buildings outdated systems to fail placing human life and safety at risk as well as increasing the costs required to perform the necessary modernization 23 in its report the senate appropriations committee had completely rejected the courts requested increase for this account instead approving the fy2001 level of 75 million the committee said it favored retaining the fy2001 amount for fy2002 in order to fund the routine maintenance of existing building systems in anticipation of construction start in 2003 under revised building upgrade plan acceptable to the committee the committee explained that it was entirely supportive of the proposal to replace building systems which have been maintained long past the end of their useful service lives but that it was very concerned by the linchpin of the courts construction approach the digging out of an underground annex as swing space for displaced staff 24 the court had requested its 110 million increase for this account on onetime year basis rather than make the first of several annual funding requests to defray costs incurred as the renovation proceeded while not agreeing to the full amount of the judiciarys request the house appropriations committee in its report said that budget authority was being made available until the appropriated amount was expended to give the architect of the capitol maximum flexibility in structuring the building renovation contract 25 separate from this 2207 million appropriation it should be noted the court security account received 772 million from the emergency response fund established by congress in response to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states see preceding discussion in this report under the heading the judiciarys response to the terrorist attacks 26 the amount requested for fy2002 the judiciary said in its budget submission would make possible the replacing of inadequate and outdated court security equipment and fund court security officers for new buildings 27 in its report on hr 2500 the house appropriations committee noted that language in the bill clarified the current responsibilities of the court security program to provide protective guard service for united states courthouses the installation and maintenance of security equipment in all buildings housing judiciary operations and the inspection of mail and packagesagreement did not include language in the senate report regarding building renovations23 the conference report also noted that the entire amount of 375 million shall remain available until expended24 congress also approved 2207 million in funding for the judiciarys court security account 108 increase over fy2001 budget authority of 1991 million25 the house and senate bills respectively had provided 2244 million and 2098 million while the judiciary had requested 2284 million26 the house senate conference report said that it adopted language in the house bill and report clarifying the responsibilities of the court security program27 congress also authorized as requested by the judiciary costofliving increase in judges and justicess salaries and appropriated 86 million for that purposehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31009crs38 28 in its report on hr 2500 the house appropriations committee said the bill deferred without prejudice the proposed salary adjustment for federal justices and judges 29 although the senate judiciary committees cjs bill as reported was silent on the issue the senate on september 10 2001 adopted an amendment to its version of hr 2500 which among other things provided for costofliving pay adjustment for judges the provision was part of an amendment introduced by senators ernest f hollings and judd gregg which the senate approved by voice vote making various technical and clarifying corrections to the bill 30 the salary adjustment effective january 2002 increased the annual salaries of article iii judges as follows for chief justice of the united states from 186300 to 192600 for associate justices of the supreme court from 178300 to 184400 for us courts of appeals judges from 153900 to 159100 and for us district court judges and judges on the us court of international trade from 145100 to 150000 31 in addition to securing an eci adjustment in judicial salaries for fy2002 the judiciary called for but as of this reports writing failed to persuade congress to make more sweeping changes affecting judicial pay rates and the process for setting future pay levels for judges specifically at the start of the 107th congress the judiciary urged congress to make future costofliving adjustments for judges automatic authorize presidential commission to periodically advise the congress and the president on appropriate compensation for government officials and enact legislation giving judges and other high level federal officials catchup pay adjustment of 96 to recapture previous lost eci adjustments ie adjustments over the last decade which congress did not statutorily authorize congress had authorized eci costofliving increases in judges and justices salaries for fiscal years 2001 2000 1998 and 1993 but not for 1999 or 1994 through 1997 32 during debate on their respective fy2002 treasury appropriations bills the house and senate declined to adopt amendments which would have denied pay adjustment for members of congress and executive officials while the house bill declined to authorize judicial pay adjustment28 such provision in the senatepassed bill29 was approved in conference paving the way for judicial pay increase based on the employment cost index eci of 34 effective january 200230 the judiciary had called for pay adjustment for judges in its fy2002 budget submission to congress judiciary compensation it was argued lagged far behind both inflation and the increasing salaries of private attorneys with judges purchasing power having declined by over 13 over the past eight years31 the cjs conference agreement on pay adjustment for federal judges and justices was reached against the backdrop of an imminent 2002 calendar year costof living pay increase for members of congress and executive branch officials annual costofliving adjustments for the latter are automatic effective january of each year as provided by the ethics reform act of 1989 unless congress adopts language barring particular annual adjustment from taking effect by january 1 2002 legislation had been enacted to withhold the pay adjustment32 in contrast to automatic costofl iving pay adjustments for members of congress and executive branch officials an annual pay increase for judges must be specifically authorized by congress and the legislative vehicle for that authorization in recent years has been the cjsjudiciary appropriations bill at time since judicial pay adjustments have required statutory authorization have judges received lower pay adjustments than members of congress and executive branch officials hence in keeping with thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31009crs39 33 see pay section under federal personnel issues in us library of congress congressional research service appropriations for fy2002 treasu ry postal service executive office of the president and general government by sharon s gressle crs report rl31002 washington jan 16 2002 34 specifically the judicial conference had requested the addition of 6 permanent and 4 temporary court of appeals judgeships and 23 permanent and 21 temporary district court judgeships 35 although giving the judiciary far fewer new judgeships than had been requested congress included in the judiciarys fy2001 appropriations title the creation of ten new district judgeships prior to that in the judiciarys fy2000 appropriations title congress created nine new district judgeshipscustom the conferees action on the fy2002 cjs appropriations bill as enacted allowed costofliving pay increases for justices and judges to keep apace with those for members of congress and executive branch officials33 also without requesting fy2002 funding for this purpose the judiciary called for the creation of 54 article iii judgeshipsjudgeships created under article iii of the constitution and having lifetime as opposed to fixedterm appointments34 the judiciary noted that since congress last enacted major judgeship bill in 199035 increases in federal jurisdiction and law enforcement resources had contributed to more than 25 increase in the workload of the federal courts however increased judgeships ultimately were not provided for by congress in hr 2500 as enacted nor

noncriminal cases the lsc has been controversial since its inception in the early 1970s and has been operating without authorizing legislation since 1980 there have been ongoing debates over the adequacy of funding for the agency and the extent to which certain types of activities are appropriate for federally funded legal aid attorneys to undertake in annual appropriations laws congress traditionall has included legislative provisions restricting the activities of lscfunded grantees such as prohibiting representation in certain types of cases or conducting any lobbying activities pl

for basic field programs 124 million for management and administration 44 million for client selfhelp and information technology and 25 million for the inspector general the budget request also continued all restrictions on lscfunded activities currently in effect the administrations fy2002 request for lsc 3293 million was the same as the amount currently obligated for the program for fy2001 historically the corporations highest level of funding was 400 million in fy1994 and fy1995 for fy2002 the house and senate also recommended total of 3293 for lsc and included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees in carrying out lscs vision of an effective and efficient statewide system of delivering legal services to the poor grantees have been merging and reconfiguring their legal services programs to better use every federal dollar allocated to them the house committee report indicated concern about the lsc overruling without appeal certain configurations implemented by grantees via the state planning process the house committee report directed the lsc to review the state planning process and the concerns raised and report back to the committee by september 4 2001 with proposal that includes input from the stakeholders that outlines the reconfiguration standards and the process for states to appeal lscs decisions41 pl 10777

fy2002 included 310 million for basic field programs 124 million for management and administration 44 million for client selfhelp and information technology and 25 million for the inspector general pl 10777 also included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees equal empl oyment opportunity commission eeoc the commission enforces laws banning employment discrimination based on race color national origin sex age or disability the eeocs workload has increased dramatically since the agency first was created under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 passage of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and the civil rights act of 1991 as well as employees growing awareness of their rights have made it difficult for the agencys budget and staffing resources to keep pace with its heightened caseload congress approved 279 million for the agencys fy1999 budget an increase of 37 million the following year the appropriation rose minimally to 282 million although the commission received 21 million more for fy2001 303 million the increase was about half of that requested by the clinton administration nonethelesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31009crs51 42 the house and senatepassed amounts both included 2188 million in offsetting regulatory fees as requested by the commission while the house provided for direct appropriation of 198 million and the senate approved direct appropriation of 338 million 43 the fcc request consisted of 2188 million in offsetting regulatory fees and direct appropriation of 298 million 44 the house committee said it hoped the commission would take greater steps toward carrying out its responsibilities under title 18 of the us code section 1464 the procedures developed by the fcc for addressing obscene indecent or profane language by continuedthe funding increases of the last few years enabled the eeoc to cut by 69 the backlog of private sector charges from high of 111000 in mid1995 and reduce the average processing time for private sector charges to 216 days the latter was largely due to the commissions expanded use of alternative dispute resolution procedures eg mediation president bush requested 3104 million for fy2002 an increase of 72 million to allow the agency to further enhance its record in its private sector program and make improvements in its federal sector program among other things the house approved the presidents request for 3104 million to fund the eeoc the house committee directed the commission to continue reducing the backlog of private sector discrimination charges and continue at least its current spending level 18 million on contract mediation which is in addition to the mediation performed by eeoc staff it expressed concern about the still high level of these charges and expects the agency to exceed the small 6 backlog reduction that was assumed in the administrations budget request the senate version of cjs provided the same level of funding3104 millionas requested by the administration and passed by the house for the eeoc congress enacted that level for eeoc in fy2002 commission on civil rights the commission collects and studies information on discrimination or denials of equal protection of the laws it received an appropriation of 89 million in fy2001 and fy2000 the presidents request for fy2002 called for slight increase to 91 million the house and the senate agreed to provide the administrations request which congress enacted federal communication s commission fcc the fcc is an independent agency charged with regulation of interstate and foreign communication by means of radio television wire cable and satellite for fy2002 congress approved total funding for the fcc of 2451 million 68 increase over fy2001 resources of 2295 million the amount enacted was 65 million more than the 2386 million approved by the house and 75 million less than the senate bill amount of 2525 million42 of the 2451 million total 2188 million is to be derived from offsetting fee collections as provided in both the house and senate bills resulting in net direct appropriation of 263 million the commission had requested 2485 million in total funding an 83 increase over fy2001 resources43 in their report housesenate conferees reiterated concerns expressed earlier by both appropriations committees about the declining standards of broadcast televison and the impact of this decline on americass children44 the confereeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31009crs52 44 continued means of radio communication the committee said are cumbersome and reactive only the committee at the same time commended recent fcc efforts to take more aggressive stance in curbing an assault of obscene matter over the airwaves while remaining cognizant of the constitutional rights of our citizens in similar vein the senate appropriations committee expressed its concern about the declining standards of broadcast television and the impact this decline is having on americas children the committee referred to an analysis of all primetime programming which it said had found tripling in overall sexual content foul language and violence over the past decade the commit tee directed the fcc to continue to report to congress on the issues associated with resurrecting broadcast industry code of conduct for content of programming that if adhered to by the broadcast industry would protect against the further erosion of broadcasting standards 45 the purpose of this effort the conference report said would be to reestablish the engineering preeminence of the commission which must be more fluent in technology than the entities it regulates the conferees recommend that the commission establish means by which colleges and universities may submit proposals to advance cooperative efforts towards excellence in engineering the conferees directed the commission before taking any action in this regard to first submit report to the house and senate appropriations committeesadded that they expected the fcc to continue in its efforts to address these concerns the conferen ce agreement said that it did not include senate report language which had recommended 4 million for the commissions excellence in engineering program instead the conferees recommended that the fcc pursue modified approach to an excellence in engineering effort45 in keeping with the requirements of the government performance and results act the fcc as part of its fy2002 budget request set forth its overall mission and general and specific goals for fiveyear time frame federal maritime commission fmc the fmc regulates large part of the waterborne foreign commerce of the united states the administration requested 165 million for the fmc for fy2002 1 million more than congress appropriated in fy 2001 the house appropriations committee recommended 155 million which was equal to the amount enacted for fy 2001 and 1 million less than the presidents request the housepassed bill approved the committees recommendations the senate committee on appropriations recommended 175 million which was about 2 million more than congress appropriated in fy 2001 and 1 million more than the presidents request the senatepassed bill approved the committees recommendations the conference agreement provided 165 million for the fmc equal to the administrations request the federal trade commission ftc the ftc an independent agency is responsible for enforcing number of federal antitrust and consumer protection laws in recent years the ftc has used premerger filing fees collected under the hartscottrodino act to entirely fund its operations zero 0 direct appropriations have been required httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31009crs53 for fy2001 the administra tion requested an increase in the ftcs program level from 125 million to 1646 million the fy2001 request included 7 million derived from estimated fy2000 carryover fee balances and an anticipated 1576 million from premerger filing fees therefore as was the case the previous year for fy2001 the ftc requested net direct appropriation the house appropriations committee recommended cjs appropriation of 1348 million for the agency for fy2001 that request included 137 million derived from estimated fy2000 carryover fee balances and an anticipated 1211 million for premerger filing fees the house bill mirrored the committees recommendation the senate appropriations committee recommended program level for the agency for fy2001 of 1595 million to be derived exclusively from the collection of premerger filing fees the conference agreement approved by congress in december 2000 included total operating level of 1472 million for the ftc for fy2001 the conference agreement assumed that of the amount provided 1453 million would be derived from fees collected in fy2001 and 19 million would be derived from estimated unobligated fee collections available from fy2000 these actions resulted in final direct appropriation of zero 0 for fy2002 the administration requested program level of 1563 million for the ftc an increase of 91 million over the current year appropriation all of the funding would come from offsetting collections derived from fees collected for pre merger filings during fy2002 so as to result in final direct appropriation of zero 0 the house approved slightly smaller funding level 156 million the senate passed bill recommended 1563 million this amount too would be entirely derived from fees collected by the agency congress provided the ftc with 156 million for fy2002 securities and exchange commission sec the sec administers and enforces federal securities laws in order to protect investors and to maintain fair and orderly stock and bond markets the sec collects fees on various securities market transactions in recent years these collections have exceeded the agencys budget by wide margin legislation before the 107th congress s 143 and hr 1088 proposed reducing these fees in 2000 congress approved total operating level of 4228 million for the sec for fy2001 an increase of 550 million over fy2000 the figure was comprised of 1278 million in offsetting fee collections for fy2001 and 295 million in fy1999 collections the result direct appropriations were required for the agency for fy2001 for fy2002 the administration requested total operating level of 4379 million for the sec an increase of 151 million over fy2001 as was the case in fy2001 direct appropriations would be needed instead the sec would be funded entirely by current and prior year fee collectionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31009crs54 46 in its fy2002 budget submission to congress the institute stated that the financial assistance it provided is an especially appropriate form of federal assistance because it enables all 50 state court systems as well as the federal courts to benefit from the innovations and improvements made in any one states court system the institutes grants spark those innovations and transfer information about them to every other court system in the country federal agency can match the scope of the institutes authority and state can fulfill its national mission 47 the presidents budget request stated that appropriations for sji in fy2002 were intended to provide for continuation of institute operations at reduced level appendix budget of the united states government fiscal year 2002 p 1222the house approved sec spending at the level of the administrations request 4379 million of which 1095 million would come from

other activities to further the development of judicial administration in state courts throughout the united states under the terms of its enabling legislation sji is authorized to present its request directly to congress apart from the presidents budget the institute requested 150 million for fy2002 more than double its fy2001 funding amount of 6835 million46 congress however scaled back the sji appropriation for fy2002 significantly approving 30 million instead of 6835 million and 62 million approved by the house and senate respectively separate from the institutes request the president had requested the same funding amount for sji as appropriated for fy20016835 million47 the conference report stated that the 30 million appropriated for the sji is available for fiscal year 2002 only and that the conferees did not recommend continued federal support for the institute beyond fy2002 the termination of funding for this program the report explained does not necessarily mean the dissolution of the institute the conferees encourage the institute to solicit private donations and resources from state and local agencies office of the us trade representative ustr ustr is located
