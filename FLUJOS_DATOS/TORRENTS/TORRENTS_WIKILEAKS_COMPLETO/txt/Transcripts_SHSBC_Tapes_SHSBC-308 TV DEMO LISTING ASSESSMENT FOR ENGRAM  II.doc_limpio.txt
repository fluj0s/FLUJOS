tv demo listing assessment for engram running part ii an auditing demonstration given on 27 june 1963 okay here we are on 27th of june 1963 almost didnt remember it without you to tell and surprise here todayim going to finish up this demonstration on the preliminary step of mr and as you know we already had list and we listed this list more or less to clean needle may have to add to it but maybe not and we will carry on from that point now the listing step as you can see is not dissimilar to any of the other listings that we have been doing my only fear is that somebody will get big protest or the rudiments madly out on the pc through very complicated sessioning and do one of these eightyninepage lists down to god help us but in some cases it may be necessary to do rather long list all right so there it is lrh okay move ahead little bit there good thank you all right is it all right if we audit in this room pc yes yes lrh very good pick up the cans all right tone arm seems to be up here higher than we had yesterday pc i think i was bit harassed yesterday getting the tv room ready by the time lrh hm pc i was quite bit harassed yesterday getting the tv room ready and chasing around on it i had to do that so lrh all right pc without any comfort lrh okay all right squeeze the cans thank you your havingness is up all right now what were going to do here is complete this assessment on r3r which we did yesterday okay pc all right lrh all right so is it all right with you if i begin this session now pc yes lrh okay start of session all right session started for you pc yes lrh okay what goals would you like to set for this session pc well to complete the list quickly if necessary to work well not get in the way of the assessment lrh yes pc feel the benefit of the session at the end of it lrh okay very good got those all right now im going to d 0 my missed withhold step here because were going to be assessing pc mmhm lrh all right have i missed withhold on you all right may have pc oh yes um yeah it was in the oh yes it was to do with an auditing folder you looked at today and you said that the instructions hadnt been carried out carefully lrh oh yes pc but i was responsible for the instructions not being carried out carefully because i misled the auditor slightly by suggesting this was what he should do lrh i see pc and i didnt say anything to you at the time lrh oh all right very good pc i just let it go lrh okay all right have i missed withhold on you well there seems to be some disturbance on this pc this is to do with uh what i thought of then was um the man you were talking about downstairs at work um i just wondered whether wondered what you thought about my using him lrh hm pc as you know didnt know whether you were really pleased about that or not lrh all right okay all right have i missed withhold on you well it bangs on missed withhold what about missed withhold just in general just the idea of missed withhold protest pc possibly that um uhm i think this is situation that im in peculiar situ auditing situation that im in inasmuch as being an instructor out on the course that there are certain withholds one has from the students and uh that one you know dont want to bring them up and i think that is possibly might be bit concerned and why im protesting and worrying about that lrh all right very good very good all right missed withholds missed withholds yes theres something about missed withholds im talking now not about what missed withholds youve got pc uhhuh lrh but some upset perhaps connected with just missed withholds any upset connected with them not that you have particularly but just pc well i know it might be that on sessions that ive had before that ive known missed withholds have been around and i didnt want to spill them on the on the air lrh uhhuh pc not so much that i wouldnt tell you about them but that uh possibly committing overts in the session in doing it you see lrh i see i see all right i got that now now let check this question here again itll probably be all right have i missed withhold on you well i do have tick here you get what the question is its have i missed withhold on you pc yes i do im looking too um lrh there there pc well that i was thinking of the um track map that iyou know the track map i showed you today lrh uhhuh pc the only thing i thought of was i suggested doing this on continuous roll of paper and you suggested doing it on cylinder do you lrh umhm pc and i didnt know whether you had thought that id thought of the cylinder or whether you hadnt really understood that id suggested it on continuous roll of paper lrh uhhuh pc the cylinder was the better idea and uh thats all i thought of there lrh all right very good have i missed withhold on you oh this is getting into heavy wire here the thing is ticking there pc hm lrh there there pc well ive only seen you little since our last session i mean it was clean presume it was clean last night lrh yeah pc so um i only saw you for lrh there there pc well i was thinking of when i came in just now and uh you and nick had had coke and i hadnt and uh i dont think that theres i wasnt upset about it i just thoughtand lrh all right pc i dont know what the missed withhold what you missed there actually i was wondering i know i was wondering whether you were going to offer one and uh i thought well i dont really want one just now before i go up for session and uh i just wondered whether youd noticed it i suppose thats the only thing i could think of there lrh all right pc if that would make the meter bang i dont know lrh all right okay all right very good well get you one after the session pc thank you lrh okay now let ask you this question again and make sure its clean have i missed withhold on you well it dirties up the needle is there some fear or anxiety here theres an anxiety pc hm lrh all right on this question is there anything youve been anxious about pc well im anxious that it doesnt hold up the session and uh so on lrh uhhm pc actually what i thought of was that uh well i came up to get the session ready lrh uhhuh pc and uh i checked over it and i thought you got everything you want wanted and then blow down you want some paper you see at the end and i wondered whether you thought id been lax in not seeing youd got some paper to write on i did go and get you some auditors re orts that i p noticed you hadnt got lrh all right all right very good all right have i missed withhold on you bang pc well its these cans again then i brought these cans up theyre different from the ones i had last night lrh yes pc and when you said the uh um when you said the uh meter was reading was different i thought perhaps the cans had made it different you know that theyd been lrh oh i see pc different cans lrh i get you i get you all right okay have i missed withhold on you still bangs pc well i feel lrh is this question being protested yes pc i feel particularly clean i dont im sure youre lrh when did you start protesting the question pc i think i started at the beginning of the session when you said you were going to start pulling the missed withhold my thought then was well perhaps its the list that is make roughing up the needle and not not uh the missed withhold lrh oh all right very good all right does the missed withhold have to do with the list seems to be all right have i missed withhold on you ive still got bang there there pc well that is that i in the session yesterday i was saying that i didnt get many withhold many decisions that i didnt carry out since just our in between sessions ive thought about this and there have and i have realized theres quite number of decisions that i havent carried out lrh oh pc and just before the session began i think i was sitting here and these came to mind you see and its the sort of thing i was going to tell you was that that i thought would probably come up well ive often downstairs somethings happened you see on the course im going to see ron about it ill do this that and the other and ill decide to do all this you see mock up everything im going to do and then of course the next time few hours has elapsed the thing is all sorted out and theres nothing to it anyway and i dont so i sort of decide theres another decision not to do that lrh i see pc but it was bit of withhold inasmuch as you would not know i sort of get into this state sometimes and try not to take you by storm lrh all right very good okay let check this question again have i missed withhold on you all right thats clean okay pc good lrh all right very good now we have this list here and im going to go into this now pc uhhuh lrh and what we had here was question in this lifetime what have you decided all right and i thought this list was probably complete and i see now that the question bangs pc uhhuh lrh so why dont you give just few more items here in this lifetime what have you decided pc well heres one that i that was complained to that i hadnt decided that i deci i decided to live with jenny in the saints this was complained about its probably the missed withhold as well probably missed withhold lrh all right pc um well ive decided not to row with people lrh ye s pc to um decided um to take things in their stride lrh all right pc um to accept things as they are decided to um handle problems decided not to solve every problem that not to solve every problem that came along uh decided not to overfinance my children lrh not to pc overfinance my children lrh good pc um lrh good pc oh yes decided to yeah see decided to use uh to use smiles thats right lrh good pc uh this is one i made in the first job was decided to have clean collar and clean pair of shoes always this was um bit of advice that manager gave it was quite good actually because you do that and the rest of you seems to get tidied up decided to audit to run to play table tennis to take m organ to party perhaps somebody will ask to play it lrh oh dear pc oh dear lrh all right pc um decided i dont know if this counts really but decided that i was bad handwriter these seem to be real they dont seem to be dreams but anyway decided that i was shy lrh all right pc decided i couldnt uh talk in public and decided i could talk in public decided i was more able than most conceited pup um decided that i was right um more often than i was wrong in business and then earlier on this makes it sound silly with what ive just given you decided not to be conceited lrh okay pc want some more lrh well yeah in this lifetime what have you decided pc yes uh decided uh that when i had nothing to say to say it decided to go camping decided to be an analytical chemist once decided um that um on the whole people are honest decided i didnt like bathing swimming in that sense decided to play golf at an early age i decided to do something about making the world better place to live in decided i was good teacher and also decided to teach decided to um go on bscn course and scientology courses anyway would cover that i once decided to build radio set lrh okay how are you doing pc all right lrh let get the brief mid ruds in there on this question pc all right lrh all right on this question has anything been suppressed yes pc well what i suppressed was i said i gave you decided to audit and uh there was decision before that not to audit particular individual and then decided to audit i suppressed that lrh mmhm pc um i dont get anything else in the way of suppressing anything in the session lrh all right ill check the question on this question has anything been suppressed its equivocal on this question has anything been suppressed apparently not on this question is there anything youve been careful of yes pc ive been very careful to give everything that came up and sometimes i suppose ive given unnecessary ones but anything thats come up ive given you lrh all right very good on this question is there anything youve been careful of all right thats clean on this question is there anything youve failed to reveal yes pc ive failed to reveal peoples names sometimes lrh all right on this question is there anything youve failed to reveal all right latent is there anything youd care to say about it pc just wondered whether it was clean lrh all right very good on this question has anything been invalidated yes pc probably invalidated jenny by bringing that one up the first uh the first question ifirst decision i gave you today lrh all right very good on this question has anything been invalidated all right its latent pc i was just thinking then about uh i was saying i was conc i gave you one and said i was conceited that was invalidating myself to some extent lrh oh all right on this question has anything been invalidated all right thats clean on this question has anything been suggested yes pc well that answer the first answer was suggested to out of session by jenny lrh oh all right all right on this question has anything been suggested all right that seems clean on this question has mistake been made yes pc uh i wondered where the im not quite sure what the um actual meaning of the word decide is i was trying i did come across this when i was giving you decided thats instead of decided to lrh mmmm pc looking at it i thought well in both cases its sort of making up ones mind either about something or to do something lrh hmmm pc but i was just wondering whether i was mistaken in doing the answering the question on the rather about rather than to do lrh very good all right on this question has mistake been made yes another one pc i made mistake yesterday by uh going getting something off outside of this lifetime lrh all right okay on this question has mistake been made another one pc i cant think of one lrh question being protested yes pc is it i hadnt realized i hadnt realized i was protesting the question lrh all right let check this again on this question has mistake been made there is mistake pc the only thing i can say is that one answer ive given you must have been mistake but i cant recall the actual question or the actual answer lrh all right very good on this question has mistake been made weve roughed it up here am i cleaning clean in some way do you think there must have been mistake pc well its the only thing im groping there i cant i cant see how mistake could be made im find having difficulty finding out how mistake could be made on this question it could only be in my answer i dont think youd have given the question wrong or made mistake lrh oh all right very good let check the question again on this question has mistake been made is this question being protested pc its being puzzled about lrh being puzzled about all right pc new rudiment for you lrh okay on this question has mistake been made were going to leave that it uh was much cleaner that time pc mmhm lrh were just going to leave that not worry you to death with it ill recover it if necessary on this question has anything been protested yes pc possibly protesting the length its going on it seems to be going on theres lot more items coming out and uh i decided there shouldnt be many more items lrh all right pc that was decision that was lrh all right on this question has anything been protested all right thats clean on this question is there anything youve been anxious about apparently pc anxious about the number of items answers im giving and whether im i was answering correctly lrh all right on this question is there anything youve been anxious about all right i didnt get read then now on this question has anything been decided yes like mad pc well its been deciding well i decided to give you some of these other form ofform of answer to the question lrh oh i see all right on this question has anything been decided looks clean all right now lets check the two that we messed up on here on this question is there anything youve failed to reveal yes pc oh i did s lrh there pc well i didnt go into detail on uh some of some of the answers i gave you i didnt go into detail on what sort of thing i was coming to storm into your office protesting vigorously lrh all right okay on this question is there anything youve failed to reveal all right i didnt get read that time this thing seems to still be hot pc uhhuh lrh question seems to be hammering here is there something wrong with this question question reads just the word question all by itself not taking up interim minor thoughts pc mmm lrh but thats whats dirtying up these rudiments here what about question there it is pc well the only thing i thought of then is perhaps fin not sure exactly what the question means um does the question mean the question on the question is uh is it decisions to do or decisions about is it case case of what opinions has one formed or what has one decided to do lrh mmhm pc thats the only thing that i could question on the question as it were lrh all right all right question question still little bing here now we wont worry about that i have business doing this i could bad form pc all right lrh im trying to get this clean if i can all right on this question is there anything youve failed to reveal there is failed to reveal pc well um lrh there pc well there must be lots of decisions that i havent revealed to you lrh uhhuh pc to answer the question some possibly i dont think ive monitored my answers very much but possibly some minor things that ive done some of them seem ridiculous things to put on the list anyway that i havent given you lrh ahhh pc and uh so on and i was just wondering you know lrh that cleaned it pc all right lrh all right on this question is there anything youve failed to reveal all right equivocal on this question is there anything youve failed to reveal and now i roughed it up by saying it was equivocal pc oh is it lrh it was tiny latent were you worrying about whether it read or not pc i was just stuck just looking at uh i was sorting i was figuring i apologize i was looking to see what how id given you failed to reveal and then i realized that i had given you failed to reveal and i hadnt revealed that in the session lrh all right very good pc the fact that id given you some apparently unimportant or insignificant decisions lrh mm mm all right very good clear the question againi meanill ask the question on this question is there anything youve failed to reveal there is bang now pc hmmm lrh what does this mean an incomplete list is this list incomplete all right in this lifetime what have you decided actually it isnt the question that is reading now while you were listing here did you at any time say oh well need to put that on the list oh need to put that on the list is there any of that pc i possibly did it i cant recall doing it lrh you dont recall doing this well theres sense in harassing you to this degree pc some of them that i gave them to when i gave them to you i i gave them to you thats silly putting that on the list lrh oh all right pc it wouldnt have been i didnt know giving you things that i didnt think need be on the list lrh all right pc not that way lrh okay in this lifetime what has been decided all right good we are going to try to null this list if we get into trouble we can always add to it okay pc right lrh all right

possibly pass through period when it wasnt banging pc yes lrh but we have got an incomplete list here which is perfectly all right and although the question tested clean that doesnt always make it so okay pc uhhuh lrh all right now well have to get that list completed pc uhhuh lrh all right but it is not complete yet pc understood lrh but youve done total twice if not three times pc uhhuh lrh all right is it all right with you if thats the end of the body of the session today pc all right lrh okay now have we made any part of our goals for this session to complete list quickly pc well we tried hard we didnt make it completely because its incomplete lrh all right work well pc oh yes lrh all right not get in the way of the assessment pc yes lrh all right and feel the benefit of the session at the end of it pc well i certainly i feel very bright and i told you the room place suddenly everythings gone somethings gone i mean lrh all right pc somethings shed lrh very good very good we went

the table underneath the table cloth thank you all right touch the gold lettering thank you pick up the cans all right squeeze the cans okay lets do that again squeeze the cans very good your havingness is well up thats fine all right that was the last command okay now is there anything youd care to ask or say before we end this session pc yes thank you very much lrh all right good enough is it all right with you if i end this session now pc yes lrh okay end of session pc thank you lrh all right tell im longer auditing you pc youre longer auditing lrh very good all right there we have that session demonstration andfinish up my auditors report hereand you saw pc go through seven approximately four or five times very interesting i call that to your attention the tv set was jumping there for little bit i had to hold it still now sorry but the trouble here is simply routine of course with these very short sessions its very unfair to the pc it very often requires more than one twoanahalfhour session to finish list and this list is not complete and you saw meand i did this for your benefit more than the necessity to do itbut you saw put in all the mid rud buttons you saw chivy around with the questionwith the word question which by the way you would not ordinarily do in session but i wanted to show you the source of the reads all right we cleaned all that up didnt we that was all clean everything was fine and this pc was still going ticktick here little bit but we went back we tried to null and everything was in and so we added to the list and we got to another clean period and then we once more tried to null and i nulled further than i ordinarily would have just to show you how extreme it is actually list ought to be in condition it ought to be in such condition that everything just goes out out out out out out out out out until you leave one in now there is the demonstration and i tried to show you thethat if you havent got complete list it doesnt matter how many mid ruds you put in how much you harass the pc you wont get yourself clean needle by which to null and you dont go on with this kind of nonsense of harassing the pc because everything is staying in and nulling everything down you see leaving everything in and then going over it again and going over it again well the list is not complete now actually that means essentially that the item is not on the list and as far as speed of nulling is concerned you could almost finish up this list and then just take the last pages after this session that were doneim telling you an extreme step now and just null those and you would find that its on it in other words he hasnt put on the key word yet and thats what this is all about so anyway you saw dirty needle and that dirty needle was caused as i demonstrated to you purely totally and only by just the one thing of incomplete list now if you fail to complete list on pc dont be surprised if your pc arc breaks and so forth now the reason the pc doesnt arc break between sessions when you have an incomplete list on the pc is very elementary because the pc expects the list to be completed so the charge has not yet been missed but if you tell pc that the list is complete and you start nulling endlessly without completing the list of course you get the arc break right in the teeth now this isthis list is as i said incomplete it needs completing and when it is complete why itll null very very easily i dont know how far this list will go we do happen to be treating button which is peculiarly susceptible to long list all right now there is your demonstration and you are still watching preliminary step for engram running okay and our thanks to the pc give him hand thank you and thank you very much and good night
