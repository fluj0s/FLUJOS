in imis data which m eant that it could not be always relied upon to produce an accurate result of the amount of allowances payable to staff as result the need for com prehensive review of the mobility and nonrem oval allowances was reiterated which had been raised in the previous oios audit in 2000 aa200071005 but had not been im plemented due to lack of resources oios also recom mended that the result of the review be docum ented and should include the nature and extent of problem s related causes and plan of action for prevention eca brought to the attention of oios an issue of inconsistent application am ong duty stations in the region in interpreting and applying the eligib ility for hardship allowance section 15 of stai20002 mobility and hardship allowance coul d be read as m eaning that professional staff recruited at the duty station directly on their firs t posting with the are not eligible to receive hardship allowance for that posting if they did not receive an

adequate and considered that the staff and managem ent of hrss were com mitted to continuous im provem ent of arrangem ents oios recom mended that these efforts be furthe r improved by placing m ore em phasis on its roles for strategic and m anagerial issues clearer tim eframes for processing staf f entitlem ents were also needed for m ore effective work planning and monitoring by putting in

reflected in the final report in italics eca has accepted and is the process of implementing most of the recommendations raised as described further below ii audit objectives 4 the overall objective

controls b evaluating whether adequate guidance and procedures were in place c determining the reliability and integrity of the data available from the present systems and d reviewing compliance with regulations and rules and administrative instructions iii audit scope and methodology 5 the audits focussed on activities in 2004 and involved interviewing staff and reviewing available documents the audits covered approximately us74 million of entitlements in 2004 6 oios also followed up on the implementation of recommendations raised in previous audits in 2002 aa200271004 eca staff administration and 2003 aa200371002 follow up audit on eca sta ff administration and recruitment iv audit findings and recommendations education grant and dependency allow ance subm ission of education grant claim form s 7 in 2004 eca paid total of approxim ately us24 m illion for education grant to 139 staff m embers eca was experiencing probl ems with education grant claim form s not being properly f illed in resulting in delayed processing and additional work f or staf f of hrss and bfs for exam ple there were several instances where it was possible that the p41 499 certificate of attendance and cost and receipt for paym ents had been filled in or altered by the concerned staff b several p41 499 form s contained inaccurate and insufficient inform ation for exam ple p41 499 certified by the school for 20032004 year for child with index 960755 child of staff with inde x 306057 did not indicate whether books were provided free of charge in another exam ple p41 499 for child with index 308483 child of staff with index 184672 and 906855 child of staff with index 967084 did not indicate what level the child had been in and whether the child had been in f ull tim attendance c staff did not always ensure that the p 45 799 request for paym ent of education grant andor advance against the education grant form is accurate and com plete for exam ple p45 799 for child with index 282415 from staff 559217 pyeg1721 and child with index 922481 from staff 914628 pyeg1697 did not have inform ation on school attendance and or actual cost staff with index 154404 subm itted p45 799 for two of his pendents indicating that they were in second and third year in the 20022003 academ ic years the claim form for 20032004 also depicted the dependants as being in second and third year respectively 8 oios determ ined that the problem stem med from educational institutions and staf f members not properly com pleting form s 9 hrss was of the opinion that the could not enf orce educational institutions to fill the p41 correctly but could request staff to persuade the educational institutions to cooperate in com pleting form s oios is of the opinion that there are num ber of actions which eca could undertake to im prove cooperation from educational institutions such as collect statistics on frequently attended schools and the perform ances of those schools with regard to the com pletion of the education grant claim s as basis for determ ining action along the lines suggested below holding forum with schools in addis ababa or dissem inating relevant inform ation via em ail on the im portance of proper certification b creating an inform ation leaflet for schools illustrating how the form should be filled in and rem inding its im portance c creating roster of problem schools and offering them an em ail contact point and if the situation does not im prove considering withdrawing support for these schools 10 oios appreciated that hrss agreed that they could do m ore to ensure staff 2 complete p45 799 properly and indicated that it would develop checklist with the intention of returning all incom plete subm issions to staff indicating the action required 11 eca commented that it would undertake review with regard to making educational establishments aware of the exp ectations within the feasible limit of ecas capability and responsibility taking into account the cost effectiveness of implementing the recommendation reviews to be undertaken at the end of july 2005 taking into account other priorities with regard to the recommendation ii checklist on education grant was developed and circulated to staff at large under steca0330 dated 30 may 2003 as agreed by hrss standardised memorandum with the checklist of missing document or information on education grant claim has b een developed with the intention of returning the incomplete submissions to the staff member for immediate action oios appreciated hrsss prom pt action and further action is proposed 12 according to stic20025 education grant and special education grant for disabled children paragraph 15 late claim s are subject to staff rules 10315 ii and 2125 on retroactivity of paym ents and will be paid only if they are subm itted within one year following the date on which the staf f member would have been entitled to the paym ent of the grant oios noted that hrss has com plied with that clause b processing of education grant claim s controls for calculation of education grant 13 eca appeared to have good controls in place to ensure the accuracy of the calculation of education grant there was sound cooperation between hrss and bfs to ensure the accurate application of rules on the education grant am ount further there was an adequate review procedure using spreadsheet to double check the accuracy of education grant calculation certification of paym ents for textbooks 14 oios noted four cases where schools were inconsistent in the certification of textbooks and action had been taken by either hrss or bfs to enquire into the discrepancies because the existing controls did not provide for such check hrss indicated its intention to collect som basic inform ation on term s and conditions offered by schools such as school term tuition boarding textbooks to assist in the identification of anom alies recommendation to ensure that the education gran t is paid in consistent m anner to eca staff hum an resources services section and budget and finance section eca should work toge ther to establish m echanism to identify and investigate any cont radictions between claim form s subm itted from the sam school or among the claim s form s for sim ilar items subm itted from different schools which should include developm ent and sharing of data base on frequently attended schools and their basic term s and conditions rec 01 15 eca accepted the recommendation and explained that it will establish database of frequently attended school including all the schools in addis ababa attended by dependants of staff members to be made available to all hras and colleagues responsible 3 for education grant in bfs to ensure consistency this will be undertaken at the end of july 2005 in conjunction with the review of educational establishments above oios thanks for the com ment and will close the recom mendation upon notification of the mechanism put in place to identify and investigate any contradictions between claim form s subm itted from the sam school or am ong the claim s form s for sim ilar item s subm itted from different schools which should include developm ent and sharing of database on frequently attended schools and their basic term s and conditions verification of the num ber of years in post secondary education 16 eca prepared follow up form for the num ber of postsecondary years whose purpose was to ensure that the education grant would term inate when the child ceased to be in fulltim attendance at an educational institution com pleted four years of post secondary studies or was awarded the first recognized postsecondary degree whichever was earlier oios is of the opinion that use of this form minimises errors and attributes an overpaym ent and subsequent recovery of approxim ately 5000 to the fact that use of this form has fallen into disuse 17 upon the oios recom mendation eca informed that it reinstated the follow up form immediately additional recom mendation is raised c educations grant advances 18 oios appreciated that eca appeared to have granted the education grant advances based on the staff request and relevant suppor ting docum ents however oios noted that eca has approxim ately us205000 of long outst anding education grant advances which were over due for m ore than year docum entation was available to determ ine the exact cause of those long outstanding advances at the tim of audit the yearly breakdown is as below table 1 yearly breakdown of long outstanding advance years due for recovery amount us prior to 2000 46230 2000 53102 2001 46399 2002 2003 58798 19 the officerincharge bfs explained that she was aware of the situation and was in the process of clearing the advances as part of com prehensive review of accounts receivable to determ ine the accurate causes of delay in settlem ent and appropriate corrective actions however clear tim efram had not been established recommendation to ensure that long outstanding ducation advances of eca staff totalling m ore than us200000 are cleared or recovered hum an resources and finance division eca should establish m echanism for timely clearance of all item s before the end of biennium rec 02 20 eca commented that it has commenced recovery action from payroll for old outstanding education grants that require scheduling thus action has been taken and it is 4 expected that full recovery of old outstanding amounts should be completed by the end of the biennium with the exception of conversion items that are very complicated and difficult to clear given the complexity of the conversion data transferred into imis oios thanks eca f or the prom pt action taken to clear existing advances and will close the recom mendation upon notification of the full recovery of old advances and m echanism put in place to prevent reoccurrence of the problem d education grant travel 21 there were 62 education grant travel requests in 2004 oios reviewed and found problem s with the arrangem ents for granting the education grant travel which included ensuring the eligibility and ensuring the accuracy of the entitlem ent travel in term s of itinerary and lum p sum amount distance learning 22 in its audits of unog and unon education grant oios noted that distance learning courses were norm ally not eligible for reim bursem ent stai20042 considers correspondence courses as nonadm issible except where such courses are the only available substitute for fulltim attendance at school of type not available at the duty station or where such courses are related to academ ic subjects that are not included in the regular school curriculum but are required for the childs subsequent education oios is concerned that the conditions of section 35 c would not allow distance learning as an alternative but only as an exception though this form of training can be cost effective alternative to attending classes and is finding very wide acceptance in som countries distance learning is especially im portant for duty stations such as addis ababa where majority of the dependants are studying abroad 23 oios raised this issue at the tim of unon audit and m ade recom mendation that unon should liaise with unog and suggest to ohrm m odification of section 35 of stai20042 to give greater flexibility in the recognition of online training as an alternative rather than as an exception this would recognize current educational trends and developm ents and to allow for m ore convenient and flexible educational arrangem ents for staff m embers children unon responded that the chief hrms would bring the matter up at the annual chiefs hr m eeting in new york in 2005 oios is also recom mending that the chief of hrss take part in suggesting the m odification of section 35 of stai20042 recommendation to ensure that the widest possible training opportunities are offered to eca staff hum an res ources and finance division eca should liaise with the counterpart s in unog and unon and suggest to ohrm m odification of section 35 of stai20042 to give greater flexibility in the recognition of online training as an alternative rather than as an exception rec 03 24 eca commented that it would convey oios recommendation to ohrm oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation upon notification of the outcom of discussions with ohrm to seek m odifica tion of section 35 of stai20042 to give greater flexibility in the recognition of online training as an alternative rather than as an 5 exception f work arrangem ent in bfs for education grant processing 25 while appreciating the benefits of bfs dedicating one staff m ember to processing education grant claim s there were statistics available to verify that the volum of claim s sustained the use of dedicated staff m ember especially as m ajority of the claim s were subm itted during 3 to 4 m onth period oios suggested that eca should collect workload statistics to determ ine the periods when dedicated staff are required for processing education grant claim form s and to identify periods when the staff could be redeployed on other activities eca commented that bfs has redefined the duties of the staff members working on education grants whereby in quiet periods the staff will work on other payment types this has been included in the staff members workplan for 2005 2006 oios thanks eca for the prom pt action taken and in light of this new inform ation is not raising any recom mendation on this m atter g dependency allowance 26 approxim ately us860000 was paid for dependency allowance for 541 staff in 2004 in accordance with the stai20008 dependency status and dependency benefits the claim s for paym ent of dependency allowance shall be m ade each year in accordance with the procedures set out in the inf ormation circular entitled review of claim s for dependency benefits as m ay be adjusted locally at duty stations outside new york w hile oios had earlier recom mended in its previous audit aa200271003 that dependency benef its be discontinued when the claim s are not subm itted in the f orm of dependency questionnaire p84 the review had not been carried out since 2001 as result records were m aintained with regard to the earnings of those spouses who were recognized as dependents and paid for the related benefits furtherm ore the absence of regular dependency status review m eant that the continued eligibility of dependency benef it for the children aged between 18 and 21 and indicated as full tim student have not been verified accordingly eca could not assure that the dependency allowance have been paid correctly 27 the chief of hrss was aware of the situation and indicated that she intended to carry out the review process in 2005 however tim efram had been established it was further explained that the review process is cum bersom which m ay not serve its purposes and rather increase adm inistrative workload in particular it was m entioned that there would be way of verifying the earning inform ation of spouses of general service staff in particular furtherm ore there were technical dif ficulties in obtaining details of imis personal data of each staff 28 nevertheless oios is of the opinion that the review process is vital to ensure that dependency allowances are appropriately paid further the review process could also serve as tool for verification of personnel data in imis the chief of hrss indicated that the action is contingent on the technical ability of eca to generate personal imis data 29 in addition oios noted inaccurate dependency data in imis for children aged over 18 who should be in full tim attendance at school university or sim ilar educational institution in order to be recognized as dependent child and paid for dependency allowance there were about 200 dependent children aged over 18 years out of 20 samples from about 200 dependent children aged over 18 years oios noted that three 6 children were not indicated as fulltim student while they were indicated as dependent in imis further there were children indicated as dependent beyond the age of 21 w hile there was f inancial im pact as the imis payroll has built in control that the dependency allowance is not paid when the fulltim attendance has not been indicated in case of children over 18 and imis stops the allowance when the child reaches ages of 21 data clean up was needed to m ake sure that those children are not indicated as dependent recommendations to ensure that the dependency allowance is paid correctly to eca staff based on the verified depe ndency status hum an resources and finance division eca should explore ways to ensure that the annual dependency review is carried out in com pliance with stai20008 dependency status and dependency benefits rec 04 to ensure the accuracy of eca imis data on dependency hum an resources and finance divisi on eca should ensure that data clean up exercise is carried out for dependency status of children aged over 18 years and who are not fulltim students rec 05 30 eca accepted both recommendations and commented that it would review these issues end of june 2005 oios will close recom mendation 4 upon receipt of the procedures put in place to ensure that the annual dependency review is carried out in com pliance with stai20008 dependency status and dependency benefits recom mendation 5 upon notification of the results of the data clean up exercise carried out for dependency status of children aged over 18 years and who are not full tim students b home leave and family visit travel entitlem ent check list 31 in 2004 eca paid approxim ately us780000 for 150 travel authorisations for home leave and 11 travel authorisations for fam ily visits eca had developed hom leave entitlem ent checklist which oios f elt was usef ul tool f or verif ication of not only the suf ficiency of hom leave credit points but also other eligibility requirem ents oios found that only few hrss staff were using and filing this checklist and recom mended that eca ensure the hom leave entitlem ent checklist is com pleted and f iled f or all requests eca accepted the recommendation and implemented by issuing letter to all staff in hrss on 17 june 2005 reminding the mandatory use of the checklist oios thanks eca for the prom pt action taken and is not raising any recom mendation on this m atter b adm inistration of requests guidance to staff on subm ission of requests 32 in accordance with eca inform ation circular stecaic0329 dated 30 may 2003 hom leave or fam ily visit travel was requested using the eca form request for hom leavefam ily visit travel which had to be subm itted to hrss three weeks in advance of travel in cases where the lum p sum option was opted the request had to reach 7 hrss two m onths in advance further relevant parts of pt165 form for lum p sum travel were required to be com pleted at the tim of notification of lum p sum amount and at the completion of the travel 33 oios determ ined for the following reasons that the circular and request form did not fully serve their purpose and needed to be revised while m ost staff opted for the lum p sum option the requests were rarely subm itted to hrss two m onths in advance hrss agreed that the twom onth requirem ent was unnecessary and indicated that one m onth would be sufficient b the circular did not m ake specific pr ovision for staff in subregional offices whose hom leave requests norm ally take m ore tim for processing c the request for hom leavefam ily vi sit travel provided section related to the acceptance of lum p sum option am ount that duplicated pt 165 and m ay therefore be redundant d the section b of pt165 lum p sum trav was not com pleted at the tim of notification of lum p sum amount but rather completed at the com pletion of travel therefore the purpose of pt165 was not served recommendation to enhance the effectiveness of existing guidance to eca staff on the subm ission of hom leave and or fam ily visit requests hum an resources services section eca s hould revise stecaic0329 with regard to the tim efram for subm ission of the request and also should simplify the request f or hom leavefam ily visit travel taking into consideration the form pt165 rec 06 34 eca commented that it fully agrees with the observation that part b of pt165 should be signed by the staff members before commencing travel mechanism has been put in place to require the certifying officer in hrss to verify that section b of pt165 has been signed by the staff member before certifying the ta with regard to stecaic0329 hrss will issue an amendment as some information is longer valid and there is new information to be added however as to the issue raised by oios that hrss indicated twomonth requirement while the majority of staff members submitted their requests within one month eca is of the opinion that this not an issue while hrss is able to process the hl requests within one month advising staff members to submit earlier has most likely contributed to reducing the number of last minutes requests received oios may have viewed this from the point of staff compliance issue while hrss takes this approach as contingency planning taking into account the habitual lateness of many staff in submitting their requests in addition the twomonth requirement would also cover the extra time needed to process the hl of staff members in the subregional offices on the issue of duplication of the request for hlfv travel and the pt165 referring specifically to part where staff member has to sign acceptance of the lump sum amount eca has amended the part of the request form to provide staff member with the information of their travel time and bringing attention to the requirement for timely submission travel claim copy of the revised request form attached furthermore eca has been in touch with the travel unitnew york to explore the possibility of exporting the electronic request for lump sum travel to eca oios appreciates ecas prom pt actions 8 on the

explained that the review had not been carried out due to lack of resources and other priorities within hrss 52 at the tim of the audit chief hrss initiated an extensive review of the allowances for all internationally recruited staff the prelim inary findings indicated multiple causes for incorrect paym ents of allowances including insufficient supervision imis processing and data problem s and app lication of inappropriate policy which would be analysed in greater detail 53 oios has replaced its previous recom mendation on the need for com prehensive review of the allowances with the following recom mendation that in order to ensure that the ongoing com prehensive review of m obility and nonrem oval allowances leads to the establishm ent of sustainable m echanism for the correct paym ent of allowances hum an resources and finance division eca should fina lise the extensive review of allowances by the end of june 2005 and docum ent the results detailing the nature of errors

in light of this developm ent is not raising any recom mendation on this m atter oios will include the am ount recovered in the total recovery figure to be reported in the oios annual report paym ent of hardship allowance 55 stai20002 states that hardship allowance is paid to staff in the professional category and above field service staff and inte rnationally recruited general service staff who are assigned to duty stations classified as b c d and for period of year or longer giving rise to an assignm ent grant this could be interpreted as m eaning that professionals recruited locally were not eligible f or hardship allowance f or the f irst posting if they did not receive an assignm ent grant 56 eca practice was to grant the hardship allowance to locally recruited professional staff if their contracts were for m ore than year following the sam logic locally recruited general service staff received the hardship allowance during the spa period to professional category 57 the chief of hrss explained that eca had followed the spirit of the hardship allowance as stated in the sam stai the hardship allowance is not considered as an expatriate benefit and is for the com pensation of varying degree of hardship at different duty stations therefore eca had concluded that the allowance should not be tied with recruitm ent travel or assignm ent grant as such the allowance was paid to professional staff with contracts longer than year regardless of their recruitm ent status which is also the logic built into imis 58 for clarification eca sought advice fr om ohrm who provided rulings that hardship allowance is linked with paym ent of assignm ent grant on two occasions in january and novem ber 2004 eca was in the process of im plem entation of that ruling as of the audit date 59 eca raised the issue that other duty stations in the region unon and ictr had also adopted the practice of granting hardship allowance regardless of recruitm ent travel and assignm ent grant though operational serv ices division ohrm indicated in october 2004 that the m atter would be looked into it appears that action had taken so far oios confirm ed with unon and ictr that they had not received guidance from ohrm in this regard oios is therefore referring this m atter directly to the hum an resources policy service ohrm and recom mendation has been raised for eca 13 f extension of mobility and nonrem oval allowances 60 exceptionally the period of paym ent m ay be extended for period of up to one for mobility or two years for nonrem oval upon certification in accordance with section 28 and 43 of stai20002 eca practice was not to authorize any exception and allowances were autom atically reduced or discontinued wit hout notification or review of eligibility of extension recommendation hum an resources and finance division eca should advise hum an resources officers through circ ular to review the cases of all staff members with im pending reduction of mobility allowance or discontinuation of nonrem oval allowance to determ ine whether there are eligible for extension based on paragraphs 28 and 43 of stai20002 rec 09 61 eca commented that mobility and nonremoval allowances are incentives for staff members to move the limitation of five years is intended to encourage staff larger mobility paragraphs 28 and 43 of stai20002 of 10 march 2000 on mobility and hardship clearly spell out the circumstances for which the maximum five years could be extended the policy on this has been well established the principle is to grant an exception when it is the organization that requires the staff member to remain longer at duty station the fact that staff members may have tried to move but are unsuccessful is not the criterion for granting of an exception for longer payment of mobility and non removal allowance as indicated in paragraphs 23 and 43 of the stai the extension could be granted if staff member has not declined to be reassigned or if the staff member is asked to stay longer due to the need of hisher services in addition under mobility when staff members reassignment is imminent and expected before the end of the sixth year and under nonremoval when staff member has compelling reasons to remain at the duty station an exception could be granted thus there are distinctions between the circumstances where staff member has been selectedasked to move and declined and where staff member wants to move but has not been selected under mobility and non removal allowance only the former qualified for an exception for extended payment and not the latter in light of this eca does not see the need to issue information circular advising staff members of when to request for an exception 62 oios appreciated ecas clarification indica ting that it is necessary to deal with the issue on casebycase basis this does not however address the issue of how staff member would know heshe should claim and oios is not aware of any procedures currently in place that set out the position stated above to assist hrss in reviewing and determ ining eligibility in light of this oios will close the recom mendation upon receipt of copy

leave eca should am end existing instructions to require confirm ation from both the staff m ember and the tim and attendance clerk eca commented that it would enforce this requirement however it should be noted that confirmation of ta is already an existing requirement each month staff member and supervisor sign the ta irfa report that shows the days when leave are taken during that month and submit it to hrss for official record keeping each end of the year the same is signed by the staff member showing balance to be carried forward in general this procedure is working well except for

by hrss upon the subm ission of the education grant claim s usually took around m onth eca was not in position to assess its perform ance as it did not system atically m aintain and monitor against perform ance indicators to judge the adequacy of actual perform ance 80 the chief hrss explained that while the intention of the recommendation is appreciated and certain progress has been made its full implementation would also require stable organisation with sufficient staff complement to ensure maximum benefit from those activities otherwise the establishment of timeframe for processing and its monitoring would not serve its full purposes it was explained that the work of hrss has been allocated in accordance with workload indicators such as number of staff and number of requests for consultants from each client sections or divisions and the changes in the availability of the professional staff currently the administration of staff entitlement is carried out by four separate teams three of which are under the supervision of shortterm professional staff the fourth team is headed by regular professional staff 81 while appreciating the explanation from hrss oios draws m anagem

oios was pleased to note that target dates for subm ission of claim s have been incorporated for education grant and hom leave w hilst this was an excellent initiative to give guidance to staff its value was largely lost as data was kept recording what happened in practice this was necessary to determ ine whether any changes were required to the subm ission date or whether additional m easures were required to m ake staff aware of the need to follow the subm ission deadline b time frames or benchmarks for the processing of staff entitlements and their monitoring except for hom leave there was official tim efram for processing of request f or entitlem ents as result it was not clear how the performance of hrss in adm inistering the entitlem ents could be evaluated such inform ation when

team is required in this regard as explained in the next section 82 with specific regard to the m anagem ent inform ation the chief hrss explained that while such data is useful for analysis from time to tim hrss does not see the added value of maintaining such statistical data i it will need allocation of valuable resources to update the database daily when the inform ation is already centrally stored in imis ii if not updated continuously the database would be useless for reporting purposes as data would change everyday and iii the need of inform ation is periodical and can be served very well through query from imis with correct and precise specifications 83 whilst appreciating the position taken hrss has yet to define what its managem ent inform ation needs are and therefore could not dem onstrate that all the data it needs is readily available in imis recommendation in order to further assist in wo rk planning and m onitoring for the processing of eca entitlem ents hum an resources services section eca should define its m anagem ent inform ation needs and coordinate with the imis coordinator for clarifying data specification and procedures for producing such managem

arrangem ent between imis team and hrss for the enhancem ent of imis utilisation as m anagem ent tool 88 the chief hrss explained that the core issue of imis support in eca and perhaps the sam in m any other duty stations is the absence of hrimis person who is knowledgeable on the hr policies as well as the imis system so that heshe could review problem s com municated by the user com munity and
