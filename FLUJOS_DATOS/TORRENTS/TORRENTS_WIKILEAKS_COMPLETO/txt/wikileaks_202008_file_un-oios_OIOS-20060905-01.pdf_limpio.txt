properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreements partners internal controls were assessed as satisfactory bu t suggestions were made to strengthen them the bureau and the representation agreed to oios r ecommendations project performance monitoring was adequately carri ed out however financial monitoring could be more systematic and hence effective there was also need to strengthen the internal controls over assets on loan to partners assets we re not barcoded right of use agreements had not been entered into and recent physical in ventory had been conducted the bureau and the representation agreed to take action to str engthen internal controls the representation could not provide plausible ex planation for the low implementation of project 05sbsyrrp333

representation the recruitment process was not documented or trans parent and the criteria used for the selection of candidates were not clear number f project staff were hired for core functions

focused on 2001 programme activities covering expenditure of us 1 million an inspection from the inspector general s office was also conducted in the same year it was found that the implementing partners n eeded to strengthen internal controls and ensure more effective rate of implementation of p rogramme activities unhcr syria provided insufficient training for both programme nd protection local staff and it was found that unvs performed core functions for unhcr the n eed for regional policy with regard to long stayers and urban refugees was also highlig hted 3 the unhcr representation in syria was estab lished in 1991 as syria is not party to the 1951 convention the programme comprises of significant protection eligibility activities as well as resettlement as this is the only durable solution for recognized refugees in the country 4 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the audited activitie s during the exit conference held on 15 december 2005 draft of the report was shared with the director of the bureau of caswaname and the representative in december 2005 the comments which were received in january 2006 are reflected in the repo rt the bureau of caswaname and the representation have accepted most of the audit reco mmendations made ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to ev aluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets and compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subproject agreements iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on 2004 and 2005 programm activities under projects 04 05absyrcm201 and 04 05absyrre500 with exp enditure of us 15 million our review concentrated on the activities implement ed by the syrian women union swu expenditure of us 133000 and the syrian red cresc ent society srcs expenditure of us 1062000 oios also reviewed activities direc tly implemented by unhcr with expenditure of us 222000 2 7 the audit reviewed the administration of th office of the representation with an administrative budget of us 317000 in 2005 and as sets with an acquisition value of us 708000 and current value of us 225000 in dece mber 2005 the representation had 38 staff which included 7 unvs 7 personnel under spe cial service agreements 4 personnel under service contracts and 6 staff on temporary as sistance 8 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations programme management programme implementation 9 as shown in table 1 below in 2004 and in 2 005 the implementation rate for project sbsyrrp333 was low especially for direct implem entation table 1

increasing the capacity to initiate proposals and p rojects in the medium term 11 under project 05syrrp333 for iraqi refu gees on temporary protection tp with 22508 cases registered by unhcr and in the absenc of other reliable official statistics the project expenditure was only us 162487 more tailed review of expenditure on the project disclosed that hardly any activities had be undertaken with regard to education legal assistance or food distribution the impact of this project therefore was close to nil while interviews and situation papers concur describing t he situation as critical 12 it was clear from discussions at the repre sentation level that due to lack of information sharing in the office most of the staff involved in the project was under the wrong impression that funds available were very l imited thus activities had to be small scale and kept to the minimum oios commented that efforts should have been increased to identify potential partners including government s ervices to provide public services such as education and suggested that the representation ent er into additional subproject agreements to increase the impact of its activities for person s of concern 13 the representative commented that normal implementa tion had been hampered by local constraints such as the weakness of implement ing partners capacity or inefficiency of the concerned ministries the representative was so of the opinion that the nonrelease of funds was the main cause for under implementation the bureau indicated that although there was funding constraints they continually enco uraged the representation to submit concrete proposals with measurable targets and outp uts to be achieved this was not done 3 and it was the opinion of the bureau that the repre sentation lacked an understanding of how to manage the entire operation as well as project nd subproject details 14 the bureau indicated that although they offered sup port it was not accepted by the representation nonetheless considering the proble ms encountered for 2006 the bureau has allocated provisions for 6month programme office r post in the perspective of increasing the capacity of the representation the bureau also highlighted that successful programme design and formulation implementation monitoring evaluation also depended on the active participation of the entire office including prote ction administration and management 15 oios is concerned as to the apparent lack of comprehension and expertise the representation has in developing and implementing p rogrammes therefore as indicated by the bureau with immediate effect an experienced p rogramme officer should be deployed on temporary basis to both assist in the development and implementation of projects as well as in train staffing in the fundamentals of programme formulation and management recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for caswaname should deploy with immediate effect an experienced programme officer on temporary basis to assist the representation in pr ogramme development and implementation the assigned progra mme officer should also train representation staff on the funda mentals of programme formulation and management rec 01 b implementing partners monitoring 16 for project 04 05absyrcm201 two sub project agreements were signed with swu and srcs respectively only one project descrip tion however was developed for both subprojects oios also found that the subproject performance indicators included were not always smart specific measurable achievable rel evant and timebound meaning that it was difficult to compare planned outputs against the actual results as benchmarks units of measurements andor expected levels of achievement were not given without proper performance and impact indicators the success of t he project could not be effectively measured 17 it had already been identified by the 2002 oios audit that internal controls over the financial management of activities delegated to par tners needed improvement as result budgetary transfers should only have been authorise d at the item level it was oios opinion that to have them at the sector level allowed too m uch flexibility oios found that in 2004 operational costs of swu 30 per cent of the final project expenditure exceeded the initial budget figure by 42 per cent or 273929 syp us 5 115 supplementary agreement was prepared as required or evidence that this budget verrun had been authorized 18 oios assessed that subproject financial m onitoring could be more systematic and hence effective for example annual monitoring p lan had been established financial monitoring reports assessing the reliance unhcr cou ld place on the implementing partners were not prepared and there was inadequate follow up on previous recommendations number of them had not yet been addressed moreove r oios found that the unhcr authorizing officer did not always sign the spmrs formally accepting that the expenditure 4 reported by the partner as genuine project expendit ure 19 considering the capacity of unhcrs implem enting partners in syria it is oios opinion that unhcr needs to enhance its method of p roject formulation and improve its monitoring role this would help improve not only t he quality of the project management but also the accuracy and effectiveness of reporting on the project activities undertaken 20 furthermore gender specific indicators wo uld allow measuring to what extent unhcr syria reaches out to women and children throu gh its projects recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in syria should improve it s sub project management by reverting to budget flexibili ty at the item level ensuring that operational costs of subproje cts are kept at reasonable level and transfers in excess of 15 per cent are properly authorized more detailed project descriptions are also required as well as improvements to the formulation of performa nce indicators including gender specific ones project monitoring procedures should be formalised by the establishment of more r egularly documented reviews rec 02 21 the representation commented that quarterly financi monitoring visits will be established in 2006 and duly documented the bureau agreed with the recommendation and will provide support to the representation 22 considering the nature and age of some of the assets unhcr should consider transferring some of the project assets except veh icles to partners in order not to retain the responsibility for them for the remaining assets r ight of use agreements should be signed prior to the disposal and transfer of assets approp riate procedures through the local asset management board need to be undertaken 23 oios noted that project assets were not ba rcoded and recent physical inventory had been conducted the administrative assistant t whom the responsibility for asset management was delegated had been requested on number of occasions both by the implementing partners and the programme unit of the representation to barcode assets apparently due to other priorities this was not don recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in syria should strengthen its internal controls over assets provided on loan to partners all unhcr assets should be barcoded rights of use agreement s entered into and periodic physical verification undertaken th representation due to the nature and age of some f the assets should consider transferring some of them to partne rs after appropriate procedures have been initiated through the local asset management board rec 03 5 24 the representation confirmed that right of use agre ements would be issued in 2006 the bureau indicated that they would provide the ne cessary support to implement the recommendation c country operation plan indicators cop 25 indicators in the cop are not always speci fic measurable or relevant as an example preventing further hardship due to deteriorated ec onomic situations is not measurable and is not sufficiently specific with regard to the activi ties undertaken in the unhcr projects similarly recognized refugees interviewed hom visits calls for target number which would allow measuring if it was achieved or n ot 26 the representation confirmed that efforts would be made to improve performance indicators making them more specific measurable nd relevant in the next cop exercise b review of implementing partners 27 for the two partners reviewed reasonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreements oios assessed that internal controls of both partners were generally in place and operating effectively albeit some improvement was warranted the 2004 audit certificate for srcs had been received and an unqualified opinion xpressed syrian women union 28 in oios opinion the social counsellors r esponsible for implementing counselling activities did not have sufficient social counselli ng experience prior to being hired they were english literature graduates although the unhcr ssistant community services officer prepared interview checklists in order to assist in the work carried out only 40 of them have been completed since march 2005 there was not suff icient evidence therefore that this activity was competently performed 29 in oios opinion the narrative spmr was n ot satisfactory as it did not allow for an accurate view of the activities undertaken at this stage as unhcr does not intend to enter into an agreement with swu in 2006 oios would sugg est that swu be encouraged to provide more detailed and specific spmr narrative that adequately documents the impact of the subproject 30 further efforts were still required to str engthen internal controls over financial management for example although bank reconciliati ons were performed on monthly basis they were neither reviewed nor signed by supervis or such procedure would provide additional control over cash and bank transactions the representation mentioned that cash management was in accordance with the syrian women union financial internal procedures and policies which the representation could not ch ange oios would emphasize that the representation has responsibility to ensure that partners implement sound internal control procedures in line with generally accepted good pra ctices 6 b syrian red crescent society 31 the two social counsellors of srcs share n office where the interviews with the refugees take place confidentiality and privacy wa s for them not an issue and they mentioned that should they feel that refugee was uncomforta ble the other would step out of the office oios believes that the conditions for refugees to d isclose any problem especially serious sgbv or violence abuse should be provided from t he start and that conducting onetoone interviews exclusively should prevail recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in syria should request th syrian red crescent society to rearrange its office space to llow for interviews with refugees to be held in comfortabl and confidential environment rec 04 32 the representation agreed to raise the issue of hav ing separate offices for counsellors with the implementing partner 33 staffing table was provided to unhcr wi th the final spmrs nor was one available in the project file oios found changes t the srcs staff working on the sub project and the increase in the salaries paid to th em this had not been properly monitored and disclosed 34 the accountant for the project received full salary from the unhcr subproject and his employment contract provided for full attendan ce in practice the accountant was only partially involved with the project did not have n office and worked on other nonunhcr related activities recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in syria should ensure tha t staffing table indicating names and salaries as well as ent ry on duty be provided regularly through the final spmrs and sub project agreements as well as liaise with the syrian red c rescent society to amend the level of salary of the accountant to ne that is more adequate for parttime work rec 05 35 the representation agreed to liaise with srcs to am end the level of salary of the accountant 36 at the time of the audit updated asset s list had been prepared although some new assets one printer should have been included logbook was maintained for the vehicle purchased from unhcr funds although the issue had already been raised in oios 2002 audit it was therefore not possible to assess the exclusive use of the vehicle for the project some old furniture chairs desks was kept in the inner court of the office with action taken to dispose of them the representation confirmed it will ensure that sr cs keeps list of assets updated throughout the year maintain l ogbook for the vehicle and dispose of old items 7 c stockpiling in holhassake 37 the camp of hol was closed in 2004 and the remaining nonfood items have since been kept in warehouse at the camp all items wer received in 2003 and while following mission of senior logistics assistant from the ir aq support unit their distribution has increased in 2005 tents dispatched to the unhcr jo rdan office relief items distributed in abu kamal damascus and hassake their rotation is still insufficient to reduce the risk that they will deteriorate in storage it is also import ant that these items when distributed are done using the firstinfirstout basis the representation confirmed that it will continue distributing the remaining items during the first q uarter of 2006 c direct implementation refugee status determination activities 38 the increase in the number of iraqis appro aching the office and at the same time the number of other refugee cases remaining stable was putting increasing pressure on unhcrs protection staff for example the asylum seekers pproaching unhcr in december 2005 will only obtain an eligibility interview in april 2006 most of the eligibility activities registration interview finalizing the file have been delegated to unvs or nonunhcr staff service contracts and special service agreements developed under personnel management oios noted from discussions with staff that the intense workload has started to impact on staff morale and motivation 39 oios also understood through meetings with the staff that little formal training is provided upon assignment and most of the experience is obtained from onthejob training moreover although weekly protection meetings take place opportunities for eligibility assistants to share their experience cases or ques tions possibly with the guidance of protection officer should be developed to alleviat the impression that they are working in isolation the representation confirmed that training and disc ussions on protection related issues will be implemented and that one to two one day sessions were planned for the spring 2006 40 eligibility assistants are appointed as fo cal points for minors detention cases somali or sudan refugees etc the criteria on which the f ocal points are appointed was not clear and did not necessarily reflect their expertiseexperie nce the representative explained that although not documented the focal points were appo inted based on their experience the senior protection officer mentioned that starting 2006 it is planned that the eligibility assistants would rotate every two months and that n assessment of their performance would then be made to appoint the focal points on longe r term basis b use of interpreters 41 interpreters performing translation for hcr eligibility or resettlement interviews are not professional and do not have contract th ey sign an engagement of confidentiality as informal volunteer interpreters and receive cas h allowance the total interpretation fees paid in 2004 for project 04absyrcm201 amounted to us 6637 of which up to us 2100 was paid to the same interpreter the representation commented on the difficulty to undertake issuing formal contracts due to the limi ted number of interpreters and their fluctuation it would however look into the issue nd has already scheduled training for 8 interpreters for 2006 oios understands that guidelines are being drafted with regard to the recruitment conditions of service training and mo nitoring of interpreters used by unhcr in the interim period until the guidelines are finaliz ed and issued the representation should seek guidance from the legal affairs section via the des k recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in syria in conjunction wi th the desk should seek guidance from the legal affairs section on the proper contractual arrangements for the hiring of interpre ters the representation should also develop criteria for the ir selection and evaluation rec 06 42 the bureau confirmed that guidance from the legal ffairs section would be sought to ensure proper contractual agreements are impleme nted c policy for long stayers 43 oios already mentioned in its report of 20 02 that significant share of the caseload had received assistance for longer than six months which is normally the maximum period under unhcrs current policy at the end of 2005 s rcs confirmed that some refugees had been receiving subsistence allowance for the past f ive years follow up action has been taken by the representation or by the bureau for ca swaname to establish policy regarding long stayers in saying this however oi appreciates that once the guidelines on urban refugees are finalized this may assist the b ureau and hence the representation in establishing regional or local policy the representation confirmed that it will followup on the recommendation in light of the final report of the beirut workshop held in november 2005 and the draft unhcr revised policy on refugee s and asylumseekers in urban areas d capacity building and training 44 institutional capacity building is one of the operational priorities of the office upon discussion with the representative oios learned th at only one government capacity building event took place during the period 20042005 namel workshop for the government in march 2005 on the 1951 convention an intervention planned at the law university was cancelled seven other workshops were also organize d for implementing partners in 2004 and 2005 oios considers this level of activity as insu fficient for priority area 45 the representation indicated that it would use any opportunity to adhere to the recommendation but that in the past the governmen t had been reluctant to accept unhcrs training offers if this is the case then the representation needs t readdress how it is going to achieve one of its operational priorities recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in syria should develop strategy on how it is going to implement institutional capacity building which is one of its operational priorities the represent ation should be more active in the area of assistance and instituti onal capacity building and ensure more seminarstrainings take pl ace rec 07 9 46 the bureau supported the recommendation and indicat ed it will provide assistance where requested in oios view the forthcoming visit to syria of t he deputy director of the bureau and the head of desk should address this iss ue to ensure programme objectives and targets are met from the audit subsequent corresp ondence and discussions with the bureau it is doubtful that assistance will be requested it is oios opinion however that achieving targets is joint responsibility of the representa tion and the desk and thus initiative or corrective action is not the sole prerogative of t he representation d personnel management staffing levels 47 the representation has currently four prot ection posts which are senior protection officer protection officer an associate resettl ement officer and protection clerk the latter two were vacant at the time of the audit in reviewing the cop submission for 2006 oios noted that additional regular posts for protection activities were reques ted it was mentioned in the cop revision for protection posts the office is quite satisfied with the current staffing table in terms of national unvs an d regular staff under the protection and resettlement section from our review of the rsd ctivities in the office the meetings held with staff and the contract situation as described below it was oios opinion that the protection staffing situation was not satisfactory the desk confirmed that it was upon their request that two new general service protection pos ts were created recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for caswaname in consultation wit h department of international protection should asse ss the staffing requirements in protection at the representation in syria and address any shortcomings identified rec 08 b recruitment 48 with the exception of unvs which fall und er different process with undp local staff were normally selected through an interview h eld solely with the representative in some cases an interview with protection internat ional staff was subsequently performed but this was an exception rather than rule the only criteria mentioned in the newspaper announcement for unhcr positions were the need to h ave an excellent command of english and arabic and university degree in law and thes were not always complied with moreover oios review of the recruitment process n oted that systematic process of evaluating and grading candidates was not conducted evaluation schedules interview notes and conclusions reached were available for oi to assess the objectivity and effectiveness of the process this was less than sa tisfactory especially as in many cases interviews were only conducted by one person in t he interest of fair and transparent selection process panel of 2 or 3 persons should conduct all interviews for the selection of eligibility assistants the senior protection offic er andor the protection officer being the direct supervisors should be involved in the interv iews 10 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in syria should develop an objective transparent and documented recruitment process whi ch includes clear selection criteria the establishment of an i nterview panel and interview forms to evaluate candidates evaluations decisions and recommendations should be clearly documented rec 09 49 the representation confirmed that an interviewrecr uitment panel would be established in the beginning of 2006 50 personal history forms p11 or curriculu m vitae were not always found in the personnel files and the representation stated that missing p11s w ould be completed c appointments 51 the office has 24 project andor temporary staff all on different types of contracts including unvs personnel on service contracts sta ff on temporary assistance and personnel on special service agreements each of th statuses has its rules and related benefits if any ssas oios would question the re asoning of having such variety of contractual arrangements particularly for personne l conducting the same function for example eligibility assistants the representative explained that eligibility assis tants start with twoweek training period for which cont ract is signed and salary is paid should this prove satisfactory ssa is then signed for 3 months initially either converted to service contract if the staff performs satisfacto rily or extended service contract is the last step for longerterm employment at the end of the process the person who remains had been pressurized and had matured 52 oios would highlight that within unhcr rul and procedures the issuing of ssas andor sc to personnel working in unhcr is not gitimate contractual agreement oios appreciates that ssas are available under the unite d nations rules stai19997 but it is for an individual who is recognized authority or specialist in specific field the person issued an ssa shall normally not receive any train ing at the expense of the organization this is contradictory to the use of ssa in the repr esentation for an initial probation and training period oios does not think it is appropri ate to hire staff even if it is for training without proper contract and remuneration package moreover evaluation on the performance of staff was found in the personnel fil to support that one staff member proved satisfactory or not 53 overall oios was concerned with regard to the variety of contracts and the terms of reference therein entered into with individuals car rying out unhcr core functions oios could not identify any clear criteria for the deter mination of the type of contract or the salary level paid the following shows the anomalies that have arisen as result of this there were eight eligibility assistants under three different types of contracts unv sc and ssa staff member initially on temporary assistance an d entitled to the unhcr medical insurance dependency allowance etc was later tra nsferred to sc and as result lost all prior entitlements the two social counsellors employed under 05sbsyr rp333 and issued with 11 special service agreement are paid differently one of them having the same salary as the driver recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in syria should discontinu the practice of hiring individuals without any signed contract or remuneration package the representation should dis continue the use of contractual arrangements which are not in l ine with unhcrs rules and procedures rec10 54 the representation commented that ssas would be dis continued in 2006 and that project staff will fall either under the unv scheme or the sc formula further nonunv staff were getting salaries in accordance with their qual ifications and the nature of the job although the first determining factor was budgetary constraints oios is of the opinion that as service contracts are not legitimate contractu arrangement in unhcr the conversion of staff under ssas to scs is also not appropriate 55 oios also noted in its review of personnel files that contracts were not issued and signed prior to the commencement of work in many ca ses the representation confirmed that contracts preparation would be undertaken in due d contracts 56 the variety of contracts and the absence of clear rationale for appointments under differing contractual status resulted in difficu lt situation in the representation at the time of the audit oios noted that decision had been t aken that all personnel under unv scs or ssa contractual arrangements would move to unifor m sc in 2006 this would force some of the unvs to take leave in order not to lose all accrued entitlement on 15 december it was decided that based on the staff performance and niority heads of unit would make proposals for each staff the representation elaborated in january 2006 that committee had been appointed to review the situation and make recommendations enabling the office to establish homogeneity and fairness in accordance wi th objective criteria which are qualifications the nature of the work done and ove rall performance this exercise would be done only after filling the new g3 g5 g6 g7 prot ection posts as well as the g7 programme post oios commends the representation for this initiativ but believes that it would be more beneficial to have the committee work on crite ria and performance appraisal before the selection process for new posts is initiated it wo uld be regrettable that the transparency and objectiveness intended does not immediately apply t the current staffing of positions 57 in oios opinion considering the core fun ctions performed by most of the project staff request should be made to regularize them it is also oios opinion that the staffing issues identified above should be further refined nd discussed with headquarters to identify satisfactory alternative the representation stated that it could not avoid having different contracts unless unhcr decided to treat fairly its project staff by giving them stable situation oios would reemphasize that under unhcr rules and procedures the representation should not be hiring project staff 12 58 the differing contractual arrangements mea nt that some unhcr personnel were not entitled to medical insurance oios understands tha t the representation is currently working on finding medical insurance for personnel on servi ce contracts oios met with other organizations in syria and noted that unicef and wf p added medical insurance scheme to their service contracts and that additional pensio n was either included or considered for inclusion for medical insurance such an option wa s already taken and contracted out to van breda oios notes that the unv status provides mo re comprehensive social security insurance policy to staff and their dependents as well as being less costly for unhcr the representative indicated that in 2006 service cont racts would be medically covered under the van breda insurance scheme 59 the determination of the salary level for project staff was not clear with the exception of unvs it was confirmed in oios discus sions with undp that for its personnel hired under service contracts it was based on the salary scale of general service category in syria in oios view in the interim period unti l the staffing situation is regularised it may be appropriate for unhcr to apply similar salary scale for example the salaries paid to eligibility assistants were paid at the g3 level nd social counsellors were paid at the g1 level or less which does not appear to be commensu rate with the level of duties and responsibilities the representation indicated that the salary scale policy was determined first by budgetary constraints second by the natur of the job and third by the staff qualification however the same salary scale would be applied to those staff who cannot be put under the unv scheme oios would highlight such practice is highly irre gular and the representation does not have the authority to devel op local salary scale policy the bureau in conjunction with dhrm needs to resolve this issu recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for caswaname should liaise with t he division of human resources management to ensure th at review is conducted of the staffing practices established and contractual arrangements entered into by unhcr syria there is need to regularise the staffing situation as well as implem ent procedures for the monitoring and supervising unhcr syrias human resources activities rec11 60 the bureau stated that mission to syria in februa ry 2006 by the deputy director and the head of desk will ensure the proper impleme ntation of recommendations 09 to 12 they will involve of the division of human resource s management job description and performance evaluation 61 through oios interviews with staff it wa s found that some staff had not been issued with any job description defining their tasks the extent of their responsibility or the criteria on which their performance would be evaluated the representation confirmed that it would redistribute job descriptions to newly recruited s taff from review of files oios also observed
