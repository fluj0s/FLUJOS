fm discusses taliban financial flows and reintegration with amb holbrooke and treasury as cohen classified by richard g olson ambassador reason 14b d 1 snf summary during january 11 meeting in abu dhabi visiting special representative for afghanistan and pakistan srap amb richard holbrooke discussed afghan reintegration with uae foreign minister sheikh abdullah bin zayed nahyan abz abz noted the importance of establishing an effective and transparent reintegration trust fund that includes saudi support amb holbrooke urged the uae to do more to disrupt taliban financial flows abz discussed his recent visit to iran noting iran is acting more confident even as the country moves backwards he added that pakistani president zardari had asked the uae to take in his family in the event of his death end summary afghanistan meetings 2 snf amb holbrooke began by thanking abz for hosting the welltimed srap meeting in abu dhabi on january 12 abz said he was looking forward to the gulf participation including that of the jordanian foreign minister particularly following the recent attack in khost abz said judeh had told him jordan plans to send more troops to afghanistan amb holbrooke said judeh had made the same point during his recent visit to washington 3 snf amb holbrooke said the decisions on the afghan reintegration program and the upcoming elections would be the key deliverables for the abu dhabi meeting and would pave the way to success in london abz asked what the role of reintegration fund contributors would be noting that the uae did not want to be associated with fund that afghans would find ineffective nontransparent or slow abz said funding must go to programs with clear benchmarks that have strong financial and policy oversight he added that it is very crucial saudi arabia donate to the fund for symbolic reasons turning to the elections abz suggested compromise solution whereby the afghan government would ask isaf when it would be ready to support the elections rather than having any party dictate to president karzai disrupting taliban finance 4 snf amb holbrooke stressed to abz the importance of uae efforts to combat taliban financial flows through the uae amb holbrooke noted the productive meeting he and treasury as cohen had with uae national security advisor sheikh hazaa bin zayed earlier on january 12 and the uaes efforts to crack down on bulk cash smuggling as cohen added that the usg is most concerned about dubais central role in regional financial flows 5 snf abz asked several questions about usg concerns and the uaes response including if taliban financial flows are regional andor transiting dubai what is the suspected value of these flows why the usg does not intercepting the funds in afghanistan if incoming or outgoing cash declarations would help and if the usg believed the uae was not effectively enforcing existing regulations amb holbrooke and as cohen explained that the usg is concerned that dubai is being used for the facilitation of the flow of taliban funds goods and personnel to and from afghanistan the usg is working with afghanistan and pakistan but that the uae should also take steps to enforce and investigate inbound cash declarations and amend laws to require outbound declarations as cohen noted that the planned dhsice cash courier training in february would focus on identifing and intercepting likely couriers pakistan zardari concerns 6 snf abz said he had met with pakistani president asif zardari in dubai in late december and the latter was in better shape than abz expected stressing the sensitivity of the information abz told amb holbrooke that zardari had asked abz to convey request to uae president sheikh khalifa abzs halfbrother that zardaris family be allowed to live in the uae in the event of his death note the bhutto family has lived in dubai for years and in effect this would be continuation of commitment late uae president sheikh zayed made to ali zulfikar bhutto end note iran and yemen 7 snf turning to his late december trip to iran abz said it was his first meeting with ahmedinejad that did not include cleric murshid he interpreted this to mean that ahmedinejad is now trusted and does not need constant supervision noting that ahmedinejad had cited western media criticism of dubais financial situation as plot against dubai abz told amb holbrooke he believes ahmedinejad is crazy but welleducated abz said he felt tehran is going backwards although he was surprised by the number of women not covered up properly the iranians believe that the united states is now preoccupied in afghanistan and iraq which will prevent any us attack on iran abz said the us message on iran in the region is not loud and clear many are acting like iran is already nuclear power and iran sees the united states is not doing anything about it if middle east peace was achieved abz said the iranians would be unable to suggest they are the defenders of the palestinian cause 8 sbu abz said that fm mottaki was polite and courteous for change during the december visit he added that mottaki called him on january 3 to convey that the us had promised democracy and development in afghanistan but the result was more smuggling narcotics and terrorist acts mottaki went on to discuss yemen telling abz that saudi and us forces are attacking civilians in yemen 9 sbu amb holbrookes office has cleared this cable olson
