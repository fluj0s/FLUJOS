convenient i n the work amen my dear reader dear fellow man the thoughts you are reading now are rather confession than socalled foreword the equivalent of which they represented at their first editionor than an elementary treaty that is preimagined perhaps now although they are referring to an ironguardist monograph they are written by noniron guardist by romanian who is considered to be neither favourable to iron guardists nor against them and whose profession is not even that of historian but only fellow man of yours that was invited by one of the editors selfinvolved in monographic effort about ion moţa and vasile marin to share for you as far as the space in foreword allows some of the feelings and thoughts that were brought about by the meeting with the militant writing of these two ironguardist commanders this because of the only reason that previously i made and published the political wills of the six of the martyrs of the nation among them the leading three of the ironguard codreanu moţa and marin beside eminescu antonescu and iorga 1 with v the word s f eac h f the m by l ogi c as s emb l i ng of quo t ted ide s 1 wi th w h m with ll thre f th m t h i s is i n

slough of the present days that is worsening day by day to our nation it is lacking in worrying proportion the spiritual cultural and political horizon necessary for the great historical renewals 14 insomuch that although to the older romanian history it was not lacking the great missionary consciousnesses headed by eminescu 15 never the missionary spirit penetrated so deep in the thought feeling and act of whole generation as the romanian interwar miracle as far as it existed one lies especially in this creative flow coming from elites and spread up to the large mass of people there were not in this generation only great creative personalities crowded as it was in other epoch in the history of the romanian people but also large popular front for struggle and national creation catalysed especially by the ironguard youth 16 and the historiography in romania being still tributary to ideological censorship did not succeed unfortunately till now in analyzing and assessing without prejudices the complex ironguard phenomenon unique not only in romania but also in certain respects even in europe 17 18 1 3 r ă zvan c d r scu i n s ea rch f r t h lost i ro n g u rd p g 1 0 7 1 4 i

but i want to be well understood even from the very beginning the natural and more than any time the necessary asking the demystifying questions must not at all mean to fall in the other part in the exaggeration of the ironguard in denying even the possibility to have as anything that is human some imperfections hence an investigating effort made honestly and piously without any slightest resentment or preconceived idea and still essentially turning to any opinion or source met regardless of the degree of its conformity5 with the politically right version on the phenomenon and of l l that is connected to it but even with the ironguard one when there is you have an intuition perhaps that endeavouring myself to see the things in this manner i make choice necessarily for an unconventional honour of the invitation i want to comply with it means that i shall use it only as pretext to frolic on much larger areas and to invite you to remote correlations between elements that apparently have connection with the subject among others i outline even an s s ump t i on as far as i know entirely original on the second world conflagration all of them preferring to talk about especially aspects tackled little or even not at all in the searches the god gave the privilege to have them under my eyes regardless of the fact if they are or not convenient to the ironguard andor to somebody else saying in very few words after the contact that i had with the romanian nationalist writing with the six personalities that previously i mentioned that i have drawn up with the i r wn wor d s the political wills but not at all nl w i th th em i consider that the iron guard idea message being contained ba s i c l in the writing of codreanu moţa and marin is the s umm r f th fou r hol g s pel l i v ed an d av owe d to m arty d r om at least by the three thinkers and militants of the christian orthodoxy the authentic romanian spirit implicitly reason for which it is beyond to believe those who want to credit theses as that of supporting the guardiron by hitler of the fascism of the iron guard or of serve you right its subordination to moscow furthermore i do not exclude at all at least as working assumption the possibility that the world war ii itself should not have been but huge perverse and bloody bl uff strategic stage for getting the so much proclaimed globalization ie of the planetary unique state i have still in mind the words written on paper in 1945 secretly by constantin rădulescu motru in his secret diary the victory that the allied have in mind is against the nationalism but not against the industrialism or even against the german militarism that is why roosevelt in his speech that was going to be held if he did not die speaks about the good relations between nations and the same language is used by his successor truman in the congress of the united states the same cause explains also the approaching between the united states and the soviet republics the hate that both of them have against the nationalist ideology 19 and not accidentally all our ministers compete one another to ignore the differences of ethnicity in appointment of positions and in measures of administrative and school legislation in moldavia there are preferred the jews and in transylvania the hungarian as for us the real meaning of the word fa s c i s t is not

that i used to before would be even for spring of everlasting anxiety and grief there will be published in romania only political writings of deep passion but of superficial thinkings in journalism there will be prevailing the jew brainworkers that have the ability to write about anything and in fact about nothing seriously it will be continued the propaganda of the present day against the hiltlerite racism and tyranny artless pretexts for the jewish people to hide under them for the eyes of the romanian their real interests the romanian brainworkers for the fear of censorship as the censorship will continue also after being6 concluded peace will content themselves with banality especially the publications with philosophic content will refer only to being repeated the stereotypes preferred by the ruling party 21 2 1 i b i d em pag 3 7 but how could two political and economic systems so p r oc l m toril contradictory between them the capitalism and the communism the two omnipotent world superpowers respectively and even only to suggest to somebody an image of two arms app r nt l independent and opposite of the same overpotent but hardly visible brain this question worried i bored and thus in the spirit of fidelity to the scientific objectiveness as i specified on the other occasion 22 i cannot exclude the fact either that in the consistent dictionary of jewish personalities written only by jewish authors translated into romanian by team led by jewish woman and published in the year 2001 at hasefer publishing house jewish publishing house karl marx is presented as descendant both on the part of mother and of father as well of long genealogy of rabbis and some of the leaders on the top of the bolshevik coup detat and at the same time of the soviet communist regime are also present 2 2 i n th in rv ie w th t w s t k n t b mr s i r in iri n i p h d d itor f or r d io c u l r l ro mania on ug u s t 9 20 0 5 s re g r d s the wo r k m i h i m i n s c u s po l i c l wi l l interview published under brochure form in the same year in c r u n i v rs it r ă p ub l is hi ng h ous in b uch re s t at the same time in the same spirit of scientific honesty i cannot neglect some elements such as presence in the same dictionary of jewish personalities of comprehensive biographical heading dedicated to rotschild bankers or inclusion in the impressive work famous f r eem as on s published in 1999 in nemira publishing house of hitler and mussolini as well in the context in which the comparative analysis of the two biographical collections emphasizes the presence not at all rare in the world at level of the upper freemasonic leadership of some remarkable jewish personalities consequently when hearing such news is it unjustified from not to contest but to show only methodic circumspection in the spirit of descartes if you want on the veridicity of the way in which the contemporary manuals of history and most of official massmedia shall comment for instance on crucial realities of the universal history such as the world war ii the capitalism and the communism of course my dear reader i almost hear you already how perfectly rightfully you will ask now amazingly well but this mr crişan means that you consider the extraordinary assumption that hitler ie the person who ordered and led genocide on the jewish people was in fact jewish agent or this is really more than absurd except only if you sustain that for holocaust it is guilty completely somebody else or even neglect the existence of holocaust and your question is more than serious and more than essential to pretend even in the conditions of the present penal legislation that i did not hear it so i give you an answer and without denying neither the existence of genocide in mass on the jewish people nor the role had by hitler in its development i reproduce for you7 rightly and under i n v n tor b ene fi t some paragraphs that you will find them in the work p r oto c ol s of k oga i on thes nd as s ump ns w r i tten down an d aut hen c ted b io n coj i n r der t b d er s to d n d v uat ed r i ght l the ro m n j wi s h cl ai m s i n c l udi ng as s ome f t he m c l i t the hol c aust i n r man i here they are in the interested and as far as possible informed media on those occurred in those years there are theories and theses that connect v n the deve l op m t of the ho l oc au s t to j wi s h c m pl i c i ty of s ome j ew s f s om j wi s h l ea ders of s m j ewi s h i nte r s ts it is excluded that the jewish leaders nowadays not to know these theses that incriminate as most severely as possible the public opinion waits for definite and wellargued denial from the jewish people of those in question but whose duty is to do it by means of which to put an end to those speculations that give the holocaust more detestable dimension than the real one probably real we have in view those who connect the development of the holocaust to the racialist theories to which many jewish leaders of conscience adhered to even before coming to ruling of the nazism theories according to which man must intervene for removal from life or from procreation of the human specimen with defects and biologically unsuccessfully there is nation that should have such human wastes the ghetto life brought about also the appearance of large number of degenerated jews some jews of lower quality the assumption presented by bbc few years ago and belonging to an english historian according to whom the nazi concentration and extermination camps selected especially the jews that did not correspond to some certain anthropometric parameters the sign for being recognized these jews of l owe r q u l i ty seems to be first of all the poverty the impossibility to accede to life standard as civilized as possible anyhow it is well known the fact that then when hitler asked the jews to leave germany not all jews could or had where to go it seems that the l ea ders of the j ewi s h c omm i ty w r tho s w h c i d ed b l i s ts s u bmi tt ed to g erm n au tho r i s whi c h of th j ew s we r to l av g r man b ei n g thu s s v ed and whi c h of th j ew s r m i ne d i n g r m ny i n ord er to fi l l th ex t ermi nat i on c am p s something similar happened also in bassarabia little before the outbreak of the war tens of rich jewish families left bassarabia being informed on the fact that there are going to happen serious events events uncontrolled by laws similarly as in these years to leave for the saving palestine was not accessible to all jews in romania and this was done accoridng to some criteria including the biological criteria youth physical and intellectual endowment perfect health condition etc jewish oral sources accredits the idea that among jews it is well known this terrible dimension of holocaust only that the interdiction to comment publicly this stupefying possibility is absolute for the jews as regards the assumption of the english historian this one presented it under the form of theatre play that the second day after premiere was forbidden by the british censorship fact that had not happened for several centuries in england in the motivation of intervention the censorship authorities said that they do not put in discussion the interpretation given to holocaust on which only the specialists can say their opinion but they consider the s s i bi l i t of those who suffered in holocaust and that the authors thesis will hurt them too much unfortuna tely not even up to the present day the specialists first of all the jewish specialists in the history of the holocaust did not give an answer to the terrible accusations formulated by the english author whose text and whose arguments remained unknown were taken out of the public circuit of information 23 2 3 i n c j p ro t c l s f k g i n the ses n d s m p t i n s w ri t t d w n n d u t h ent i cate d b i n c j i n r d r t b u n d rs t d n d r i g

leaders even if they had operated that terrible selection it is not excluded to have done gai ns t their will this fact being in the described conditions the only possibility to save at least part of the fellow countrymen and it would not be honest to hide from you that i also said to the same but fortunately i found start of hope that i can break the deadlock the following editorial explanation

that even if he was perhaps mason at certain time he rose against masonry i shall invite you to think over the following quotation from the famous fr eem s on s in 1944 d ruggenborg noticed i think that mussolini and hitler are two adequate examples for the fact that such characters apparently against the freemasonry would have to be analyzed more carefully 30 hitler was initiated in 1922 in lodge in münchen it was the creation of freemasons from west hitler defended the interests of freemasonry and some of brothers that subsequently had influential positions within the german nationalsocialist parliament 3 1 3 0 m i l i an m d b r s c u f m u s f r ee m s n s n emir p u b l i s h i n g h u s b u char st 199 9 p age 8 3 3 1 i b i d em pag 7 91 d ruggenborg says how mussolini forbade not the freemasonry to which some fascists belonged but only the roman direction of the great orient of italy increasing thus the influence in italy of the united great lodge of england 32 3 2 i b i d em pag 8 3 thats right but even so the masonry an appendix to the hebrew hitler mason and implicitly s u bord i na ted to hebrew power nevertheless how could have been only for

work the r m n m as c r r the specification april 1929 gr 30 octavian goga militates for foundation of the fr eem s on i c chris an b l oc k mr octavian goga that although is mason has idea of the role of freemasonry as he dared to speal in the lodge about christianity mistake for which the masons will never forgive him mr goga went so far with his naivety as he proposed that the national lodge to be called the christianational lodgevtrifu 1932 50 5 0 h r i n est r s c u b ăl ce ş t i th r m n i n m so n i c rd er p ag 3 4 4 and nichifor crainic in r t ho d ox i s m an d m as onry saying about the reason of being present the bible as r i tua l ob j ec t in certain lodges he comments the romanian freemasons of scottish rite say we are not against the orthodoxism as they are those from the great orient we admit the bible we swear on bible what is it true from all these the masonry either scottish or the other one is kind of upsidedown religion it has temple cult organized with various rituals and some symbolic objects among these symbolic objects the scottish masonry accepts also the bible what does this mean that the masonry accepts the doctrine comprised in bible in this case it would be only religious sect as many sects emerged from christianity but the bible in masonry has another meaning lets consult the book of mr uge n lan nho ff the bible the protractor and the compasses he says are the three great lights of masonry b i b l the light above us t s do g ma tic ut ho rity bu t as an ex p r s i n f fai th i n n u n i v r s l mo r ord er it means common symbol as the protractor light within us and as the compasses light around us consequently in masonry the bible plays role of precise symbol as any other object for instance the compasses and the protractor instead of it even bowl could also mean the same symbol as the symbolic meaning is not linked to the dogmatic authority of bible but what does the bible also mean if you take out the dogmatic authority of the revealed doctrine is it not here about supreme mockery that is brought to the divine book reducing it to the1 meaning that may have an apron trowel or the compasses n i chif r c r ai

nichifor crainic says there is separation between the two masonries the scottish one and that of the great orient they work hand in hand only that the scottish one is said to be deist this does not mean in any case that it accepts the christianity the deism is philosophical conception that accepts at the origin of the world an abstract creative and impersonal principle but with which the world has nothing in common any more in fact this learning is only nuance of the atheism hidden atheism the symbolic formula from the scottish rite in the name of the great architect of all the worlds according to the interpretation that is given by mr u gen lan nho ff does not mean formula of faith in personal god it is maintained as purely symbolic expression to bring together those that reach the masonry with the religious beliefs of the church i b i d em p age 5 4 all my sayings have an objective character they are based on monumental book d i fr ei mau r er by mr ug l ann ho ff convinced mason published in 1929 in vienna the book was given to as gift by my distinguished friend dr hei nri c h s r the owner of amaltheea publishing house where it was published the work d i fr ei mau r r
