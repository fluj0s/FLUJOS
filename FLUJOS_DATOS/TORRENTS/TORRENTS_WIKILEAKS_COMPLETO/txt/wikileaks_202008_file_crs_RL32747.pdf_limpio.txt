government and finance division august 27 2008 abstract the united states is projected to undergo demographic shift as the aging of the baby boomers causes an unprecedented increase in the fraction of the population that is retired coupled with rising life expectancy this means under current policy steady increase in the portion of the population that is both out of the workforce and receiving social insurance beneﬁts from the government if left unattended this situation poses serious challenges for the governments ﬁscal position and the economy as wholehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747 order code rl32747 the economic implications of the longterm federal budget outlook updated august 27 2008 marc labonte specialist in macroeconomic policy government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747the economic implications of the longterm federal budget outlook summary the retirement of the baby boomers risi ng life expectancy and the rising cost of medical care are projected to place current federal policy on an unsustainable fiscal basis over the next several decades social security outlays are projected to rise from 43 of gross domestic product gdp toda to 61 of gdp in 2030 and medicare and medicaid outlays are projected to rise from 41 today to as much as 84 of gdp in 2030 and 125 of gdp in 2050 these increases in spending are not expected to subside after the baby boomers ve passed away without any corresponding rise in revenues this spending path would lead to unsustainably large budget deficits above 10 of gdp which would push up inte rest rates and the trade deficit crowd out private investment spending and ultimately cause fiscal crisis to avoid this outcome taxes would need to be raised or expenditures would need to be reduced altering taxes and benefits ahead of time would reduce the size of adjustments required in the future if the proceeds were used to increase national saving making changes ahead of time would also allow individuals time to adjust their private saving behavior nationa l saving can be increased by using the proceeds to pay down the national debt pur chase financial securities or finance individual accounts but if the budget savings is offset by new spending or tax cuts the governments ability to finance future benefits will not have improved individual accounts financed by increasing the budget deficit however would not increase national saving or reduce the g overnments fiscal imbalance and could exacerbate the governments fiscal imbalance over the 75year projection relatively small tax increases or benefit reductions could return social security to longrun solvency restraining the gr owth in medicare and medicaid spending is more uncertain and difficult however the projected increase in spending is driven more by medical spending outpacing genera l spending increases than by demographic change but it is uncertain how to restrain cost growth because much of it is the result of technological innovation that makes new and ex pensive treatments available if future medical spending gr ows more slowly than projected then the longterm budget outlook improves drama tically from governmentwide perspective social security or medicare trust fund assets cannot help finance future benefits because they are redeemed with general revenues the reason revenues are not projected to ri along with outlays is that these programs are financed on payasyougo ba sis current workers finance the benefits of current retirees in the future there will be fewer workers per retiree once pay asyougo system is up and running and f aced with an adverse demographic shift there is reform that can avoid making some present or future generation receive less than past generations under current policy future generations will be made worse off by higher taxes or lower benefits under reform that increases national saving some of that burden would be shifted to current generations overall current budget deficits remove the systems limited existing prefunding exacerbating the future fiscal shortfall reducing the curren t budget deficit is the most straightforward and concrete step that can be taken today to redu ce the future shortfall httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747contents p r j c t i n s s h w t h t c u r r n t f i s c l p l i c i s u n s u s t i n b l e1 the

projected to underg demographic shift as the aging of the baby boomers causes an unprecedented in crease in the fraction of the population that is retired coupled with rising life expectancy this mean s under current policy steady increase in the portion of the populati on that is both out of the workforce and receiving social insurance benefits from the government if left unattended this situation poses serious challenges for the governments fiscal position and the economy as whole1 projections show that current fiscal policy is unsustainable social security and medicare are financed primarily on payasyougo basis benefits paid to todays derly are based on dedicated payroll taxes collected from todays workers2 under current policy expenditures are projected to grow much more rapidly than revenues because of the increase in retirees relative to workers the worker to recipient ratio for social security is shown in figure 1 and is projected to fall from 33 workers per recipi ent today to 22 workers per recipient in 2030 the worker to recipient ratio for dicare is slightly lower than for social security but exhibits the same pattern over the longrun projection the projected decline in the worker to recipient ratio is driven by the retirement of the baby boomers declining fertility and increasing life expectancy which means that under current policy and retirement patterns workers will be spending larger fraction of their lives in retirement assuming workers and employers attitudes toward retirement do not change thus the increases in spending are not projected to subside after the baby boomers have passed aw ay worker to recipient forecasts are subject to large margins of uncertainty represented by the high and low lines in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs2 graph but even under the most optimistic of assumptions about population growth the worker to recipient ratio will fall well below historical levels in coming years source trustees of oasdi annual report 2007 table ivb2 note middle line based on trustees intermediate assumptions outside lines represent worker recipient ratios under alternative scenarios benefi ciaries include the retired survivors dependents and the disabled for elderly entitlement spending to keep in line with revenues in light of these demographic changes some combinati on of expenditures reduction and revenue increase will be required social security and medicare are financed through dedicated revenues the payroll fica ta x as shown below diverting existing general revenues to titlement spending cannot realistically cover the financing gap because of the sheer magnitude of the gap relative to total government revenues thus the financing problem should not be thought of as programmatic problem but rather as governmentwide problem and is best analyzed relative to economic output gdp the role of the social security and medicar trust funds will be discussed below figure 2 illustrates the projected increase in social security spending from the present to 2105 projected spending incr eases from 43 of gdp today to 58 of gdp in 2030 and leveling off around 56 of gdp in 2050 wher eas revenues are projected to stay fairly constant as proportion of gdp however there is high degree of uncertainty surrounding these projections the congressional budget office cbo estimates that there is 10 chance that spending will exceed 825 of gdp by 2050 and 10 chance that sp ending will be below 525 of gdp that year by contrast revenue projections show very narrow degree of uncertainty as figure 1 worker to

projections of expected outcomes shaded areas indicate the 80 percent range of uncertainty around each projection based on distribution of 500 simulations from cbos longterm model an 80 percent range means that there is 10 percent chance that actual values will be above that range 10 percent chance that they will be below it and an 80 percent chance that they will fall within the range in the scheduled benefits scenario workers each year receive full benefits as calculated under current law includes scheduled benefits and administrative costsb includes payroll taxes and revenues from the taxation of benefits social security projections are base d on straightforward assumptions since benefits are determined by specific rules and formulas and demographic projections by contrast there is obvious way to pr oject medicare and medicaid spending into the future because widely differing assu mptions can be made about how much will be spent per beneficiary under current law4 while there are fairly reliable projections of the number of medicare be neficiaries and cu rrent law broadly specifies the medical services that medicare and medicaid will cover little can be known about how medical treatment s costs and technologies w ill evolve in the future or what new treatment s will become available in th future new technologies could potentially lower costs through pr oductivity gains but they could also potentially raise costs by making new treatments available that are both more effective and more expensive figure 2 social security spending and revenues as of gdphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs4 5 glen follette and louise sheiner the sustainability of health spending growth federal reserve board of governors finance and economics disc ussion series 200560 september 2005 6 the 25 excess cost growth assumption is included for illustrative purposes as noted above it is not possible for spending to ri that quickly over the projection window in recent history the latter has occurred and as result health spending has risen more rapidly than gdp referred to as excess cost growth however there is guarantee that this pattern will continue in the future in fact it is unreasonable to extrapolate historical excess cost grow th indefinitely since that would result in health care eventually consuming 100 of gdp5 unfortunately although there is great uncertainty about what future rate of excess cost growth above growth in gdp per capita is reasonable medicare and dicaid expenditure projections are highly sensitive to this assumption to illustrate the sensitivity figure 3 compares cbos projection of medicare and dicaid spending to two other scenarios that the historical growth rates of 25 persisted and that excess cost growth is eliminated6 source congressional budget office the longterm budget outlook dec 2007 note excess cost growth refers to growth in spending per beneficiary above gdp per capita growth cbos projection is based on the assu mption that excess cost growth will eventually slow down enough to allow nonh ealth consumption to grow modestly in absolute terms specifically cbo assumes that excess cost growth will slow from 24 in 2018 to 11 in 2082 for medicare and from 22 in 2018 to 02 in 2082 for medicaid medicaid cost growth slows more because although cbo ca nnot assume that current federal policy can change it can assume that state policy would change and medicaid is jointly finan ced federalstate program in cbos projection combined medicare and medi caid spending increase from 41 in 2007 to 84 in 2030 and 125

vehicles have been projected to lead to only small increase in revenues when the baby boomers retire and may be more than offset by other factors that make revenues fall alan auerbach william gale and peter orszag continuedprojected to stay relatively constant so ev under the most benign scenarios these programs would put serious strain on general revenues under current policy7 even with the assumption that excess cost growth will slow total health care spending private and public would be nearly half of gdp by the end of the projection window although most of the policy debate in the past has focused on ways to reform social security it is medicare and medicaid that place far larger strain on the federal budget between now and 2030 social security spending is projected to increase by 15 percentage points whereas medicare and medicaid is projected to increase by more than 4 percentage points of gdp fr om 2030 to 2050 social security spending as share of gdp is projected to stay constant whereas medicare and medicaid spending is projected to increase by another 4 percentage points other government spending programs will also be affected by an aging society including supplemental security income ssi and health and pension spending for civil servants and veterans8 some analysts fear that the finances of the pension benefit guarantee corporation government agency that insures private defined benefit pension plans could also be negatively affected if firms do not take steps to improve their pension reserves9 on the other hand government spending on the young could fall as share of gdp as our society ages the increase in projected spending for these programs is small as share of gdp compared with the increases in social security medicaid and medi care spending however in 2000 social security medicare and medicaid accounted for about 85 of to tal federal spending on the elderly10 it is also unclear what assumptions shoul d be made to project current tax policy if current law were followed the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts would expire and an estimated 70 of taxpayers would eventually be subject to the alternative minimum tax amt due to inflation projection more consistent with current tax policy would arguably be to assume that the tax cuts do not expire and the amt is indexed for inflation this projection results in modest increase in revenues relative to gdp because of real bracket creep meaning that as incomes rise taxpayers on average shift into higher tax brackets11 likewise discretionary spending is set annuallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs6 11 continued reassessing the fiscal gap the role of taxdeferred saving tax notes july 28 2003 12 although some modest increase in the debt re lative to gdp is sustai nable it is uncertain how much therefore the fiscal gap assump tion is commonly used rule of thumb for estimating sustainabilitythrough the appropriations pr ocess so many valid assu mptions could be made about its future size an assumption that nondefe nse discretionary spending will stay close to its recent share of gdp seems reasonable for longterm projection under the above assumptions about cu rrent policy and future excess cost growth the increase in entitlement spending would not be matched by increases in general revenues or decreases in other spending and would need to be entirely deficit financed as result projected budget deficits would top 10 of gdp by 2030 and the national debt would rise at continually accelerating pace and rapidly surpass record levels relative to gdp if the tax cuts and amt patch were assumed to expire as scheduled under current w and nonentitlement spendi ng were reduced to all time lows relative to gdp policy would be sustainable for longer deficits would not exceed 10 of gdp until after 2050 but still become unsustainable within the next 50 years another way to measure the imbalance in fu ture government finances is through the fiscal gap concept which refers to the immediate reduction in spending or increase in taxes that would be required in order to prevent the federal debt from rising relative to gdp over the projection window12 cbo estimates fiscal gap of 69 of gdp over the next 75 years under curre nt policy to close this fiscal gap today would require immedi ately reducing total noninte rest spending by 38 raising total revenues by 37 or some combination of the two although these changes would be unprecedented delay would re quire even larger cuts in the future waiting until 2020 to change policy would increase the fiscal gap to 90 of gdp and waiting until 2040 would increase it to 152 of gdp necessitating more drastic adjustments although these options ar undesirable they cannot be postponed indefinitely if the projections prove to be accurate for reasons discussed in the next section policymakers do have wide array of choices c oncerning the form the tax increases or spending cuts could take however the effects of current policy on the economy figure 4 illustrates why current policy is considered to be unsustainable large budget deficits would cause the national bt to rise at an accelerating rate to unprecedented levels the united st ates has never financed peace time deficit above 6 of gdp and foreign countries ve not succeeded in financing persistent deficits that were much larger although larger us deficits were financed during wars wars are only temporary whereas the fiscal imbalan ce under current law is permanent in essence the rise in entitlement spending under scenario with continued excess cost growth is too larg and permanent to credibly be financed indefinitely by pushing its cost forward through borrowinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs7 source congressional budget office the longterm budget outlook dec 2007 notes the alternative fiscal scenario assumes that current policy is maintained the extended baseline scenario assumes that the tax cuts and amt patch expire and discretionary spending grows at the rate of inflation for the next 10 years if current policy is maintained and the assumptions in the projections hold the resulting deficits would likely cause inte rest rates on us treasury bonds to rise substantially both as result of the higher risk that the treasury might ultimately default on its debt and also because th governments demand for borrowed funds would raise the price of credit which is the rate of interest default would likely undermine financial stability because of the cen tral role that us treasury securities play in providing the financial system with liquidity as benchmark asset and as safe haven for risk averse investors if the government financed its rising budget deficit by increasing the money supply th rate of inflation would also increase significantly along with interest rates budget deficits of the size projected under current law could lead investors to doubt that the united states would be able to service its debt fully and on time which could cause the value of the dollar to drop precipitously because more than onehalf of the total outstanding debt of the united states is held abroad collapse of the dollar would have serious economic repercussions around the world presumably us budget policies will be ltered before this point is reached in the interim the deficit w ould still have negative impact on the economy long before the fiscal outlook reached cris is rising risk premium due to an unsustainable fiscal policy is only one reason for interest rates to rise the deficit also causes interest rates to rise because it is competing with private capital investment to be financed from finite pool of loanable funds from domestic and foreign lenders in terest rates rise to equilibrate the higher demand for credit w ith the supply of loanable funds which is national saving plus capital from abroad th deficits projected under current policy would exceed private saving and cause national saving to become negative whatever the cause of the increase in in terest rates the effect on the economy is the same higher interest rates reduce private capital investment lower rates of capital formation cause economic growth to slow leading to lower us living standards as measured by per capita income in the long run than there otherwise would have been foreign capital flows can offs et part or all of the decline in national figure 4 projected federal debt as share of gdphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs8 13 see crs report rl31775 do budget deficits push up interest rates and is this the relevant question by marc labontesaving but this will still result in lower us standards of living than if the budget had been balanced because the income from that capital will flow to foreigners instead of americans13 cbo estimates that by 2050 the deficits resulting from current policy would reduce the capital st ock by 40 and gro ss national product by 25 relative to what it would have been even if future budget deficits were reduced to the point where they became sustainable crowding out still results in smaller future economy than would otherwise be the case all else equal as result fewer resources would be available in the future from which the government can draw to finance the retirement of the baby boomers ultimately the resources available in the economy as whole will determine the level of government spending that is feasible in the future financing given level of spending from an economy that is smaller than it would have been in the absence of deficits would in turn require higher tax rates cbo longterm budget projections do not include any of the macroeconomic effects discussed in this section the pr ojected deficits are not assumed to affect interest rates or gdp throug h crowding out effects if macroeconomic effects were included the projections would be more unfavorable intere st payments on the national debt would be higher and tax revenues would be lower why cant the contributions of young workers finance the benefits that they have been promised proposals to eliminate the shortfall of revenues in the future to finance the entitlement benefits th at have been promised under cu rrent law have raised criticisms about fairness after all re tirees today paid the same or lower tax rates than todays workers and they are receiving the benefits equal to or exceeding what they were promised while this predicament may be pe rceived as unfair it is inherent in pay asyougo system where benefits are based on income and financed by those working at the time when the workerretiree ratio falls only two options are available under payasyougo benefits to retirees fall or taxes on workers rise payasyougo system is fundamentally different from the fully funded pension systems that private employers run where an employees contribu tions are invested to finance his future benefits rather than used to pay the benefits of current retirees even fully funded pension system would pay smaller monthly annuities when life expectancy rose however once payasyougo system is up nd running and suffers an adverse demographic shift there is reform that can avoid placing burden on some participants in the system by making some present or future generation receive less than past generations this burden can be thought of in terms of generations participating in the system rather than in terms of taxes and benefits for example the burden imposed by tax on todays work ers is equivalent to the burden of benefit cut when todays workers retire reform cannot avoid making some current or future generations pay disproportionately because th windfalls initially createdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs9 14

geanakopolis olivia mitchell and stephen zeldes social security moneys worth nber working paper 6722 september 1998 by payasyougo system have already been collected and spent by the early workers in the system who received benefits that far exceeded their contributions14 evaluating the generational equity of reform proposal is best done from governmentwide perspective and not from programmatic perspective for example proposals can appear to raise entitlement benefits paid to any given generation through general re venue transfers or increasin g the national debt but general revenue transfers or larger na tional debt must eve ntually be financed through higher taxes or lower government spending thus the burden has been shifted out of the program and into the general budget it has not been reduced trust funds cannot finance future benefits from governmen twide perspective according to law when benefit costs of social security and medicare part exceed income their trust funds can be draw n down to finance benefits it is often argued that benefits can be financed in full until their trust funds are exhausted which is projected to occur in 2041 and 2019 respectively medicare part b does not have dedicated revenue source and re lies heavily on genera l revenue transfers already while this is true from the pr ograms perspective the trust fund assets have effect on solvency from the overall governments perspective the trust funds hold us treasury securities which are nothing more than an iou from the government to the trust fund therefore social security and medicare can only be financed in full as long as the government can find the budgetary resources to finance them arguing that the trust fund securitie s provide those resour ces is equivalent to arguing that one has assets because ones right pocket contains an iou from ones left pocket the problem is not that from the trust funds perspective the government will not honor its treasury secu rities the problem is that from the governments perspective it must fi nd the budgetary resources to honor those securities under current policy it will lack the resources before the trust funds are exhausted because tax revenue is not projected to rise nor nonentitlement spending projected to fall in tandem with the rise in entitlement spending if the trust fund surpluses created futu re budgetary resources at the time they were accumulated then those surpluses c ould be thought of as having valid economic claim on those resources although the political process would still determine whether they received their claim unfortunately the governments overall fiscal position has precluded the possibl use of the surpluses to create future budgetary resources with the exception of 19992000 surpluses of the social security and medicare systems have not been and are still not being used to improve the governments fiscal condition in preparation for the retirement of the baby boomers inst ead they are being used to support the governments current fiscal stance in which revenues and other outlays are set at level where they are not in balance if the surpluses were being saved they could be given credit for freeinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs10 15 some argue that the surpluses have created real resources because the governments unified budget deficit would have been even larger had it not been for the trust fund surpluses this argument cannot be settled conclusively since there is way of knowing the size of the unified budget deficit in th counterfactual case where there had not been social security surpluses for comparis on of perspectives on the trust fund see kent smetters is the social security trust fund worth anything national bureau of economic research working paper 9845 july 2003 16 for an overview of social security reform and current legislation see crs report rl33544 social security reform by dawn nuschlerup future budgetary resources and an argume nt could be made that those freedup resources should then be devoted to the entitlement programs but since they are being diverted to finance nonentitlement spending the presence of trust fund surpluses has not created any future budgetar resources that can be used by future governments to honor the treasury securities held by the trust funds it is the governments unwillingness to balance revenues and outla ys outside the trust funds that prevents the trust fund surpluses fro m generating real resources that can be drawn down in the future15 focusing the reform debate on the g overnments overall fiscal position rather than the position of the programs trust fund also would have the benefit of avoiding budgetary maneuvers that may give the fa lse appearance that the programs fiscal position has been improved for example some reform proposals return the trust funds to solvency through general revenue transfers or by investing the entitlement surpluses in nongovernmental financial ssets either collectively or through individual accounts without increasing th governments tax revenue although these proposals make the programs fina ncial position look improved in isolation they do nothing to reduce the overall imb alance between government outlays and government revenues in the case of the latter surpluses diverted from financing general government outlays for investment purposes must be replaced by increasing the national debt in the abse nce of other policy changes for the government as whole higher earnings on the trust funds or individual accounts are offset by higher interest on the national debt economic effects of reform options reform may encompass several go als altering the redistributive characteristics of the system giving pe ople more choices bout the form their benefits take and so on th is section considers reform options in light of only one goal altering current policy to achieve future fiscal solvency because changes to the status quo are unavoidable under current projections achieving this goal is possible only through some combinati on of higher tax revenues and lower spending16 as demonstrated above maintainin g current policy through borrowing is unsustainable in cbos projection medicare and medicaid spending grow continually relative to gdp while clearly unrealistic as best guess of future outcomes it may make sense as projection of current policy for it underlines the fact that any policy changes to place the budget on sustainable path must include reductions in the growth rate of government health spending httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs11 17 it should be noted that from an economic perspective increasing resources available to the government is not important since theoretic ally the government can raise taxes to any level they desire at any time it is the in crease in the resources of the economy that is important 18 see crs report rl30708 social security saving and the economy by brian w cashellalthough the fiscal problems facing the g overnment in the future are large they are also distant budgetary resources are available for policy to continue along its current course for at least another decade or two in this light before evaluating specific reform proposals it is useful to explore th arguments for not postponing reform further reforming now rather than later has been justified on at least three grounds to reduce the scope of future polic changes to improve intergenerational equity and to reduce uncertainty prefunding to reduce the scope of policy changes one reason given to undertake reform toda is to reduce the scope of the policy changes that must be ultimately undertake n reform as defined in this report reduces the governments overall future fi scal shortfall reforms made today can reduce the future fiscal shortfall without re ducing the present fiscal shortfall for example benefit cut could be announced toda that did not go into effect until say 2030 but for reform to reduce the ultimate scope of future be nefit cuts or tax increases it must incorporate prefunding raising resources today and saving them so that more resources are available in the future to pay future benefits in other words smaller benefit cut could restore fiscal solvency if it went into effect today and its proceeds were saved th an if it went into effect in 2030 for example cbo estimates fiscal gap the immediate tax increases or spending cuts needed to stabilize the federal debt of 69 of gdp over the next 75 years under current policy waiting until 2020 to change policy would increase the fiscal gap to 90 of gdp and waiting until 2040 would increase it to 152 of gdp prefunding can be done through the gove rnment by paying down the national debt or investing the trust funds in pr ivate assets or through individual accounts the salutary effects of prefunding on the projected future fi scal imbalance are not limited to changes in social security and medicare any policy change that reduced the current budget deficit would reduce the g overnments future fiscal gap likewise current budget deficits incr ease that fiscal gap pref unding increases the resources available to the government and economy as whole by raising the national saving rate17 the additional saving is then available to finance additional capital investment spending or reduce reliance on foreign saving to finance current investment which increases national output greater nati onal output increases the future resources available to finance the needs of an ag ing population and reduces the governments fiscal shortfall18 the current fiscal stance of budget deficits by contrast eliminates the prefunding that would presently occur if the social security surpluses were saved and exacerbates the future fiscal shortfall for the same reasons but making the transition to prefunded system makes curre nt generations worse off because the prefunding must be financed either th rough higher taxes or lower benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs12 19 bosworth and burtless present internationa l evidence that saving in public pension system is offset by dissaving in the rest of the governments budget barry bosworth and gary burtless pension reform and saving working paper presented at the international forum of collaboration projects tokyo japan february 1719 2003 20 see crs report rs20165 social security and medicare lock boxes by david s koitz and geoffrey c kollman 21 peter diamond argues that these resources would not really be off the table because there would be political pressure to allow preretirement withdrawals from the accounts as is allowed for individual retirement accounts i ras and to substitute withdrawals from the accounts for government spending see pete r diamond macroeconomic aspects of social continuedprefunding requires high er revenues since under payasyougo existing revenues are already financing the benefits of current beneficiaries and because of the onbudget deficit trust fund surpluse s are already financing other government spending if reform were instead fina nced through borrowing it would not improve the governments ability to pay benefits in the future after adjusting for risk it would saddle future generations with explicit general government liabilities in the form of greater national debt if reform is financed by borrowing the increase in national saving in the trust fund or indivi dual accounts is offset one for one by the decrease in government saving th rough the larger budget deficit because benefits are tied to wages and gdp prefunding not only increases the resources available to finance existing benefits promised by current law it also increases the benefits themselves pre funding leads to some fiscal improvement because it does not increase the social security benefits of those already retired to make prefunding more effective strategy for improving future fiscal solvency benefits could be delinked from economic growth delinking social security benefits from economic growth is straightforward and can be accomplished by longer tying benefits growth to wage gr owth delinking medicare benefits from economic growth is less straightforward as long as demand for health care increases with income policies to increase gdp are also likely to increase the demand for medicare spending plans to reform through prefunding face difficult political dilemma how can commitment to prefund be main tained and reform plans pr eserve course of action that spans decades in the face of the comings and goings of new congresses every two years if reform plans cannot be preserved little may be gained from an economic perspective by reforming now19 this is particular concern since there could potentially be significant shortterm political gains and few political costs from diverting prefunding resources to unrelated policy goals history suggests that this concern is real one for example the congressional social security lock box failed to prevent social security surpluses from being diverted to finance other spending beginning in 200120 for this reason prefunded individual accounts might have an important political advantag over centralized government prefunding because they take those res ources off the table politically so that they could not be diverted to other uses however it is im portant to note that if individual accounts are debtfinanced rather than prefunded they will not be taking any resources off the table21 proponents argue that centrally cont rolled trust fund invested in privatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs13 21 continued security reform brookings papers on economic activity 2 1997 p 1 22 see crs report rl30520 the national debt

other government spending or the general revenue transfers to finance part b of medicare equal to 372 trillion that the trustees assume will occur some of th general revenues will be paid by future generations and some by present generations see tables iiic16 and iiic24 of the medicare trustees reportassets would be another way to take those resources off the table opponents argue that the earnings of centrally controlled trust fund could be si phoned off to finance other government spending just as easily as the interest earnings of the trust funds are siphoned off today intergenerational equity another reason given for undertaking refo rm sooner rather than later is to pursue intergenerational equity the choice for policymakers is whether to spread the tax increases or spending cuts ove r all generations beginning now through prefunding or whether to concentrate th policy changes on future generations financing government spending through budget deficits does not impose less of burden than tax increases or other spendi ng cuts it shifts the burden forward to future generations through lowe r saving rate and capital stock22 the longer reform is postponed the greater the benefit reduc tions or tax increases imposed on future generations economic theory cannot judge th desirability of reform that shifted to prefunding because it is question of in tergenerational equity is it fair that future generations are treat ed worse than current and past generations under current policy because of the effects of advers demography on payasyougo system prefunding would place less of burden on fu ture generations but would be unlikely to eliminate it since past generations received benefits that exceeded their contributions under current policy the trustees report for social security and medicare estimated respectively that there will be transfer of resources from future generations to past and present genera tions of workers equal to 136 trillion for social security and 125 trillion for medicare in present value terms23 some would argue that it is fairest to spread the voidable burdens of payasyougo system among all generations rather than placing the entire burden on future generations others would argue that placing the burden on future generations is justified since they will be wealthier than current genera tions because of future economic growth in the case of medicare and medicaid anot her argument against current generations bearing more of the burden is the uncer tainty about whether projected spending increases will actually materialize deciding between benefit reductions and tax increases to restore future fiscal solvency is often viewed through the prism of fairness this is somewhat misleading in the aggregate there is not much difference in fairness between cutting benefits and raising taxes on the same individual for equity c onsiderations the generation affected by the reform is more important th an the form that refo rm takes reformshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs14 24 proposed benefit reductions to close the fisc gap are relative not absolute reductions if future generations receive only the benefits that can be financed by dedicated revenues under current law their dollar amount will still exceed the benefits paid to retirees today however these benefits will be lower relative to earnings because future earnings and life expectancy will be higher likewise tax increases would reduce aftertax income as share of future income but would still leave fu ture citizens with higher incomes than today in absolute terms similarly under current law even t hough the retirement age has increased future retirees will spend more years in retirement collecting benefits than current retirees because of increases in life expectancy 25 the effect of number of reform proposal s on system solvency can be found in social security advisory board why action should be taken soon washington dc july 2001 the report also illustrates how much larger reforms would need to be if postponedundertaken now can raise taxes or lower be nefits on current generations or future generations reforms postponed to the futu re will only affect future generations however social security doe s provide favorable benefits to individuals who are low income widows dependents and the di sabled and maintaining the favorable treatment they currently receive would pend on the nature of the benefit cuts reducing uncertainty finally another rationale fo r undertaking reform sooner ra ther than later is that it can reduce uncertainty workers trying to plan their optimum private saving behavior today are hampered by uncertainty concerning the benefits that will be provided by the government in the future some policy uncertainty is caused by the projected future fiscal shortfall and can be reduced if the shortfall is reduced on the other hand there is forecast uncertainty whic h complicates attempts to modify policy ahead of time since policy responses could turn out to be larger or smaller than what turns out to have been needed as demonstrated in figure 3 the correct rate of future excess cost growth for medicare and medicaid is the largest source of long term forecast uncertainty uncertainty has implications for the type s of reforms that can be undertaken policy options that affect individuals when they are old must be adopted far ahead of time if individuals are to be given time to adapt to those changes for example benefit cuts must be announced far in adva nce if individuals are to be given the opportunity to save more in their working ears to offset benefit cuts by contrast policy options that affect individuals when they are young such as tax increases can be adopted more rapidly this implies that postponing reform is likely to bias the eventual resolution toward tax increases rather than spending cuts reform options reducing benefits social security24 relatively minor changes in benefit calculations could bring social security outlays back in line with revenues under the intermediate scenario25 for example if initial benefits were indexed to price inflation instead of wage growth outlays would fall significantly in the long run if this were done benefits would still be rising in nominal terms and keeping constant in real terms but the replacement rate of benefits compar ed to wages would fall the advantagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs15 26 congressional budget office the long term budget outlook december 2005 p 22 27 see barry

government would rise over time as the spread between wages and prices grew to offset the increasing fiscal imbalance since budgetary savings grow under this approach larger reductions would be needed if postponed to the future disa dvantage of this proposal is that it is not directly tied to the size of the financial shor tfall so if the shortfall turned out to be smaller larger than expected benefits would be cut more less than needed to restore solvency cbo estimates that one proposal along these lines could reduce outlays to 47 of gdp from 64 of gdp under current law by 205026 this would keep social security spending n ear its current level as share of gdp to avoid reduction in their standard of living in retirement following benefit cut workers may choose to save more of their income during their working years or work longer thus to the extent that social security substitutes for private saving benefit cuts could lead to higher saving or labor supply which in turn would boost economic growth27 but to the extent that social security substitutes for family income transfers households fail to plan ahead for retirement saving or private saving is driven by other motives such as bequest motive or precautionary saving reduced social security benefits would not influence private saving furthermore the relatively unequal distribution of us w ealth suggests that private saving may not be that sensitive to changes in social security at the top of the income distribution which accounts for most us saving soci security makes up little if any of an individuals retirement income for example elderly in the highest quartile of the income distribution received 21 of thei r income from social security in 200228 at the bottom of the income distribution si zable fraction of amer icans have very little private saving and would presumably ffer reduction in living standards rather than raise their saving rate in light of benefit cut29 an alternative approach to reducing benefits would be to raise the retirement and early retirement ages this appro ach could avoid reducing monthly benefit payments although lifetime be nefits would fall since retirees would begin to collect benefits later in life pr oponents justify this approach on the grounds that rising life expectancy means that retirees are collecting benefits for longer than previous retirees in effect longer life expectancy has inadvertently caused lifetime benefits to increase in addition raising the retirement age would directly increase output by keeping workers in the labor force longer thereby providing the economy as whole with more resources to cope with an aging society one study estimates that raising the retirement age to 70 would increase employment rates among men age 5574

policy to 56 of gdp31 medicare and medicaid unlike social security there are straightforward proposals to reduce the l ongterm growth in medicare and medicaid spending social security spending is ba sed on specific formulas that can be altered to reach desired spending level health spending by contrast is not currently set directly by the government rather the government chooses the services it will finance and the spending on those treatments ultimately depends on supply and demand few concrete policy proposals have yet been put forward that grapple with medicares longterm fiscal imbalance so little is known about how much savings could be garnered from the proposals discu ssed below it is likel that none of the proposals adopted in isolation c ould close the fi scal imbalance32 the central challenge for policymakers is to reduce excess cost growth if spending on the health programs grew at the rate of gdp they would not place significant strain on government finances however there is way to know what rate of excess cost growth will occur in th future forecasters assume that the rise in health spending will outpace gdp growth because it has consistently done so in the past it is possible that technology or consumer preferences would change on their own such that excess cost growth wa nes without government intervention but it may be more prudent to assume that it will not wane given historical patterns then the challenge becomes finding policy actions that can restrain excess cost growth33 some economists argue that there are structural biases toward excess cost growth in the market for health care th at could be altere d by policymakers policymakers can attempt to restrain cost growth through the demand side or supply side of the market demand could be reduced by shifting medicare costs from the government to the beneficiaries which would also directly reduce the governments fiscal gap and alter gene rational equity if applied to current generations shifting costs to the benefi ciaries in the medicaid program is arguably less philosophically compatible since it is lowincome support program demand could be reduced by making beneficiar ies bear

of changes to medicare since this cost estimate was conducted it should be vi ewed as giving only an order of magnitude estimate to the cost savings of the proposal 37 adverse selection is caused by asymmetric information because patients know more about their health conditions and therefore potentia l medical costs than insurers because of asymmetric information sick patients will find an average price offered by insurers profitable and healthy patients will find it unfavorable as result healthy patients could be driven out of the market driving average prices uppremiums34 if desired higher premiums coul d be meanstested to avoid negative effects on lowincome individuals be neficiaries currently pay about 25 of premiums and general revenues pay the remainder ho wever higher premiums may have little effect on medical spending of participants alt hough it could reduce participation since it would not influence the marginal cost of specific treatments because premiums finance the overall insurance not specific treatments to influence marginal costs raising deductib and coinsurance rates would be more effective but even if marginal costs were increased some analysts are skeptical that consumers could make well educated decisions based on price since choosing between medical procedures unlike most goods involves highly specialized knowledge of medicine and unless rules on supplemental covera ge were altered privatelypurchased supplemental plans or medicaid could cancel out policy changes that made marginal costs higher and shift health spending from medicare to private spending and medicaid35 another way to reduce demand would be to restrict enrollment one way would be to raise the age of eligibility in fact unlike social security medicares eligibility age is not already rising under current w modifying medicares eligibility age to match social securitys would save billions of dollars but the saving would still be modest in light of the programs future projected fiscal shortfall36 budgetary savings is not rationale for reducing demand in and of itself from an economic perspective reducing demand is desirable if the benefits of receiving the health care are outweighed by the cost s to society of their provision medicare may provide service elder health care th at could not be as efficiently provided by the market notably because of adverse selection37 if higher costs to beneficiaries caused them to drop out of part b or recei ve too little care notably preventive care medicare spending could fall to socially suboptimal level nonparticipation could be avoided by making participation mandatory lthough this would increase budgetary pressures on the other hand ce patients do not directly bear the costs medical care may be

limiting the coverage of newly developed treatments consequences of such an approach are that some medical spending would cease and some would be shifted to private spending and private insurance some argue that another path to restraining cost growth lies with transforming medicare from government monopsony to competitive market of private insurers including the health maintenance organization hmo model that dominates employerbased coverage38 this approach is sometimes referred to as premium support the rationale behind this argume nt is that government lacks the profit incentive competitive pressures and market savvy needed to restrain costs others argue that government provision has two advantages over competition that make it more suitable first onl government has monopsony bargaining power and economies of scale which it does not fully use at present and these can be used to hold down costs more effectively39 second an efficien t insurance mechanism broadly pools risk so that the premiums of the healthy offset the costs of the sick health insurance could only be efficiently provided in competitive markets if adverse selection and cherry picking private plan s only serving healthy individuals to lower costs could be avoided th eoretically adverse selecti on could be avoided through some combination of nondiscriminatory coverage riskadjus ted premiums and medicare regulating the types of coverage th at any plan must provide but designing these tools effectively has been difficult in practice40 in any case as an empirical matter hmos do not have long enough track record to reach consensus on whether they can reduce costs continually or only on onetime basis although many analysts credit hmos with reducing cost growth following their adoption in the 1990s

medicare sp ending it would have to be set up differently than the current medicare advantage system43 in the medicare advantage system the government sets the minimum beneficiary premiums the basic benefits offered and the payments to companies thus companies are not really free to compete on price and efficien cy gains cannot be translated into lower spending instead companies compete on the medical services offered they must offer basket of services set by the g overnment and can add additional services to that basket so that holding governme ntmandated premiums constant efficiency gains are translated into higher profits or greater medical spending because the company will offer the beneficiary more medical services preventing companies from competing on price is way to reduce but not likely eliminate adverse selection for companies to compete on price and the market to function efficiently other tools would need to be f ound to prevent adverse selection some analysts argue that reforms to medicares payment system could also generate cost savings health care providers are paid on feeforservice basis which may give them an incentive to overprovide medicare payments are set by complex formulas that may not always match the price that medicare could secure if bargained in the market once tr eatment is approved by medicare the government leaves it to physicians who have little incentive to consider the governments objective of limiting spending to prescribe its use some researchers argue for evidencebased medicine claiming that costsaving could be achieved by substituting less expensive treatments that are similarly effective44 for example some researchers claim that the differences in outlays by region cannot be explained by cost of living and patient characteristics45 however these types of reforms may lead to onetime rather th an continuous cost savings two other proposals to limit supply meet skepticism among economists first queuing rationing undersupply through waiting lists is widely used to reduce costs in foreign countries with nationalized h ealth care systems but economists are skeptical that the benefits of the lower financial costs exceed the nonfinancial costs of queuing the nonfinancial cost can be thought of as the monetary price patients would be willing to pay to avoid the wa it second cutting medicares payments to providers cannot be used to restrain cost growth on an ongoing basis while this strategy has been used in the past for s hortterm budgetary savings to use it on an ongoing basis would require providers to accept continually lower payments for their services eventually this would cause pr oviders to withdraw their services and some analysts have argued that this has ccurred when payments

of this report but many economists doubt that excess cost growth could be reduced in medicare and medicaid unless it is also reduced in private health care spending46 in other words private corporations insurers and medical providers would have to change their behavior in order for health spending nd the budget to be placed on sustainable path some of these changes in private spending may come about through private sector initiatives and some through public policy changes many proposals could potentially replace medicare spending with private spending either by individuals or by the corporations from which they retired or spending by state and local governments some proposals adopted in isolation would shift some spending from medicare to medicaid which would limit th

spending reform options raising taxes the projected tax increases required to place social security back on solvent financial path are not large compared with historical changes in tax revenues if social security is maintained on payasy ougo basis tax increases of about 1 of gdp are projected to be needed by 2050 assuming because of the overall budget shortfall that general revenues are unavaila ble to place this total in perspective tax revenues increased by 25 percenta ge points of gdp between 1993 and 1999 with little evidence of negative ramifications for the economy if taxes are increased sooner and the revenues saved the project ed increase required to bring the system back to solvency is smaller projected tax increases required to keep medicare and medicaid on sustainable paths and maintain benefits are much more daunting under cbos projection of current policy taxes would need to rise immediately by 7 percentage points of gdp to close the 75year fiscal gap and more if tax increases are postponed gradual tax increases of these magnitudes need not be ruled out as infeasible since many western european countries collect more than 50 of gdp in tax revenue compared with 29 of gdp for the total of state local and federal government in the united states in 2007 alternatively if there were excess cost growth taxes would need to increase about 15 per centage points of

progressi ve through graduated rate structure progressivity would be hard er to achieve with consumption taxes consumption taxes would shift more of the burden of reform to the existing elderly because they tax existing saving when it is drawn down besides tax rate increases there could be changes made to the tax treatment of social security to raise revenue for example if policymakers wanted to make the system more progressive the income ceiling on the payroll tax could be removed for social security there is none for medicare alternativel social security benefits could be taxed in full currently about tw othirds of recipients pay tax on their benefits whether these changes are consistent with the overall tax system depends if social security is viewed as pension or income transfer system revenues could be raised within medicare through higher premiums for parts b or d if the longterm fiscal imbalance were closed through higher taxes raising taxes earlier and saving the proceeds through prefunding would re quire smaller tax increases than if tax increases were post poned earlier tax increases would be more economically efficient than larger increases later and would affect generational equity by shifting some of the cost of reform to present generations if taxes were raised today and the proceeds not saved then the tax increases required in the future would not be reduced there is widespread belief that lower spending is better for economic growth than higher taxes but there is not strong evidence backing this belief economic theory is ambiguous as to the effects of higher taxes on growth in general and it would also depend on what form the ta x increase took either way empirical evidence suggests that the economic effect is small for modest changes in the case of closing the fiscal gap however the estimated changes are much larger cbo estimates that eliminating the overall fiscal shortfall through higher marginal taxes would cause the economy to be 5 to 20 smaller in 2050 compared to if government spending were cut under this projection the economy would still be much larger than it is today47 cbo notes that there is little confidence surrounding these estimates ce there is comparable histori cal experience and little consensus over what model best descri bes how taxes affect the ec onomy furthermore cbo notes that the economic effects would be significantly smaller if revenue were raised by broadening the tax base instead of by raising marginal rates taxes can affect economic growth by influencing labor supply both the decision to work and the number of hours worked or the saving rate empirical evidence is inconclusive as to the effects of taxes on saving because the decision to save is very complicated one made over time and motivated by many different factors thus results turn out to be highly sensitive to the model used currentlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs22 48 see theresa devine demographics social

decision to save at the margin rais ing taxes by several percentage points of gdp could reduce private saving by reducing aftertax income empirical evidence suggests that labor supply is relatively unresponsive to tax changes most people particularly men and single women will work fulltime regardless of tax rates48 in any case individuals would not be expected to change their behavior as much in response to an increase in taxes for soci security compared with normal tax increase because reducing labor supply would directly reduce the individuals benefits one demographic group whose labor

on the economy even when those policies are intended to reduce entitlement spending when entitlement spending is influenced by current income spending policies can also act as tax by reducing benefits

out of the existing social security system through benefit offsets and diverting some of the payroll tax some policymakers have instead recommended that the accounts be added on to social security by not altering present law benefits and not diverting the payroll tax the effects of add on continuedreform options individual accounts individual accounts have been proposed as potential solution to social securitys financing problems51 proponents argue that pa yroll tax revenues could be diverted to accounts that would be ow ned by the individual and these accounts could be invested in financial securities the high rate of return earned by the accounts it is argued could be used to re duce social securitys fiscal shortfall switching social security to syst em of individual accounts partially or completely raises several economic issues that will not be addressed in this report including questions of risk sharing adverse selection moral hazard annuitization and bequests52 furthermore individual acc ounts alone would not address the systems current social goals which include redistribution and the provision of benefits for survivors dependents and th disabled which currently account for 38 of the systems outlays this report will only analyze the claim that individual accounts can improve the gove rnments fiscal position as illustrated below individual account s would not be selffinancing because savings to the government from the in dividual accounts would not occur until the account holders retire all payroll tax revenues are cu rrently dedicated to the payment of benefits to current retirees or the financing of general government spending despite the social security rplus there are unused funds available to finance the creation of individual acc ounts thus individual accounts would need to be financed by immediately raising taxes reducing spending or issuing treasury securities increasing the budget deficit this is sometimes referred to as the transition cost of imple menting individual accounts53 individual acc ounts are one vehicle through which prefunding can be implemented if financed through higher ta xes or lower government spending then all else equal the governments overall fiscal position will improve national saving will rise private investment will increase nd this will increase the future size of the economy54 as noted above individual accounts are not necessary for prefunding httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs24 54 continued accounts on the economy are the same as carve outs if the accounts are financed through higher taxes or lower spending then they will increase national saving although less than one for one because there will be some offset in private saving which will increase gdp but if they are financed through larger budget deficits they will not contribute to national saving and therefore not incr ease gdp however matter how they are financed add on accounts do not reduce the governments fi scal gap because they do not reduce social securitys liabilities nor introduce new revenue stream that can be used to finance social securitys liabilities 55 according to media reports the administration stated that this was its plan at an economic summit in december 2004 edmund andrews bush puts social security at top of economic conference new york times december 15 2004 56 since the individual accounts do not reduce the governments fiscal gap individuals with rational expectations would not be expected to respond to the creation of the accounts by reducing their private saving nevertheless if individuals perceived the individual accounts as new net wealth to them they might decide that they need to save less to meet their retirement needsprefunding can also occur if the government reduces the national debt or collectively invests in private securities howeve r individual accounts may also be created without prefunding by increasing the size of the budget deficit55 if this occurs additional economic resources will be generated to reduce the governments fiscal imbalance any gain in government revenues from the indi vidual accounts will in theory be offset by higher interest payments on the national debt because the individual accounts were debt fi nanced and lower rate of return earned by private investors because the increased demand fo r private securities and government debt would push down the return on private securities and raise the interest rate that the government must pay to finance its debt if individual accounts equal to 24 of payroll 0816 of gdp were introdu ced without new source of revenue as the presidents commission to strengthen social security proposed the effect on interest rates and private rates of return c ould be significant the creation of debt financed individual accounts is zero m game for the economy as whole because they do not raise the national saving rate the rise in private saving is canceled by the decline in public saving nor the national cap ital stock all else qual so they do not increase national income most proposal s do not allow accounts to be topped up with voluntary private contributions so there is little reason to think that the increase in private saving will exceed th decrease in private saving56 this argument can be made more concrete using official estimates provided by social security

account with an offse tting reduction in benefits based on diverted amounts compounde d at real rate of return 35 which is the source of budgetary savi ng to the government since option 1 does not identify any new source of revenue to finance the accounts they can be considered to be debtfinanced it is analyzed here because it is the only option that relies solely on individual acc ounts options 2 and 3 are combination of individual accounts and bene fit reductionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs25 57 the income rate refers to payroll tax revenue collected by the social security system the cost rate refers to the benefits paid by the so cial security system taxable payroll is the tax base from which payroll revenues are collected 58 since the graph shows the change in the income and cost rates caused by introducing individual accounts future financing crisis is averted only if the proposals generate enough additional revenues to cover the entire financing gapfigure 5 illustrates the change in the income and cost rates of the social security system as percentage of taxa ble payroll caused by introducing individual accounts57 diverting 2 of the payroll tax to individual accounts would reduce the income rate by an amount that would st abilize at about 133 of taxable payroll in decade assuming twothirds of eligible workers participate however individual accounts would not lead to any significant decline in the cost rate for many years since funds would not be withdrawn fro m individual accounts which reduces the cost rate through the social security benefit offset until they retire the reduction in the cost rate steadily increases ove r time approaching 275 of payroll in 2075 as larger individual accounts are amassed and then drawn down for the first 40 years after the introduction of individua l accounts the accounts are projected to generate less revenue than wa s being diverted from benefi ciaries roughly 40 years after the introduction of i ndividual accounts when enough retirees had spent their entire career making contributions the reduc tion in benefits from the offset would exceed the revenue lost from 2 marginal payroll tax cut after that the savings to the government would grow and eventually become large58httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs26 59 the accounts are unlikely to raise private saving by more than the fall in public saving since the accounts come from tax revenue and cannot be supplemented by private saving contributions 60 this graph does not illustrate the overall budget deficit under system of individual accounts but rather the change in the budget deficit caused by the introduction of individual accounts figure 5 change in social securitys finances from introducing 2 individual accounts source chief actuaries of social security administration memorandum to presidents commission to strengthen social security december 2001 p 53 notes estimates based on commissions option 1 reform plan with 667 participation rate it assumes accounts equal to 2 of payroll are introduced in 2004 thus individual accounts would exacerba the financing problems of the social security system for roughly 40 years but improve the systems finances from that point on whether this is desirable can only be dete rmined by judging the effect of the accounts on the economy and governme nt as whole such accounts would improve the governments overall finances and national saving only if the revenue shortfalls caused by them in the first 40 years of their existence were financed through tax increases or benefit reductions59 by contrast figure 6 illustrates the projected increase in the unified budget deficit comp ared with current policy if the individual accounts are debt financed i introduced without an accompanying source of financing60 as explained above the eff ect on the unified budget balance is the most meaningful measure because it is the only one that clearly identifies the cost of reform to the government as whole httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs27 61 at some point beyond the 75year projec tion window the effect of introducing debt financed individual accounts on the budget defic it may turn positive but projections of long enough duration to answer that question are not available figure 6 change in unified budget balance from introducing 2 debtfinanced individual accounts source

667 and 100 participation rate it assumes accounts equal to 2 of payro ll are introduced in 2004 negative number signifies an increase in the deficit over the first 40 years of the accounts ex istence the decline in the income rate would exceed the decline in the cost rate and the government would have to borrow the difference increasing the national debt and interest payments on the debt once the decline in the cost rate exceeded the decline in the income rate the effect of the individual accounts on the budget would be positive however this saving would be offset by the higher interest payments on the larger national debt as long as the additional interest payments on the debt plus the decline in the income rate exceed the decline in the cost rate the net ffect of the individual accounts on the budget deficit would be negative figure 6 indicates that indi vidual accounts if debt financed worsen the governments fiscal shortfall through 2075 61 because the private assets in indi vidual accounts are growing through the accumulation of interest these results may seem puzzling although the assets in individual accounts are growing the debt i ssued by the government to finance the accounts is also growing because of inte rest accumulation the individual accounts offset government benefits at higher rate of return than the interest payments on government debt 30 so

government money it is the benefit offset not the earnings of the accounts that reduce the governments liab ilities but because so much debt must be issued immediately it takes more th an 75 years before the accounts pay for themselves in fact the actuaries of th ssa make two sets of assumptions both of which are illustrated in figure 6 since the accounts are voluntary they estimated the costs under the assumptions 1 that 667 of eligible individuals elect to participate and 2 that 100 elect to pa rticipate comparing the results under the two assumptions leads to result th at may buck conventional wisdom when individual accounts are debt financed the co st to the government can be reduced by reducing the participation rate the presidents commission on social s ecurity made it clear that option 1 would not avert future financing crisis62 for that reason it also proposed two further options that coupled the introduction of individual accounts with benefit reductions but it follows from the data presented on option 1 that it is only the benefit reductions not the i ndividual accounts if debt fi nanced that improve the systems financial position in options 2 and 3 through 2075 depending on the details some indivi dual account proposals could worsen the governments fiscal outlook by adding bene fits or administrative costs to the current social security system many proposal s allow the individual accounts balance to be left as bequest to heirs when th owner dies when an individual and if applicable his widow or her widower dies prematurely in social security the excess of taxes paid over benefits collected impr oves the systems financing individual accounts may require regulatory oversight financed from genera l revenues eg to ensure that the accounts are not being inve sted fraudulently the government may feel obligated to bail out individual acc ounts with general revenue in the event of stock market crash individual accounts may receive better or worse tax treatment than social security benefits which w ould worsen or improve the governments finances respectively for example 100 of withdrawals from trad itional individual retirement accounts iras ar taxed while 0 to 85 of social security benefits are taxed depending on income level ho wever contributions to iras are deducted from taxable income while the employees half of social security contributions payroll taxes are not if withdrawals from individual accounts r eceive the same tax treatment as iras it would increase tax revenues if contributions receive the tax treatment of iras it would decrease revenues it should briefly be noted that the ec onomic benefit of in troducing individual accounts is unrelated to its effects on gove rnment finances the economic benefit of individual accounts is that it could potentia lly lead workers to view social security less as tax and benefit prog ram and more as pension if so it could reduce the distortions to work and save currently caused by social security for example workers may be more likely to continue working after they become eligible for retirement if they can continue accumulating contributions in their individual account

conclusion the retirement of the baby boomers in creased life expectancy and the rising cost of health care are projected to make current policy unsustainable in the long run increases in spending are not expected to subside after the ba by boomers have passed away to keep the overall budget on sustai nable path over the next 50 years either the projected rise in social security medicare and medicaid spending will have to be contained or tax revenues will have to be increased or both determining the right balance between benef it reductions or tax increases depends on peoples desire to spend future income gains on health vs nonhealth consumption expenditures and whether those expenditures can be more effi ciently and fairly supplied by the private sector or government programs based on cbo projections reduction in the growth of medicare and medicaid has to be part of the solution since it continually outpaces gdp growth current policy is projected to eventually cause budget deficits to exceed 10 of gdp and the federal debt to grow at an accelerating rate that would surpass record levels if current policy is maintained until 2030 cbo projects that some combination of tax increases and spending reductions totaling 115 of gdp would be needed at that point to place the budget on sustainable path for the next 75 years however if reforms are made ahead of time the ultimate size of required tax increases or benefit reductions could pot entially be reduced for example cbo projects that immediate action would reduce the needed tax increases or benefit reductions to 7 of gdp for this to occur the revenues generated through tax increases or benefit cuts would have to be dedicated to hi gher rate of public saving thereby boosting economic growth if the revenues are in stead spent on other government spending or tax cuts the ultimate size of future benefit cuts and tax increases will not have been reduced grappling with the fiscal so lvency issue is also complicated by the inability to bind future congresses to longterm spending path even if revenues raised are initially used to reduce the budget deficit there is the risk that the fiscal improvement will be undone by future congresses determining how much bene fits and revenues should be altered ahead of time is difficult however because of the wide degree of uncertainty associated with longhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32747crs30 65 for examples of specific proposals see peter diamond and peter orszag saving social security washington dc brookings institution press 2004term government projections in particular if the projected future excess medical cost growth does not materialize the budget outlook would dramatically improve crafting solution to restore fiscal solv ency faces the fundamental question of how much can be done at this point to prevent excess cost growth that has not yet happened and may never happen on the other hand acting in advance may expand the array of feasible options restoring the system to solvency ahead of time would allow individuals enough forewarning th at they could adjust to future benefit reductions without disrupting their spending patterns for this reason if reform is postponed it is more likely to result in ta x increases since notions of fairness make benefit cuts to those already retired unlikely what has already contributed to the fis cal imbalance is todays budget deficits and the simplest and most concrete step that can be taken to reduce the fiscal gap is to reduce the current budget deficit the salutary effects of prefunding on the future fiscal imbalance are not limited to changes in social security and medicare any policy change that reduced the current budg et deficit would reduce the governments future fiscal gap likewise current budg et deficits increase that fiscal gap social security faces financial imbal ance that experts agree can be eliminated through relatively small increases in taxes and decreases in benefits65 and the changes could be minimized if they were prefunded today the system faces immediate financial shortfall on the contrary it is currently generating surpluses and would not put pressure on the rest of the budget in its current state until at least 2017 according to the social security trustees individual accounts are not substitute for benefit cuts or tax increases although they c ould be vehicle for either debtfinanced individual accounts by themse lves are projected to worsen the fiscal outlook over the next 75 years and not incr ease gdp through higher national saving medicare and medicaid face much larger and more intractable financial problems than social security historically health care spending generally and health care spending on the elderly in par ticular have risen mu ch more rapidly than has overall economic output it is impossible to know if this patte rn will continue in the future but if it does medicare and medicaid under current policy risk overwhelming budgetary resources yet unlike social security spending on the health programs cannot be c ontrolled directly unless access is restricted or rationed to reduce future medicare and medicaid sp ending the government must find way to reduce the price or quantity of elderly health care provided quantity can be reduced either through restrictions on the medical treatments offe red or by lowering demand demand could possibly be reduced through higher costs to the recipient but the link between price and demand will always be indirect in an insurance program since marginal costs are largely borne by the insurer in this case largely the government rather than the insured c ontinually reducing prices on the supply side cannot be accomplished simply by conti nually reducing payments to providers ultimately if payments decline and providers costs do not providers may stop offering those services fo r that reason many experts doubt that reduction in medicare and

in theory reduce fu ture prices although in recent years they have led to higher prices by making new but expensive treatments available it is unclear what interventions government can pursue to reverse that trend certain modifications have been suggested that might lead to onetime efficiency gains such as changes to the medicare reimbursement system or the adoption of private sector hmo administration but it is less clear that these modifications could lead to the continuous efficiency gains requi red to contain cost growth
