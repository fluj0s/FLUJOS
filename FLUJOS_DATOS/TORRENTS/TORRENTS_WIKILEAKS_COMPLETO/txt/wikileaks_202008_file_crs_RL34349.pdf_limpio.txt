spilling over from housing and financial markets to the broader economy including monetary policy the responsibility of the federal reserve and fiscal policy legislators and the president adopted an economic stimulus package pl 110185 on february 13 another stimulus package hr 7110 passed the house in 2008 over the past few months the government has also intervened in specific financial markets including financial assistance to troubled firms legislation authorizing massive intervention in financial markets was adopted on october 3 pl 110343 it includes authority to purchase 700 billion in troubled assets in addition the fed has lent directly to financial institutions through an array of new facilities and the amounts of loans outstanding have risen into the hundreds of billions of dollars congressional leaders and presidentelect obama have now proposed much larger stimulus packages ranging from 600 to 850 billion comprised of spending and tax cuts the estimated budget cost of the stimulus acted in february wa s about 150 billion for fy2008 the largest provision in terms of budgetary cost was tax rebate for individuals the senate committee bill also included an extension in unemployment compensation benefits the iraqafghanistan supplemental appropriations completed june 26 included 13week extension signed on june 30 the current stimulus proposal would increase spending on infrastructure unemployment benefits medicaid and food st amps by 50 to 60 billion unemployment was extended by an additional seven weeks on november 21 2008 the need for additional fiscal stimulus depends on the state of the economy the national bureau of economic research nber has declared the economy in recession since december 2007 growth rates after two strong quarters were negative in the fourth quarter of 2007 positive in the first and second quarters of 2008 and negative 05 in the third quarter according to one data series employment fell in every month of 2008 the unemployment rate which rose slightly in the last half of 2007 declined in january and february of 2008 but began rising in march and in november stood at 67 some forecasters believe that the ongoing financial turmoil will result in recession that is deeper and longer than average fiscal policy temporarily stimulates the economy through an increase in the budget deficit there is consensus that proposals that result in more spending can be implemented quickly and leave longterm effect on the budget ficit would increase the benefits and reduce the costs of fiscal stimulus economists generally agree that spending proposals are somewhat more stimulative than tax cuts since part of tax cut will be saved by the recipients the most important determinant of the effect on the economy is its size the recent stimulus package increased the deficit by about 1 of gdp the broad intervention into the financial markets has been passed to avoid the spread of financial instability into the broader market but there are disadvantages including leaving the government holding large amounts of mortgage debt

bureau of economic research nber has declared the us economy in recession since december of 2007 numerous actions have already been taken and continue to be considered to contain damages spilling over from housing and financial markets to the broader economy these policies include traditional monetary and fiscal policy as well as broader interventions into the financial sector earlier in 2008 in response to weaker economic growth legislators and the administration proposed economic stimulus packages after negotiations with the administration the recovery rebates and economic stimulus for the american people act of 2008 hr 5140 was introduced by speaker pelosi and passed by the house on january 29 2008 on january 30 the senate committee on finance reported the economic stimulus act of 2008 which contained provisions not included in the house bill on february 7 the senate adopted the house bill with added rebates for retirees and the house adopted the revised bill on february 13 the bill was signed into law as pl 110185 some proposals discussed but not adopted in that package might be considered in second stimulus bill at this point the scope of second proposal remains uncertain provision that was considered but not enacted in the february stimulus bill was 26week extension of unemployment benefits the iraqafghanistan supplemental appropriations adopted by congress on june 26 and signed by the president on june 30 as pl 110252 extended benefits for 13 weeks second stimulus plan hr 7110 passed the house on september 26 and included 369 billion on infrastructure 128 billion highway and bridge 75 billion water and sewer 5 billion corps of engineers 65 billion in extended unemployment compensation 145 billion in medicaid and 27 billion in food stamp and nutrition programs on october 3 the house passed the unemployment compensation extension act of 2008 hr 6867 which would provide extended unemployment benefits an extension of unemployment compensation in lameduck session in november but not genera l stimulus congressional leaders have now proposed packages as large as 600 billion accord ing to news reports presidentelect obama plans to proposed much larger stimulus packag of around 670 to 770 billion that he expects with additions in congress to amount to 850 billion figure much larger than proposals enacted or considered in 2008 this package could include grants to the states infrastructure spending increased transfer payments and tax cuts financial market conditions worsened significantly in september 2008 although the real production of goods and services has so far showed unexpected resilience since financial turmoil began in august of 2007 the ability of private borrowers to access credit markets remained restricted throughout the year evidence of credit crunch was seen in the persistence of wide spreads between the interest rates that private borrowers paid for credit and the yields on treasury securities of comparable maturity one indication of restricted credit despite stimulative federal reserve monetary policy was the failure of mortgage rates to fall significantly instead the spread between treasuries and government sponsored terprise gse bonds remained elevated over the summer the newly created federal housing finance agency fhfa cited the persistence of this wide spread as major factor in its decision to place the gses in conservatorship in september during the week of september 1519 fi nancial markets were further disturbed by the bankruptcy of investment bank lehman brothers and federal reserve intervention on behalf of the insurer aig these actions eroded market confidence further resulting in sudden spike of the commercial paper rate spread from just under 90 basis points to 280 basis points spike that in times past might have been called panic if financial market confidence is not restored and private market spreads remain elevated the broader economy could slow more due to

education and other big ticket items on september 18 administration and federal reserve officials with the bipartisan support of the congressional leadership announced massive intervention in the financial markets requesting authority to purchase up to 700 billion in assets over the next two years the treasury has also provided insurance for money market funds where withdrawals have been significant congressional leaders and other members raised number of issues and made some additional proposals which included setting up an oversight mechanism restrictions on executive compensation of firms from which assets are purchased acquiring equity stakes in the participating firms and allowing judges to reduce mortgage debt in bankruptcies not included in the final act tentative agreement announced september 26 by the senate banking committee and the house financial services committee would allow an initial 250 billion of financing with an additional 100 billion upon certification of need with congress allowed 30 days to object to the final 350 billion the plan would have oversight by an inspector general audit by the governmental accountability office setting standards of appropriate compensation and providing for equity positions in all participating companies final proposal hr 3997 which termed the program the troubled asset relief program tarp also included an oversight board and options for firms to purchase insurance failed to pass in the ho use second bill hr 1424 that preserved the central elements of the failed proposal but added an expansion of deposit insurance coverage was passed by the senate on october 1 by the house on october 3 and signed into law as pl 110 343 there are however concerns about how to price acquired assets in way that balances protection of taxpayers with providing adequate assistance to firms the treasury had indicated use of reverse auction mechanism to purchase mortgage backed securities where companies will bid to sell their assets it is not clear how well such an auction would work with heterogeneous assets 1 the treasury subsequently announced that it will use the first 250 billion authorized to purchase preferred stock in financial institutions and has now indicated it will use the funds for capital injections consumer credit such as auto loans student loans small business loans and credit cards and mortgage assistance 2 congressional leaders urged treasury to provide 25 billion in aid to us auto manufacturers3 on november 10 restructuring of government assistance to aig was announced which increased the amount at risk from 1437 billion to 1734 billion extended the loan length and reduced the interest rate the federal reserve also announced on october 14 that it

on november 23 the government announced plan to assist citicorp and on november 25 the federal reserve revealed plans to purchase 200 billion in asset backed securities through the term assetbacked securities loan facility talf these securities are based on auto credit card student and small business loans the federal reserve also announced plan to purchase 600 billion of mortgage related securities owned or guaranteed by the housing gses much of the intervention up to this point has been in the financial markets however the big three us automakers gm ford and chrysler have asked for 34 billion in loans to forestall bankruptcy the rise in gasoline prices reduced demand for profitable suvs and the credit crunch and recession have further decreased co nsumer demand congressional leaders proposed using some of the tarp funds but the treasury did not agree with that position so such loan would require legislation or need to be considered in 2009 some analysts believe failure of the auto industry could be disastrous for the midwest and some also believe much larger amount will be needed others believe bankruptcy of the firms which would be accompanied with adjustments in payroll as in other bankruptcy cases would be better alternative 6 after congress did not adopt an emergency loan of 14 billion in special postelection session in december 2008 the administration indicated on december 19 that it would provide 174 billion from tarp 94 billion to gm and 4 million to chrysler with and additional 4 billion for gm if the remaining 350 billion in tarp funds is

significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than few months based on number of economic indicators with an emphasis on trends in employment and income 8 but because

nber later declared the recession to have ended the current recession was declared in late november of 2008 in october 2008 consensus among forecasters developed that the economy was in or was about to enter in recession and in november and december the forecast worsened9 after two strong quarters economic growth fell by 02 in the fourth quarter of 2007 and increased by 09 in the first quarter of 2008 revised figures show 28 growth rate in the second quarter of 2008 the bureau of economic analysiss estimate however indicates that real gdp decreased by 05 in the third quarter although negative growth is not an official prerequisite for recession all historical recessions have featured it after long and unprecedented housing boom the median house price of existing homes fell by 18 in 2007possibly the first year of falling prices since the great depression according to one organization which compiles the data 10 and the decline continued in 2008 and appears to be worsening over time other housing data fell even furtherexisting home sales fell by 22 in the twelve months through december 2007 and reside ntial investment house building fell by 18 in the four quarters ending in the fourth quarter of 2007 the decline in residential investment has acted as drag on overall gdp growth while the other components of gdp have grown at more healthy rates many economists argued that the housing boom was not fully caused by improvements in economic fundamentals such as rising incomes and lower mortgage rates and instead represented housing bubble situation where prices were being pushed up by irrational exuberance 11 most economists believe that housing downturn alone would not be enough to singlehandedly cause recession12 but in august 2007 the housing downturn spilled over to widespread financial turmoil13 triggered by dramatic decline in the price of subprime mortgagebacked securities and collateralized debt obligations large losses and decline in liquidity spread throughout the financial system the federal reserve fed was forced to create unusually large amounts of liquidity to keep shortterm interest rates from rising in august 2007 and has since reduced interest rates significantly recent cuts in interest rates by the federal reserve included cut the federal funds rate by threequarters of percentage point on march 18 and an additional cut of quarter of percentage point on april 30 one half of percentage point cut on october 8 cut of one half of percentage point on october 29 and cut of ¾ to 1 percentage point on december 16 this last cut reduced the federal funds target rate to 0 to 025 in addition the fed has lent directly to financial institutions through an array of new facilities and the amounts of loans outstanding have risen into the

losses is another channel through which the economy could enter recession to date financial markets remain volatile new losses have been announced at major financial institutions and responses outside traditional monetary policy have been undertaken in march the financial firm bear stearns encountered liquidity problems was provided emergency financing by jpmorgan chase and the federal reserve bank of new york and was purchased after plummet in stock value by jpmorgan chase then in july the government sponsored enterprises gses fannie mae and freddie mac experienced rapidly falling equity prices in response to concerns about the value of their mortgage backed securities assets in july congress authorized treasury to extend the gses an unlimite d credit line which has not been utilized to date in hr 3221 because of concern that the failure of gse would cause systemic financial crises the federal government took control of fannie mae and freddie mac in early september in november 2008 treasury purchased 28 billion of senior preferred stock from freddie mac to prevent its net worth from becoming negative according to news reports government officials decided not to intervene on behalf of lehman brothers and merrill lynch 15 on september 14 bank of america took over merrill lynch without federal intervention and on september 15 lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy the treasury and federal reserve were trying to engineer private bailout of the nations largest insurance company aig but on september 16 seized control with an 85 billion emergency loan 16 on september 18 administration and federal reserve officials with the bipartisan support of the congressional leadership announced massive intervention in the financial markets17 the proposal asked for authority to purchase up to 700 billion in assets over the next two years the treasury has also provided insurance for mone market funds where withdrawals have been significant these proposals suggest that government economists see problems with the transmission of traditional monetary stimulus into the financial sector and ultimately into the broader economy where significant contraction of credit could significantly reduce aggregate demand although the legislation passed with some delay the stock market has fallen significantly the original proposal had discussed buying mortgage related assets particularly mortgagebacked securities but the treasury has indicated it will spend the initial 250 billion on preferred stock in financial institutions the federal reserve has also announced purchases of commercial paper 200 billion of asset backed securities and 600 billion of mortgage related securities the government has also announced plan to assist citigroup at the same time as the economy and financial sector has been grappling with the housing downturn energy prices had risen significantly from 48 per barrel in january 2007 to 115 dollars on april 30 2008 and 144 as of july 2

43 most recessions since world war ii including the most recent have been preceded by an increase in energy prices18 energy prices had gone up almost continuously in the current expansion however without causing rece ssion which may point to the relative decline in importance of energy consumption to production although housing downturn and associated financial turmoil or an energy shock might not be enough to cause recession in isolation the combination could be sufficient unle ss energy prices begin to rise again there is little reason to believe they will place any further downward pressure on economic growth going forward in sum there are some indications that slowdown has occurred and that there are problems in several sectors growth rates after two strong quarters were negative in the fourth quarter of 2007 were positive in the first and second quarters of 2008 and negative in the third quarter of 2008 according to one data series employment fell in the first 10 months of 2008 the unemployment rate which was 48 in february 2008 rose to 61 in august 2008 remained there in september 2008 and rose again to 65 in october 2008 and to 66 in november forecasters project slower growth for 2008 and appear to have reached consensus that the us is in recession problems exist in several different sectors of the economy housing energy and financial markets the continuing turmoil in financial markets could result in credit crunch and result in contractions in the interest sensitive sectors of the economy

pattern called the business cycle recession can be characterized as situation where total spending in the economy aggregate demand is too low to match the economys potential output aggregate supply as result some of the economys labor and capital resources lay idle causing unemployment and low capacity utilization rate respectively recessions are shortterm in natureeventually markets adjust and bring spending and output back in line even in the absence of policy intervention 19 policymakers may prefer to use stimulative policy to attempt to hasten that adjustment process in order to avoid the detrimental effects of cycl ical unemployment by definition stimulus proposal can be judged by its effectiveness at boosting total spending in the economy total spending includes personal consumption business investment in plant and equipment residential investment net exports exports less imports and government spending effective stimulus could boost spending in any of these categories fiscal stimulus can take the form of higher government spending direct spending or transfer payments or tax reductions but generally it can boost spending only through larger budget deficit deficitfinanced increase in government spending directly boosts spending by borrowing to finance higher government spending or transfer payments to households deficit financed tax cut indirectly boosts spending if the recipient uses the tax cut to increase his spending if an increase in spending or tax cut is financed through decrease in other spending 18 for more information see crs report

in other taxes the economy would not be stimulated since the deficitincreasing and deficitdecreasing provisions would cancel each other out how much larger deficit can stimulate economic activity depends on the state of the economy at that time when the economy is in recession fiscal stimulus could mitigate the decline in gdp growth by bringing idle labor and capital resources back into use when the economy is already robust boost in spending could be largely inflationarysince there would be idle resources to bring back into production when spending is boosted the boost would instead bid up the prices of those resources eventually causing all prices to rise because total spending can be boosted only temporarily stimulus has longterm benefits and may have longterm costs most notably the increase in the budget deficit crowds out private investment spending because both must be financed out of the same finite pool of national saving with the greater demand for saving pushing up interest rates 20 to the extent that private investment is crowded out by larger deficit it would reduce the future size of the economy since the economy would operate with smaller capital stock in the long run in recent years the us economy has become highly dependent on foreign capital to finance business investment and budget deficits21 since foreign capital can come to the united states only in the form of trade deficit higher budget deficit could result in higher trade deficit in which case the higher trade deficit could dissipate the boost in spending as consumers purchase imported goods indeed conventional economic theory predicts that fiscal policy has stimulative effect in an economy with perfectly mobile capital flows 22 some economists argue that these costs outweigh the benefits of fiscal stimulus the most important determinant of stimulus macroeconomic effect is its size the recently adopted stimulus package pl 110185 increas ed the budget deficit by about 1 of gross domestic product gdp in healthy year gdp gr ows about 3 in the moderate recessions that the us experienced in 19901991 and 2001 gdp contracted in some quarters by 05 to 3 the us economy has not experienced contraction in full calendar year since 1991 thus swing from expansion to recession would result in change in gdp growth equal to at least 35 percentage points stimulus package of 1 of gdp could be expected to increase total spending by about 1 23 to the extent that spending begets new spending there could be multiplier effect that makes the total increase in spending larger than the increase in the deficit offsetting the multiplier effect the increase in spending could be neutralized if it results in crowding out of investment spending larger trade deficit or high er inflation the extent to which the increase in spending would be offset by these three factor s depends on how quickly the economy is growing at the time of the stimulusan increase in the budget deficit would lead to less of an increase in spending if the economy were growing faster 20 crowding out is likely to be less of concern if the economy enters recession since recessions are typically characterized by falling business investment 21 if foreign borrowing prevents crowding out the future size of the economy will not decrease but capital income will accrue to foreigners instead of americans 22 for

stimulus may not be necessary for the economy to revive relatively quickly if on the other hand the economy entered deeper prolonged recession as some economists believe to be likely then fiscal stimulus may not be powerful enough to avoid it economic forecasts are notoriously inaccurate due to the highly complex and changing nature of the economy so it is difficult to accurately assess how deep the downturn will be and how much fiscal stimulus would be an appropriate response the main obstacle to another round of fiscal stimulus may be the size of the current budget deficit although the stimulus measures proposed are not that large in isolation some observers believe the deficit will already exceed 1 trillion in 2009 while there have been larger deficits in the past relative to gdp and current government borrowing rates are extremely low because of the financial turmoil there is fear that deficit of this size could become burdensome to service when interest rates return to normal larger deficit could crowd out private investment act as drag on economic growth and increase reliance on foreign borrowing which would result in larger trade deficit by doing so the deficit places burden on future generations and could further complicate the task of coping with longterm budgetary pressures caused by the aging of the population 24 in the highly unlikely worst case scenario if too much pressure is placed on the deficit through competing policy prio rities then investors could lose faith in the governments ability to service the debt and borrowing rates could spike many of these issues could be avoided if the elements of the stimulus package are temporary although there is often later pressure to extend policies beyond their original expiration date in judging the need for an additional stimulus package policymakers might also consider that stimulus is already being delivered in addition to the stimulus package passed in february from two other sources first the federal budget has automatic stabilizers that cause the budget deficit to automatically increase and thereby stimulate the economy during downturn in the absence of policy changes when the economy slows entitlement spending on programs such as unemployment compensation benefits automatically increases as program participation rates rise and the growth in tax revenues automatically clines as the recession causes the growth in taxable income to decline in january the congressional budget office projected that under current policy which excluded the february stimulus package the budget deficit would increase by 56 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 this amount is significant although smaller than the approximately 150 billion deficit increase due to the recent stimulus package 25 second the federal reserve has already delivered large monetary stimulus by the end of april 2008 the fed had reduced overnight interest rates to 2 from 525 in september 200726 on october 8 the interest rate was lowered to 15 to 10 on october 29 and to 0 to 025 on december 16 lower interest rates stimulate the economy by increasing the demand for interest 24 see crs report rl32747 the economic implications of the longterm federal budget outlook by marc labonte 25 in march 2008 cbo projected the budget deficit for fy2008 compared to fy2007 to increase to 193 billion largely reflecting the stimulus package of 153 billion offset by some other small reductions note also that in january cbo estimated that if supplemental military spendi ng to maintain current troop levels overseas and an alternative minimum tax patch are enacted and expiring tax provisions are extended the 2008 deficit could increase by 98 billion in total compared to 2007 this projection was made in the absence of stimulus legislation and would increase the 56 billion deficit increase by 42 billion 26 for interest rate changes see crs report 98856 federal reserve interest rate changes

spending which includes investment spending residential housing and consumer durables such as automobiles in addition lower interest rates would stimulate the economy by reducing the value of the dollar all else equal which would lead to higher exports and lower imports27 one might take the view that the federal reserve has chosen monetary policy that it believes will best avoid recession given the actions already taken if it has chosen that policy correctly an argument can be made that an additional fisc stimulus is unnecessary since the economy is already receiving the correct boost in spending through lower interest rates and through the first stimulus package in this light additional fiscal policy would be useful only if monetary policy is unable to adequately boost spendingeither because the fed has chosen an incorrect policy or because the fed cannot boost spending enough through lower interest rates to avoid recession and direct intervention in financial markets is not adequate 28 finally some economists argue that if the root of the problem is concentrated in the housing and financial sectors the economy is unlikely to return to sustainable expansion until those problems are solved if so fiscal stimulus may at mo st provide temporary boost as long as those problems are outstanding but cannot singlehandedly shift the economy to sustainable path of expansion for example the first stimulus package did not prevent the economy from deteriorating in the third quarter of 2008 these problems were addressed in major housing and financial legislation in 2008 as described above but it remains to be seen whether they have been solved

congress enacted and the president signed stimulus package in february of 2008 during discussion of the stimulus package variety of proposals were advanced the administration proposed initially to largely limit the stimulus to tax reduction but there was also discussion in congress of spending programs such as extending unemployment benefits and food stamps the house leadership initially negotiated proposal with the administration which included refundable rebates to low income workers the senate added rebates for low income retirees and unemployment benefit extensions with the former eventually adopted and the latter not adopted the house senate finance committee and final versions of the economic stimulus package are briefly described below the house version was the recovery rebate and economic stimulus for the american people act of 2008 hr 5140 the estimated budget cost of hr 5140 is 1459 billion for fy2008 and 148 billion for fy2009 see table 1 the 10year cost is estimated to be 1172 billion 27 for more information see crs report rl30354 monetary policy and the federal reserve current policy and conditions by gail makinen and marc labonte 28 fed chairman ben bernanke may have hinted at the latter case when he testified that fiscal action could be helpful in principle as fiscal and monetary stimulus together may provide broader support for the economy than

both the original house bill hr 5140 the senate committee proposal and the final legislation is the tax rebate for individuals unlike the 2001 rebate the rebates have elements of refundability families without tax liability receive rebate although the senate committee proposals and the final bills refundability is greater than in the initial house proposal the house proposal hr 5140 would provide 1097 billion in rebates while the senate committee proposal would provide 1263 billion30 the final proposal adds 6 billion in the first year to the original house plan the rebate is technically credit for 2008 but payments would be mailed in 2008 based on 2007 returns if taxpayers qualify for higher credit based on their 2008 circumstances they could claim the excess on their 2008 returns there are five elements of the rebate proposals that are outlined in table 4 the first is the basic nature of the rebate the house proposal effectively suspended part of the 10 income tax bracket allowing reduction in tax liability of 10 of the first 6000 of taxable income for single individuals and 10 of the first 12000 of taxable income for married couples absent any other provisions the benefit would increase gradually until maximum benefit was reached at 600 for single individuals and 1200 for married couples the senate committee plan allowed flat rebate of 500 for single individuals and 1000 for couples the basic rebate follows the house plan the second element is the basic refundability feature which extends benefits to lower income households without tax liability in the house bill individuals without tax liability but with earnings of at least 3000 can receive minimum rebate of 300 for singles and 600 for married couples households with earnings under 3000 would not receive rebate in the senate committee proposal the full flat amount can be received for households with at least 3000 in combined earnings and social security benefits this inclusion of social security benefits would extend the rebate to large group of retired individuals who do not have taxable income the final bill allows the refundability for social security but at the lower house rebate level 29 this section was prepared by jane gravelle government and finance division 30 joint committee on taxation see jcx608 and jcx908 httpwwwhousegovjct

both bills the benefit is phased out at higher incomes the phaseout points are higher in the senate committee proposal the final bill follows the house provisions the fourth element is the child rebate which in all plans is set at 300 per child and allowed if basic or refundable rebate is received the fifth element present initially only in the senate committee proposal limits and expands the

ineffective in increasing spending there is some evidence the 2001 rebate was spent32 in general economic analysis suggests that benefits that go more heavily to low income individuals are likely to be more effective per dollar of payment than those with smaller benefits because lower income households are more likely to spend the rebate and spending is necessary to produce stimulus the extension of rebates to those with social security payments could be quite complex administratively since it would require filing and processing up to an additional 18 million tax returns 33

mainstream economic theory states that overall spending in the economy is stimulated only if the rebates lead to higher consumption but households may decide to consume or save the rebates there are now data available on disposable income and personal consumption expenditures through september 2008 to begin to judge whether the rebates have led to higher consumer spending table 5 shows the breakdown of rebate checks sent by month through the end of june 798 billion or three quarters of the rebates were received 34 t able 5 receipt of rebates b month rebates received billions of d ollars april 43 may 457 june 298 july 120 source crs calculations based on data from the us treasury households may choose to increase consumption before when or after the rebates are received households might decide to increase consumption beforehand in anticipation of receiving the rebate assuming they are not liquidity constrained meaning they had access to credit or savings thus to evaluate the full effects of the rebate on consumption would require data for all three periods as well as assumptions about how quickly the rebate will be spent at this point only prior and contemporaneous consumption data are available some of the stimulative effects will come in future months making this analysis incomplete at present furthermore the data available at this time are preliminary and future revisions to the data could potentially result in fundamentally different picture of the rebates effects 32 see crs report rs22790 tax cuts for shortrun economic stimulus recent experiences by jane g gravelle 33 according to the tax policy center 18 million households over the age of 65 would receive rebate under the house bill see tax policy center table t080030 at

disposable income ie income net of taxes in june that far exceeded normal monthly fluctuations disposable income rose 01 in april 52 in may and fell 26 in june the fall in june is caused by fewer rebates being paid out in june than in may disposable income in june was 24 higher than in april the bureau of economic analysis estimates that in the absence of the rebates disposable income would have fallen by 01 in may and 04 in june35 disposable income continued to fall in july and august and was up slightly in september yet as shown in figure 1 the large increase in disposable income has not yet led to any perceptible rise in consumption spending above the trend36 consumption spending rose 01 in april 03 in may and fell 02 in june 06 in july and 04 in september the rise in may is slightly above average but the changes in april and june are below average there was large increase in personal saving from 03 of disposable income in april to 5 in may and 28 in june suggesting that the rebates initially resulted in mostly higher personal saving as noted previously there may be lag between receiving rebate and increasing consumption consumption in march the month before the rebate checks were first sent rose 03it is debatable how much of this increase might be attributable to the anticipation of rebate checks not yet received another weakness in the argument that the rebate checks have already stimulated the economy is the fact that the overall economy grew at more rapid pace than consumption in the second and third quarters of 2008 gdp growth was 28 while consumption grew by 12 in the second quarter government spending net exports and even nonresidential investment which typically shrinks during recession all grew at more rapid pace than consumption in the second quarter despite the boost to disposable income from the rebate checks 37 35 bureau of economic analysis income growth affected by rebates news release august 4 2008 36 all figures discussed in this paragraph measure the change since the previous month and have been adjusted for inflation 37 inventory reduction was large drag on growth in the second quarter which suggests that producers responded to higher consumption by reducing inventories rather than increasing production

disp osable income rebate checks source crs calculations based on data from the b urea u of eco n omic analysis note consumption and disposable income data are adjusted for inflation rebate checks ar not adjusted for inflation the effectiveness of the rebates in boosting overall spending could in theory be reduced by leakages into higher inflation interest rates or imports38 prices for personal consumption expenditures rose at an annualized rate of 42 in the second quarter of 2008 much of this increase was due to food and energy prices thus the argument can be made that most of the rise in nominal consumption in the second quarter went toward price increases rather than higher consumption in inflationadjusted terms spending on real imports fell by 66 in the second quarter so that does not appear to be source of leakage likewise interest rates in general did not show much movement during the second quarter the effects of the rebates on consumption cannot be determined by looking at the absolute growth of consumption in isolation rather we ne ed to compare actual growth to the growth in consumption that would have occurred in the counterfactual case without any rebates since there is way of observing the counterfactual economists must rely on economic models to conjecture about the counterfactual one simple counterfactual would be to compare consumption following the rebates to consumption in typical month by this measure the rebates seemed to have had discernible effects so far but there are good reasons to think that the past three months have not been typical monthsnamely because of the slowdown in the economy and the resulting rise in unemployment and decline in consumer confidence goldman sachs estimates that the counterfactual would have been for consumption to have fallen by 15175 in the second quarter compared to this counterfactual goldman sachs estimates the rebates to have boosted consumption by 225 billion to 252 billion and consumption

the total boost to spending goldman sachs analysts attribute 17 billion to 23 billion to higher spending in march in anticipation of receiving the rebate checks39 their counterfactual decline in consumption spending is strikingly large however consumptio n spending has not fallen by as much as they assume or even been negative since the fourth quarter of 1991 disposable income excluding the rebates does not show similarly large decline less pessimistic assumption about consumption in the counterfactual would have resulted in smaller estimate of the boost to consumption from the rebates the ultimate success of the rebates will depend partly on whether they help move consumption onto path of sustainable growth in the future if consumption falls after the effect of the rebates wears off some may argue that the rebates will have at best postponed the economic downturn goldman sachs predicts that by the fourth quarter of 2008 the effect of the rebates on gdp will have worn off at which point we foresee renewed stagnation in us output 40 economist martin feldstein argues that the rebates should be deemed failure because they have had very little bang for the buck41 he argues that rebates which added nearly 80 billion to disposable income to date have resulted in additional consumption of only 12 billion in other words about 15 of the money spent on the rebate s served its stated purpose goldman sachs was more generous in crediting consumption spending to the rebates concluding that the rebates added 225 to 252 billion to consumption which is still considerably less than 80 billion feldstein attributes the rebates ineffectiveness to their having been mostly saved and argues that permanent tax cut would have been spent at much higher rate than onetime rebate two points can be made about feldsteins conclusions first the 12 billion estimate understates the rebates ultimate effects since somewhat more of the rebates are likely to be spent in future months second the ineffectiveness of the rebates due to the saving effect is more powerful argument for direct government spending rather than permanent tax cuts as more costeffective way to stimulate the economy in the shortterm since none of government spending is saved 42 study based on survey data of household nondurable consumption concluded that the average family spent around 20 of their rebate in the first month after receipt extrapolating similarly over time our estimates imply that the receipt of the tax rebates directly raised nondurable pce personal consumption expenditures by 24 in the second quarter of 2008 and will raise it by 41 in the third quarter 43 their findings of relatively large effects at the household level can be reconciled to the macroeconomic data on few grounds first their

depreciation allowing 50 of investment with life of less th an 20 years which applies mostly to equipment to be deducted when purchased the second addressed provision that allowed small businesses to deduct all equipment investment when purchased by increasing the ceiling on eligible equipment and phasing out the benefit more slowly the senate committee proposal had these same provisions although it modified bonus depreciation by allowing deduction over two years instead of one it also added provision that would allow companies to increase the period of time in the past that they can use to offset current net operating losses nols against past positive taxable income from two years to five for losses generated in 2006 or 2007 the senate committee proposal would have allowed businesses to use only one of the three provisions the senate committee proposal also included the extension of some energy provisions that largely relate to businesses these provisions are compared in table 6 the final bill followed the original house provisions the bonus depreciation provisions are the most costly of the business provisions amounting to 439 billion in fy2008 and 54 billion in fy2 009 for the house bill and 164 billion in fy2008 and 202 billion in fy2009 for the senate committee proposal apparently the election provision significantly reduces the cost of bonus depreciation in the first two years as with all of the provisions which largely involve timing revenue is gained in future years as regular depreciation deductions fall over 10 years the cost is 74 billion in the house bill and 67 billion in the senate committee proposal 46 the small business expensing provision in both plans costs 09 billion in fy2008 and 06 billion in fy2009 with the 10year cost 01 billion the net operating loss nol provision in the senate committee proposal loses 154 billion in fy2008 and 81 billion in fy2009 and then gains revenue with the tenyear cost 51 billion 44 j steven landefeld eugene p seskin

rate would be about 18 billion for the house bill and about 14 billion for the senate committee proposal overall it is unlikely that these provisions would provide significant shortterm stimulus investment incentives are attractive if they work because increasing investment does not trade off short term stimulus benefits for reduction in capital formation as do provisions stimulating consumption nevertheless most evidence does not suggest these provisions work very well to induce shortterm spending 47 this lack of effectiveness may occur because of planning lags or because stimulus is generally provided during economic slowdowns when excess capacity may already exist of business tax provisions investment subsidies are more effective than rate cuts but there is little evidence to support much stimulus effect temporary bonus depreciation is likely to be most effective in stimulating investment more effective than much costlier permanent investment incentive because it encourages the speedup of in vestment although there is some dispute most evidence on bonus depreciation enacted in 2002 nevertheless suggests that it had little effect in stimulating investment and that even if the effects were pronounced the benefit was too small to have an appreciable effect on the economy 47 see crs report rl31134 using business tax cuts to stimulate the economy by jane g

incentive effect is even smaller firms may for example benefit from the small business expensing but it actually discourages investment in the expanded phase out range the nol provision since it largely relates to events that have occurred in the past and therefore the effect is only cash flow effect is unlikely to have much incentive effect the energy provisions provide an extension through 2009 of provisions that expired at the end of 2007 or will expire at the end of 200848 their overall cost is 57 billion and they are unlikely to have stimulative effect of importance not only because of their size and because investment incentives are unlikely to be effective but also because market participants may already be acting under the expectation that they will be extended in any case finally the senate committee proposal provides an extension of tax exempt bonds for housing that costs 17 billion and similarly would be unlikely to provide significant shortterm stimulus

high cost limits are be similar to the conforming loan limit many of those supporting the increases believe they provide needed stimulus to housing and mortgage markets52 factors tending to limit the impact of the increased mortgage limits are as follows existing loantovalue ratio limits continue to apply this prevents homeowners who owe more on house than its appraised value from participating in the program existing credit worthiness and debttoincome requirements apply this prevents anyone not current on their mortgage from refinancing the reduction of the 30 extra capital requirement to 20 allows the gses to purchase and hold an additional 200 billion in mortgages the gses could also purchase additional mortgages by following the suggestion in the economic stimulus act of 2008 and hr 3221 to package these mortgages add their guarantees and sell mortgagebacked securities mbs to large investors these housingrelated provisions of the act could narrow or eliminate the spread between loans above the permanent loan limit but under temporary limits and conforming loans already eligible for purchase recently this spread has been more than 150 as compared to normal spread of approximately 020 the provisions nd subsequent reduction in the spread could help homebuyers with good credit obtain lower interest rates on loans in the affected range the monthly payments on 30year fixedrate 600000 mortgage could fall from 3824 to 3377 saving 447 per month53 fhas guidelines state that mortgage payments insurance and taxes should not exceed 29 of monthly income according to the

second tier of benefits for workers in states with high unemployment of up to maximum of an additional 13 weeks of tier ii euc08 benefits for up to cumulative 33 weeks of euc08 benefits originally the intent of the unemployment compensation uc program was among other things to help counter economic fluctuations such as recessions 59 this intent is reflected in the current uc programs funding and benefit structure uc is financed by federal payroll taxes under the federal unemployment tax act futa and by state payroll taxes under the state unemployment tax acts suta when the economy grows uc program revenue rises through increased tax revenues while uc program spending falls as fewer workers are unemployed the effect of collecting more taxes than are spent is to dampen demand in the economy this also creates surplus of funds or cushion of available funds for the uc program to draw upon 54 12 usc 45624564 and 4566 55 for more information on fha see crs report rs22662 hr 1852 and

program spending rises as more workers lose their jobs and receive uc benefits the increased amount of uc payments to unemployed workers dampens the economic effect of earnings losses by injecting additional funds into the economy60 the limited duration of uc benefits generally more than 26 weeks results in some unemployed individuals exhausting their uc benefi ts before finding work or voluntarily leaving the labor force for other activities such as retirement disability family care or education the extended benefit eb program established by pl 91373 26 usc 3304 note may extend uc benefits at the state level if certain economic situations exist within the state the eb program like the uc program is permanently authorized the eb program is currently active solely in north carolina up to 13 weeks and rhode island up to 20 weeks on december 7 2008 the eb program will be activated on in oregon in addition to the current euc08 program congress acted seven other timesin 1958 1961 1971 1974 1982 1991 and 2002to establish temporary programs of extended uc benefits these programs extended the time an individual might claim uc benefits ranging from an additional 6 to 33 weeks and had expiration dates some extensions took into account state economic conditions many temporary programs considered the states tur andor the states insured unemployment rate iur recently congressional and popular debate has examined the relative efficacy of the expansion of uc benefits and duration compared to other potential economic stimuli in his january 22 2008 congressional testimony the director of the c ongressional budget office cbo stated that increasing the value or duration of uc benefits may be one of the more effective economic stimulus plans61 this is because many of the unemployed are severely cash constrained and would be expected to rapidly spend any increase in benefits that they may receive62 others point out that increasing either the value or length of uc benefits may however discourage recipients from searching for work or from accepting less desirable jobs63 rationale for making an extension in uc benefits only temporary is to mitigate disincentives to work since the extension would expire once the economy improves and cyclical unemployment declines 60 for detailed examination of how the federal government has extended uc benefits

government should extend unemployment benefits has been active for decades generally this debate has examined the efficacy of using the iur or tur as triggers for extending benefits the debate also has examined whether the intervention should be at national or state level recently serious consideration of alternative labor market measures has become increasingly common in particular the increase in the number of unemployed from the previous year has emerged in several proposals as new trigger for nationwide extension in unemployment benefits g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g561 the bill as passed by the senate finance committee on january 30 2008 would create new temporary extension of uc that would entitle certain unemployed individuals to unemployment benefits that are not available under current law the house bill contained provisions relating to unemployment benefits individuals who had exhausted all rights to regular uc benefits under the state or federal law with respect to benefit year excluding any benefit year that ended before february 1 2007 would be eligible for these additional benefits the amount of the benefit would be the equivalent of the individuals weekly regular uc benefit including any dependents allowances the temporary extension would be financed 100 by the federal government the number of weeks an individual would be eligible for these temporary extended uc benefits would be the lesser of 50 of the total regular uc eligibility or 13 weeks under special rule if the state is in an eb period which has special definition for purposes of this temporary extension the amount of temporary extended uc benefits would be augmented by an additional amount that is equivalent to the temporary uc benefit thus in those highunemployment states where the eb program was triggered mporary benefits of up to 26 weeks would be possible 64 governors of the states would be able to pay the temporary extended uc benefit in lieu of the extended benefit eb payment if state law permits thus once the regular uc benefit was exhausted state would be able to opt for the individual to receive the temporary extended uc benefit 100 federal funding rather than receiving the eb benefit 50 federal funding and 50 state funding the program would terminate on december 31 2008 unemployed individuals who had qualified for the temporary extended uc benefit or had qualified for the additional highunemployment provision would continue to receive payments for the number of weeks they were deemed eligible however if the unemployed individual has not exhausted the first temporary extension of uc benefits by december 31 2008 regardless of state economic conditions the individual would not be eligible for an additional highunemployment extension of the temporary uc 64 the bill would temporarily change the definition of an eb period only for the purposes of the bill regardless of whether state had opted for section 203f of the federalstate extended unemployment compensation act of 1970 an eb period would be in effect for such state in determining the level of temporary extended uc benefits in the state the bill would temporarily change that trigger by removing the requirement that the tur be at least 110 of the states average tur for the same 13weeks in either of the pr evious two years the bill would also change the base eb trigger described in section 203d only for purposes of the bill reducing it from an

euc08 before eb or vice versa states balance the decision of which benefit to pay first by examining the potential cost savings to the state with the potential loss of unemployment benefits for unemployed individuals in the state it may be less costly for the state to choose to pay for the euc08 benefit first as the euc08 benefit is 100 federa lly financed whereas the eb benefit is 50 state financed 65 however if the state opts to pay euc08 first individuals in the state might receive less in total unemployment benefits if the eb program triggers off before the individuals exhaust their

billion in medicaid and 27 billion in food stamp and nutrition programs similar bill has not been able to pass the senate and the president has indicated that he would veto the house bill earlier bill relating to housing relief was passed the senate budget resolution set aside 35 billion for second package which is allocated between taxes and spending67 the accompanying committee print discussed the unemployment benefit extension discussed above as part of potential future package along with two other spending programs expanding food stamps and aid to the states it also discussed spending on readytogo infrastructure investments discussed during the stimulus debate additional spending on liheap low income energy assistance program and wic special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children and the summer jobs program the resolution also discussed current proposal under consideration to address housing issues the foreclosure prevention act of 2008 s 2636 this proposal was passed by the senate as hr 3221 on april 10 it was not broad stimulus package but was largely targeted at the housing sector it included some regulatory and direct spending provisions in the latter case primarily 4 billion authorization for state and local governments to redevelop abandoned and foreclosed homes it also included some tax reductions the largest of these in short run revenue cost was provision similar to that enacted by the senate for the first stimulus bill allowing firms to elect an extended net operating loss carryback provision and temporary suspension of the alternative minimum tax limitation for bonus depreciation and small business expensing for 2008 and 2009 the net operating loss carryback period was extended to four years this provision cost 25 billion from fy20082010 although it would raise revenues thereafter with total cost of 6 billion over ten years the bill also included liberalization of taxexempt mortgage revenue bonds tax credit for buyers of homes in foreclosure temporary deduction for property taxes by homeowners who do not itemize capped at 500 for single and 1000 for couples and an election to refund certain corporate credits in li eu of other business provisions there were also some limited provisions for areas still recovering from hurricanes and from storms and tornados in kansas altogether the package would have cost 22 billion over ten years the house also considered housing legislation hr 5720 which had been reported out of the ways and means committee that provision has more limited number of tax incentives it includes credit for firsttime homebuyers to be repaid over 15 years as well as the property tax deduction in the senate bill but with lower caps of 350 and 700 along with some provisions affecting the lowincome housing credits and tax exempt bonds for housing the bill provided revenue offsets however and is therefore revenue neutral on may 8 the house combined the tax legislation with other housing legislation and passed its version of hr 3221 the measure was delayed in the senate but the perceived need for rapid legislative response to the gses problems resulted in senate passage where the provisions have been negotiated with the house the net operating loss provision was eliminated and the tax credit is now similar to the house bill of the bill on july 10 final vote was taken by the house on july 23 and by the senate on july 67 see concurrent resolution of the budget for 2009 senate report to accompany sconres 70 senate print 110 039 march 2008 p 6

property taxes marriage penalties the rd tax credit and tax exempt bonds fiscal stimulus is only effective if the money is spent and many economists also view fiscal policy as less effective than monetary policy in an open economy tax cuts may be less effective than spending because some of the tax cut may be saved tax cuts that are temporary that appear in lump sum rather than in withholding or that are aimed at higher income individuals are thought more likely to be saved for example some evidence suggests that only two thirds of the 2001 tax rebate was spent the challenge to spending programs is that there may be lag time for planning and administration before the money is spent for that reason infrastructure spending is often discussed in the context of readytogo projects where all of the planning is in place and the only missing factor is funding some analysts ggest that aid to state and local governments may be more quickly spent because these governments are likely to cut back on spending in downturns and the aid may forestall these cuts 68 concerns have also been expressed that the larger the package the greater the risk that the spending will not be effective especially for certain types of infrastructure some economists advocate quick enactment of smaller package followed by additional spending that can be more carefully considered69 these delays in spending are less of concern if the downturn appears likely to be protracted or the recovery slow

spending if the goal of stimulus is to maximize the boost to total spending while minimizing the increase in the budget deficit in order to minimize the deleterious effects of crowding out then maximum bang for the buck would be desirable the primary way to achieve the most bang for the buck is by choosing policies that result in spending not saving73 direct government spending on goods and services would therefore lead to the most bang for the buck since none of it would be saved the largest categories of direct federal spending are national defense health infrastructure public order and safety and natural resources 74 higher government transfer payments such as extended unemployment compensation benefits or increased food stamps or tax cuts could theoretically be spent or saved by their recipients75 while there is way to be certain how to target stimulus package toward recipients who would spend it many economists have reasoned that higher income recipients would save more than lower income recipients since us saving is hi ghly correlated with income for example two thirds of families in the bottom 20 of the income distribution did not save at all in 2004 whereas only onefifth of families in the top 10 of the income distribution did not save 76 presumably recipients in economic distress such as those receiving unemployment benefits would be even more likely to spend transfer or tax cut than typical family as discussed previously business tax incentives can be crafted so that they can be claimed only in response to higher investment spending but businesses ma be unwilling to increase their investment spending when faced with cyclicallyinduced decline in demand for their products 77 mark zandi of moody s economycom has estimated multiplier effects for several different policy options as shown in table 7 78 the multiplier estimates the increase in total spending in the economy that would result from dollar spent on given policy option zandi does not explain how these multipliers were estimated other than to say that they were calculated using his firms macroeconomic model therefore it is difficult to offer thorough analysis of the estimates in general many of the assumptions that would be needed to calculate these estimates are widely disputed notably the difference in marginal propensity to consume among different recipients and the size of multipliers in general and macroeconomic model has highly successful track record predicting economic activity thus the range of values that other economists would assign 73 policies that result in more bang for the buck also result in more crowding out of investment spending which could reduce the longterm size of the economy unless the policy change increases public investment or induces private investment 74 for the purpose of this discussion government transfer payments such as entitlement benefits are not classified as government spending 75 food stamps cannot be directly saved since they can only be used on qualifying purchases but recipient could theoretically keep their overall consumption constant by increasing their other saving 76 brian bucks et recent changes in us

economists would likely agree with the general thrust of his estimates howeverspending provisions have higher multipliers because tax cuts are partially saved and some types of tax cuts are more likely to be saved by their recipients than others as discussed above noticeable increase in consumption spending has not yet accompanied the receipt of the rebates from the first stimulus package

which different stimulus proposals have been evaluated there are lags before policy change affects spending as result stimulus could be delivered after the economy has already entered recession or recession has already ended first there is legislative process lag that applies to all policy proposalsa stimulus package cannot take effect until bills are passed by the house and senate both chambers can reconcile differences between their bills and the president signs the bill many bi lls get delayed at some step in this process as seen in table 8 many past stimulus bills have not become

york times jan 2 3 2 00 8 second there is an administrative delay between the enactment of legislation and the implementation of the policy change for example although the stimulus package was signed into law in february the first rebate checks were not sent out until the end of april and the last rebate checks were not sent out until july when the emergency unemployment compensation euc08 program began in july 2008 there was about three week lag between enactment and the first payments of the new euc08 benefit many economists have argued that new government spending on infrastructure could not be implemented quickly enough to stimulate the economy in time since infrastructure projects require significant planning others have argued that this problem has been exaggerated because existing plans or routine maintenance could be implemented more quickly others have argu ed that although federal spending cannot be implemented quickly enough fiscal transfers to state and local governments would be spent quickly because many states currently face budgetary shortfalls and fiscal transfers would allow them to avoid cutting spending 79 finally there is behavioral lag since time elapses before the recipient of transfer or tax cut increases their spending for example the initia l reaction to the receipt of rebate checks was 79 transfers to state and local governments could be less stimulative than direct federal spending because state and local governments could in theory increase their total spending by less than the amount of the transfer for example some of the money that would have been spent in the absence of the transfer could now be diverted to the states budget reserves but if states are facing budgetary shortfalls many would argue that in practice spending would increase by as much as the transfer httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34349g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g21g149g152g160g141g152g160g151g497g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g138

spike in the personal saving rate see above it is unclear how to target recipients that would spend most quickly although presumably liq uidityconstrained households ie those with limited access to credit would spend more quickly than others in this regard the advantage to direct government spending is that there is analogous lag although monetary policy changes have legislative or administrative lags research suggests they do face longer behavioral lags than fiscal policy changes because households and business generally respond more slowly to interest rate changes than tax or transfer changes g14g152g151g144g556g157g142g155g150g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561 as discussed above while deficitfinanced policy change can stimulate shortterm spending it can also reduce the size of the economy in the long run through the crowding out effect on private investment stimulus proposals can minimize the crowding out effect by lasting only temporarilyan increase in the budget deficit for one year would lead to significantly less crowding out over time than permanent increase in the deficit among policy options increases in public investment spending would minimize any negative effects on longrun gdp since decreases in the private capital stock would be offset by additions to the public capital stock also tax incentives to increase business investme nt would offset the crowding out effect since the spending increase was occurring via business investment

to date some economists have argued that as long as problems remain in these depressed sectors then generalized stimulus will only postpone the inevitable downturn as noted above separate legislation to support housing and financial markets were recently enacted for example goldman sachs predicts that by the fourth quarter of 2008 the effect of the rebates on gdp will have worn off at which point we foresee renewed stagnation in us output 80 other economists argue that if the current housing bust is being caused by the unwinding of bubble then it could be detrimental for the government to interfere with natural market adjustment which is bringing those markets back to equilibrium that in the long run is both necessary and unavoidable and some would argue that the best way to help troubled sector is by boosting overall demand

mortgagerelated assets from financial institutions the plan as passed included much broader definition of troubled asset this broader definition encompasses any asset including stock in banks that treasury in consultation with the federal reserve believes is necessary to provide financial stability following passage treasury committed to purchase 150 billion of preferred shares of the nine largest banks in order to inject capital into the financial system 84 treasury has formally announced that it has abandoned plans to remove troubled mbs from bank balance sheets but has also announced plans to use some of the funds to intervene in consumer based assetbacked securities abs markets such as credit card receivables auto loans and student loans 85

an attempt to unwind their financial commitments can cause too much uncertainty for the balance sheets of other financial firms because financial firms are highly leveraged the failure of major counterparty to their contracts could significantly damage their solvency because credit derivatives are traded many firms might not know how exposed they are to particular counterparties until the derivatives are triggered 87 furthermore there is assurance that counterparties have adequate resources to fulfill their commitments great uncertainty surrounded the toocomplextofail test the federal reserve was willing to provide financial backstop to the resolution of bear stearns but declined to do so for lehman brothers even though both firms participated significantly in credit derivatives markets88 it appeared that the toocomplextofail test would not be applied in the future however three days later the federal reserve provided bridge loan to insurer aig partly due to aigs positions in

mortgagerelated assets from financial institutions which was adopted this option would attempt to remove devalued and illiquid assets from the balance sheets of financial firms at the same time to clean up the entire system one advantage of this approach is that many firms become healthy in one swoop financial firms will have the ability to make new loans not because of more capital but because their existing capital would not be encumbered by bad assets this approach is similar to the resolution trust corporation rtc during the savings and loan crisis the rtc was created to resolve insolvent thrifts it has the advantage of dealing with large amounts of bad debts in short period of time it has the disadvantage of putting the government in an awkward position first the government will be the holder of vast amounts of mortgage debt th treasury proposal says that assets should be resolved to protect the taxpayer however this creates conflict of interest for those policymakers that would want to see more debt forbearance for distressed borrowers second the government could also hold vast interests in real estate if the government sells it quickly to terminate the issue then home prices could collapse if the government holds on to the assets then the government could be in the position of being landlord for extended periods of time finally this approach may have the unintended effect of penalizing firms that acted prudently by cleaning up the balance sheets of their competitors but not of themselves problems in accurately pricing the securities could complicate this approach on the one hand auctions can be designed to attempt to make sure that the government does not overpay for the illiquid securities 92 on the other hand the inclusion of mandatory warrants in eesa complicates the calculation of the worth of the securities to the firms that hold them firm considering selling some securities must not only attempt to evaluate the worth of the security but must also try to calculate the impact of government warrants that could dilute future shareholder positions furthermore the impact on the value of individual securities would be complicated by the number of securities that the firm might consider to sell because the amount of warrants is not directly related to the amount of securities sold firm planning to sell many securities would discount the impact of the warrants similar to spreading fixed costs compared to firms that might plan to sell fewer securities as result not all securities of the same intrinsic risk weighted value would be treated the same in potential eesa auction in the end treasury decided to abandon purchasing existing illiquid mortgagerelated assets

already begun following the passage of pl 110343 in similar approach the government acquired warrants to for this purpose for fannie mae and freddie mac93 this approach has several advantages it would leave the decisions of which assets to keep and which to dispose of to firm managers who would presumably have greater expertise second it would not require the government to become the administrator of large accumulations of real estate assets third if the program successfully revives financial markets then the stock will compensate the government for the cost of the program this approach is similar to the reconstruction finance corporation rfc during the 1930s the rfc was created to loan funds directly to banks railroads and other firms during the great depression during the hoover administration the rfc primarily intervened by providing loans to banks and trusts the names of recipient banks were announced which may have had the perverse effect of identifying weak banks which subsequently suffered runs on their deposits fdr made several changes one of which allowed the comptroller of the currency to reorganize national banks without receivership the comptroller could then
