the board on september 8 2004 the strategy was designed to ensure strong government ownership of the program to allow the government and the bank to adjust that program to changing government priorities and country circumstances and thereby to maximize the contribution to development the cornerstone of the cps is the joint economic research program jerp an instrument that has put at the service of the government of kazakhstan gok best international practice in managing natural resource windfalls and harnessing them for the needs of human development 2 at the time of the 2004 kazakhstan cps the government was skeptical of the banks value added and questioned its relevance to its development agenda there was risk that engagement could be cut off entirely the introduction of the jerp was an innovative solution to change the way the bank works in kazakhstan as result the program since 2004 has been purely demanddriven the pressure of discerning client has helped improve the quality and responsiveness of the interventions the quality of the dialogue has improved and the bank is now viewed as trusted policy advisor the jerp has proven to be helpful vehicle to promote strong ownership including at high levels of government 1 country context 3 the political environment evolved during the cps period legislature has become increasingly active and assumed expanded powers under the 2007 constitutional reform which declared the transition from presidential to presidentialparliamentary republic early parliamentary elections were held on august 182007 and the party nurotan received 88 percent of the vote and won all available efforts to improve voice and participation are ongoing and the government has indicated its intention to continue the process of democratization decentralization and the development of civil society institutions recently the organization for security and co operation in europe osce appointed kazakhstan as chairmaninoffice for 20 10 by unanimous vote of the 56 participating member states2 4 until mid2007 kazakhstan maintained strong economic performance driven by rising oil production and prices but faced mounting overheating risks more recently an asset bubble emerged in the real estate sector real gross domestic product gdp growth averaged 96 percent over 20042007 gdp per capita has doubled during the cps period exceeding us6700 in 2007 the consolidated budget remained in healthy surplus it averaged 56 percent of gdp over 200420073 and the majority of windfall oil revenues have been saved in the national fund of the republic of osce observers said the 2007 election showed progress compared to the 2005 presidential elections but was still marred by problems bias in the state media was noted while independent observers report that media freedom remains limited kazakhstan joined osce in 1992 and will be the first noneuropean country to chair it this comprises state budget nfrk savings and privatization receipts the latter have equaled zero since 3 2003 kazakhstan nfrk established in 20004 nevertheless signs of overheating multiplied inflation accelerated from 64 percent in 2003 to 86 percent in 2006 and to 108 percent in 2007 cumulative appreciation of real effective exchange rate over 20042007 was 13 percent overheating was exacerbated by very rapid growth of foreign borrowing and commercial credit expansion which led to the deterioration of the quality of loan portfolios of kazakhstan banks 5 shifts on the international financial markets in 2007 have affected the growth outlook of kazakhstan foreign borrowing became much less accessible and more expensive the financial services and construction sectors have slowed down considerably since mid2007 and growth outlook for 20082010 is in the range of 46 percent capital inflows particularly debt financing have been much more modest which created shortterm pressures on the tenge exchange rate in the second half of 2007 and weakened the balance of payments 6 the authorities have taken strong measures to contain the financial crisis and by late 2007 financial markets in kazakhstan have stabilized to an important degree and in spring 2008 the balance of payments has strengthened markedly on january 8 2008 the government the national bank of kazakhstan nbk and agency for the supervision of financial markets afn published joint statement that outlined their crisis mitigation strategies and emphasized the need to share risks between the government and the private sector this sent clear signal that the government will not be providing generalized bailout and will maintain prudent fiscal stance in the wake of financial sector troubles there remain risks that the government may be tempted to maintain certain level of growth via domestic credit expansion although slower than in 20052007 this would likely have significant fiscal costs and could precipitate deeper crisis particularly in global economic slowdown scenario 7 key development challenges for kazakhstan go beyond maintaining prudent macro policiesto further improving the investment climate and quality of governance nontransparent corporate governance constrains the attractiveness of kazakhstan as an investment destination5 kazakhstans progress in implementing international obligations to fight money laundering and terrorist financing also remained limited until 2008 when policy decision has finally been taken to establish the anti money laundering unit in the mof overall governance ratings suggest that corruption did not abate in the past four years and may be influencing development effectiveness 8 diversification is also challenge and now is an opportune time to focus on it including by developing the countrys potential as an agricultural producer and exporter the country is endowed with abundant land and the agricultural sector has become more competitive in recent years the recent global food price increase is benefiting farmers particularly grain producers who responded in 2007 with impressive production growth however domestic consumers were hard hit with prices for some nrfk reached us24 billion in may 2008 it is independently audited and managed kazakhstans doing business ranking has improved in 2008 to 7lst and its ease of paying taxes ranking to 44 the highest in the commonwealth of independent states cis group the global competitiveness index produced by the world economic forum for kazakhstan was 61st in 2008 but individual components of this index varied from strong performance on macroeconomic policies and labor market flexibility respectively 25h and 15 place to rather low indicators for health and primary education 94 4 5 2 food groups doubling the challenge is to strike delicate balance between the development needs of the sector and protecting consumers 2 governments overall policy environment and progress achieved to date 9 over the past four years kazakhstans leaders have maintained strategic vision for economic development based on integration into the global economy through the adoption of international standards for the productive financial and public sectors in 2003 kazakhstan adopted its national strategy for industrial innovation development nsiid for 2003201 5 aimed at laying the legislative and institutional foundations for economic diversification the 2004 cps supports nsiid with wideranging policy advice and technical assistance from the bank equipped with these tools kazakhstan maintained macroeconomic and fiscal stability made progress in strengthening institutions in several key areas and embarked on an ambitious public administration reform with time its development programs have become richer and more focused on issues related to competitiveness such as the investment climate institutions human capital basic infrastructure and the environment6 the broad government priorities remain consistent with the pillars identified at the time of the cps pillar 1 reducing losses in competitiveness through prudent management of the oil windfall and increased public sector efficiency 10 since the 2004 cps kazakhstan has established credible agenda for transitioning to modern economy and has made progress in its implementation its track record has been impressive in meeting the overall growth objectives aggregate income levels and fiscal stability its record in mitigating the resource curse and increasing public sector efficiency was more mixed evidently structural shifts that can spur the transition over longterm towards the service sectorsdriven knowledge economy as envisaged in the nsiid requires more than four years that have elapsed since the launch of the 2004 cps 11 jerp provided extensive support to the government in mitigating shortterm and mediumterm macroeconomic risks advisory and analytical services aaa under jerp helped the government to define specific measures for containing the overheating syndrome more recently jew advisory services helped the government to avoid fiscally risky general bailout strategies in the wake of financial sector crisis and to balance macroeconomic and monetary stability with sustainable growth objectives jerp supported the formulation of mediumterm macroeconomic forecasts and government staff training in this area several jerp reports on financial sector risks prepared in 20052007 have spurred important amendments to the regulatory and supervision framework for commercial banks and capital markets 12 the banks program facilitated the transfer of bestpractice international experience in public sector management which helped government launch administrative reform and mediumterm performancebased budgeting the bank helped develop the new institutional framework for government agencies separating of particular importance was the march 2006 address which set the goal for kazakhstan of 6 joining the group of fifty most competitive nations 3 policymaking and executive functions and increasing the efficiency of public decision making analytical work on the efficiency of kazakh customs yielded number of reform recommendations which are now being implemented via the fy08 customs development project the jerp supported review of tax policy and administration framework and familiarized government officials with good practice tax systems eg us sweden as result revisions to the tax code are being made on the public expenditure side advisory support started with recommendations on improving public investment planning and then expanded to full assessment of financial management systems recently the government requested bank advice on establishing committee for financial monitoring under the ministry of finance as part of its anti money laundering and combating financing of terrorism amlkft effort 13 the signing in december 2006 of memorandum of understanding mou on the extractive industries transparency initiative eiti between the government and the bank accelerated the pace of eiti implernentatin amendments to the law on subsoil use were passed mandating commitment to eiti for all new license holders eiti now covers not just the oil and gas sector but mining as well with 103 companies participating including tengizchevroil the largest oil producer in kazakhstan the share of companies that have signed the eiti memorandum represents over 80 percent of the total extractive revenues generated in the on february 29 2008 kazakhstan held its first national eiti conference and presented its first national eiti report covering 2005 data on payments and government revenues from the oil and gas sector the bank is expected to maintain its support to the government for expanding the coverage of the second eiti report planned for late 2008 this will be an important step towards full eiti membership pillar 2 promoting competitiveness by strengthening the governments capacity to identifi and reduce barriers to businesses and private investors 14 progress on the diversification agenda has been limited kazakhstan faces problems similar to other oil exporters where strong dominance of the extractive sectors and rapid overall growth has not translated into meaningful results in non extractive exports almost half of all growth momentum during 20042007 was accounted for by construction and finance far from sustainable pattern of growth the regulatory regime remains rigid in particular as regards multiple inspections and the award of land property rights foreign direct investment fdi remains concentrated in oil and gas while nontransparent ownership structures in other sectors deter foreign direct investment appreciation of real effective exchange rate by about 13 percent over 20042007 has weakened the competitiveness of domestic manufacturing this effect however was less pronounced than in some other oil exporters whose currencies have appreciated stronger than tenge over the same period 15 agriculture has excellent prospects particularly grain exports and number of policies have been developed to strengthen this sector jerp focused on key policy issues to promote the agriculture sector as an engine of economic growth the kazakhstan joined extractive industries transparency initiative eiti in june 2005 but its progress the rest is accounted by about 190 small firms out of the total of 296 extractive sector companies 7 towards full membership has accelerated only since late 2006 8 4 government has sought the advice on the role of the state as facilitator to strengthen the competitiveness this includes establishing level playing field for all producers and maintaining quality in production the bank has provided advice and investments in the areas of food safety which is key barrier to entering new markets there is some concern about the efficiency of remaining government controls and subsidies and their benefits for productivity government is also seeking the continuous engagement and international frame of reference to inform its policy response to the current food crisis in this context the bank held high level brainstorming event in april 2008 focused on agriculture policy and food price issues 16 the banks support through jew focused on helping the government to make concrete improvements in the competition regime the bank provided extensive support to the process of accession to the world trade organization wto while the jerp report on agricultural policies focused inter alia on the effectiveness of public support for that sector as result of bank work in this area the government has made amendments to the law aimed to improve the competition protection regime the competitiveness of economy is further enhanced with the ongoing jew work on local supply chains and technoparks development beyond jerp technology commercialization project is supporting the strategy for the development of industrial innovations which kazakhstan adopted in 2003 the government is also focusing on the human development agenda in order to improve competitiveness see pillar 3 17 the current international finance corporations ifcs committed portfolio in kazakhstan is us204 million as of april 2008 and supports the financial sector and projects in the oil and gas and general manufacturing sectors while the lack of transparency regarding the ownership of enterprises and financial intermediaries remaining weaknesses in corporate governance and the still limited use of audited financial statements in accordance with international good practices remain challenging despite these obstacles ifc has been expanding its private sector investment program ifc commitments since fy05 total usl75 million further developments in the areas of corporate governance and business transparency should attract more private investors and bring greater efficiency as businesses mature and seek greater access to international sources of financing to support such enterprises ifc started corporate governance advisory services project focusing on regulatory improvements increasing general awareness of corporate governance issues and providing customized advice to private companies customized assistance for companies on corporate governance may result in important synergies with investment operations pillar 3 building the foundation for future competitiveness by investing in human capital and basic infrastructure 18 public spending on human capital and infrastructure has grown and human development indicators have improved over the cps period undps human development index improved from 80th in 2005 to 73d in 2007 still much remains to be done and human development indicators are inferior to those of many countries at comparable levels of income per capita major segments of infrastructure eg road and power transmission networks urban infrastructure and services do not meet the needs of rapidly evolving economy two projects which the bank implements for kegoc have 5 contributed visibly to stable power supply in the southern regions of the country while the road rehabilitation project has helped the government strengthen the vital transportation link between almaty and astana the government is aware of the need to improve human development outcomes in february 2008 highlevel brainstorm was organized in partnership with the bank which addressed key policy challenges facing health education and social protection sectors the brainstorm helped the government prioritize its actions in these vital areas of social policy 19 the bank has supported kazakhstans human development agenda through the jerp program in several areas at the request the bank prepared report on improving the longterm sustainability of the kazakh pension system as result the government is formulating comprehensive program to improve the efficiency of its pension system in line with international best practice and considering amendments to the pension legal and institutional framework recommendations of higher education report prepared jointly with the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd were used by the ministry of education and science to formulate its sector reform strategy in the health sector analytical work begun under jew has evolved into the health sector technology transfer and institutional reform project approved in fy08 which is helping to raise the efficiency of public resources directed to the health sector the latter is good example of how modest bank engagement through analytical and advisory support has led to an investment project see box 1 beyond jerp the syr daria and north aral project synasi has delivered impressive results ahead of schedule and dramatically improved the livelihoods of fishing communities along the northern rim of the aral sea pillar 4 ensuring future growth will not harm the environment andpast liabilities are mitigated 20 the impact of banksupported work addressing environmental concerns is tangible the government is strongly committed to addressing key environmental legacy issues and is undertaking substantial investments in the environment sector the bank provided over the period of this cps extensive technical assistance to kazakhstan on reducing gas flaring which culminated in 2006 with workshop by the global gas flaring reduction partnership ggfr and amendments to law on oil which obliges extractive companies to reduce gas flaring through the gas utilization program meanwhile small geffunded project on drylands management has delivered results beyond expectations farmers participating in the project saw their cattle herd double which led the ministry of environment to seek repeater 2 1 the government recognizes the environmental regulatory framework and enforcement practices need strengthening the current regulatory framework is based on environmental fees that are generally too low to serve as incentives for industries to invest in abatement measures institutional capacity needs to be strengthened to enable the enforcement of environmental standards air and water pollution is significant and since the environmental monitoring systems are not adequately funded environmental statistics do not reflect the current pollution load on the environment hazardous and non hazardous dumpsites and landfills often do not meet international sanitary design standards for safe disposal of waste 6 box 1 jewtoproject sequence the health sector technology transfer and institutional reform project the engagement with government on healthcare began in 2000 with preparation of health restructuring project focused on primary healthcare that project was cancelled in 2002 following decision by government to cancel all bank projects reduce external debt and selffinance existing projects using budget funds the bank retained an ad hoc relationship with the government on health issues until 2003 when the health sector was included in the jerp this reopening of formal dialogue coincided with the development of the state health care reform and development program 20052010 to which the bank provided substantial input the relationship with the ministry of health strengthened with jerp moving from program of demanddriven but piecemeal policy advice to coordinated technical assistance program focused on health information systems health financing reform and healthcare quality improvement the bank also helped coordinate support from other partners including the world health organization and the united states agency for international development jerp activities were supplemented in 2005 by flagship piece of economic and sector work on health information systems and in 2006 by the health involvement in highlevel government study tour to examine and new experiences with public management reform in the health sector by early 2006 it became evident that with comprehensive reform program in place and key policy choices made the government needed assistance primarily on reform implementation accordingly in early 2008 the health sector technology transfer and institutional reform project was approved the share of preparation costs was funded largely by the government fiduciary preparation was financed by the bank to avoid conflict of interest ministry of health staff is responsible for actual project preparation the project covers wide range of reform issues including health financing healthcare quality improvement medical education and science reform laboratory and blood transfusion system reform reform of pharmaceutical policy and strengthening of food safety among others total project cost is us 177 million with further us1784 million in cofinancing from the government source bank staff cps relevance 22 overall the flexible and strategic approach formulated in 2004 has delivered the expected results by offering new products primarily cuttingedge knowledge driven by the needs and priorities the bank has managed not only to maintain its presence in kazakhstan but to increase demand for its services this approach has demonstrated that the bank can remain relevant in addressing development challenges of countries that enjoy commodity export windfalls and have low borrowing requirement 23 on the nonlending side there has been notable increase in the range and amount of government financing of analytical and technical assistance services requested by the government in 2007 the jerp program grew to us3 million with majority government funding the fy07fy08 jew programs reflect the priorities of the mediumterm program for 20072009 namely administrative reform and public finance management vital for improving the quality of government services territorial development reflecting government concerns that the fmits of rapid economic growth reach every citizen in every region of the country and competition regulation and supply chain development which reflect growing focus on competitiveness the the cps was designed to serve as basis for cooperation between the bank and kazakhstan for as long as it remained relevant in the overall economic and political environment relevance was to be assessed against three criteria the demand for the services the valueadded to the development process and overall policy environment 9 7 importance and effectiveness of highlevel brainstorms to support the jerpbased dialogue on key development issues is valued by government who use these events to inform the process of policy formulation and implementation see 3 1 24 an important feature of the past three years has been the continuity of key themes in the jerp reflecting the consistency of government priorities with second generation reforms often the first request to survey international good practice on certain topic evolves into adapting bestpractice to the kazakhstan context for eg the world trade organization wto accession work tax administration and the reform of tariffs to build on this analytical work the government has in certain instances requested preparation of bankfinanced project to support specific reforms eg the customs development project and the health sector technology transfer and institutional reform project this confirms that the government believes that bank projects can provide knowledge transfer beyond what is possible through analytical work alone this is demonstrated by the recent increase in the pipeline of bank projectsthree have been approved in fy08 five more are under preparation 25 jerp effectiveness is further enhanced by making publications available to the civil society at large the banks public information centers in astana and almaty including two out of office units in the national libraries make jew publications available to various nongovernment clients including business associations non governmental organizations ngos and academia stakeholder consultations were held over the past four years on such key issues as health and education environmentally sustainable development eiti agriculture competition policy migration and youth portfolio performance 26 an important challenge for the bank in kazakhstan as in some other middle income countries mics is working with internal country processes which are evolving at slower pace than dictated by the countrys development needs while under the 2004 cps the government indicated its preference to see bank projects designed for quick delivery preparation held to 12 months and implementation to 3 years whenever possible government steps to simplify internal processes to speed up project approval and implementation have been limited project preparation is rigidly bound to the annual budget preparation cycle while signing and effectiveness are stalled by repetitive clearance procedures it takes currently about 40 months from concept approval to effectiveness project implementation is hindered by excessively rigid interpretation of feasibility studies the lack of flexibility in budget implementation and micro management of procurement and disbursement by the ministry of finance this weakens the ability to provide timely assistance 27 not all projects in kazakhstans portfolio seem to be equally affected by the problems described above two projects implemented by the kazakhstan electricity grid operating company kegoc under the sovereign guarantee have been prepared in much shorter time periods 6 and 15 months from concept to effectiveness while the strong ownership of projects by public company which is known to be one of the best run companies in kazakhstan might have contributed to this outcome public companies also seem to function in more flexible regulatory environment than government entities 8 28 the bank is finalizing participatory country portfolio performance review cppr and is formulating jointly with the government concrete action plan to improve portfolio performance close attention to portfolio performance on the as well as on the part have already brought some marginal improvements in 2007 joint governmentbank working group has examined the reasons for the disappointing pace of investment projects and proposed some improvements within the existing legal framework the disbursement ratio in fy08 has exceeded the results of the two preceding fiscal years anecdotal evidence suggests that the turnaround of project related correspondence by the state agencies has become faster however most issues are systemic and can be improved radically only through comprehensive changes in the public financepublic service systems and underlying legislation the 2008 cppr explores in more depth the underlying reasons of the relatively better performance of public companies mentioned above to see if some lessons learned can be applied to governmentled projects through the jerp the bank is supporting government reforms in public finance and public administration which may ultimately streamline systems in more radical way and lead to substantial improvements in the portfolio performance 29 the main drivers of the quality of the bank portfolio affect also the governments own investment program excessive centralization of decisionmaking and budgetary controls is slowing down project preparation and implementation through the cppr and jerp the bank had drawn the attention of the government to these lessons the latter has recently initiated important reforms which promise to improve the efficiency of public investment more systematically this issue is being addressed by the new budget code which is expected to be enacted later in 2008 adopts mediumterm performancefocused budgeting and makes financial management and procurement mechanisms more flexible accountable and transparent lessons learned 30 the jerp approach requires constant attention to the client whose priorities shift frequently in extreme cases this priority setting can become volatile which may lower the impact of bank work the lesson learned is to balance responsiveness while keeping the strategic perspective on long term reform needs of the economy the bank has achieved some success in this area while not every bank report was accepted there were examples where they became wholly adopted and used to frame the strategic planning eg health wto accession tax administration in some other cases when the timing was not right for implementing the recommendations the government appreciated their value at later point and relied on them to inform policy choices eg overheating and macroeconomic management the advice was found to be most effective when developed around broader themes eg competitiveness human development and diversification where different individual work items reinforce each other one example is the education work prepared in the context of the jew 3 1 highlevel brainstorming events help government set priorities for complex reform agendas the bank has supported the ambitious reform agenda through series of brainstorming events six since 2004 which focus on learning from international experience as they build their capacity in reform formulation and implementation the key themes of the frankfurt brainstorming held in july 2006 were 9 adopted as the main areas of the mediumterm program for 20072010 february 2008 event focused on the human development agenda which the government recognizes as critical for longterm competitiveness of the country the president referred to some of the recommendations of this session during his annual address to the nation the most recent brainstorming in april 2008 addressed agricultural policy issues 3 bank strategy looking forward 32 the overall operational environment for the bank in kazakhstan remains positive with strong demand for nonlending services and the government recognizing that banksupported projects transfer knowledge and skills in ways that purely analytical program cannot accomplish jerp will remain the key driver of this cps and is expected to be maintained at broadly the same level the government and the bank will work to further increase the direct policy relevance and the impact of each jew study the government is already using jew to develop its own analytical and policy formulation capacity good example is the role of the prime national analytical center in implementing jerp tasks on administrative reform and the survey of the quality of government services the government is stepping up quality control of jerp tasks scrutinizing them for concrete impact to make sure that line agencies fully benefit from jerp support discussions are underway to extend jerp benefits to agencies such as the national bank and the national holdings 33 the government recognizes that banksupported projects facilitate key institutional reforms accelerate the evolution of fiduciary systems towards international best practice and thus have spillover effects for improving the efficiency of governments own investments accordingly the government and the bank have increased the number of projects under preparation annex 1 this translates into an average lending envelope of roughly us320 million per year over the period 2008201 0 which is higher than the us100150 million originally envisioned in the cps future lending will depend on whether the existing government consensus that bank projects deliver tangible valueadded will hold the impact of bank projects will be determined by the ability to act on the cppr recommendations and expedite project preparation and execution for the next few years the procurement and financial guidelines will continue to apply capacity building in these key areas is programmed under jerp specific areas of engagement 34 the new government appointed in 2007 has reconfirmed its desire that the bank remain engaged in each of the four pillars of its development strategy the government views the bank as an efficient conduit for international knowledge and experience on key strategic issues to organize consensus building activities and debates and to provide implementation support and capacity building details of the fy08 and mediumterm programs are presented in annex 1 the government is also financing bank technical support to establish the bota foundation to benefit children and youth in kazakhstan see box 2 since the fiscal position is forecast to remain strong significant government cofinancing for most projects 50 percent or more of total project cost is likely 10 35 as result of the jjzrp approach the bank has not been engaged in some traditional areas where there was demand eg poverty assessment while official reported poverty numbers national poverty line have decreased from 27 percent to 127 percent over the cps period there is very little knowledge on the distribution of poverty across regions social groups and the impact of the recent financial sector and rise in food prices on poverty this work is fundamental to making actionable recommendations for macro management and social protection policies the bank proposes to the government joint poverty assessment in fy09 similarly the bank will recommend work to assess the governance environment and its impact on development effectiveness box 2 the bota program in may 2007 the world bank agreed to assist the governments of kazakhstan the united states and switzerland in setting up an independent foundation in kazakhstan that will use approximately us84 million in frozen funds for development projects involving poor children and youth in kazakhstan the concept and program of the bota foundation meaning baby camel in kazakh was developed by the world bank in response to request from the three governments to develop transparent mechanism to use the funds for the direct benefit of the people of kazakhstan the bota purposes are to implement multiyear program through such activities as i conditional cash payments to kazakh families for those under school age to receive adequate health care ii educational scholarships to the poorest kazakh youth to attend university and iii grants to local and international ngos aimed at improving youth welfare in kazakhstan the work is financed on feeforservice basis potential new clients 36 opportunities to expand the world bank group wbg portfolio the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd lending guarantees and risk management products and the international finance corporation ifc longterm financing exist with regards to the government holding companies samruk and kazyna the newly established socioentrepreneurial corporations secs and sub national governments similar to other mics careful risk analysis should be conducted to determine whether such new business lines can be developed without central government guarantees which appears to be the stated preference of the government in some cases existing legislation limits the ability to work with new clients eg local governments other than the municipalities of almaty and astana cannot contract foreign debt the bank and the ifc are helping the government strengthen its public private partnership ppp program via policy advice including on the establishment of the ppp unit and assistance with pilot transactions in the power and transport sectors central asia regional issues 37 over the cps period kazakhstan has gained prominence as regional growth engine and built up its presence in regional structures such as the central asia regional economic cooperation carec eurasian economic community and its development bank eadb the government has expressed interest in contributing to regional development projects both through these regional frameworks and through national holdings primarily kazyna and samruk kazakhstan is already the largest 0 kazyna is the sustainable development fund and samruk is holding for the management of state assets 11 investor in the kyrgyz republic and is major investor in georgia and some other cis countries in particular kazakhstan is interested in supporting large regional projects such as the rogun power dam in tajikistan and the central asiasouth asia regional electricity market casarem the bank is assisting government to work closely with regional cooperation bodies in the fields of energy transport trade and communicable disease kazakhstan has also notified the bank of its intention to make its first contribution to ida thus marking its entry into the group of donor countries the bank stands ready to assist kazakhstan establish its development assistance fimction which is expected to prioritize its central asian neighbors monitoring and evaluation 38 the cps success will continue to be measured primarily in terms of the value added that bank interventions bring to kazakhstans development agenda as the program is demand driven the effectiveness will in the first instance be measured by whether or not the government remains interested in continued involvement in the jew and lending in broad way the impact of the cps on the development of kazakhstan will be measured in terms of the priorities the authorities set for their development agenda and the pace with which they increase government implementation capacity the bank will regularly review the followup to the recommendations made through analytic work and in project preparation within each of the four pillars the impact will be measured by the degree to which the bank promotes dialogue and debate around specific policy issues eg education and health reform utility tariff reform capital markets development etc addresses questions raised by the government in real time provides advice based on the most relevant international experience and the understanding of circumstances and provides handson institutional support through projects 39 the bank will ensure that the environment into which its resources are placed meets reasonable standards of policy direction and governance this will require monitoring overall reform efforts particularly in macroeconomic and fiscal management and the various aspects that could contribute to greater competitiveness transparency and governance including implementation of international amlcft obligations pursuant to treaties which kazakhstan has signed and ratifiedi2 outcomes for example in diversification competitiveness and poverty reduction will also need to be monitored an assessment of progress to date under the cps is provided in annex 1 4 risks and creditworthiness risks 40 in terms of macroeconomic risks kazakhstan is well positioned to weather external shocks sovereign foreign debt has declined to negligible levels in recent years under 2 percent of gdp at end2007 the consolidated government budget is in healthy surplus 56 percent of gdp for 20042007 the country has accumulated in 2000 kazakhstan signed but has not yet ratified the convention against transnational organized 12 crime palermo convention major instrument in the fight against amlcft 12 over us40 billion in gross international reserves the longerrun solvency of the government appears even stronger due to the large kashagan off shore oil field which is expected to come on line in the next five years and roughly double oil output of the country 41 by establishing nfrk and by implicitly targeting certain level of nonoil fiscal deficit kazakhstan has done much to mitigate the problems of dutch disease and overheating the tenge has appreciated in real terms to lesser degree than the currencies of most oil exporters have in recent years until 2007 inflation associated with oil dependency was kept broadly in check the significant increase in inflation in 2007 can be largely attributed to sharp increases in world prices for food products 42 kazakhstans outstanding challenges are the need to improve its investment climate by increasing the transparency of corporate governance reduce its dependence on extractive sectors consolidate its balance of payments position primarily with regards to the current account and to contain the already high private external debt the government recognizes its exposure to these risks and relies on the bank extensively as source of advice in shaping its macroeconomic and diversification policies the bank will also energize the governance dialogue by demonstrating the value of good governance for development effectiveness 43 kazakhstan is also vulnerable to other external shocks these include nonoil commodity shocks climatic shocks affecting the agricultural sector the risk of major earthquakes and other
