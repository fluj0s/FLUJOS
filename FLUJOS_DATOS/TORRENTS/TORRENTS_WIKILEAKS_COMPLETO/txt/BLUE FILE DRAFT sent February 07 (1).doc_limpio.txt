investigation into fraud concerning the estate of the late bernard glazer nowhere in history are the glazer brothers mentioned for their achievements and yet as research has revealed they were very powerful men on this continent as well as abroad bernard glazer opposite was private individual who played major role in developing southern and central africa when he consolidated their interests after his brother sams below untimely death in 1959 bernard represented honour integrity and courage representative of the former generation that built this country he acted behind the scenes in conjunction with the highest executive levels of both government and private enterprise in africa and globally in his will he appointed his sam glazer after reaching 21 julius feinstein and cyril jaffe as administrators the latter two his oldest and most trusted directors of numerous companies locally and abroad to ensure and perpetuate his vision bernard glazer passed away under unusual circumstances on 17 july 1984 michele glazer his eldest daughter and beneficiary entered into family agreement in 1997 were she ceded her entitlement in terms of the will to her brother sam glazer based upon the evidence and with proper reading of the will and powers of trustees the contract entered into with her brother and the socalled ratification thereof by the administrators and with reference to the above the administration of deceased estates act and certain provisions therein we believe that michele is compelled to set the matter right by way of an application to court for an order setting aside the agreement entered into we are of the view that the agreement entered into between michele and her brother wherein she cedes her entitlement in terms of the will from that date to him is irregular and unenforceable and in fact void abinitio in view of the fact that the position that he her brother occupied at the time of concluding the contract was as heir as well as an administrator of the trust and that there is clear conflict between the two positions with regard to prejudicing other heirs and furthermore the agreement is not approved by the master of the supreme court we advise that on our interpretation of the will wherein the trust is created the will does not make provision for this scenario further to the above having regard to the assets of the estate and the complex web of transactions of the tati concessions and mineral rights and royalties accruing thereto and its successors there appears to have been massive fraud committed by the administrators and executors of the late estate whereby assets that were the property of the deceased at the time of his death were wilfully and deliberately concealed from the master of the supreme court and are not referred to in the liquidation distribution ld accounts and have effectively been siphoned off this doubt prejudices not only the south african uk government and others by not disclosing the estate duty that would be due to it but there is the further question of prejudice to heirs in that the impression is created that the trust does not have assets wherein in fact the substantial portions thereof were never in the first place brought into the trust which we are sure will be of interest to the receiver of revenue as well as to constitute criminal offence furthermore that her brother fraudulently withheld relevant information from her which would be further ground of setting aside the 1997 agreement based on fraudulent misrepresentation as well as whether or not one can cede in the context of vesting estate future right or hope the reconstruction of the glazer brothers history in southern africa and internationally remains the significance of the intellectual property that will provide an understanding of what is happening in south africa presently and is perhaps the entry point for much that was excluded from the trc contrary to public opinion of mineral rights ownership in southern africa beginning with cecil john rhodes and the charter group of companies and the well publicised history of anglo americande beers rio tinto and lonrho there is the unpublished history of the glazer brothers it is this extraordinary story that demonstrates far more sinister and unbridled greed that casts long shadows reaching across the decades to darken the reputations of some of south africas most eminent professional men bernard glazer did much to open up botswana zimbabwe and zambia from the early 1950s with acquisitions of former british south africa companys bsac such as tati co 16 million acres in botswana and the bechuanaland exploration co the former managers for the bsac in southern africa this company held vast interests in botswana zimbabwe and zambia including mineral trading timber and water rights schedule of some principal investments included central mining and investment corprand mines african european investment co charterland general durban roodepoort deep rand selection corp sa mines selection ltd rhodesian anglo american president steyn gold mining co and pretoria portland cement with these various share interests the glazer brothers made controlling bids for central mining investment corp and lonrho in 195657 at the same time consolidated gold fields was formed and records indicate an interest therein one must bear in mind that the foundation of southern africas wealth and development after wwii was created in all commercial spheres with mining at the core an understanding of current developments such as the gold fieldsharmony takeover and barclaysabsa acquisition requires an understanding of those foundation structures put in place between 1948 1984 core asset of the glazer brothers property portfolio was their acquisition of african city properties trust in 1952 this company was incorporated in england in 1894 and owned large portfolio of land and buildings mostly in the jhb cbd area this company with its entire asset portfolio was sold in 1965 to urban investment properties pty ltd the sole shareholder of which was the joint municipal pension fund transvaal situated in benoni the entire parcel was later acquired by retco ltd at some time in the seventies retcos major shareholder appears to have been federated employers insurance ltd which later became fedsure before it was taken over by investec in 1987 however the parcel of land didnt move all the way with the federated bundle it was hived off in 1981 after having been held through retco by south african breweries for while to the cbd property fund which was controlled by sage holdings ltd through sagenedequity properties pty ltd the start of the exit trail was when acp 1952 ltd was converted to private company in 1983 as were many of glazers companies around this time by 1997 the year michele signed the questionable family agreement with her brother sam sage group was ranked at number 51 on the sunday times business times top 100 companies list it had turnover of r24 billion total assets of r58 billion and managed assets exceeding r9 billion of particular relevance was glazers expansion of his international operations in the 1970s he enjoyed close friendship with his banker jan hurter who at the time was chairman of volkskas and also sat on the board of the south african reserve bank one important subsidiary acquired was schwab small merchant bank in london which facilitated the banking licence so necessary in the days of apartheid sanctions prior to his death bernard glazer entered into joint venture jv with volkskas limited resulting in him owning 25 share in volkskas international also acquired in the 1970s was the siberian syndicate limited inc1913 an investment holding company with interests in siberia and other mining investments such as substantial holding in gold fields the name was changed to crest international securities and had on its board numerous influential south africans such as the lubner brothers one cannot look at the future without taking into account the structures that he created and how these have been used by creative legal and accounting brains to funnel large amounts of wealth out of number of african countries particularly since his death in 1984 the same group that has used his structures to run away with the bone currently holds sway over africas destiny through the control of or at least major influence over the financial and mining sectors the historical relevance of his story lies in exposing or illuminating the global political and financial structures that existed behind the veil of apartheid and in spite of economic sanctions it will also suggest plan to bring the anc into government and to strip the country of its wealth at the same time our investigation reveals pattern of destruction of company records both from the dti companies house london and various other depositories to reconstruct the history of bernard glazer outside the orbit of the administrators michele glazer has suffered undue and unnecessary prejudice since her fathers passing way in her attempts to unravel the truth there was effort made to memorialise his legacy and michele was marginalised and every effort was made for her to cede her rights and entitlement through debtforequity entrapments which included regal treasury after 20 year battle the matter rested with the high court of pretoria where the estate had been temporarily suspended from closing on the 5th of july 2004 her application had been made for the suspension of the administrators subject to an investigation into the affairs of the trust the administrators deny mineral and other international financial interests yet our research strongly suggests otherwise in october 2005 our client michele glazer unilaterally withdrew case 95752004 in the high court of pretoria and suspect an arrangement with her family ensued notwithstanding extreme prejudice the project team salutes remarkable south african bernard glazer truly larger than life individual the scope of this draft report was limited to the denials in the application as an introduction the scope is far broader and more sinister as the pursuit for truth evolved the private acquisition of bsa companies in the 1950s remains an historical precedent and foundation for transparency today research i salute the project team that rose above adversity in this journey of discovery we began with limited information other than unsubstantiated allegations by client the name blue file was derived from file to include correspondence from sam glazer brother which michele found in her late fathers london penthouse in 1992 the contents revealed relationships and non disclosure which activated this study in order to establish what glazer had purchased by the time of his passing in 1984 we had to go back to the beginning reconstruction of 100 year history involved following mineral right ownership in various countries from the inception of rhodes companies and management by the crown agents for overseas governments also to complete the matrix interconnectivity and symbiotic corporate activity over hundred years hundreds of local and international companies were researched social network charts were constructed manually dusty archives scoured and interviews with the intelligence community academia retirees media this daunting task received the cooperation of numerous individuals from every sector there unselfish contribution to establish the truth remains the basis for this salutation the object was not to audit financials rubberstamped by the glazer will trustees but also illuminate historical misrepresentation we had idea where this investigation would lead us or what budget to set aside we initially focused on botswana mineral rights and the tati exploration company we began with all government records of correspondence between sa botswana since inception and finally retrieved physical copies of title deeds mineral right ownership was further validated with recently declassified correspondence from the commonwealth foreign office uk nathan werksman glazer legal representative defended takeover bid 21 january 1960 by the uk commonwealth office to exclude mineral right ownership and trading rights from any sale the bid via syfrets executor trust co ltd was unsuccessful but defence of tati mineral rights then confirmed there relevance as opposed to the arrogant denials made by administrators in 2003 by march 2003 evidence of fraud by the administrators had received favourable legal opinion by team of professionals and glazer passing in 1984 was suspect research was seriously hampered by the lack of resources to thoroughly investigate the finances of the panamanian registered holding company amarena andor the swiss bank accounts held by bernard glazer before his death also the confidential records maintained by the sa reserve bank relating to the reserve bank approval that was previously granted for certain financial institutions we could not solicit help from the botswana government regarding royalty arrangements but the private agreement in 1970 between sir seretse khama and bernard glazer is self explanatory and elaborated on later in this draft report the interlocking mineral interests of glazer companies acquired in the 1950s included amongst others vast areas zambia congo drc and zimbabwe glazer brothers zimbabwe pty ltd was head quartered in bulawayo and ultimately controlled by panamanian shell amarena due to political instability in zimbabwe formerly southern rhodesia we retrieved the mirror image of mineral succession records from northern rhodesia zambiasee ch6 rhodesian anglo holdings 1962 and company interrelationships for bsa chartered company interviews with senior intelligence personnel in 2002 revealed there was information on glazer other than the kidnapping ransom for sam glazer jnr ownership of mineral interests in africa was vested with anglo beers lonhro formerly london rhodesia rio tinto period history was silent on the controlling bid by glazer brothers for the investment holding company central mining rand mines 195657 and lonhro 1958 this acquisition trail may go some way to explaining the equally unusual passing away of sam glazer bernard brother in 1959 however they spoke frankly of predetermined plan to destabilize south africa and bring the anc into power the industrial development that evolved in southern africa in the 1960s resulted with an investigation that expanded exponentially to include financial institutions such as volkskas international uk established at the apex of sanctions in the 1970s the results described in chapter 4 leaked in 2003 and the subsequent absa acquisition by barclays followed we were bound by law to report fraud to sars and summary evidence of the blue file investigation was placed on record with the business intelligence division of sars and validated by december 2005 since 2003 the scope simply expanded to point where it became obvious the race was on to retrieve records that were being destroyed as fast as we requested or retrieved them those records we planned for retrieval later due to budgetary constraints were gone by the time we got back there relevant company records from our department of trade and industry dti were simply missing or in many cases diluted to render them useless physical records of principal uk controlling entities with companies house uk were burnt by an employee in cardiff the main repository which is not accessible to the public we were fortunate on various occasions to have specific permission and access to share registers we thank those archivists from cardiff for assistance to company records and share registers logistically we relocated on numerous occasions for security reasons and remained confined to premises for 3 years the volume of data retrieved was so voluminous that history was segregated between 1890 1960 the foundation period of glazer acquisitions 19601970 glazer consolidation 19701984 glazer deceased establishment of international operations 1985 1994 the exit of property and anc appointment 19952004 sa destabilisation debt for equity and glazer will trust liquidation i salute our legal representatives who endured endless frustration as they waded through mountains of information and defended michele various debt for equity entrapments also for there protection and motivation the project team invested millions of rand for the cost of international records but unfortunately michele sought to come to private family arrangement rather than suffer marginalisation by family friends and ongoing financial duress her fathers legacy could not be illuminated without successful conviction of defendants michele chose to disappear without contact from 2005 and blue file summary report 04 was simultaneously filed with sars business intelligence unit our mandatory responsibility our initial request was for assistance to complete this investigation and for access to sa reserve bank records the sarb had indicated that substantial files exist but without consent from the administrators or court order the sarb was unable to assist after 12 months the results of the blue file investigation received national security status individuals were assigned from national intelligence agency military intelligence sa secret service sars business intelligence counter intelligence organised crime department of minerals legal and other for international liaison direct correspondence to the presidents office is void of any response or recognition for information supplied the intelligence task force have also disappeared with further contact in few years we have witnessed the exit of miners seen consolidation as never before explosion of mining development in africa reduction and delineation of the interests of anglo beers old faces like general mining disappear new faces front for old what is really going on the african invasion is rhodes revisited with different mask similar invasion is that of foreigners in all parts of africa not dissimilar to gold rush 100 years ago an article in sunday times 18 february 07 p26 the chinese are the new colonials the state keeps slicing an ever shrinking pie believing you can build sustainable economy purely on the services sector and raw material exports the chinese are wooing africa to build infrastructure and create permanent jobs for africans they are the new colonials and it would appear that like george bush who learnt nothing from vietnam our politicians have learnt nothing from colonialism is government up for sale sunday times 18 february 07 p28 and violent crime is more prevalent than it was 10 years ago our media frenzy continues with the suspect leadership in sa various journalists like ann crotty and renee bonorchis received prize winning accolades from sanlam for related subjects such as executives golden parachute for absa directors nallie bosman frans du toit and rupert pardoe were implicated with the barclays takeover see volkskas international ch 4 also the harmony gold fields bid required harmony to honour golden parachutes for three directors holland ian cockrill and craig nelson there was speculation as to anglo shares in gold fields that were suddenly sold to norlisk in march 2004 mineweb 20 feb 07 anglogold and polyus gold stake rumour is prokhorov reviving project golf mikhail prokhorov coowner of polyus gold russias leading gold miner once utilized sporting theme in scheme to buy control of gold fields and take the south african company offshore it was called project golf although prokhorovs strategist for that game leonid rozhetskin was fired when the scheme got prokhorov into kremlin trouble prokhorov and his partner vladimir potanin ended up clearing billion dollars in profit when the scheme was abandoned and the gold fields shares sold more recently prokhorov made himself famous with form of ball game that got him into trouble of another sort but can he be thinking of reviving project golf and taking swing at acquiring anglogold ashanti according to the confidential takeover plan prepared by hsbc in august 2004 project golf required prokhorov to join harmony gold to create new international goldco i from g h and ns international gold assets g stood for gold fields 20 of which had been sold in march 2004 by anglo american to norilsk nickel prokhorovs and potanins principal mining company before polyus was spun off as goldco anglo required the russians pay 116 billion in cash h stood for harmony and n norilsk nickel i according to project golf was to be listed as new major in north america attracting premium valuation the hsbc document acknowledged that the proposed full takeover of gold fields was highly desirable to demonstrate that the original stake purchase had real commercial synergy there was an admission that the gold spin off idea which turned into polyus had been preceded by number of abortive schemes to take prokhorovs and potanins russian gold assets offshore out of reach of the kremlin n has also looked at reversal candidates eg kinross iamgold project golf failed in south africa because harmonys bid was rejected by gold fields shareholders the polyus spinoff took place successfully but kremlin permission for reversal into an offshore company controlled abroad has not been tested that is not for lack of trying on prokhorovs part along with polyuss chief executive yevgeny ivanov to sell their valuation of polyus to kinross kinross has dismissed the russian price as inflated the stock market has been more generous to polyus than tye burt kinrosss chief executive multiplying the value of the gold reserves polyus claims in the ground from an acquisition price of about 1 billion to current market capitalization of 105 billion what if norlisk origins and history coincide with the siberian syndicate1913 uk acquired by glazer in 1970 what if anglo held the shares on behalf of nominees as managers anglo and norlisk conclusion there is new generation of south africans born since the time of the union generations which have shouldered their fathers responsibilities and think they are heavier than they used to bethey might well be right the history of an era in which south africa came of age and grew in stature will stir up events of the past thirty years ago that influence our destiny in some african quarters the two world wars are considered little more than european wars for world dominance which to some degree they were this must be measured however against the tendency to excise the colonised from history this plays down the contribution of previously colonised people to the making of the modern world and oppressive forces of every kind i conclude with this quote oh what tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive sir walter scott brief history of bernard glazer 1 an african pioneer bernard glazer was born in lithuania in 1913 and came to south africa in 1930 when he was 17 the lithuanian jews who immigrated masse to south africa in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century played dominant role in the latter countrys economic history and bernard glazer was exception while most people were active in kimberley and the witwatersrand glazer headed north to botswana southern rhodesia now zimbabwe and northern rhodesia now zambia he acquired company tati goldfields company listed on the london stock exchange and the first ledger entry is dated 30 april 1955 wherein there is royalty and rental payments reflected with specific reference made to the monarch mine which claims date back to 1934 importantly for glazer it was not all gold and diamonds strategic metals such as zinc lead and copper played an important part in the development of the west following the industrial revolution copper in particular was crucial for the expansion of electricity and telephony and for ammunition shells and the rhodesias were rich in copper according to the book oppenheimer and by anthony hocking mcgrawhill 1973 northern rhodesia possessed mining field likely to achieve greater importance than any other in the british empire with the possible exception of the rand and the author continues ernest oppenheimer told the shareholders of anglo america that he was not convinced that the area wouldnt surpass the witwatersrand in value and importance to understand the business of procurement in the colonies it is necessary to understand the british crown agents the crown agents which was established in 1863 and still exists today was an independent organisation selffunded and answerable to noone not to the crown nor to the british parliament whose job it was to procure supplies and contracts on behalf of colonial administrations for the development of the colonies for example if colonial government or administration needed railway line or harbour to be built the crown agents would procure the contractors and the materials necessary for the operation naturally this type of business put them in position to benefit great britain commercially but it also meant that they could perform vital intelligence function the crown agents managed the colonies and mineral interests of the british south africa company bsac the glazer brothers had close links with the british establishment such as baron ellie rothschild and the french with leopold david rothschild see central mining bid it is possible that his estate was wrested from glazer and his beneficiaries by those who were concerned about his powerbase in africa bernard glazer had access to toplevel system locally and internationally the risks of doing business in africa would necessitate the creative use of shell corporations as is still applicable today the blue file contains much evidence of the transnational flow of capital and the pattern is evident as was necessary with the development of southern africa this evidence includes classified foreign affairs documents which give an insight into the workings of global network of influence that has the power to steer world events towards predetermined plan reports on the flow of trans national capital from europe and america during apartheid with particular reference to bank loans copies of documents lodged at companies house in london which reveal the use of front companies to acquire an international bank that became volkskas international and how control of this bank was wrested from bernard glazer by afrikaner interests only year before his passing only year before the south african rand began dramatic slide that has lasted almost two decades but which has suddenly corrected itself in the very year that the glazer estate closes bernard glazer operated in partnership with his brother samuel lieb glazer who was found slumped over his desk in 1959 having suffered what the coroner said was heart attack this mere two years after their much published controlling bids for central mining investment corporationrand mines and london rhodesia mining corporation lonrho of which their substantial interests therein have yet to be determined it may be argued that these interests were acquired in the 1950s however closer look at the share registers of these companies clearly show that large share blocks were held by nominee entities registered in tax safe havens such as panama bermuda the jersey islands to name but few the administrators are being economic with the truth by hiding behind technical limitations imposed by financial institutions in various jurisdictions therefore our investigation is restricted as to the true identity of the nominee companies utilised and the nondisclosure by the south african reserve bank on substantial file held by them on bernard glazer by his own admission feinstein was bernard glazers financial advisor research has revealed that the glazer brothers acquired with the purchase of the bechuanaland exploration company limited principal investments in over 40 transvaal finance and gold mining companies rhodesian companies and commercial and industrial holdings these were in the form of cumulative preference and ordinary stock preference shares convertible notes and shares mortgage debenture stock and so forth after the acquisition these assets disappeared from the financials and this would tie in with the opening of swiss bank account in 1956 prior to the introduction of the electronic system these shares were elaborately engraved certificates an example is the 6 cumulative preference stock of african and european investment company of which these shares can be tracked in the financials up until 1990 when the company is deregistered from companies in london the solution remains access to his fiscal records maintained by his primary bankers the glazer brothers first postwar transaction on record is their acquisition of marston house building in johannesburg in january 1946 and the subsequent registration of company embassy investments pty ltd this was the first investment in real estate portfolio that by the mid1950s would include dozens of companies and even more buildings most of which were in the johannesburg cbd and which included most if not all of the prime spots around the intersections of eloffpleinjeppe joubert streets but it was the acquisition of vast landholdings with mineral rights in bechuanaland now botswana and northern and southern rhodesia now zambia and zimbabwe respectively in the mid1950s that would announce the glazer brothers arrival as major players on the african scene the link between urban real estate and mineral rights is important in the same way that cashrich pension funds and insurance companies invest in real estate so too did the cashrich holders of mineral rights the glazer brothers so while they were well known around johannesburg as property magnates nobody guessed at the real source of their income nor the extent of it fact which would serve the administrators of bernards estate only too well 2 mineral rights the glazer modus operandi the ownership of mineral rights is quite separate from the physical act of mining following the discovery of diamonds in kimberley and gold on the witwatersrand in the late nineteenth century the race was on to see what other riches africa had in store and prospectors headed northwards however it was not freeforall but rather controlled in most gentlemanly manner most of the expeditions were sponsored by corporate backers in london and paris and were conducted by teams that included more businessmen and lawyers than prospectors for the first priority was not to determine the value of the gold or base metal deposits but rather to secure the rights to do so over vast areas from the tribal chiefs the biography of cecil john rhodes the founder by robert i rotberg jonathan ball 2ed 2002 illustrates this process clearly when it tells about the team that rhodes sent to negotiate with king lobengula of the ndebele who ruled over the independent matabeleland the team included charles rudd wealthy businessman who was principal in gold fields and held shares in beers as well as rochfort maguire an oxford graduate and one of the upandcoming star lawyers of the day when they arrived gbulawayo was crowded with motley collection of wouldbe syndicate creators hunters traders prospectors and other hopefuls the king kept rhodess party on string for more than month they were camped outside his kraal while he considered his options but eventually he awarded the concession to rhodess team and it became known as the rudd concession in return for paying lobengula 100 month and supplying him with guns and ammunition and an armed steamboat to patrol the zambezi the king assigned rudd and company the complete and exclusive charge over all the metals and minerals situated and contained in my kingdoms principalities and dominions the concession gave the company carte blanche to do whatever was necessary to extract the metals and minerals and to protect their rights to the profits it gave the company the right to exclude all others seeking land or prospecting privileges from his kingdom it is known that the glazer brothers gained control over what was known as the tati concession which would have been acquired in very much the same way and with similar terms and conditions the actual work of prospecting and the wholly separate operation of physically extracting the metals or minerals from the ground and transporting and marketing them was done by companies created and financed specifically for that purpose such mining companies were sometimes created by the same people who owned the mineral rights but more often than not it was completely different company that moved in on the land with the consent of the rights holder the rights holder in effect became the mining companys landlord this structure and practice remains in place today the physical component of mining requires large investments in equipment negotiations with labour and risk exposure to the vicissitudes of the market the landowner on the other hand just sits back and waits if gold or nickel or copper comes out of the ground he gets few pennies for every ounce by simple virtue of the fact that he owns the mineral rights whats more until such mining takes place the landowner can sell the surface rights to farmer who will farm subject to allowing prospecting to take place on that farm if decision is taken to mine the area the farmer in exchange for certain compensation has to allow the mining company access and he has to allow the mining company to put up whatever structures are necessary the mineral rights in most african countries were nationalised following the independence of those countries it is not known what compensation was paid to the holders of those rights either by the governments in question or by the british government the possibility exists that deals were made whereby african presidents formed partnerships with the original owners of the mineral rights the history of corruption and skewed wealth in africa strongly suggests such an arrangement and it is the hope of the blue file investigators that the glazer case will expose few of these arrangements the infrastructure required to support mining operation is vast it includes roads railway lines electrical and telecommunications supplies offices housing for the workers shops and so on in many cases this infrastructure extends to whole towns being built its great business for landlords to be in fact well noted by bernard and sam glazer who as mentioned acquired number of cecil john rhodess companies with landholdings that stretched from botswana through zimbabwe the former rhodesia to zambia the former northern rhodesia for example report in the bulawayo chronicle of 7 may 1955 on the acquisition by glazer brothers pty ltd of 90 of bechuanaland exploration company former rhodes company put the latter companys holdings at more than 500 000 acres of land in southern rhodesia northern rhodesia and bechuanaland together with many prominent buildings and businesses in bulawayo salisbury fort victoria broken hill and the aberfoyle estates near gwelo the report continued thus with these properties together with their tobacco ranches and their investments in more than 40 leading south african and overseas companies the bes assets are estimated at more than 1000000 schedule of principal investments included shares in companies such as african and european investments company central mining and investments corporation limited charterland and general durban roodepoort deep limited free state geduld mines limited president steyn gold mining company rand selection corporation south african mines selection limited west rand investment trust western reefs exploration and development co rhodesian anglo american and pretoria portland cement to name but few african and european investment co ltd played major role in developing the orange free state goldfields during the 1950s the 6 cumulative preference shares held by be can be traced to 1990 when african and european investment co is deregistered from the records in companies house london due to the fact that the company ceased to have an office in the united kingdom as can be seen they held substantial portfolio even then and more importantly they held the mineral rights to all that land study of the financial records of the be company reveal that within few months of having gained control of the company the glazers moved the registered office to zimbabwe and true to form in other companies acquired by them they raised mortgages on all the properties within the company to total value of nearly 500 000 with this gearing they launched new developments acquired more companies and financed the establishment of many others the value of his estate at the time of his passing was given as being in the region of r30 million having acquired companies worth some 5 million in the 1950s this would not represent good growth over 30 years the blue file wished to uncover whether this was the true state of affairs or whether certain assets were hidden from his beneficiaries his wife and children who would have known little or nothing about the true nature and extent of his business at the time of his passing 3 making an invisible asset disappear bernard glazer did much to open up botswana zimbabwe and zambia and to provide the kind of infrastructure mentioned earlier his involvement in the development of francistown in botswana is perhaps the best example extensive details of his activities are available in the blue file and will be discussed below however its important at this stage to understand the implications of the invisible asset of mineral rights and how they provide the spine for the claims made by the blue file the rudd concession mentioned above was the crucial deal that enabled rhodes to gain charter from the british parliament the charter was britains colonial arrangement whereby company that showed itself to be worthy was given the right to govern territory on its behalf it could collect taxes run an army and generally turn the landscape into private commercial enterprise in this way the british government could tax the profits of the colonies without having to incur the expenses of maintaining them but more importantly this arrangement gave the english commercial control to the exclusion of all others over the worlds richest mineral and metal deposits this changed in the latter half of the twentieth century when public pressure forced the political face of the colonised countries to change however it remains to be seen whether confidential agreements ensured that the mineral rights which in most cases were nationalised remained under the covert control of british companies the information in the blue file invites the conclusion that bernard glazer was force for stability and longterm growth in africa through the gradual opening up of mining areas and the reinvestment of profits locally however it would appear that his interests ran contrary to those of certain people around him in the third quarter of 1984 the south african rand until then strong and stable currency lost nearly 13 of its value against the british pound and 19 of its value against the us dollar this was by far the largest fall in the rands value since 1972 prior to 1972 exchange rates were fixed against the dollar in the 50 quarteryear periods from the first quarter 1972 up to and including the secondquarter 1984 the rand had only lost value quarteronquarter against the british pound 24 times this reflects stable currency with the number of times it increased in value being almost the same as the number of times it decreased in value 26 vs 24 it should be noted too that this was during the years of economic sanctions against the apartheid regime although as will be shown many european and american banks still made millions of dollars worth of loans to the south african government during this time from thirdquarter 1984 up to and including fourthquarter 2002 the rand increased in value against the british pound quarteronquarter only 16 times in other words its trend was dramatically downwards decreasing quarteronquarter 58 times or in 78 of the periods in question graphs in the blue file illustrate this dramatic shift in the rands value it should be remembered that bernard glazer died on 17 july 1984 and it is the contention of the blue file that for the following decade and more his assets were systematically restructured and moved offshore in particular it is alleged that if any sums were paid to him or following his passing to his estate in the form of mining royalties then they were similarly redirected and possibly used to finance or collateralise new structures including possibly an international investment bank and other international mining and property companies at the same time it is alleged that structures created by him were used by other groups to move vast sums of their own money offshore in advance of change of government that they knew would happen in accordance with predetermined plan the blue file has evidence of these structures as well as evidence to support this notion of predetermined plan the foreign exchange figures indicate that this process started immediately following bernard glazers death and some actions of his employees which are revealed in the blue file are indicative of this urgency bernard glazer samuel lieb glazer
