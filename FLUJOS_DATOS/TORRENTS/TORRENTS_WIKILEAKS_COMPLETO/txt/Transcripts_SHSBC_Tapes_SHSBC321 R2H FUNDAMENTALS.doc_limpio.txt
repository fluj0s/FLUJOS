r2h fundamentals lecture given on 7 august 1963 whats the date audience august 7th august the 7th ad 13 saint hill special briefing course im going to give you talk today which isnt the official final rundown of r2h but which lays down the fundamentals of the process itself all right r2h is one of the most satisfying processes that you ever cared to run it is arc breaks taken apart by assessment it has tendency to succumb to inexpert handling and as long as you give good thought to the fundamentals of the process you wont run cropper but here is one of the more interesting processes contained in the this process is different than any process weve ever had in dianetics and scientology dont think that you understand this process because its quite different this process will run engrams and secondaries it has tremendous power and therefore it very well may be senior to r3r in spite of the fact that its an r2 it very well may be senior it may run more bank than these and the only thing it wont run is gpm and to run gpm you have r3m and r3n oh youd forgotten r3m huh you wait till one day you run into wildcat gpm man and youll thank your stars for r3m if you know how to do it because thats how you got the patterns in the first place was r3m thats how you got 3n thats the papa process out of r3m can be borne patterns 3n presupposes that youve got the pattern you sit there and let the pc pattycake around and yap around and bark around and give you random items and you dont see them rocket read and you dont know which end youre goingstanding on and you let him hunt and punch and keep sitting there at the emeter i think the fashion is to sit there at the emeter as the auditor and just keep shaking your head it didnt rocket read it didnt rocket read until the pc blows his brain out of course he doesnt need brain thatsthats good thing but r3m will do wildcat gpmby which we mean gpm for which you have pattern and they exist all over the track and youll eventually run into one inevitably dont think you can just go on running the pattern gpms because thatd mean your pc was never caught in bind that was an oddball bind see and he never got out to arcturus and fell in that particular area that nobody else fell into see i meanbe very fortunate if he was normal and had only the normal implants but that is never true hes always got an oddball one so youve got r3m and that takes care of your offbeat implants and the only change that i would make in it todayi wouldnt ask the cross question on oppose the way its asked i wouldnt ask who or what would oppose to get your next pair i would say what does the next pair consist of give the oppterm of the third pair thats the one i would use i would use something like that and then who or what would oppose it yeah and id use that as phraseology now 3n thats leadpipe cinch but 3n has this liability on some pcs if you dont random listi dont care if they had the item or not and if it rocket read or notyou dont get tone arm action and if your tone arm action ceases just up and random list just as easy as that that gets all of your locks off the ri with all of its locksnothing has changed that dont you see even though youve got the item absolutably cantankerous why make him random list who or what would oppose it and he gives you all kinds of things and that blows the lock and your ta action may restore but the bigthe big thing that keeps 3n ta action down of course is having the wrong date and the wrong pattern theres nothing like having the wrong date for the gpm and the wrong pattern from the gpm to freeze the tone arm thats almost certain now if you add to that session wrong or out itsa linereturn line from the pc to the auditoryou of course have got it made the ta simply goes up to the moon and sticks and wont go anyplace else you understand that dont you youd be surprised how often you find wrong date and youre running the helatrobus implantsso you thinkand you go right into the next goal for which youve listed and then you try to get absolutably and you cant get rocket read and you say whats happened tas up and stuck ive got this next goal to be goof its obviously the next goal in line only it isnt here shucks man youre probably running bear implant its probably shot back on the track lord knows where because the one thing gpm wont do is properly time you can duration gpm and you can time gpm and you can get the date of gpm almost endlessly why because its primary basis is lousing up time those two opposing items fire against each othersound like time to the pcproduces change situation so the gpm floats on the track and so its very difficult to time gpm so its just nothing to get the quote next gpm in line to run and find out that it isnt at fortythree trillion but at fifteen trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion embarrassing eventually you go back and start looking for wrong dates on the case and you finally locate that to be goof is not the next helatrobus gpm but gpm which exists in the early limbos of nowhere now whats very interesting is an exactlythesamelooking hill with exactlythesamelooking parking meters with exactly the same railroad track existed about trillionsfour ago which laid in an entirely different pattern which was far more aberrative than the helatrobus implants and which is basic on the helatrobus implants and i told you one day the helatrobus implants are on the screens they show you in the betweenlives that isnt ive been making that mistake for about ten thousand years every time i put this thing up on the screen why its the wrong implant theyre an early implant and they had hill there unfortunately located in the same geographical area as the helatrobus implants and it looks to the pc just like the helatrobus implants only it isnt youve got date error then consisting of trillionsfouralmost trillionsfour you see trillion trillion trillion trillion your date error of course your ta action will cease so theres lot of tricks in running gpms gpms are what require special techniques they require special techniques now nothing else that i know of requires special technique and you might even do away with r3r this is very adventurous statement if you had perfect r2h r2h has the potentiality of running engrams and secondaries on the whole track with greater avidity and speed than r3r because it takes apart the restimulated and bypassed charges which exist in the secondaries and engrams it doesnt run the engram so much as it takes out of it all the bypassed charges and causes of course that particular segment to snap back onto track you probably have not looked at it this way but youre actually not trying to erase somebodys time track in the betweenlives area they apparently are trying to wipe out your time track so you dont know who you are well were actually not doing that youre not in actual fact working with the time track to knock out all the pictures everybody has that is really not what youre doing youre trying to take out of the time track the things which prevent person from having his pictures and after that you can restore to him the right to have pictures or not to have pictures as the case may be youre trying to pull his knowingness high enough up to point where the individual does not have to have pictures to tell him who he is now you got that you reallyyour first target is not to erase somebodys time track youre liable to think that because that is what betweenlives screen specializes in it allegedly is trying to invalidate persons time track to point where he doesnt have any and therefore cant remember who he is because he has picture reference i spoke to you this way about it yesterday well youre really not then trying to erase the whole time track but there are certain unwanted pictures that he couldnt handle and which he became the effect of if you take the charge off of those pictures then pictures become available to the person and he can have them or not have them as the case may be now the pictures which mostly louse up things are the gpms thats the real messup but because betweenlives implant has target of invalidating all of your pictures and therefore wiping out your identity and memory because of this you might thinkand im sure many people who are upset about auditing might thinkthat youre trying to do this you realize scientologist may be looked at with askance by certain areas and interests and so forth as though they were betweenlives implanters because they get some whiff of the idea that youre going to erase the whole time track and they might think were betweenlives implanters i dont know what would happen if we i was toying with this this morninglet give you little bit of laugh out of the side of thisi was thinking of outerspace tactics and strategy this is an interesting and vast subject and i have come to the conclusion that the missing factor in it is communication and that lack of communication is what causes all the trouble all right thats beside the pointthat makes then very intricate and complicated tactics and strategy you see i wondered if impishly you couldnt rise above this factor with few curves of one kind or another by entering societies from within where you did have communication you see well how would you go about it then i was sitting there idly speculating about it over my scrambled eggs and i suddenly realizedstill eating i mean im decadenti suddenly realized that these betweenlives blokesthe marcabianswouldnt know what to do if they came down here and saw that they had marcab headquarters here we set up their headquarters for them and you put up their flag you see and so forth and look at the news story i must have brought this news story on us or had telepathically realized that somebody was going to call on us the mirror group was calling on us today so many advances have happened in dianetics and scientology in the last three or four years that they had better be covered we agree with them perfectly but how they will cover them god knows thats one of the biggest newspaper chains in england but they also are the author of the death lesson stories and so we regard them with some suspicion but there is this pressure all the time of we are you seewere putting out fantastic the stories involved here would make whats turned out in university labs and the psychiatric blokes and this sort of thing would stagger them man you see i mean theres more story in any given week in dianetics and scientology you see than these birds and the pressurethe pressure of this much data inevitably will produce some sort of reaction on the surroundings you see and youd find these guys sooner or later are going to realize they missed the boat instead of writing about that cult they might write about those people and youll see them swinging around to this sooner or later but look at the marcabian press here in this prison in spite of all that has been done to them theyre still loyal to their mother country god you know thats touching you know thats tearjerker and i sort of sat back and i said well ronnie youre dangerous man but the reaction of earth population all of which has come down through that channel to these symbols might be something approaching the most fabulous thing you ever saw it might be utter frothing see might produce widespread riot and chaos i dont know but it was an interesting thought anyway as i think you will agree not that were going to do anything desperate like thatat least this afternoon the point im making herethe point im making hereis that if you tell the pc that youre going to erase his whole time track why hes liable to go into sort of an anaten propitiate because this happens to him every sixty or seventy years to such degree you see that he doesnt quite know whether hes coming or going but you tell him youre going to give him back his pictures and you might entirely change your identity as far as hes concerned as an auditor see hes got certain pictures that make it impossible for him to get back his pictures thats the condition hes in and youre in actual fact trying to return him to case level 2 and oddly enough you have to move him to case level 2 before you can move him to case level 1 thats whats very interesting about it and your pcin spite of all your erasure of pictures is going to wind up with pictures man hes going to have pictures he takes them all the time they just arent available some of these pictures arent too pleasant some of them arent too unpleasant but the point is there is dearth of pictures whats the matter with him is that he obsessively makes pictures of everything without discrimination hes something like garbage collector see any old picture is good enough you see but he gets some of these pictures like gpms and jails and things like this from betweenlives implants and they then hit him every time he tries to see his own pictures you see and he sees these and of course theyre his pictures too but he never realizes this theyre so hostile to his future and his mental health that he disowns them ive just gone through phase of disowning my whole trackout of disgust you know had beautiful case resurgence for aboutoh i dont know must have lasted for an hour or two then of course it collapsed but what i did was go through the consideration of track and track became artificially you seethe artificiality of it became less and less real until the track itself disappeared and now the track is appearing with total reality you see and good knowingness its an interesting through theknothole experience you know i wasnt i dont know who the hell i am i you at least got up to the point of where you didnt need picture to tell you who you areyou got brave enough to say well i just dont know and from that point on you start getting your own track back thats an interesting point that this occurs and perhaps perhaps you havent given enough attention to this as nobodys trying to wipe out your picturestheyre just trying to pick out those pictures which bar all other pictures and which the individual considers hostile and when youve done that why the individual gets back all of his pictures its very simple the hostile ones can longer bite now youve got case level 2 now you go after the mechanism which makes it automatic for him to make pictures and you put this back on power of choice and of course youve got an ot and thats the whole scope of processing where it has to do with pictures and bank and knowingness and so forththeyre all wrapped up in that well now you see instead of erasing pictures you could go at this another way you could bring up the individuals confront with regard to pictures to such an extent that he could even face the hostile ones ah thats an interesting approach too isnt it now this is comparable to the old exteriorization approach instead of erasing the guys bank pull him out of it thats the old exteriorization approach well this is similar approach but its different than either of those approaches you see of erasing the pictures or pulling the guy out of the pictures were pushing the guy up so that he can disentangle and confront his pictures in other words were getting him so he can understand his pictures and this one works too which actually gives you third route to processing so r2h is not just method of erasing pictures or getting the pc away from his pictures it actually raises the individuals potential in recognizing and owning his pictures and making the pictures better now wellrun r2h can make the pictures much better much prettier much solider without them being obsessively solid so that they intimidate the pc with their tremendous solidity now thats the important point of it so with r2h you actually are embarked on another philosophy if you understand this grip on it it is its own philosophy doesnt make the other philosophies invalid but it embarks on its own private personal railroad car and says this is whole philosophy in itself of course it uses the elements and mechanics and other things but the individualism of r2h is based on this there have been some new discoveries about this and theyve been put to work in r2h and let show you what these things look like editors note starting at this point in the lecture ron made diagrams of some of these points these were issued in hcob 14 aug 63 lecture graphs which can be found in technical bulletins volume vii here is thetan now your first level of life and beingnessyour first look at life and beingnesswhat life and beingness are exist as potentials or abilities not as thingsand those potentials and abilities consist of r and c you know all about r and c affinity reality and communication but think of those things as potentialsnot affinity for anything special but the potential of having affinity in other words you could say what is the potential of the r and c of an individual what is his potential youd be asking the same thing as how alive is he the more alive he is the more arc hes capable ofthe less alive he is the less arc hes capable of thats interesting isnt it what do you think of philosophy that thinks that man is mud well lets take look at this arc arcand probably this could be drawn in different waysarc goes out toand remember that communication with other beings is through matter energy space time and so forth see this arc potential or arc with what what is this arc with communication with reality about affinity for see what are these things connected up with well if there were just other beings itd be telepathic ball and that would be that but when you talk to joe youre actually talking through mest to joeno matter how youre communicating with joeunless your arc is so much on the ball that you can telepathically communicate and by the way your arc doesnt have to be very high to telepathically communicate that is quite interesting that man is at large below this level of telepathy but it is paid attention to in some civilizations to the degree thatoh they set upyouve got threeway communication you got conference with other departments or ship commanders or somethingit wouldnt matter whether its business or unit of some kind or another and you set up box you set up box and the thetan briefing them briefs them through box which telepathically retranslates his thought onto an endless banner and puts it out with sound also in other words telepathy sufficiently strong that it can be mechanically reconverted device more difficult than the vocotyper that the ibm keeps trying to make you talk to the typewriter and it types you know well this is telepathic vocotyper im not talking to you out of popular mechanics in other words the telepathy factor is strong it is something you have to deal with they have antinoise campaigns in new york city well i imagine in boardinghouse bunch of thetans would have an antitelepathic campaign you know can you stop shouting telepathically all night you know telepathy is very heavy hardhitting force some of you will be going through an implant or something like that and youll pick up off the track what you think is your postulate and then suddenly realize it isnt your postulate that somebody thought it in your vicinity you sometimes can pick up the thoughts or fear of some thetan down the line who is also being implanted this stuff will sometimes kick back into an implant its quite valid theres nothing to worry about with that now this isnt any lecture about telepathyit gives you an idea of how low arc can go without disappearing and how high it can also go because the birds im talking about that use telepathy for communication arent even by your chart estimates in very good shape see theyve had the helatrobus implants too but they just arent getting their lives wiped out every sixty or seventy years see that factor is missingthe only factor of difference between your case and theirs see thats the sole difference every once in while why their empire gets wiped out and somebody implants the lot but thats life so heres your arc and your arc can go up then to pretty high levels and it depends below certain level on matter energy space and time as its communication media arc gets very important after you start dropping away from telepathic communication becomes very importantbecause you see its so much present before then that nobody ever thinks of it nobody ever thinks of it at all youre just not mad at people and reality is terrific and you know all about itand communication is good and your understanding and knowingness are pretty well up so it wouldnt be something that you worried about at all but the second you start introducing mest into communication lines living with great dependence upon this universe in this universethen arc become very important and become the measure of life of course theyre there all the way up but you dont measure them as going out in fact i believe nobody would believe they could livingness degree of livingness is measured by arc how alive is somebody its how much arc is he capable of that is the test now when you get over here lets just rule out telepathy im saying it exists but it isnt necessary to our proposition at all and its highly individual and odd bit of business see that transcends matter energy space and time and goes straight to other beings so we would have thetans as thing to be in arc with and then we would have matter energy space time form location now you could add to this you could break these down further but they are the principal things beyond which there is breakdown possibly in importance it ought to be l and then f now the arc that this individual has expresses the degree that he can be cause over these the potential of arc of the individual gives you the degree that he can be at cause over thetans matter energy space time form and location the less life he has the less he is now as thetan gets more and more solid he is less and less capable of arc thats fairly obvious isnt it why it isnt that his solidity prevents him from communicating or feeling affinity or that sort of thing but its simply an indicator that he must have broken arc with matter energy space time form and location or it wouldnt be piled on him without his choice thats an interesting point isnt it he must have had arc breaks then with matter energy space time form and location ah but how could he have arc breaks with matter energy space time form and location without having arc breaks with other thetans well i think its probable and very possible that he could have but the truth of the matter is it was having arc breaks with other thetans that caused him to start to arc break with matter energy space time form and location doesnt necessarily follow that way but normally that would be it so as an individual rises up the lineas he rises up the linehe then rises back toward direct communication direct affinity direct reality on other beings the less arc he has the more matter energy space time form and location he has to go through in order to communicate to other beings see you look little bit dense on that one let give you an idiots line here you have bill and here you have space and here you have joe now joe in order to hear bill has to register an air wave which is generated by bill so bill generates an air wavevibrationsthat are received by joe and are reinterpreted into arc so arc here are converted and then are converted from matter energy space time to arc and you in actual fact have done this cycle this thetan here communicates to those thetans there by going up here here see and actually they communicate back similarly see get the idea once you drop away from telepathy you enter mest into the line and arc then becomes subordinate to mest and you eventually get bunch of knuckleheads implanted up to their ears did you ever realize einstein went through the betweenlives area when he kicked the bucket served him right i wonder if he traveled faster than constant these brutal gruesome thoughts i have every once in while now look at thisman is not mud but fellow who isnt alive at all would think only mudly hed have very muddy thinking hed come to mudlike conclusions therefore his mental sciences are very mudlike there are mental studies which admittoday that are currently being taughtthat admit of the existence of being they only admit of the existence of biological combinations of mud resulting in very muddy result psychology textbooks today begin by very carefully defining the fact they do not know what psyche is and they do not even know if one existsand theyre pretty sure it doesntbut we will now give you the parts of the brain see what are you dealing with there youre dealing with somebody who is so far away from other beings that he is longer talking through mest hes talking to mest ding ding ding here comes the wagon every once in while you see some poor little kid thats been knocked in the dome too much and hell be out there beating his red wagon and you yourself in your dippier moments will start talking to something on the mantelpiece and when youre particularly foggy in the morning and havent been awakened youre very often prone to curse your shoes well you may be doing it on another harmonic because thetan is always capable of investing things with life and youre probably doing it because youve alived the shoe you see youre perfectly capable of mocking up living being and making it talk and walk totally independent of you perfectly perfectly capable of doing that used to do it as ots all the time so youre capable of investing matter energy space and time and so forth with life and then otherdetermining it saying it is longer i and having it walk around and talk now thosethats potential thats talked about in dianetics evolution of science that speaks of throgmagog you can always invest something with life such as shoe and you can always pretend that shoe is alive but how would you like to be in the kind of condition where you thought another living being was more capable of life than shoe lets reverse that see lets get total reverse on the situation lets look at living being and say that this living being has life in it now you got some kind of an estimate of how far down scale you can go and somebody can still sit there and eat breakfast got the idea its pretty far south matter energy space time form and locationarc breaks with cause the dwindling spiral of arc breaks with other beings matter energy space time form and location bring about deterioration of ones arc it never really deteriorates one just believes it is deteriorated you see in other words you can have an arc break with mest you can have an arc break with form you can have an arc break with locations its very common for an animal to have arc break with locations place where an animal has been hurt will be avoided by that animal very carefully now what in essence does this forecast that is the basic theory behind r2h it forecasts that by clearing up persons arc breaks one then returns to him his arc potential clean up his arc breaks with matter he feels better about matter clean up his arc breaks with energy hell feel better about energy clean up his arc breaks with space he feels better about space clean up his arc breaks with time and he will feel better about time clean up his arc breaks with form and he will feel better about form clean up his arc breaks with location he feels better about location clean up his arc breaks with other beings and he feels better about other beings and all the way up the line of course his bank that reservoir of arc breaksis getting plainer and plainer to him and more and more confrontable to him because hisall of his arc breaks in terms of pictures have responded as the reactive mind arc breaks because the reactive mind is made after all out of images of other beings matter energy space time form and location its as easy as that and that consists of the reactive mind so by cleaning up his arc breaks with these things you tend to clean up his arc breaks with the things hes got pictures of in the reactive mind that he cant confront and his reactive mind opens up and he can tolerate it and confront it so r2h considers and conceives that the reactive mind is reservoir of arc breaks that is the basic assumption on which that process hops off we know that the reactive mind contains images or beliefs in other beings and withcertainly their images in terms of thought dont you see we might by the way have put t under other beings for thought you see because thought or significance could be included in thatbut by just putting up other beings you also have the reflections of other beings and so that you could omit that but you know that the reactive mind consists of images of other beings thoughts of other beings thoughts of oneself and so forth plus matterif you dont believe its composed of matter someday run into ridge energyyou hear and see the energy flitterflattering around in the reactive mind all the time and thats what registers on the tone arm space every once in while guy cant see thing and then he suddenly realizes hes looking across too much space to see it in picture it always has space and lack of space is the main thing thats upsetting in the reactive bankyou cant get away from the lousy thing see you cant put space between it and you space is the cure for confront see and timegood heavens the thing is not time if theres any time in the bank that is remarkable what you have in the bank is an absence of timean apparent absence in time in the presence of totality of time youve got nothing where something is and something where nothing is and thats what makes it reactive reactiveremember thats what the thing is called that means instantaneous response regardless of what time the response is laid in aaa also equals twentynine years ago equals billion years ago equals eight trillion years ago before you start inspecting it theyre all the same time so you got this terrific time identificationyou also have space energy and matter identifications now as far as form is concerned thats not terribly upgraded thing it comes into the field of aesthetics and arts more than anything else some people like picasso some people dont some people like blondes some people like brunettes formaesthetics tastes that sort of thing and the reactive bankthe things least confronted in the reactive bank are those forms which one has disliked most and so of course hes got wonderful closeup stockpile of forms he detests were not talking now about income tax formswere talking about pleasanter things like girls and things anyhow as far as location is concerned if theres anything that is in the reactive mind its location when i first collided with this early helatrobus i was absolutely sure that it was in exactly the same locationthat here trillions of trillions of trillions of years before some knucklehead had begun this thing and then somebody had walked back in the vicinity and said well this is what you do when you are here and proceeded to give the helatrobus implants i was sure that was the case in fact i only know now intellectually that it is not the same place because its the same type of scenery given little similarity of form and boy those locations were identical but what you doing right now packing around in your bank and your head and your ridges planets which are lightyears away looks to like thats very interesting identification of location in an auditing session this comes off all the time it happens so often that you dont even think about it this guy is sitting there let us say hes running something and its something that happened in australia doesnt seem either peculiar to the auditor or the pc that it is being run out in england theres 12500mile error in location and you very often see this kind of an odd thing happen you get the thing all run and it goes spang and stays there it goes to its proper location it seems to disappear or something of course by moving in time you can make the thing disappear too but ive had this odd experience of not being able to run certain engrams because they were too well fixed in their proper location you practically have to go to arizona to run itthats where it happened you can spot the facsimile but its over in arizona well it couldnt be very aberrative if it fixes its location that smartly see because thats the right location well now if everything was on its proper time span youd have to move all over time in order to connect with anything wouldnt you so the thing must be in its improper time span if you can reach it in present time without yourself moving back trillions of years in time well theres something wrong in the reactive mind with other beingness and other thoughts with matter with energy with space with time with form and locationand everything that is the matter is theyre identified one with another two times are identified two forms are identified two locations are identified two spaces are identified two energies identified two masses identified can also go the other way into what you call disassociate and you as scientologists run less into this thing of disassociation someday you may read some sigmund freud and youll hear all about disassociation because he specialized in this thin disassociation its not anything weve ever talked about to amount to anything but two things which are the same thing approximately look entirely different in other words two pictures of the same person at two different locations look like two different people see that is an inverse of identification things that should be seen to be similar are seen to be madly different you dont pay much attention to this because after persons done that hes more or less flipped his lid but youre now going to run into disassociationand thats why im making little side comment on it here as we gobecause youre going to run into it if you really put in the itsa line and youre going to wonder whats happening because the pc doesnt at first answer the auditing question you say have you had any gains in this session and he says thewell so on the floor dropped out and then i had couple of drinks and three or four years ago why i knew girl named mabel and now in putting in your itsa line by the rules of the game you shouldnt interrupt him he may sit there but hes not finished with that communication and hell keep on going and going and going and youll see all these disassociates come up and then all of sudden if you let him go on he will eventually come up and tell you gain he has made for the session but youre running such violent stuff you see on the whole track that as he passes through the stuff hes actually going through the session trying to answer your questionand these things are getting in his roadso he says them to you they tend to asis and after that he can finally reach the material necessary to answer your question got the idea but now if youve put in an itsa line all the way across the line youre going to see disassociation so you better know what it is its simply that two things which should be seen to be similar are seen to be madly different its the inverse of identification its you ought to see similarity between the question and the answer have you had gain for the session yes ive had gain for the session i can see better you get that now thats similarity you see theres the same communication line and the answer compares to the question that was asked you get disassociation this way have you had gain in the session i had beer three years ago thats disassociate well it isnt that the pc isnt answering your question hes getting around to it and if youre very good at your itsa line he will eventually wander torturously through and eventually will come up and say yes i dont feel like ill be so thirsty all the time of course that is almost sequitur statement he will have uttered other statements less sequitur but as you search the thing out you would see that he was coming closer and closer to answering your question as he talked try that sometime on full itsa line and you will be very very very pleased with the result the guy was answering your auditing question if you let him go on talking he eventually would have answered your auditing question he only didnt answer your auditing question if you cut him off at the point he was disassociating then he didnt seem to answer your auditing question youll notice his eye is longer on you again youll notice hes still groping youll notice hes still fumbling with the bank when heas he tells you these things youll see this well thats disassociate all right guy comes up and slugs his mother thinking that she is about to rob him well hes associated his mother with burglar well youd say hes nuts well yeah true enough but there are people who are nuts but that is what that is so identification isnt the only crime theres one beyond identification thats two things that you ought to recognize the similarity between you see as vastly different so this whole thing here goes on to an inversion what you get is restimulator factor we knew girl who had pink hair see we knew girl who had pink hair so therefore girls who have pink hair arent to be trustedtherefore nothing pink must be trusted and we know fellow named pink who brushes his teeth so wed better not brush our teeth anymore do you follow that torturous line of logic well that is arc as it goes down scale doesnt just stay as arc it goes into an inverse because it gets too many things identified and then it gets things disassociated in some kind of an effort to see some separateness in existence and eventually starts going into twisteroo so that you will have people who consider good communication shooting people high level of communication i had husky one time that knew what communication waschewing people up and being bitten there he was he was quite dog it was very funny ill never forget that dog he was the toughest dog i think i ever saw id walk into the yard after being gone for long timeyou know year or two or something like thatand this dog would suddenly see this stranger and he would bare his teethhe was one of these fantastic malamutesand hed bare his teeth come tearing across the yard fangs just shooting out of his face in all directions and id pick him up on either side of his jowl and using his lunge throw him twentyfive feet you practice up little bit with police dogs and things you can get so you do its like dog judo you know and hed go through the air and hed land and hed get up oh ron he knew what communication was so theres all kinds of wild levels of communication you get people who tell you what pleasure isthey describe agony its very funny so you get these various inversions arc then doesnt just decline it goes and inverts and inverts again and inverts again and you get hodgepodge down at the end that nobody can make anything out of go down and listen to them in the spinbins and youll see how far arc can go because those people are still alive theyre still alive how far can arc go south all the waythere is bottom at which one dies but theres some mighty peculiar things happen on the way down beingnesses can die but the individualno forms can die but the person actuallyno memory can die but not the person who is capable of remembering you see not the person whowho is you see he can forget everything and hes still in that kind of state now arc never ceases so you have bottom to the process there are bottom limits to the process there is some method of communicating all the way down it gets down into weird versions of reach and withdraw as i just described one to youwith the dog thats kind of reach and withdraw want to make him happy all day sunday why chew him up all saturday night you know big case gain this is your tone scale as people go up scale they go up through anger and so forth its very funny i remember one poor psycho in new yorkauditors would process her get her up to anger and shed scold her family and theyd promptly put her in restraints and put her back in the hospital and then shed get out and then the auditors would process her and shed get back up to point where shed scold her family and they put her back and this nonsense just kept going see theyd never let her get up through anger of course theyd been knocking her in for long time and she just never was able to say that she was mad about it she was never able to do that so she never recovered now heres case then of process which if you can get any c in at all and get an improvement of the c or an improvement of the r or an improvement of the you get an improvement of the c an improvement of the r an improvement of the an improvement of the c an improvement of the r an improvement of the ayou get the idea and you just keep raising this triangleall three corners of this triangleup up up by the process of running arc breaks now the basic limit of the process is the communication of the auditing command itself and youll be surprised how many interpretations there are of an arc break and one might make criticism of the process by saying well look it has such specialized command recall an arc break only scientologist would know what that meant well actually youre really not asking for an upset youre not asking for worry youre not asking for time he was concerned youre not asking for this youre not asking for that youre asking for an arc break now i dont think itd take you any time to describe to the pc what an arc break was and hed eventually settle in his own head what an arc break was hed be better off if he could understand the communication of this phrase arc break but this is one of the weak spots of the process but its not very weak spot its very funny how fast this communicates you say life is composed of affinity reality and communication when one of these breaks down person doesnt feel so good about something now an arc break is time when affinity reality or communication have been cut down on person have been reduced thats what an arc break is it may take the individual three or four days to digest the definition but the funny part of it is having digested the definition he will have made case gain i dont really consider it liability now that process isnt going to be used very broadly and shotgunish you cant use it in coauditits too particularized so theres the anatomy however of what you are trying to do with the process you are trying to increase the individuals affinity and reality and communication with other thetans and thought matter energy space time form and location by picking up those points in time when the individual has suffered cut or reduction of communication has suffered from lowering of reality or from reduction of affinity levelperiod you dont knowcare what he had an arc break with because he has to come up quite ways to recognize arc breaks with mest this is long way north good cleancut arc breaks with mest in that earlier gpm about the only thing that was causing great deal of difficulty in running it was supreme arc break with mest that it would obey people who would do things like this gpm implantbig arc break with the fact that mest obeyed that sort of thingand an arc break with the people for debasing and degrading mest to such usage and end the items to hell with it see that wasnt the important thing the important thing was that anybody who would attempt something like this using mest that mest would obey them so on big arc break so theres one even wrapped up in gpm the thought that youre trying to get across with your auditing command is you want time when affinity reality and communication have been reduced with other beings matter energy space time form and locations and you dont direct what youre going to get the arc break about or with thatll all work out more or less automatically you simply ask for an arc break you dont ask in this lifetime you dont limit him in timeyou hope hell give you something to at least let you get your teeth into the process and get the process grooved in before youre handling godelpus engram but you want from the pc time of that reduction that is what you want and thats all you want and then you want to find out from the pc what it was this goes into your form which is still being worked outbut which is more or less grooved in now the formal steps of r2h done for good gain on the case are what where when and then an assessment and then cleaning up every line of the assessment when it readsnot going by it that is difference and working the arc break over until it longer reads on the meter and the pc feels all right about it and so forth now the exact way the assessment is done ill go over that again id better go little bit earlier the exact way what is done is you take what the pc is willing to tell you without probing whats this arc break about and hell give you résumé of it very brief usually where where thats to help him get the time see these are all development of the arc break so that he can more ably identify it and then when now this when gets very important hell have trouble with the where but nothing compared to the trouble he may get into with the when now the rule isyou use your meter on these three steps only when the last dog has been hanged and you dont date nothing with the meter unless the pc is in despair and on the verge of tears about the actual time and then you chip in at the last moment and you sayso on something like this this meter dating is terribly easy you know theres training version thats to train you to date on meter im giving you the therapeutic versionthis is the way she really rolls youve been sitting there with the meter in front of you and the pcs been saying its 1937 its 1936no 1937 1936 1937 nineteenthirty 37 i think it was 38 38 maybe it was 38 39 it could have been nineteen thir sigh oh i just dont know i just dont know i just dont know where i dont know when it was 1937 19 hes already admitted he doesnt know and your ta action has slowed down to nothing and so forth and youve watched 1937 bang every time he said it you say its 1937 according to the meter thats your dating step got that pc may also get into specialized case sometimes when if it was in 1937 it would be terrible arc breakwhereas if it was in 1938 it wouldnt have been terrible arc break because something else had happened so they keep saying its 1938 when it was 1937 heres the only other way you go about this when your tone arm is hung up youve got wrong dateand you damn well better find it tone arm is hung up you cant get it moving everything is going to the devil and so forthwell you just better do scout for wrong dates did we have wrong date there is number two that you scout for when the tone arm has stuck this is repairing it number two is you get in your bmrs on the session or the process because the pc has recalled arc breaks which he has then suppressed and has not given the auditor that causes tone arm hangup these are the three things that hang up tone arm and the pc arc breaks in session because of an arc break in the past it isnt because youve bypassed charge in the sessionhes recalled an arc break in the past which has given him an arc break in the session and when you find thatany one of those three wrong date suppressed arc breaks or an arc break in the session because of an arc break in the pastyouve got to remedy the situation your tone arm will stick and the process becomes unworkable but one of those three things exists if your tone arm ceases to move on this the other one that can stop your tone arm from moving is just too corny youve missed an assessment youve missed meter read and you havent got the reason of the bypassed charge thats just pretty corny thats under the heading of meter reading and so forth the arc break is always cleaned up to the tremendous satisfaction of the pc and youre looking on this as something whereby you do an assessment you say well that was the bypassed charge thats it thank you recall another arc break that isnt the way its done now lets go into the last end of this thing you say to the pc youre doing an assessmentyou clear it line by line just like you used to do old rudiments if you get read you say that read youve got your pat assessment sheet that read you got new onetherell probably even be differentnewer ones developed from time to time i havent issued this latest sheet yet but its very comparable to the l1 which youve got its just little better you see that an attitude refused does so that ticks you didnt go down the whole thing see you just saidright off the bat you said all right in that arc break was an attitude refused tick you say all right what attitude was refused and thats the end of your job its now up to the itsa thats your whatsa and the pc is going to stem and fuss and stew and try to figure out what attitude was refused where and the only time it wont come off is when those three things i gave you are out youve had wrong date in the session the pc has recalled some arc breaks and suppressed them or the pc has had an arc break in the present time in the session see and this system doesnt work if those three are present and if this system doesnt work those three are present so you clean this line up and its all up to the pc an attitude refused i dont think any attitude was refusedattitude was refused and so forth and so on says well i dont1 dont think there was one what do you know at this point do you shove it down his throat you say all right thank you and go to the next line well he cant remember it so obviously the thing needs shaking up some more but you leave that mark alongside of that thing because youre going to come back to it it was hot onceits going to be hot again in other words itsthat just wasnt ready to be answered thats the only thing you communicate on that if he cant find it and he says he cant thats it leave it marked dont even say well come back to it later say all right and go on to the next line otherwise your needles going to get so dirty you cant assess highly practical consideration and you say all right was that arc break caused by communication ignoredyou get down to that line seeand it goes ping and you say all right i have here that communication was ignored what communication was ignored oh well lets see it was bill and and pete and there were three dogs and spaceship landed and the dog barked and we said to hell with it but if wed listened to the dog bark yeah yeah we ignored the dog barking hehheh yeah down comes your tone arm you run by blowdowns your whole meter action is by blowdownsyour whole determination is by blowdowns you find an arc break for which you get blowdowns then you havent got the cause of the arc break and the pc hasnt remembered anything about the arc break but just because you get one blowdown isntdoesnt mean that the arc break is gone at this point you say to the pc how do you feel about that arc break and watch it on the meter the question is asked of the pc and watched on the meter if you get roughup of needlethe slightest reaction of needlethat arc break isnt gone but usually the pc will tell you well i dont feel as good about it as i want then keep on with your assessments do you understand but every time you find one and you clear one up then you ask the pc how he feels about it pc feels all right and it doesnt bang on the meterto hell with it get off of it man thats it thats it dont get into situation where the pc feels perfectly all right about it and you havent done threequarters of your assessment sheet so you just go on doggedly doing the remaining threequarters of your assessment sheet youre now trying to find the bypassed charge for an arc break that doesnt exist and i can guarantee that youve got the withhold of nothing the pc hasnt got anything to tell you so hes going to arc break so the other frailty of r2h much more important than the communication of its auditing command is that an inexpert handling of r2h can bring about an arc break very interesting every time you find line you go through the same song and dance you find line you ask him the question he answers the question hes got it all to his satisfaction matter how long the itsa line is dont expect to do many of these session man you probably wont do more than three four five session but boy the tone arm action you can milk out of that thing wham wham wham wham wham you can get lots of tone arm action why recall ten and get the same tone arm action as you get recalling four and still leave the pc with some missed withholds you get the idea so you just want tone arm action out of it not the number of arc breaks handled see youre not interested in the number of arc breaks handled just handle those you get well every time you find reason for it youll find tick and the pc will give you the answer and youve now got that now you dont even necessarily test that line again you can drive pc berserk hes now satisfied hes found it and so forth now you may suspect from the doubtful nature and the fact you havent got blowdown that there is another tick on the same line just say well ill check this line now in that arc break was communication ignored you know that still reads do you suppose you hadknow any reason why that should still be reading wellno i dont see why it should be reading maybe i protested all right you protested it thats all thats all i wanted to know down to the next lineleave it youre not going to get anyplace shoving it down the pcs throat but every now and then you say that line still reads oh it does oh well wait minute wait minute wait minute wait minute thehahait wasnt really the dog communication i ignored their communication they told not to go anywhere near that place and i did and i ignored their c yeah well that caused the arc break with them because they should have told more loudly and youll see your tone arm blow down you see how its done treat them like end rudiments that you dont care whether they clean up or not and dont leave an arc break unless the thing is reading smooth as glass an arc break is going to give you blowdowns just regard it as source of getting some blowdowns and if an arc break doesnt blow down youre now going to run into trouble with later arc breaks that is the way to forecast trouble we had arc break and then we had another arc break and we didnt get any blowdown on either of these arc breaks ohhh now our third arc breakour chances of our getting blowdown on that the next thing you know youre getting in the mid ruds and the pcs going into an automaticity of suppressing arc breaks and weve got sort of mess on our hands why because we excited some bypassed charge by asking for the arc break and then didnt clean the bypassed charge now the whole basic mechanism on which you are operating here is that incidents will blow if the misaligned or bypassed charge is knocked out and that an arc break is caused by bypassed charge there is arc break without bypassed charge so therefore you must find the bypassed charge and if you do there wont be any arc break and it straightens the bank out and the guy gets oriented in the middle of his bank and there you are its terribly permissive process it depends on the itsa line and for that accurate assessment and then having found what the thing assesses let the guy run on and it also depends on not to keep slugging him with assessments for arc breaks that have cleaned up it has frailty you can get the whole arc break cleaned up it doesnt seem hardly worthwhile and there was reality rejected and you got ping on thatit wasnt very big pingand he answered this thing and we asked for the arc break and he didnt have much of an arc breakbut now we went on and did the rest of the assessment oh youve got an arc break now why youve invalidated the reason which he gave for the arc break takes rather delicate slippy auditing but with those reservations its absolutely terrific its fabulous process terribly mild terribly permissive i see ive left you hanging on the ropes little bittheres probably something you dont understand about the process but if you just did it like end mid ruds which you didnt bother to finish if your pc got bright then youve got it made youve got it made and if you monitor its success by the number of blowdowns which you get youve also got it made and when it doesnt blow down start worrying and if it is blowing down and the ta is moving and so forth dont worry just sit back and ride your luck look for trouble when it comes not before it gets there because itll carry you through all the way pc wants to talk to you the whole session about one arc break which is giving you tone arm action from 20 to 65 you are an absolute nut not to let him see its the amount of tone arm action you can get in the session up and downnot the number of arc breaks you cover because the pc you are auditing is in after all present time he is here all there is of him is here he isnt barred out of existence by his bank and if you discharge all of these crossed bypassed charges off of present time theoretically you could run him all the way to ot without him ever going backtrack to amount to anyone he just picks up this item and that item and that incident and that incident and this one and straightens them out and his pictures are getting better and the track is straightening out and the next thing you know hes eight feet back of his head saying what do you want done with these betweenlives guys thank you very much
