states is expected to increase substantially over the coming decades primarily because of its usefulness in generating relatively clean electricity domestic supplies are projected to be unable to meet increasing demand because existing fields are yielding less production and new drilling efforts are not replicating past success rates pipeline imports from canada are also projected to decline various alternatives exist that might close the demand and supply gap with imports of liquefied natural gas lng being touted as one of the most promising as result of projected supply increases much of the lng debate and analysis has focused on the availability of the physical facilities needed to bring larger quantities of lng into the united states however other changes in lng market structure and practices are also likely to be needed before expanded quantities of lng can be supplied at competitive market prices the traditional lng market which developed in the 1970s can be characterized as capital intensive and long term with restrictive contractual provisions risk is managed through the sales contract and the whole production chain is committed in advance to ensure economic viability of the project many of the characteristics of this market are inconsistent with more competitive market environment the lng market is only in the early stages of transition which incorporates viable short term spot market price discovery through gastogas competition financial instruments to manage risk competitive capital acquisition open access of various links in the supply chain to insure efficient resource allocation and an expanded set of producers and buyers full realization of the potential of lng to provide stable source of supply to us markets as well as providing price cap to us natural gas prices awaits changes in market structure investment in receiving terminals as well as additional sources of supply the extent to which the lng market develops marketbased characteristics may determine the extent to which other sources of natural gas supply are needed an alaskan natural gas pipeline development of restricted prospective resources and developing advanced technologies to extract natural gas from unconventional sources may be considered as substitutes in closing the projected demand and supply gap

analyzes the potential for liquefied natural gas lng to become flexible dependable source of natural gas supply for the us market while also setting cap on natural gas prices the potential for increasing us lng use is usually framed in terms of expanding the capacity of existing receiving terminals and the challenges encountered in siting and constructing new terminals while adding the physical capacity to receive more lng is important significant changes in the structure and practices of the lng market are also likely to be required before lng might assume its projected economic role in us energy supply these changes center on the structure of lng markets and transactions incl uding contract design risk sharing financing transportation and the emergence of competitive spot market that determines price through transparent market process the roles of these factors in the evolving lng market are analyzed in this report measures introduced before the 108 th congress focused on physical facilities the liquefied natural gas import terminal development act of 2004 hr 4413 was aimed at reducing regulatory risk and speeding the federal review of applications to build onshore lng terminals as well as assigning authority in this area to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc in the 109 th congress the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 continued earlier efforts to streamline the process of gaining approvals nece ssary for the construction of lng terminals then federal reserve chairman alan greenspan testified before congress arguing for more lng terminal capacity to mitigate the economic effects of high energy prices1 some analysts expanding on mr greenspans testimony have pointed to the structure of the lng market as limiting factor in providing supply security and price cap to us natural gas prices2 this report describes the standard lng market transaction contrasts it with the competitive market model and evaluates the transition curren tly underway between standard transactions and competition whether the price of lng serves as cap or floor on us natural gas prices or whether it follows world oil prices will have important implications for us consumers the characteristics of lng prices will largely depend on how the structure of lng transactions and markets evolve the evolution of lng supply will contribute to the debate over the relative importance of the proposed alaskan natural gas pipeline expanded use of lands now off limits to exploration and production and investments in technology to expand additional unconventional gas supplies if secure lng supplies become available in quantities consistent with an optimistic view of the market some or all of the other gas alternatives needed to close the projected gap between us natural gas demand and traditional north american supply sources in 2025 and beyond might not be needed 1 greenspan alan chairman federal reserve board of governors natural gas supply and demand

administration eia in the annual energy outlook 2007 aeo projects the united states becoming increasingly dependent on imported natural gas in the coming decades the eia reports that in 2005 natural gas imports of 434 trillion cubic feet tcf accounted for 194 of the 224 tcf total of natural gas consumed in the us market under the eias base case reference scenario the share of imported natural gas is projected to rise to 266 or 63 tcf by 2015 3 not only are the share and volume of imported natural gas projected to rise but the sourcing and physical form of the gas are also expected to change as well in 2005 over 85 of natural gas imported to the united states came from canada via pipeline by 2020 the aeo projects that contribution declining to less than 50 virtually all of the remaining projected natural gas imports are expected to be in the form of lng in 2002 the united states imported 017 tcf of lng which accounted for less than 5 of us imported natural gas and less than 1 of the total natural gas supplied to the market in 2005 lng imports rose to 057 tcf less than 3 of us consumption the 2030 lng import projection of 45 tcf represents over seven fold increase in lng supply from overseas compared to 2005 4 the average wellhead price of natural gas was 191 per thousand cubic feet mcf in the 1990s the average price in the 2000s is 474 per mcf over double that of the previous decade the wellhead price of natural gas averaged over 900 mcf from november 2005 through february 2006 before moderating through january 2007 increased prices have put pressure on residential consumer budgets raised the cost of electricity and reduced the competitiveness of industries that are consumers of natural gas higher prices coupled with the competitive cost of lng have led to revived interest in supplying lng to the us market whether lng can provide cap on us natural gas market prices or floor below which prices are unlikely to fall depends on the way the price formation process develops in the lng market as well as the fundamental demand and supply balance the large quantities of lng potentially available on world markets lead some to envisage the us imports of lng expanding sharply in response to escalating domestic prices keeping prices capped and competition driving the price of lng down to its cost of production and deliv ery others see lng providing high cost relatively inflexible incremental supply to the market that might well be critical in avoiding supply shortages but at the same time keeps the price of all gas high enough to justify the cost of importing lng how prices are formed and whether they lead or follow the market price will be important in defining the role played by lng in the us natural gas market

producing country pipeli ne the liquefaction plant specialized tankers for delivery to the consuming country and receiving plant to convert the lng back to gaseous state each link in the chain is

initial capital outlay which is offset by earning from longterm stream of net revenues if risk related to projected gas volumes or price rises the cost of capital for the project increases threatening its economic viability the key to facilitating transactions in the lng market has been the sale and purchase agreement spa twenty year or longer relatively inflexible contract between the owners of the upstream portions of the supply chain and the purchaser of the lng 5 the length of the contract is determined by the relationship between the size of the gas field the capital investment required for the project and the consumers needs since capital expenses are high fields supplying the feedstock natural gas must be large volume producer s with long expected life leading to long term contracts to supply longterm consumption needs risk is critical factor in the lng market the spa is designed to manage and reapportion the risk most longterm contracts have included t akeorpay provision this provision requires that the buyer guarantee purchase of agreed upon gas volumes or pay for nondelivery by requiring the buyer to take contracted volumes of gas or pay for nondelivery the spa vests the purchaser with the quantity risk of the contract virtually assuring the producer of full production levels of output full production is important to the producer because less than full capacity production usually translates into poor economic performance for the investment price risk is managed through price escalation clause in the spa in most existing spas the price escalator is tied to the price of oil which traditionally has been the prime competing fuel for natural gas 6 lng prices have typically been determined through this negotiated administered process of contract negotiation based on an external index price price and volume risk do not exhaust potential risk even though the producing nations national oil company is typically principal or partner in the upstream investment country risk with respect to changing tax and business policy remains additionally political instability has played role in increasing the risk in lng markets7 investment costs have been high for lng projects8 as recently as mid1990s the capital investment cost of liquefaction plant was over 400 per ton of annual capacity implying cost of over 25 billion for plant with an annual capacity of 66 million tons9 additional costs of approximately equal magnitude are also required for natural gas field development and possible pipeline from the field to the liquefaction plant10 more recently constructed facilities have gained significant cost reductions trains 2 and 3 in trinidad were constructed for less than 200 per ton of annual capacity11 although some of these cost reductions are related to improved technology 5 the spa usually excludes the receiving terminal which is left to the consuming country to provide upstream then refers to the gas field the liquefaction plant and the specialized tankers that deliver the lng to the receiving terminal 6 this is especially true for the japanese market where japanese crude cocktail serves as the reference price for lng 7 guerilla activity in sumatra indonesia in 2001 resulte d in the temporary disruption of production at the arun liquefaction plant which supplies japan in 2006 gas pipelines were attacked in nigeria as well as in georgia 8 while consumption of lng is measured in cubic feet production is measured in tons the conversion factor is 1 million tons is equivalent to 48 billion cubic feet of natural gas 9 institute for energy law enterprise university of houston law center introduction to lng january 2003 p 20 10 jensen james t the lng revolution the energy journal vol 24 no2 2003

now more technically feasible allow for reduced capital costs per ton of lng pr oduced however economies of scale are likely to be exhausted once an optimal facility capacity is attained it is not known whether lng facilities have reached or are approaching an optimal scale capital costs scale of the production facility and risk continue to be related as larger scale operations reduce the unit cost of gas the economics of the project become more favorable risk is reduced and project financing and completion becomes more probable however if an spa is not in place as the size of production capacity increases the risk associated with marketing ever larger quantities of lng grows as result of marketing risk producers still have bias toward longterm contracts which virtually ensure favorable economics for the project in 2005 and continuing through 2006 capital costs for new lng facilities rose variety of construction related factors including limited prime contractor capacity increasing costs for steel aluminum pumps compressors and turbines as well as labor costs contributed to the increase additionally national oil companies in the producing countries played more active role in lng projects causing delays and increasing project cost 12 examples of the influence of national oil companies on lng projects include gazproms involvement in the sakhalin island and shtokman project in the barents sea as well as the nigerian national petroleum corporations efforts to control the olokola project13 transportation costs to include fleet of specialized dedicated tankers have been significant in lng projects clear ownership pattern exists in lng tankers some are owned by importing companies some by exporting companies and some by shipping companies very few lng tankers are owned by independent shipping companies and available to handle spot cargoes the spa typically includes destination clause which prevents the buyer from reselling purchased lng to third party further discouraging the development of spot market through 2006 many tankers were used inefficiently since they hold dedicated cargoes they follow set pointtopoint routes and are unable to take advantage of arbitrage possibilities or the reallocation of shipments through cost reducing cargo substitution many tankers also make return trips empty further increasing costs competitive incentives are minimal in this part of the market due to the spa destination clause as well as the ownership linkages of the lng supply chain the role of the spot or short term purchase market in the traditional lng market structure is minor although short term purchases are not unknown as of 2006 lng facility has been built that is not at least partially secured by longterm agreement competitive spot markets aid in price discovery but in traditional lng markets prices are negotiated and administered and likely linked to oil prices spot as well as futures and derivative markets allow market participants to manage risk but in the traditional lng market quantities are set in the spa and the producers need to operate at full capacity to cover financing costs and generate profit dictates contract terms since most large lng buyers under the spa system are electric utilities who were until recently operating as regulated monopolies there was only limited impetus for reform 12 sellers market petroleum economist

between large numbers of buyers and sellers results in lower costs and better quality service for consumers to adapt the traditional lng world market to this model much of the existing supply chain would need to be broken down and reassembled based on market principles the supply chain would need to be more competitive within each link in the chain as well as the links themselves becoming more independent the competitive market model would have many countries developing currently stranded gas resources and either independently or more likely in practice with the assistance of international energy companies producing volumes of lng for the open market 14 partners in lng projects would market their production shares independently of other owners further increasing competition consuming countries would grow in number and they would shop around the world to find the best available price among competing sellers price would be formed in an international market through gastogas competition with home market sources driving down prices to cost effective levels buyers could resell purchased gas if economic incentives indicated that was the profitable strategy tankers would be operated by shipping companies that competed against one another for cargoes and managed the available fleet in such way that shipping costs were minimized lng offloading woul d take place at receiving facilities that were open to all who brought cargoes to the facilities and were located in variety of locations around the consuming market to minimize the delivery costs to the ultimate consumers the spa if it was available in competitive market would have to offer increased flexibility to accommodate changing conditions supporting the supply chain would be the availability of financial capital to develop new projects fund new tankers and build new receiving terminals without the necessary collateral of an spa the market would be sufficient in size depth and transparency to assure investors that demand was stable and deep enough to justify investme nt although risk would remain part of the transaction it could be managed through the creation of financial derivatives strategy based on swaps futures contracts and options to allow ea ch class of market participant the ability to transfer risk to those more willing and able to hold it these derivative markets would exhibit sufficient financial liquidity so that creating and backing out of strategic positions could be accomplished at low cost purchase contracts would tend to be of short duration because both buyers and sellers would find it advantageous to continually search the market for the transaction offering the best economic return

transformation was driven by both time and technology at that time contracts signed during the market expansion of the 1970s and 1980s began to expire at expiration lng buyers faced less regulation in their home markets technology had also improved allowing for larger more cost 14 stranded gas resources are economically viable to produce but currently have transportation system in place for

pressures of changing buyer requirements and lower costs set in motion market transformation that continues today the united states was an early participant in the modern international lng market dating back to the late 1960s with exports from alaska to japan15 in the 1970s and 1980s japan currently the worlds leading importer of lng expanded its imports from indonesia brunei abu dhabi and other countries japan which has domestic sources of natural gas and access to pipeline imports uses natural gas mostly as fuel for the electric power industry as result of these origins lng prices have been derived from and determined contractually by the price of oil oil was the substitute fuel for japanese utilities at the time as result the lng price structure is based on net back to the producer based on the local market natural gas price if available and the reference price of oil if not as result of this pricing mechanism lng investment decisions are made on the basis of the actual and forecast prices in target markets and what the net back to the project might yield historically there is little evidence to suggest that lng prices have adjusted to competition in the market more common is the result that if prices for domestic natural gas are weak lng tends to exit the market returning when prices recover for example four lng receiving facilities were built in the united states in the 1970s 16 with the decline of natural gas prices in the 1980s and the low prices prevalent for most of the 1990s these facilities either were closed or remained open at very low utilization rates in the latter decade the higher natural gas prices of the last five years supported by demand growth for natural ga s coupled with the declining costs of lng have provided economic incentive for these facilities to reopen and expand additionally an off shore facility gulf gateway located in the gulf of mexico opened in 2005

asian market the regulatory environment for utilities is becoming more open before they enter into new lng supply agreements consumers are requesting and receiving liberalized contract terms compared to the typical spa of the 1980s takeorpay provisions now typically only apply to part to the contract volume giving the consumer some flexibility to expand or contract purchases as dictated by demand even the destination clause is being liberalized in some cases on the supply or producer side of the market more sources of lng are becoming available to the market potentially giving buyers more choice 17 although liberalized contract terms are generally beneficial for consumers the question of whether they are evidence of progress toward an idealized competitive market remains to the extent that newly negotiated contracts remain long term they may fix the market structure and practices at their current state for the next 10 to 20 years possibly slowing further liberalization 15 these exports continue with about 63 billion cubic feet b cf of gas sent to japan from the kenai peninsula terminal in alaska in 2003 16 these facilities are at cove point maryland elba isla nd georgia

exempt from take or pay provisions this could be interpreted as 10 of contract volumes being available for trade on short term or spot market or it could be interpreted as an allowance for the demand volatility that even longterm customers might experience based on earlier contracts with specific relationship to spot market transactions the general attractiveness of longterm agreements in the lng industry continues in 2007 for example austrias omv had planned to build an lng terminal in croatia but questioned the decision when it became difficult to identify longterm supply source of lng in the united states cheniere with interests in four us terminal projects including sabine pass louisiana and freeport texas is seeking mixed usage contract base seventy percent of their capacity is said to be underwritten by and allocated to longterm agreements with total and chevron and conoco phillips and dow chemical respectively however cheniere plans to take its chances in the arbitrage market with the remaining 30 of capacity g21g153g152g157g561g15g138g155g148g142g157g156g561g138g151g141g561g18g155g146g140g142g156g561 whether the increasing number of buyers and sellers participating in the lng market means it is becoming more competitive and flexible depends on whether the price of lng is the signal that affects the balance between demand and supply to the extent that the relationship between buyers and sellers is still characterized by the spa the additional market participants may do little to change the fundamental nature of the mark et if the market follows traditional practice if all new supplies of lng are tied to specific consumers net new gas will be available to secure the operation of viable spot market existing ma rket relationships will be scaled up to meet the new larger size of the market but the fundamental relationships will remain the same the existence of viable spot market is important because it allows consumers the flexibility to sell off excess supply to eliminate surpluses and acquire additional supplies to ameliorate shortages as well as aiding in price discovery these activities are central to the market process and the key to achieving lower prices and driving down cost s market determined prices will also help determine future investment decisions in lng capacity in more efficient way recent data suggests that while short term transact ions in lng are becoming more prevalent the existence of viable spot market is still in the future 18 spot cargoes generally enter the united states mostly in the summer months when worl d heating demand is lowest suggesting that the united states was residual market for lng 19 other data suggest that the deliveries taken at the operational us receiving terminals was adversely affected by world events and competitive price pressures from domestic gas production weak us natural gas prices in the winter of 200102 resulted in capacity utilization declining at the us receiving facilities as available supplies went to europe where prices were higher the same situation occurred later in the year when nuclear power problems in japan and shortages of tanker capacity again lowered us capacity utilization rates as cargoes were diverted to japan 20 this behavior has led some analysts to 18 definition and classification problems exist in the lng market in 2003 the energy information agency classified 832 of us lng imports as spot cargoes however almost all of the cargoes from trinidad are us allocated even though classified as spot cargoes neil chris lng in the us oil and gas journal

qatar reallocated supplies that were set aside for the north american market to asia mainly japan and south korea because of stronger prices in those markets during 2006 it was reported that us receiving terminals were operating at close to 50 of capacity reflecting weak demand conditions and declining prices22 this recent evidence on lng cargoes and us receiving facility capacity utilization in conjunction with the experience of the 1990s suggests that lng has not yet developed the kind of deep transparent spot market required for economic efficiency but is still largely dominated by fixed contractual relationships even though these cited transactions are short term in nature they represent only beginning in the development of an efficient spot market recent report suggested that although the asian lng market is more sensitive to market fundamentals as contracts are renegotiated this does not equate to the emergence of global spot market because of infrastructure and logistical problems lack of uncommitted lng volumes and few pipeline alternatives 23 the role of lng as stable large volume supplier to the us market is enhanced by the expectation that expanding supplies can set price cap on the us natural gas market for lng supply to set price cap for the us market producers would likely have to maintain excess capacity or have the ability to rapidly expand production in response to price increases to allow any upward price pressure to be set against extra quantities supplied in addition the price of lng should lead the market in the sense of competitively being driven down to delivered cost rather than following the market and simply netting back returns based on the current market price for natural gas or competing reference energy source because the costs of lng project development are high with significant variability price will have to be sufficiently high to cover the costs of the highest cost supplier in the market or those high cost producers will be forced to exit the market or seek markets that can meet the required price in this sense increased us lng use might actually form price floor below which natural gas prices cannot fall without risking supply disruption recent development is that dubai plans to create an lng storage center and trading hub to become operational in 2010 the physical proximity of the facility to qatar the worlds largest lng producer as well as other persian gulf producer s as well as storage capacity equivalent to approximately 20 lng tanker cargoes is expected to allow for trading based on seasonal price differentials as well as geographical arbitrages the introduction of this facility which would contribute to the market competitiveness of lng is timed to coincide with the opening of several large gulf lng projects critics argue that lng will be supply constrained through at least 2013 making it unlikely that surplus cargoes will be available for storage inhibiting the financial liquidity of the new market center 24 g21g145g146g153g153g146g151g144g561 the lng tanker fleet is increasing in october 2003 the lng tanker fleet stood at 151 ships with 55 ships in

their ability to berth at existing receiving terminals at least in the united states virtually all of the new ships currently under construction are to be dedicated to delivering the product from specific projects recently some major importing and exporting companies have ordered lng tankers not dedicated to specific pr oject this construction may or may not signal the emergence of merchant fleet while these tankers might be used for spot cargoes it is also possible that they will be used by these large companies as insurance against the quantity uncertainty associated with incomplete up and downstream projects in which the companies have invested there is still little evidence of the em ergence of an independent lng tanker fleet in the new construction data therefore the newly constructed tankers are not likely to change the structure of the market in the direction of more competition their purpose may be largely to service the larger scale of the evolving market the dedicated structure of the lng tanker sector suggests that existing practices in shipping will tend to continue an available uncommitted tanker fleet is for many analysts necessary condition for the existence of competitive lng spot market until speculative ships are built in significant number and shipping companies are willing to risk the approximately 150 to 160 million for midsized tanker it is unlikely that significant continual spot market transactions can be sustained 25 tanker costs have declined 138000 cubic meter capacity ship had an estimated nominal cost of 280 million in the mid1980s and an estimated nominal cost of about 155 million in 2003 ships are also becoming larger over time reducing the per unit transportation cost of lng actual charter rates are harder to specify because of the nonmarket use of most of the tankers but estimates run from 27000 to 150000 per day with an average near 60000 per day26 the reduced cost of lng tanker construction is largel driven by more shipyards competing to build the tankers27 when lng tankers reach the consuming nation they must have access to specialized receiving facilities with respect to receiving terminal policy in the united states policy may have moved the industry away from market based competition in the interest of certainty of the investment climate the federal energy regulatory commission ferc determined that lng receiving facilities do not have to provide open access to all who wish to dock lng cargoes they can serve the proprietary interests of their owners who typically have contracted lng resources and require dedicated unloading facilities 28 this decision may have been taken in the interest of enhancing investment feasibility given the high costs of lng facilities fear was thought to exist that little or investment in new receiving terminals would take place if the ownersinvestors in the project could not be assu red that their investment would result in their ability to import their own lng supplies and achieve an acceptable longterm rate of return on their investment however the decision is likely to retard the development of functioning spot market if receiving terminal capacity is largely st ructured to the sending capacity of an identified lng project it would become more difficult to justify speculative non allocated lng project 25 energy information administration the global

an important factor restricting the movement toward competitive lng market is the limited ability of market participants to manage risk through existing institutions the new york mercantile exchange nymex offers futures and options contracts on natural gas which can be used to manage some of the transaction risk however these are standardized contracts whose contract gas quantity levels are small compared to the size of typical lng tanker delivery making it difficult to establish contract position 29 the market also thins out as contracts further than three to six months in the future are consid ered again limiting market participants ability to manage long run risk additionally these contracts offer opportunity for the parties to the agreement to negotiate customized terms which may be required to facilitate large high value transactions the solution to the risk management limitation might lie in an active overthecounter derivatives market but that alternative may not be viable in an lng market environment characterized by tight supplies active spot market trading hubs little product storage capability and restricted transportation options

rrounding these investments terminal siting pipeline infrastructure safety and physical security and other supply bottlenecks may all require policy responses the higher energy content of imported lng

domestic production and the reduced availability of traditional sources of imported natural gas suggest the possibility of imbalance in the natural gas market over the aeo forecast period to 2025 imbalance could show up as physical shortages if new sources of production cannot be identified as well as volatile high price levels lng has been suggested as possible solution to this problem large quantities of stranded natural gas reserves exist around the world to potentially address the quantity problem while if large quantities of lng become available they might establish price cap for the market based on the cost of lng the debate thus far concerning us lng imports has focused on the investment in receiving terminals especially siting to include jurisdictional issues between ferc and the states security environmental safety and to lessor extent the magnitude of capital investment crs analysis suggests that other institutional and market structure factors might also create impediments to an lng based scenario especially with respect to the competitive nature of lng price formation 29 the typical lng tanker delivery is 650 times the size of nymex contract see james t

is based on longterm contracts designed to ensure business stability number of changes would need to occur if more competitive market structure is to evolve recognizing the scale of investment required to start lng production one of the primary factors is risk without the institutions and financial instruments to supplement or replace the spa in risk management it will be difficult for competitive spot market to develop existing markets offer market participants only partial ability to manage risk and given the size of potential lng based transactions they might alter the nature of trading if they were included in the market if competitive market fails to develop it is likely that future expansion of lng will be through complex longterm contract negotiations which might limit the role of efficient market based prices traditionally lng prices have been netted back to producers based on the price of substitute commodity usually oil or on the price of natural gas in the local market without the pressure of competitive market it is unlikely th at the longterm price of gas will be driven to cost based levels if the price determination mechanism for lng remains there is little reason to assume that lng can provide price cap to domestic natural gas prices in this case possible scenario would be for lng to enter the us market when prices are high and then exit if prices moderate while this behavior might moderate extreme price spikes it might not provide stable supply source for domestic natural gas consumers because increasing lng supplies is only one of number of ways to close the projected gap between us natural gas demand and supply over the coming years any decisions to encourage or discourage this particular source may have implications for other potential sources optimists point to the large quantities of stranded natural gas around the world and the plans to develop dozens of receiving terminals in the united states and might conclude that this source alone might close the demand and supply gap if this was the case the need for an alaska natural gas pipeline might be weaker as would the need for drilling in environmentally sensitive areas and the need for expanding technology to develop gas reserves from new sources if more pessimistic view of lng is taken these other alternatives rise in importance
