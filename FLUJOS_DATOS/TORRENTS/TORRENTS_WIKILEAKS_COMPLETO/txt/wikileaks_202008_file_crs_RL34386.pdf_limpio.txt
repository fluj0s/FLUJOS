payment freezes introduction efforts to modify large number of home mortgage loans with resetting payments have increased among private state and federal institutions in september 2007 federal and state financia l regulators issued guidance to lenders encouraging loan restructuring for troubled borrowers to avoid foreclosure where feasible1 loan servicers were instructed to review their full authority to modify loans for borrowers already delinquent and for borrowers likel to default in the near future in november 2007 the state of california nego tiated voluntary interest rate freeze plan with four large servicers2 in december 2007 national voluntary rate freeze plan was formed among private loan rvicers community organizations loan counselors the department of housin g and urban developm ent hud and the department of treasury under the hope now alliance3 the pace of voluntary loan modification has begun to accelerate after an initial period during which the pace of loan modifications was less than anticipated some observers had worried that the pace of modification may have been slowed by the number of loans sold to secondary mortgage markets and sliced in to marketable secur ities securitization securitization could present challenge for loan servicers who anticipate that the average default rate will rise among group of borrowers who are current on their mortgages but who face large payment reset due to the expiration of an introductory adjustable rate mortgage arm or interestonly io period the loan servicers may be willing to modify these loans for

this context factsensitive refers to the probability that small changes in the facts can significantly change the probability of avoiding costly litigation anticipatory loan workouts did not seem to be happening in large numbers prior to october 2007 despite recognition ce january 2006 of the upcoming subprime adjustable rate mortgage arm problem the chair of the fdic sheila baer had expressed frustration that modification fforts undertaken during the first three quarters of 2007 had helped less th an 1 of troubled borrowers5 more recent information shows significant acceleration as the california plan and the hope now alliance efforts expand the increas in fourth quarter 2007 california loan modifications appears to be confirmed by februa ry 6 2008 hope now alliance press release that shows the number of ca lifornia loan modifications jumped from 3151 in the third quarter of 2007 to 10199 in the fourth quarter of 2007 the press release does not however distinguish modi fication for borrowers already delinquent from modifications in anticipation of deli nquency therefore it is difficult to know if these servicers had resolved questions about the usage of broadbased freezes that do not contact individual borrowers recognizing potential limitations on borro wer workouts due to securitization the house financial services committee sent letter june 15 2007 to the securities and exchange commission sec requesting clarification of financial accounting standard fas 140 which governs transfers of assets in securitization sometimes referred to as true sales the sec which oversees the financial accounting standards board responded jul 24 2007 that servicer who modified the loan of borrower likely to become delinquent would not lose off balance sheet status see discussion in accounting i ssue fas 140 and anticipatory defaults section these letters addressed situations in which servicer examines the likelihood of default on casebycase ba sis but did not ddress broad based modification plans in which the servicer will not have analyzed the particulars of individual loans or attempted to contact the affected borrowers in december 2007 the ad ministration announced the hope now alliance plan for freezing some subprime interest ra tes this plan would allow servicers to freeze the interest rates of many subprime borrowers ev those current on their payments in anticipation of foreseeable fault without examinin g the particulars of each loan and without negotiating with each borrower the hope now alliance sought comfort letters from the sec and from the internal revenue service irs to assure loan servicers that their particip ation would not violate accounting standards or tax laws the responses of the sec nd the irs state that neither agency would object to the hope now initiative but advo cates of more comprehensive mortgagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34386crs3 6 one reason lenders may wish to sell their loans is that removing risky loan from the balance sheet reduces the riskbased capital re quirement monitored by financial regulators 7 fasb is not government agency however the sec has oversight of accounting rules issued by fasb and in some cases acc ounting standards such as fas 140 play an important role in legal disputes involving ba lance sheet activity misrepresentation or fraud 8 securitization trusts for mortgage backed curities are often formed as entities with the special purpose of holding the mortgages nd distributing the payments to investors according to prearranged formula thus the term special purpose entities spe they may not actively manage the assets in the trust nor may they typically acquire new assets other offbalance sheet instruments such as structured investment vehicles sivs in contrast are not necessarily limited to an initial pool of assets modification plans cannot rely on the comfor t letters issued for the original hope now plan accounting issue fas 140 and anticipatory defaults some lenders choose to sell their loans into the securitization process because selling the loan improves their balance sheet but the lender may continue as the loan servicer6 the servicing contract often specifies the range of activities permitted to cure bad loans lenderservicers who ex ceed permitted activities risk being forced to return the loans to their own balance sheets furthermore continued responsibility to cure the mortgages could under some circumstances undermine true sale and force the seller to place the loans back on the balance sheet to take full advantage of securitization lenders need to know which activities they can pursue and under what circumstances to modi fy troubled loans and still consider mortgage transfer true sale for balance sheet purposes of current interest is the ability of lender servicer to modify large numbers of loans in anticipation of default without conducting loanbyloan review the accounting rules for passthrough trusts that are typically used in securitization of subprime mortgages ar contained in fas 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial ssets and extinguishments of liabilities7 fas 140 sets among other things the cond itions under which loans transferred to special purpose entity spe qualify as true sale and can be removed from the sellers balance sheet8 it also helps distinguish between permitted activities that are consistent with passive trust and ac tivities that are not permitted because they constitute active mana gement among the conditions placed on qualified spes fas 140 presents three restrictions on permitted activ ities related to borrower wo rkouts per mitted activities including loan modification must be 1 significantly limited 2 entirely specified in the legal documents that

regarding the nature of permitted modifi cation activities9 the january 8 2008 sec office of chief account ant oca comfort letter also engaged in factsensitive netpresentvalue analysis which could be problematic for proposals to extend freezes to troubled prime arm or interestonly mortgage s default rates for some subprime loans are expected by so observers to triple to more than 30 of subprime arms issued in 2005 but similar tripling of prime arm defaults would result in default rates of less than 3 in some parts of the country especially in certain california cities arms made up large share of mortgages outside the subprime sector in 2005 given that ther are so many more prime loans than subprime loans the external effects of prime loan resets could be as large as subprime but lenderservicers might not feel confident that prime arms are reasonably foreseeable to end in default when 97 are paying on time remic tax status broadbased modification pl an could result in loss of the favorable tax status of the real estate mortgage inves tment conduit remic or trust holding securitized loans the remic structure which was part of the 1986 tax reform allows passthrough trust to divide the flow of mortgage payments into varying classes of securities without triggering corporate taxation10 prior to 1986 trust that used formula to assign financial flows to diverse classes of securities or tranches would be subject to corporate tax the 1986 law exempted this assignment of funds function and allowed multic lass securitization since 1986 many mortgages have been financed using this remic structure the irs issued revenue procedur 200772 on december 7 2007 to provide comfort to hope now alliance loan servicers that adherence to the rate freeze plan would not result in loss of tax status by aff ected trusts as with the sec the irs did provide comfort for the specifics of th december 2007 plan but provided comfort to anyone else considering voluntary rate freeze or to those considering an expansion of the december 2007 plan the irs was largely silent on its reasoning and limited its discussion to subprime arms proponents of expanding the plan to include prime arms or to interestonly resets will likely need to seek further guidance from the irs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34386crs5 11 ronald coase the pr oblem of social cost journal of law economics vol 3 1960 p 1 divergent investor interests even if market participants agree that the sec and irs comfort letters are solution to the active management definition in cases of anticipatory default modifications may result in private lawsuits because of divergent investor interests the holders of different securities from the same mortgage pool are often paid different amounts interest vs principal or paidfirst vs paidlast to name two examples furthermore it is possible that some investors could gain more from borrower terminating the mortgage early in cluding default while other investors only gain if the loan fully performs the loan servicer that renegotiates the loan may have the effect of benefiting some investors and hurting others rather than sharing gains and losses evenly consequently the holders of some tranches of securities may object to the renegotiation some obs ervers are concerned that the possibility of this tranche warfare c ould prevent private solutions to unsustainable mortgages even if all parties agree that keeping the current family in the home minimizes the total losses compared with paying the ex penses of the foreclosure process analysis of private bargaining solutions the coase theorem and its limits general economic principle called th coase theorem holds that private bargaining can lead to efficient outcomes if 1 property rights are well defined 2 information is available to participants and 3 transaction costs are low11 sometimes the efficient solution may be to keep the current mortgage borrower inthe home even though the borrower is unabl to sustain the current mortgage if foreclosure is costly and local home prices are falling for example then renegotiating with the current occupant may minimize losses compared to paying the costs of foreclosure and finding new buyer in falling market under these circumstances the coase theorem would predict that minimizing total loss would allow investors as group to compensate any potentially objecting investors and approve the loan modification the pr ohibition on active management however could make bargaining difficult among invest ors to keep the current borrower in the home even though in many cases that would be the efficient outcome the coase theorem suggests that private bargaining could lead to the creditors renegotiating with the current borrower even if the creditors have conflicting interests due to the multiclass structure the reason is because the investors as group could always compensate an objecting investor that would prefer an outcome that results in net lower return the multiclass structure and the limits on active management for tax and accounting purposes may make dir ect private bargaining by investors in different tranches impractical the npv test advocated by the industry appears to be consistent with this bargaining outcome as long as the proba ble gains from avoiding costly foreclosureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34386crs6 are greater than losses from freezing capab borrowers at lower rates private bargainers could in theory compensate i nvestors in hurt tranches the difference is that there is assurance that investors in diminished tranches actually would be compensated the result coul d be investor lawsuits nd both the irs and the sec recognized that the npv test is factsensitive the cost of potential litigation could be significant evidence of increasing voluntary loan modification the hope now alliance issued statement on february 6 2008 summarizing the current pace of loan modification table 1 drawn from that statements appendix shows that loan modifications were more than twice as high in the fourth quarter of 2007 than in the first quarter the pace of prime loan modifications also accelerated these results do not distinguish between anticipatory loss mitigation and negotiations on loanbyloan basis the results in the first two quarters of 2007 are presumably dominated by loanbyloan modifications as they occurred prior to the state and federal rate freeze initiatives table 1 quarterly loan modifications 2007 selected states q1 q2 q3 q4
