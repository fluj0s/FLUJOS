changed to allow for more evenhanded negotiations at the same time however as result of consolidation and clustering in the cable industry there are few very large cable companies which primarily serve major markets as well as the two national satellite operators that appear to have suﬃcient market strength to be able to withstand many of the demands of the programmers with musthave

broadcaster or cable network owner and multichannel video programming distributor mvpd usually cable or satellite operator about the carriage of partic ular video programming the price for that programming or the tier on which the programming is to be offered to the end user many consumers can be affected recently there have been several incidents in which negotiating impasse be tween programmer and distributor has resulted in the programmer refusing to allow the mvpd to carry or the mvpd choosing not to carry program network while contractual rms conditions and rates are determined by private negotiations they are strongly affected by number of federal statutory provisions and regulatory requirement s including the statutory retransmission consent and mustcarry rules the fcc program exclusivity rules localintolocal and distant signal provisions in satellite laws copyright law provisions relating to cab and satellite statutor commercial leased access requirements and program carriage and nondiscriminatory access provisions and the fccs media ownership rules the recent increase in negotiating impasses appears to be the result of structural market changes that have given programmers with musthave programming much greater leverage particularly when they are negotiating with small distributors competitive entry in distribution almost all cable companies now face competition from two satellite companies and are beginning to face competition from telephone companies has em boldened programmers with popular programming to demand cash payment from distributors for the right to carry that programming in particular local broadcas ters increasingly are using the statutory retransmission consent requirement to demand cash payment from small cable companies who could lose subscribers to the satellite provide rs and new telephone entrants if they reach an impasse with the broadcaster and can longer carry the local broadcast signals in the past the cable companies were the only mvpd in market and could use that countervailing pow er to refuse to pay cash for carriage thus ironically competition in the distribution market may be resulting in higher programming costs that mvpds may have to pass on to their subscribers the small cable companies have argued that some of the existing statutory and regulatory requirements were implemented at time when cable was monopoly and were intended to protect broa dcasters now that the market dynamics have changed they argue some of these rules should be changed to allow for more evenhanded negotiations at the same time however as result of consolidation and clustering in the cable industry there are few very large cable companies which primarily serve major markets as well as the two national satellite operators that appear to have sufficient market strength to be able to withstand many of the demands of the programmers with musthave progra mming and to place small independent

of june 2005 there were 1096 million television households of which approximately 942 million subscribed to an mvpd service of the latter 694 received video programming from franchised cable operator and 277 from dbs operator 3 even where the impasse involves broadcast programming that is transmitted over the air most households that subscribe to an mvpd longer have an antenna and therefore at minimum would have to obtain and install an antenna to continue to receive the programming in these cases the mvpd typi cally has offered to provide free rabbit ears antenna although in many cases higher quality rooftop antenna is needed to get good over the air reception and some households ca nnot get decent reception even with rooftop antenna indeed that inability to receive br oadcast signals over the air was the original impetus for cable television which was then called community antenna television or catva condensed review of retransmission consent and other federal rules affecting programmerdistributor negotiations1 overview virtually all us households have television and almost 86 of these television households get their video prog ramming by subscribing to multichannel video programming distributor mvpd in most cases cable operator or direct broadcast satellite dbs ope rator rather than re lying upon free overtheair broadcast television signals2 as result when conflicts arise between programmers and mvpds about the carriage of particul ar video programming the price for that programming or the tier on which the programming is to be offered to the end user for example on basic or premium tier on top 60 or top 120 tier or on an analog or digital tier many consumers can be affected recently there have been several incidents in which negotiating impasse between programmer and an mvpd has resulted in the programmer refusing to allow the mvpd to carry or the mvpd choosing not to carry program network forcing the mvpds subscribers to choose between foregoing that program network or switching to competing mvpd that did carry the program network3 there also have been number of situations in wh ich programmerdistribut or negotiations have been resolved without any disruption in program carriage but only after the negotiations played out in public with s ubscribers and public officials being warnedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34079crs2

transmission of each of the local commercial television stations ca rried on the cable system as broadcasters have deployed digital technology they have been able to use their new digital spectrum to transmit multiple video streams not just single stream andor to transmit their programming in highdefinition as well as sta ndard format the broadcasters have sought an interpretation of the mustcarry rule that would require cable operators to carry both their analog and their digital transmissions and wh ere they are offering multiple video streams or highdefinition transmissions that would re

these additional continuedof the danger of losing access to partic ular programming and being encouraged by each side to contact the other side in order to place pressure on them to compromise although the contractual terms cond itions and rates at which programmers make their programming available to distributors are determined by private negotiations there are number of fede ral statutory provisions and regulatory requirements that strongly affect those negotiations4 these include the retransmission consent and mustcarry rule s which govern the carriage of television broad cast signals by cable operators5 under these rules every three year s each local commercial broadcast television station must choos between 1 negotiating retransmission consent agreement with each cable system operating in its service area whereby if ag reement is reached the broadcaster is compensated6 by the cable system for the right to carry the broadcast signal and if agreement is not reached the cable system is not allowed to carry the signal or 2 requiring each cable system operating in its service area to carry its signal but receiving compensation for such carriage7 with this mandatory electionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34079crs3 7 continued video transmissions has been subject to re transmission consent negotiations and is not mandatory on the part of cable or satellite operators 8 these rules are found in part 76 of the fccs rules for description of these rules see the fcc retransmission consent report at footnote 8 and at paras 1730 9 commercial television station licensees are entitled to protect the network programming they have contracted for by exercising nondup lication rights against more distant television broadcast stations carried on local cable levision system that serves more than 1000 subscribers commercial broadcast stations may assert these nonduplication rights regardless of whether or not their signals are being transmitted by the local cable system and regardless of when or if the network programming is scheduled to be broadcast generally the zone of protection for such programming cannot exceed 35 miles for stations licensed to community in the commissions list of top 100 television markets or 55 miles for stations licensed to communities in smaller tele vision markets in addition cable operator does not have to delete the network progra mming of any station which the commission has previously recognized as significantly viewed in the cable community 10 with respect to nonnetwork programming cable systems that serve at least 1000 subscribers may be required upon proper notific ation to provide syndicated protection to broadcasters who have contracted with progra m suppliers for exclusive exhibition rights to certain programs within specific geographic area s whether or not the cable system affected is carrying the station requesting this protection however cable system is required to delete program broadcast by station that ither is significantly viewed or places grade b or better contour over the community of the cable system 11 cable system located within 35 miles of th city of license of broadcast station where sporting event is taking place may not carry the live television broadcast of the sporting event on its system if the event is not available live on local television broadcast station if the holder of the broadcast rights to the even t or its agent requests such blackout the holder of the rights is responsible for notifying the cable operator of its request for program deletion at least the monday preceding the calendar week during which the deletion is continuedbroadcasters with popular progra mming that are confident the local cable systems will want to carry that programming can make the retransmission consent election nd be assured compensation for such carriage and broadcasters with less popular programming that the local cable systems might ot herwise not choose to carry can make the must carry election and be assured that their signal will be carried by all local cable systems in many cases local broadcasters that are affiliated with national broadcast network and have elected the retransmission consent option have as part of their affiliation agreement assigned to the network the right to negotiate the terms of retransmission consent number of federal communications commission fcc or commission exclusivity rules8 that give local broadcasters the exclusive right to distribute certain programming the network program nonduplication rules9 and syndicated exclusivity protection rules10 or that protect sports teams or sports leagues distribution rights to sporting event taking place in local market the sports programming blackout rules11

35mile blackout zone extends from the broadcast stations licensed community with which the sports event or team is identified if the event or local team is not identified with any particular community for instance the new england patriots the 35mile blackout zone extends from the community nearest the sports event which has licensed broadcast station the sports blackout rule does not apply to cable television systems serving less than 1000 subscrib ers nor does it require deletion of sports event on broadcast stations signal that was carried by cable system prior to march 31 1972 the rule does not apply to sports pr ogramming carried on nonbroadcast program distribution services such as espn these services however may be subject to private contractual blackout restrictions 12 satellite home

access to programming in which cable operator has an attributable interest in section 628 of the communications act whic h directs the fcc to establish rules to prevent vertically integrated cable operator from discriminating in the prices terms and conditions at which it makes its programming available to nonaffiliated mv pds or have exclusive access to the programming in which it has an attributable interest16 but these prohibitions do not hold if the vertically integrated companys programming is distributed over terrestrial facilities for example over broadband lines an exception that frequently applies to re gional sports networks and potentially could apply to all cable program networ ks as broadband fiber optic cable becomes more widely deployed this exception has been termed by some the terrestrial loopholehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34079crs7 17 the fcc has long regulated broadcast ownership as means of promoting diversity competition and localism in the media

programming networks vertical or channel occupancy limit congress intended the structural ownership limits mandated by section 613f to ensure that cable operators did not use their dominant position in the mvpd market acting unilaterally or jointly to unfairly impede the flow of video progra mming to consumers 47 usc 533f 19 see for example linda moss and mike farrell dueling for dollars

v national baseball clubs the supreme court ruled that baseball is sport subject to state regulations not business involved in interstate commerce that woul d be subject to the federal antitrust laws although the supreme court acknow ledged in its 1953 decision in toolson v new york yankees inc and again in its 1972 decision in flood v kuhn that the baseballs antitrust exemption was an anomaly it ruled that it is up to congress to change baseballs antitrust exemption other sports leagues do not enjoy the same broad antitrust exemption as baseball but the sports broadcasting act of 1961 15 usc 1291 created limited antitrust exemption that allows league to nego tiate the broadcasting rights for all the teams in football baseball basketball or hockey league the act was amended in 1966 to exempt the combining of any professional football leagues the broadcast ownership rules17 and cable ownership rules18 which can affect the relative negotiating strength of programmers and distributors by restricting or allowing their reach in national or local markets for example some parties have argued that changes in broadcast ownership rules that allow broadcasters to own more than one television station in market has significantly strengthened the retransmission consent bargaini ng position of those broadcasters that own or control more than one station in local market19 certain statutory exemptions from the antitrust laws for sports leagues20 recently there have been more frequent incidents of programmers and mvpds failing to reach contractual agreements and in several instances one or the other party or end users who were affected by the impasse have sought federal government intervention either at the fcc or with congress the parties seeking intervention often propose modification of ex isting statutory provisions or regulatory requirements that allegedly favor one side in the ne gotiations or undermine the successful consummation of negotiations although thes impasses have involved number of different issues the most c ontroversial and widely publicized conflicts have involved unresolved retran smission consent negotiationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34079crs8 there are three basic functional co mponents to the provision of video programming producing cont ent assembling content into programming package such as network that can be effici ently distributed and distributing the programming to end users for convenience in this report the content assembler is called programmer in most cases the programmer is media company that packages individual programs or program series to create an overtheair broadcas t network or cable network that programmer ma or may not own the production studio or sports team where the creative talent actors directors athletes etc directly produces the content that is may or may not vertically integrate backwards into direct production on occasion sports team or l eague will vertically integrate forward by packaging its own games and other progra mming into network under its own brand name for example national football l eague major league baseball or yankees network also sometimes company is both programmer and distributor for example while an overtheair broadcaster is just programmer for the majority of households that receive thei r video programs from an mvpd it is also distributor of that programming to the minority of hous eholds that continue to receive their programming overtheair similarly most of the large mvpds have vertically integrated backward and now have partial or total equity interests in some of the cable networks distributed over their cable or satellite systems several mvpds also own sports teams for example cablevis ion owns the new york knicks and thus are content producers as well moreover the large media companies that own broadcast networks also own cable networks and often tie distributor access to their broadcast networks to agreement to ca rry some of their cable networks although existing statutory rules give th local broadcast station the right to negotiate the terms under which it ma kes its programming available for retransmission by mvpds many of those local broadcasters are affiliated with national television ne twork and in their affiliation agreements with the national network give the network the right to negotiate the terms of retransmission consent moreover increasingly the negotiations between large programmers and large distributors also involve videoondema nd rights to large portions of the programmers library of content as well as provisions setting conditions on how the programmer can make its programming ava ilable for internet cellphone and other new avenues of distribution in addition dur ing the transition from analog to digital transmission and the initial deployment of high definition technology programmer distributor negotiations increasingly invol ve issues of whether program will be carried in multiple formats analog and digital high definition and standard definition and whether network will be placed on an analog or digital tier the relationship between pr ogrammer and distributor is characterized by mutual need the programmers need distributors th at have direct contact with the potential audience the distribut or needs programmers with good content to attract subscribers at the same time there is an inherent tension as each seek s to capture the lions share of the value that consumers place on that content each must weigh the potential loss if an impasse occurs and the programmer refuses to permit the distributor to carry the programming or if the dist ributor chooses not to carry the programming for example for the programmer that potential loss could take the form of foregone compensation from the mvpd andor foreg one advertising reve nues as advertisershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34079crs9 21 kagan research reported in economics of basic cable networks 2006 at p 5 that the advertisersupported cable networks had gross advertising revenues of 137 billion and also had license fee revenues of 137 billion in 2004 kagan projected that in 2009 those totals would be 254 billion and 242 billion respectively in contrast broadcast networks historically have received almost all of their revenues from advertising not from per subscriber fees imposed on mvpds broadcaster attempts to increase those per subscriber fees have been at the core of the recent br oadcastermvpd retransmission consent conflictsrespond to reduced audience21 both of which could be substantial if the mvpds subscribers represent significant portion of the programmers total audience and if those subscribers do not switch to anothe r mvpd that does carry the programmers network for the distributor that potentia l loss could take the form of foregone subscriber revenue if without the programming as part of its offering some end users shift to competing mvpd as well as foregone advertising revenues the losses could be substantial if ma ny subscribers switched to competing mvpd given these risks negotiating impasses usually are avoided over time market forces have led to the adoption of business models th at serve content providers programmers and distributors but these business models represent an unstable equilibrium when market conditions that affect the relative negotiating strength of programmers and distributors change the newly strengthened party typically attempts to change the prevailing business model to its advantage that is happening today programmers are taking advantage of structural market changes favorable to them to pressure mvpds to make cash payments for programming that up till now was available either for free or for noncash considera tions or where cash payments have been made in the past to make higher cash pa yments some mvpds have had sufficient countervailing market power to resist or limit these changes but others have not this had led to calls by the smaller often rural mvpds for modifications to the retransmission consent rules and other federal rules that allegedly favor programmers and in particular cal broadcast stations in their negotiations with distributors market changes affecting the programmer distributor relationship the increase in programmerdistributor conflicts is in large part the result of several structural changes in the video market that are affecting the relative negotiating strengths of the various parties and hence undermining preva iling business models and affecting the availability and pricing of video programming for consumers more distribution options the most significant structural change is the increase in the number of program distribution options today programme rs can distribute their product not only through traditional broadcast levision stations and cable operators but also through direct broadcast satellite operators and other satellite companies the newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34079crs10 22 these are companies that have been awar ded franchises by local franchising authorities and have built their own wireline networks in areas already served by an incumbent cable operator these overbuilders frequently offer broadband access service as well as cable service and often serve smaller geographic areas than the incumbent cable operator sometimes serving only highrise buildings 23 for example sinclair broadcast group executive reportedly has stated that as cable satellite and telephone companies all seek to dist ribute sinclairs broadcast signals sinclair has more bargaining power than it had in th past see joe morris cable wcha at odds broadcast dispute might go to court charleston gazette july 7 2006 at p 1c 24 this is greater concern for national programmer such as cable network or broadcast network than for local progra mmer such as local broadcast stationmultichannel video offerings of th major telephone companies cable overbuilders22 online video streams and even cellular telephones as result programmers have more options available to them to reach audiences and are able to negotiate with distributors from positi on of strength ofte n demanding terms conditions and rates that are more favorab to themselves and less favorable to distributors than those that have prevailed in the past23 the market implications are greatest for musthave programming such as major sports programming and the programming of the four major broadcast networks for which significant portion of subscribers have sufficiently strong intensity of demand that they consider carriage of that programming prerequisite for subscribing with an mvpd an mvpd that does not offer musthave programming may find itself at significant competitive disadvantage in the market by contrast the prevailing business model was developed and some of the programmerdistribut or contracts that are currently expiring were negotiated in the early and mid 1990s when cable operators typically were the monopoly mvpd in their service area and therefore had counterva iling market power when negotiating with programmers even programmers with musthave programming one group of distributors small and midsized cable companies has been placed in particularly difficult position by th is structural market change they often face direct competition from the two majo r satellite companies directv and dish network these cable companies have far fewer subscribers than the major satellite companies and thus when negotiating w ith programmers typically do not pose serious risk to the programmers if there is an impasse and the programming is not carried programmers foregone per subscr iber fees from the cable companies and foregone advertising revenues would not be substantia l by contrast programmers revenues could be significantly reduced if one of the satellite companies discontinued carriage since each of the satellite carri ers have more than 13 million subscribers24 moreover many of the smaller cable comp anies have limited or ability to offer telephone and broadband access services and therefore limited ability to offer bundled videotelephonebroadband services th at tend to foster customer retention even when favored programming is longer carried thus if an impasse were to occur smaller cable company would face significant risk of losing subscribers to satellite companies in fact where smaller cable company has had an impasse with programmer sometimes the programmer or satellite company that has retransmission agreement with the programmer and competes against the cable company has offered bounty of up to 200 to households to switch to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34079crs11 25 it is not always clear whether it is the sa tellite company or the programmer that is actually paying the customer to switch mvpd for example when sinclair broadcast group and mediacom communications were in an impasse in retransmission consent negotiations late in 2006 mike wilson the general manager of sinclairs fox 17 station in iowa issued statement to viewers stating in part that t he termination of our relationship with mediacom need not limit your ability to continue to wa tch us you may choose to subscribe to either directv or to the dish network both of which will continue to carry fox 17 we particularly encourage you to call directv because if you sign up with them prior to december 1 2006 and comply with certain requirements fox 17 will pay you 150 which will be applied as rebate against your directv bill which will be applied as fifteen 10 rebates against each of your first 15 mont hly directv bills the wilson statement is available at httpwwwlongrenorg20061030moreonmediacomvssinclair viewed on june 27 2007satellite service with these offers marketed over the programmers network while the programmercable company negotiations are still ongoing25 ironically the market consequence of greater competition in the distribution of video programming appears to be greater negotiating leverage for programmers with popular and especially

reach for example local broadcast stati on as explained below consolidation increases the leverage of cable system relative to national program networks while clustering increases the leverage of cable system relative to local broadcast stations negotiating with cable program network cable program networks get approxima tely half their revenues from per subscriber fees imposed on mv pds and half from advertising28 and those advertising fees depend on the number of subscribers reached so the more subscribers an mvpd reaches the more valuable that mvpd is to the program network cable program netw orks that fail to achieve substantial penetration on mvpd systems face financial peril in recent proceedings at the fcc parties have filed comments asserting that in order to generate the advertising revenues necessary for success national program network must reach between 40 and 60 million and perhaps as many as 75 million subscribers29 carriage on the major mvpd systems comcast time warner directv and dish network therefore is key to cable program network success cable network business stra tegies therefore focus on obtaining and retaining such carriage for new cable network that might involve giving one of the major mvpds an equity interest in exchange for carriage for an established cable network w ith strong brand identity that might involve creating sister network and demandi ng of mvpds carriage of the new network in lieu of cash for carriage of the established netw ork but even an established program network is unlikely to risk negotiating impasse that results in

carriage on each of the four largest mvpd systems the systems of the two largest cable operators as well as on the systems of the two major dbs operators31 as shown in table 1 subscriber reach falls quite quickly beyond those large mvpds wh ile cable program networks will seek carriage on all mvpds as the subscriber reach of the mvpd falls the financial risk to cable program network provider of fa iling to reach carriage arrangement with the mvpd falls this may make it easier for the cable network provider to push harder for high per subscriber fee from smaller mvpd from the perspective of small or midsized cable operator howev er failing to reach carriage arrangement for relatively popular cable program netw ork that is carried by directv andor dish network can be risky thus cab operators negotia ting position visavis cable network programmers will be strengthened by consolidation negotiating with national broadcast network when local broadcast station that is affiliated to broadcast network has assigned its retransmission consent rights to the network the negotiations between the network and the mvpds are likely to be somewhat akin to those between large cable programmers and mvpds with the national subscriber reach of the mvpd an important factor the major broadcas t networks own both multiple broadcast streams and cable networks and are likely to seek compensation in some combination of the mvpds carriage and tier placement of other program networks owned by the broadcaster the mvpds purchase of advertising time on the broadcast station the broadcaster being given free advertising time on the mvpds system and cash payments the broadcas t networks in offering the most popular programming enjoy an even stronger negotiating position than most cable program networks but even the major broadcast ne tworks are unlikely to want to risk an impasse with large mvpd that serves 10 million or more subscribers negotiating with local broadcast station or nonnetwork broadcast group the negotiating dynamic may be quite di fferent when broadcast station is conducting its own negotiati ons with mvpds which appears to be happening more often these days in this situation the broadcasters reach is limited to the local market in which its station is located or in the case of station that is part of non network broadcast group the local markets in which the group has stations its concern will not be with the total subscriber r each of the mvpds with which it is negotiating but rather with the subscriber reach of those mvpds within the local markets in which the group has stations db s operators are likely to offer service in many or all of those markets but an individual cable company even one as large as comcast or time warner

broadcasters are less likely to risk negotiating impasse with the clustered cable company and therefore likely to face constraints on the demands they can make for retransmission consent compensation charter communications ceo neil smit has stated that actions it has taken to increase the densities of its existing clusters have strengthened its position in retransmission consent negotiations making it more difficult for station groups to play hardball given that they would put greater portions of their ad revenues at stake32 one industry observer has described this negotiating situation as follows cable operators have more clout than telc and even dbs cable operators are big enough in major markets to take broadcaster dark in 6080 of local homes overnight that would guarantee immediate pain as major advertisers cancel but dbs operator might serve just 1020 of local homes so it can inflict far less pain telcos are in the weakest position33 more program networks fragmented audiences another major structural market change has been the dramatic expansion in the number of program networks sometimes referred to as channels available to consumers with resulting fall in average audience size per channel the number of video channels received by the av erage us household increased from 188 channels in 1985 to 1042 channels in 2006 but neither the number of television households nor the average household view ing time per day increased nearly so dramatically during that period34 thus the average audience size per program network has falle n substantially this proliferation in prog ram networks has had two ge neral market implications on the one hand the typical program networ k has an audience share of less than 1 and unless its programming has very strong

or with major programmer it will have to rely on the commercial leased access rules and pay to gain access to an mvpd35 on the other hand the relatively few pr ogram networks that attract larger audiences are valuable to mvpds for two reasons first program network that attracts larger audience is other things equal likely to have more viewers who might choose among competing mvpds based on the availability of that networks programming there is greater business risk to mvpds not to carry that program network second larger audiences tend to attract more advertis ing revenues for the mvpd according to kagan research in 2005 of the several hundr ed advertising supported cable networks only 8 receive d from mvpds average monthly license fees of 40 cents or more per subscriber only 24 received fees of 20 cents or more only 51 received fees of 10 cents or more and only 112 received fees of 2 cents or more36 clearly the current pricedriven programmerdistri butor impasses do not directly involve the vast majority of program ne tworks programmers cannot command significant price increases for them and in any case losing the right to carry such program network is unlikely to result in significant subscriber migration to competing mvpds some program networks how ever remain extremely valuable to mvpds and in fact in some ways network proliferati on has increased the value of these networks even if their audience share has shrunk over time although the major broadcast networks share of us levision household usage has fa llen substantially over time they continue to

television households are far more likely to switch mvpd providers if they fear the loss of particular time sensitive programming such as the super bowl the olympic games the national football league

into households tended to fall into one of two categories sports networks or ne ws networks that have unique demand characteristics44 audience fragmentation also appears to be affecting the relationship between the large broadcast networks and their affiliated broadcast stations traditionally under the networkaffiliate contracts the networks assumed the retransmission consent rights of their affiliates in exchange for making cash payments to the affiliates the broadcast networks then typically negotiated retransmission consent agreement in which the mvpds agreed to carry new or less popular cable program networks owned by the broa dcast networks for example msnbc or espn classic as partial compensation for carrying the br oadcast network recently the broadcast networks seem to be changing their business strategy giving back to their affiliate broadcast stations the right to negotiate retransmission consent compensation from mvpds in exchange for reducing or eliminating the cash payments they make to their affiliate stations according to report in multichannel newswire and during the past several years the big four networks have renegotiated affiliate deals to eventually eliminate oncelucrative network compensation fees paid to stations to carry programming from abc cbs fox and nbc perhaps not coincidentally those fees began to decline precipitously in 2005 right around the time that retransmission consent revenue for the affiliate stations began to rise for example in 2005 network compensation at hearst argyle fell 359 from 288 million to 191 million and dipped another 487 in 2006 to 98 million at nexstar network compensation dipped 224 in 2005 to 66 million and fell 364 to 42 million in 2006 at sinclair the dropoff was less dramatic 7 in 20 05 from 143 million to 133 million the company has not yet released 2006 network compensation but the station owner expects mo re dramatic declines in the coming years in its 2005 annual report sinclair even went so far as to say that retransmission consent fees have replaced the steady decline in revenues from television network compensation45 the trend toward greater program ne twork proliferati on and fragmented audiences is complicated by several signif icant technologicallydriven forces during the transition from analog to digital tec hnology programmers of both cable networks and broadcast

format and to carry their digital programming in high definition as well as standard format thus single program network now might seek multiple channels on an mvpd system to offer anal og digital and highdefinition feeds at the same time the deployment of digital technology is allowing broadcasters to provide multiple digital signals that is multiple video programs on their licensed spectrum not just single signal broadcaster that previously provided programming for one channel on an mvpd system now may seek multiple channels which depending on how the fcc ultimately implements the mustcarry and retransmission consent rules in multicast digital environment could result in larger portion of an mvpds system be ing set aside exclusively for broadcast program networks whether these technolog ical changes strengthen the negotiating positions of programmers or distributors may well depend almost entirely on how the fcc or congress adopts the mustcarry and retransmission consent rules for this new environment in the short run howev er to obtain carriage of multiple signals in their retransmission consent negotiations with mvpds broadcasters may have to compromise on other objectives ch as higher cash payments cable system revenue is growing from high speed internet access and telephone services most cable operators have upgraded th eir systems over the past decade and now are able to offer wide array of serv ices over their broadband networks including high speed data telephone nd digital video services as well as traditional analog video services the revenue base of the cab system operators is diversifying with fastest growth occurring in high speed data telephone and digital tier video services46 most subscribers who select these newer services purchase them as part of bundled package with basic cable servi ce this trend is helping cable operators in their negotiations with programmers in two ways first subscribers who purchase service bundles are less likely to switch to competing mvpd if their current provider were to lose carriage of pa rticular program network even popular network this is particularly the case if the competing mvpd cannot offer the full array of services that the cable company does for example satellite companies often cannot offer high speed data and telephone services at pr ice or uplink speed that is competitive with cable companies second if cable company is enjoying rapid revenue growth from nonvide services it may be more willing to hold the line in its negotiations with programmers because it is easier to absorb potential loss of video revenues stemming from an impasse and loss of program carriage when other revenues are growing on the other hand the revenues generated by these triple play offerings may allow cable company to pay more for programming there has been an interesting market response to the growth in cable system revenues from nonvideo services as these new revenue sources have increased the average revenue generated per subscrib ing household known in the industry as average revenue per unit or arpu the value of existing cable systems has grown and this has been reflected in the price

statutory and regulatory change the negotiations between programmers nd distributors although private are strongly affected by statutory and regu latory requirements nd cannot be properly characterized as freemarket those requirements were enacted to foster the three pillars of us media policy localism diversity of voices and competition congress tried to craft them in fashion that would minimize but not eliminate government intrusion in the market the specific public policy objectives they were intended to further include fostering local programming especially local broadcast programming foster ing diversity of news nd public affairs voices and entertainment choices fostering competition in all media markets encouraging innovative programming keeping cable and satellite subscription rates affordable and fostering infrastructure investment sometimes government intervention to foster one of these objectives will impede another it is possible that as market conditions have changed statutes or regulations that did not unduly favor one party over another when they were enacted or that were intended to favor party that was viewed as being in disadvantageous position

systems the tables are somewhat turned and broadcaste rs with musthave programming often can negotiate from position of strength pecially with cable systems whose subscribers do not represent significan t portion of broadcasters audience the earlier discussion of market trends showed there is great variability in the negotiating strength of both individual programmers and indi vidual distributors almost all impasses that resulted in mvpds not carrying particular programming occurred outside major markets despite the trend toward greater programmer negotiating strength in major markets dist ributors tend to have enough market clout to be able to reach agreements they can live with this is not the case in smaller markets in this new market environment it is possible that the one size fits all regulations currently in place may longer be fostering the public policy objectives they were intended to advan ce especially outside major markets most of the proposals for modification of the current statutory and regulatory framework have come from parties that operate in smaller markets in reviewing these proposals it is important to consider their potential impact on large markets as well as smaller markets and to try to determine whethe r any changes should and could be limited to those markets where the current statutory and regulatory framework may be failing to safeguard the public against lost programming or higher prices also it is important to note that the parties that ve been proposing statutory or regulatory changes often cite the combined impact of multiple rules for example the impact of retransmission consent and program exclusivity rules in markets where broadcaster owns multiple stations that are affiliated to two or more major broadcast networks would changing just one of the existing rules resolve alleged existing problems or create new ones would changing multiple rules represent overkill specific proposals to modi fy current statutes and regulations49 most of the federal statutes and regulations affecting programmerdistributor negotiations were enacted before the recen t structural market changes and indeed several were specifically intended to strengthen the negotiating position of broadcasters not surprisingly then most of the proposals to m odify current statutes and regulations have come from small distributors that are now in relatively weak negotiating position these proposals include revising the retransmission cons ent network nonduplication and syndicated exclusivity rules to allow mvpds to import
