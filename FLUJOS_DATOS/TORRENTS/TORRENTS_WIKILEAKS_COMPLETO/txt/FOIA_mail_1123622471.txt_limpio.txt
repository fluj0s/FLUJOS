from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to jtouarizonaedueysteinjansengeouibno subject section on last 2000years date tue aug 9 172111 2005 peck and eystein in case you tried my phone has been broken for the last few days yes honestly i am sorry i had to rush off and stay longer than i had anticipated the funeral was delayed while postmortem examination had to be held to establish the precise cause of death ironic that dad had struggled on having had at least 3 heart attacks 2 strokes chronic diabetes and partial liver and kidney failure for some years besides being virtually immobile and completely blind for 18 months all in all though it was release the actual demise was sudden and unexpected and i managed to arrive too late to be with him at the end given the time constraint this final revision is not as considered as it might have been but we have tried to take into account all comments available and have given considerable attention to the ipcc terminology and emphasis on the bullet points at this stage however there are some clear areas where future work will be required to keep abreast of recent developments and perhaps to rebalance the emphasis and structure i apologise for not having responded directly to fortunat stefan ricardoolga david and tom but please be aware that i have considered all of their comments and done what i could to address them thanks fortunat and ricardo and ed who should be added to the list of cas for the text and figures and henry and jason for the help and data davids suggestions about reordering the paragraphs was particularly difficult to resolve in my own mind because i do see the logic but equally did not want to interfere with the time line approach to describing post tar work that underlies the current structure as you can see i decided to leave the order as it was it would be great if david and fortunat could check cross chapter referencing eg in relation to forcings and detection chapters we can revisit this and the issue of mcintyre and mckitrick centering of pcs in mann et reconstruction which is clearly unfounded until such time as the numerous responses are published the new sh section is in and the mwp box slightly amended to take account of the new figure peck i have considered your text on the regional section and you will see that i have edited out some relating to future and association between drought and ssts i feel strongly that you are venturing into observational territory and speculation beyond what we should say i have also amended the bullet points to reflect this you are the ultimate arbiters and it is up to you if you wish to reinsert but i will give you continuing argument later about our overstepping the paleo boundary note also that the bullet on european summer 2004 has bee altered to reflect what was last minute onesentence insertion in the first paragraph regarding jurg lutterbachers science paper as there was mention of it otherwise we had to remove the reference to 700 years in france as i am not sure what this is and it is not in the text anyway the use of likely very likely and my additional fudge word unusual are all carefully chosen where used tim has been rock in the last minute rush here not only doing the figures but also helping with the text i am really grateful to him he has sent the text with some comments and highlighted references that need attention if oyvind can identify references and handle these problems with endnote we are also really grateful the final references if missing are probably in the current text the previous endnote library or in sections of text sent by ricardo fortunat peck and eystein i trust when you guys have stiched the new text back in and the figures etc we will perhaps get last chance to correct and check references etc thanks keith professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 1httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa references 1 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa
