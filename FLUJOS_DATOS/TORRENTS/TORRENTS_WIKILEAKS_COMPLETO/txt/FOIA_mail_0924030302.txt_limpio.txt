please get this to keith by fax or other means if he is unlikely to have received this at his own email while traveling its good piece overall as you might suspect i do have several comments ray and malcolm may send along few of their own malcolm in particular may want to comment on some of your points regarding dendroclmiatic series and our itrdb pc1 series which figures so prominently in our millennial reconstruction 1 page 2 top paragraph its is very misleading to make it sound as if we are strictly reconstructing northern hemisphere mean temperature and then say 4 of the records are actually from the southern hemisphere locations this is misleading for number of reasons first of all if one is going after true northern hemisphere areallyweighted mean temperature 090 degrees as we are then the southern hemisphere tropics are actually more relevant than the highlatitudes of the northern hemisphere careful diagnostics of surface temperature covariances by alexey kaplan mark cane and others have shown this clearly to be true but more than that we are reconstructing the full 20th century surface temperature domain shown in figure 1 of our 98 nature paper this is global domain albeit sparse outside the southern hemisphere tropicssubtropics particularly the southern oceans for obvious regions the proxy network roughly overlaps the spatial domain of surface temperature we are reconstructing ie compare nature 98 figure 1a and figure 1b we choose to diagnose from this spatial domain the northern hemisphere mean only because that is the hemisphere for which we can meaningfully talk about true hemispheric mean but both the predictor and predictand have global distribution without going on and on i think its clear why your comments here are bit unfair in how they represent why we use southern hemisphere data this is probably the most important point that needs to be revised here 2 page 2 2nd paragraph minor point but an important one it is incorrect to say the our uncertainties are based only on consideration goodnest of fitover the calibration period this is not correct key point is that the verification period 18541901 diagnostics though based on somewhat sparser distribution of gridpoint data from which nh mean temp can be estimated give very nearly identifical diagnostics in terms of unresolved reconstructed nh mean temp variance so our uncertainties are based both on 20th century calibration and independent confirmation from 19th century data please make sure this is clear on the bigger point being made here i agree w you in principle and this is point that phil has raised too what we dont take into account though i challenge anyone to really ever be able to take this into account is the unknown potential bias due to degradation from diminishing quality of the underlying proxy data back in time however on some of the specific points in that regard it is very likely not significant concern in our reconstructions we closely examined the spectra of the underlying proxy data to insure that those upon which our reconstruction ultimately relies have the amount of millennial scale trendvariability that would be expected for climatic series for at least the null hypothesis of red noise malcolm independently examined the tree ring chronologies underlying our itrdb pc 1 to verify that the standardization was appropriately conservative for millennialscale reconstruction furthermore malcolm verified that the itrdb pc 1 is made up of heavily replicated chronologies as far back as we use them so neither of the points you raise appear to be all that relevant to our reconstruction with regard to this point i have some issues with your figure that accompanies the piece it is quite ironic given your comments about the potential impacts of standardization on the longtimescale veriations for our millennial reconstruction we have verified as carefully as has ever been verified that the millennial scale trend is likely to be meaningful i dont think you have done so for the 2000 yearlong trend in the series you show and if you have not verified that it is likely to have retained 2000 year long trends it is very misleading to show this series along with the others i dont believe that it is likely to accurately represent the 2000 year long trend in northern hemisphere mean temperature as you imply by showing it here i think this series needs to be removed from the plot i have related comment below point 5 3 page 3 1st paragraph remove this is moot point and replace with more appropriate language it is not moot point because the problem you point out has largely been shown to apply to tree ring density data which you have largely been using and much less so tree ring width data which we are using furthermore the comparison only goes through 1980 at which point there is little evidence that there is significant declinde in tree ring width response although more evidence that there is already problem at that point with density data your criticism is not quite fair here and the statements should be revised to reflect more accurately on what we have done 4 page 3 2nd paragraph when you talk about proxybased enso reconstructions you should mention our nino3 reconstruction this is complementary to stahles soi reconstruction in number of ways the appropriate references here are both our nature 98 papers and the chapter in henry diazs latest book in the press mann bradley rs and hughes mk longterm variability in the nino southern oscillation and associated teleconnections diaz hf

there are problems with the 2000 year series in terms of your definition of the baseline for comparing with the other series and this differs quite bit from what we are likely to be showing in ipcc it appears that both the density nh reconstruction and your 2000 year long series fall at least 01c below the other series during the 20th century and are probably running at least that much too cold the whole way through also correct global temperature and nontemperature proxies in your description of our series to global climate proxies which is more honest way of describing them given our methodological approach and make sure it is clear to the readers which series are extratropical and warm season and which are full northern hemisphereannual mean estimates ours such discussion will again figure prominently in ipcc and it would be shame for science to be publishing something that is misleading in that respect in part it was this issue that forced the publication of followup to phils perspective by ray malcolm and phil year ago and it would be nice to avoid that scenario this time around _______________________________________________________________ thanks for your consideration of the above comments i believe your piece will make an excellent perspectives article for science once these comments are appropriately taken into account ill leave it to the science editor in charge to determine if that is the case best regards mike _______________________________________________________________________ michael mann
