division redacted assessment report id case 055804 18 april 2005 oios assessment mission report the risks for fraud and violations of the united na tions staff regulations and rules in the united nations tsunami disaster relief progr ammes in indonesia and sri lanka i introduction 1 this document reports on the assessment mission car ried out in jakarta and aceh province in the island of sumatra republic of indo nesia between 17 february and 2 march 2005 by the investigations division of the of fice of internal oversight services oios following discussions both actual and virtu with colleagues responsible for investigative activities in united nations agencies as to how we might jointly address the potential for fraud and corruption in what promises to be longterm project for the united nations the purpose of this mission was to assess the potential for fraud misconduct mismanagement abuse of authority wast of resources and other violations of the united nations regulations and rules with res pect to the resources and staff of the united nations and others and who are currently depl oyed and involved on behalf of the united nations in the tsunami disaster relief rehab ilitation and development programmes tdr it was not intended to be an inve stigation but was designed to provide means for estimating the potential opport unities for fraud and other abuses to occur for determining how complaints of wrongdoing can be made in the environment for ascertaining the critical persons and entities involved in tdr who are those who may be able to identify possible problems and to assist in solving them and finally for seeking local advice for preventive and response ac tions 2 this document reports on information that was colle cted and provides analysis of the information as well as descriptions of potentia l risk scenarios it also proposes recommendations as to how such risks can be mitigat ed or even avoided 3 oios had initiated early consultations in january 2 005 with agency investigative oversight offices notably undp unicef unhcr and w fp as well as the world bank and olafec to establish working group which would be able to consider how we might ensure appropriate investigative responses as required it was agreed that an assessment mission was needed and should be conduct ed as soon as possible so that necessary measures could be undertaken to prevent f raud and to detect it early where it does occur due to other commitments none of the other agencies oversight personnel who were invited were able to join the oios team f two investigators who undertook the mission nevertheless upon return the head of the team from oios provided briefings to interested agencies in both new york an d geneva the feedback from those sessions is incorporated into this report ii background 4 at approximately 800 am on 26 december 2004 an ea rthquake with magnitude of 9 on the richter scale struck in the indian ocea n the epicentre of the earthquake was off the north west tip of the island of sumatra it destroyed most of the city of banda aceh and its surrounding areas the aceh province nd killed an estimated 300000 people minutes after the earthquake witnesses st ated to the oios investigators the ocean emptied itself for about one kilometre from the coast and about fifteen minutes later succession of tsunami waves about five to six metres in height and travelling at over 600 kilometres an hour struck the land razin g everything and everyone in its path during the mission oios investigators were informed that indonesian authorities were still finding about 1000 bodies per day 5 the international community was quick to respond p ledging nearly us 1 billion in aid and services within month after the disast er the office for coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha estimates that the fina ncial and services requirements needed to restore the affected areas in the immedia future not including longterm development requirements is at least us 370 mill ion for indonesia alone 6 at the date of this report the relief work for foo d distribution temporary shelter medical services education services and other welf are requirements is well underway and united nations agencies ngos and governments op erating on bilateral arrangements with the republic of indonesia will b egin the rehabilitation phase this phase will include reconstruction of housing const ruction of replacement housing reconstruction of government facilities and provisi on of health education social and economic services to the affected communities cerns regarding fraud and corruption activities as result of the influx of funds have been raised to oios along with the role of the military and local police and whether they will be of assistance in addressing such concerns or detrimental iii legal basis of oios assessment missions paragraph 17 of stsgb273 of 7 september 1994 prov ides for oios to initiate activities designed to identify opportunities for f raud in the united nations in this regard paragraph 17 states activities of the office in the area of investigati on shall also focus on assessing the potential within programme areas for fraud and other violations through the analysis of systems of contr ol in highrisk operations as well as offices away from headquarter s on the basis of this analysis recommendations shall be made for co rrective action to minimize the risk of commission of such violations 7 assessments unlike reactive investigations are not initiated to accumulate evidence of wrongdoing but are designed to gather information which is then subjected to analysis based on experience for the purpose of trying to determine fraud risks in this case the assessment mission was designed to gather information which would indicate those risk factors for fraud which appeared more li kely to occur than not and which could negatively affect the united nations assessments c an provide programme managers with an opportunity to prevent fraud from occurring or to minimize the risk of occurrence and are therefore of value to the united nations s ystem iv methodology 8 as is usual investigative practice the assessment team conducted interviews of those with access to information relevant to assess the risk of fraud including staff of the secretariat the funds and programmes government fficials and nongovernmental organizations observations and the reviews of docu ments were also employed but to lesser extent 9 mission may be at risk of fraud for number of reasons often united nations funding and other resources are available and subj ect to fewer controls due to environmental factors such as lack of banking facil ities the need for urgent emergency measures and the relative inexperience of some staf f in the region in crises or in the united nations system 10 all of these factors and variables currently prevai l in aceh province most united nations staff ngo personnel and government officials with whom oios investigators spoke agree that united nations missions in indones ia are exposed to high degree of risk at this time 11 oios has developed six broad categories of activiti conducted throughout the united nations system that are subject to risk thes categories are procurement finance personnel assets and inventories managem ent and programme v risk assessment analysis and solutions procurement 12 procurement includes the majority of transactions i n which the united nations seeks to purchase goods or services it also includ situations in which the united nations arranges with nongovernmental organizations to implement projects 13 from interviews and observation oios has learned u nited nations procurement relating to the tsunami disaster in aceh province w ill have three main phases emergency reconstruction and rehabilitation and development while these three phases are on continuum with some overlap each has particular p rocurement conditions and needs for example the emergency phase necessitated procureme nts which were not done in accordance with standard procurement practices for items of immediate need such as tents the reconstruction and rehabilitation phase necessitates procurement for construction or rehabilitation of buildings and th development phase necessitates procurement for essential infrastructure such as ro ads and other public works these different phases also involve other institutions s uch as the world bank and the european union differing financial requirements present dif ferent transactional conditions for instance largescale infrastructure projects requi re governmental involvement while distribution of tents to dispossessed persons in id p camps may be implemented by an ngo risk exposure 14 oios investigators interviewed numerous people with extensive procurement experience in indonesia who advised that procuremen t there often includes illicit incentive payments such as 10 addon to the b id by contractors for payment of bribes to those who can facilitate project the united nations estimates that about us 207 million 1 is required to rehabilitate aceh province if c onservative estimate of 30 of that amount is expended on procurementrelat ed activities which includes 10 incentive payment surcharge there is exposure to theoretical loss of just over us 6 million 15 oios investigators found that goods and services p articularly at the low end of the market such as provisions of basic building ma terials basic mechanical repairs etc 1 the estimate cost was provided by ocha in the tsun ami flash appeal plan in indonesia are distributed through territorial supplier system supplier who belongs in one territory will not supply buyer even if th buyer is the united nations if that buyer happens to be located in the territory of ano ther supplier contractor must use only the subcontractors within certain group or territory even though others belonging to another group may be cheaper consequently whe n the united nations tries to procure goods andor services it may not be possib to find the necessary commercial diversity and numbers of regional suppliers or serv ice providers that it needs to capitalize on competition this brings another problem becaus of the lack of competition the united nations could receive bids and quotes which will seem to come from different bidders but which will be from the same bidder in order to protect the territorial supplier 16 in large infrastructure and building procurement ios investigators were told staff have noted in every one of their procurement actions collusion between the winning company and members of government andor other cont ractors these sources stated that when the collusion is with members of governme nt bribes are paid by the winning company and by those companies which receive subco ntracting work from the winning company sources also warned oios investigators th at if the united nations is to procure for infrastructure development it is to ex pect that the winning contractor will have colluded with other contractors to secure the bid on basis that it was the winning contractors turn to secure that bid moreover as part of the collusion the other contractors will have been guaranteed to receive so of the subcontract works these sources also stated that because the bid will have been colluded it will inevitably include at least 10 above and over what the real price wou ld have been for incentive payments 17 project financing involving water sanitation and shelter construction is also reported to be subject to bribery for example oi was informed of pricing scheme involving housing projects project by an ngo for the construction of 240 houses in the nias area of north sumatra was priced at us300 0 for 36 square meter house while government project for the construction of 58000 of the same size houses in the aceh area was priced at us700 per square meter for materials alone raising the pric per house to us25000 just for materials 18 oios investigators received information that govern ment bodies and local ngos are approaching united nations agencies as well as f oreign aid governmental agencies such as the ngo 1 ngo 2 ngo 3 for funding to rebuil d refurbish and reequip their banda aceh offices while these government bodies and local ngos may well have lost everything to the tsunami including their building s requests have been made for the same items to many agencies without coordinatin g oversight body these governmental bodies and local ngos may obtain excess office space and up to four times their equipment requirements including motor vehic for resale 19 those knowledgeable about procurement practices in indonesia have recommended to the oios investigators that an agenc ys close involvement with specific community is essential to decrease fraud because their experience suggests that the local community leaders want to ensure that the ir community receives all the supplies services and funds to which it is entitle d so that the expected and greatly needed rebuilding can occur risk mitigation 20 the first step in risk mitigation in the procuremen t area is that the united nations in consideration of the 10 that contractors may ad d onto their bids for incentive payment is to scrutinize bids closely and to comp are prices both with other agencies and with the local community although united nation s agencies have evaluation and verification procedures which are designed to ensur that services andor goods are delivered as specified and in timely manner by ut ilizing progressive payment systems and proper receipt and inspection procedures these postaward procedures usually are concerned with contract issues not prevention of f raud as such greater degree of pre award scrutiny especially for emergency and other n onbid procurement activities will be required 21 additionally to the extent possible agencies shou ld coordinate procurements to take advantage of economies of scale and to obtain best prices contractors need to be put on notice that the united nations will not accep t such corrupt practices and is ready to try new tactics to prevent them including procu ring goods and services outside the region 22 for those projects involving construction or major rehabilitation the united nations agencies should not only consult on common p urchases but also develop realistic base price and then ask for proposals fro m bidders to meet this price meeting quality assurance standards the supplier who subm its the bid closest to the united nations base price could then be selected in some co nfidence that the united nations has sought to protect its resources and obtain the best price specialist may need to be hired to evaluate realistic price for some of the most substantial procurements when in house expertise exists possibly with the help of t he beneficiary community this would obviously be different way of doing business from the norm and may be subject to consideration by the agency legal advisors and ola 23 the next step in risk mitigation in the procurement area is to eliminate middlemen the more layers of transactions the gr eater the risk that the goods can be diverted funds expended for other than intended pu rposes and inferior goods provided if possible the united nations should attempt to directly with its targeted beneficiaryclient community for example in pr oject involving the distribution of hygiene kits it may be preferable to seek the assi stance of community leader to select member of the community to distribute the kits in clean water project the agencies could use community leaders to procure water sourci ng and drilling with the assistance of unrelated technical expert 24 the next step is to give ample advance notice of in tended projects particularly in the second phase so that the beneficiary community and potential contractors have time to ascertain the real needs and obtain realistic understanding of the cost involved the goal is to utilize the collective input of the bene ficiary community to prepare realistic estimates that are not so low that the projects va lue is jeopardized or so high that incentive payments as described above are built into bids in addition knowledge of what united nations agencies intend to provide crea tes policing role by the beneficiary community which will demand what is promised and will create true competition amongst the contractors making the procurement exe rcise more transparent 25 finally contractors need to be told clearly that t he united nations will not tolerate fraud and corruption even when bids are requested for local procurements under us1000 upon acceptance of quote all contracto rs should be notified of the results of the bidding exercise along with statement that i f at any time collusion between bidders is found or false paper work is found such fraud w ill be reported to local authorities for prosecution and the firm will be debarred from futu re contracts b personnel risk exposure 26 the aceh province is muslim community alcohol co nsumption and sexual promiscuity are not tolerated these are potential problem areas which could cause international incidents 27 since the tsunami disaster united nations agencies have been hiring local staff and engaging the services of ngos on an expedited ba sis as result there is neither the time nor the resources to adequately verify the bac kground or bona fides which could allow for the infiltration of terrorists and others with agendas different from that of the united nations oios investigators also received re ports that some local staff have engaged in the practice of referring other locals f or employment but demanding kickback from the person referred 28 several agencies have been permitting use of their logos by ngos and implementing andor operational partners consequ ently any misconduct or other problem such as traffic accident could be attri buted to the united nations rather than the ngo or the implementing or operational partner displaying the agency logo this was suggested by several persons as potentially har mful to the reputation of the united nations further the logo unless carefully distribu ted could be used for private gain risk mitigation 29 the united nations needs is to establish early on s it has in other missions either that alcohol will be allowed at all or t hat it will be allowed in limited quantities in restricted united nations areas pursuant to ho st country agreement 30 additionally in this culture it is especially imp ortant that strict adherence to the ban on sexual abuse and exploitation be reenforced and training on dealing with the local population is provided to all and be site specific 31 all united nations agencies in aceh province sho uld use common and uniform recruitment policy and vetting system single da tabase with information on local staff employees and applicants would create economies of human resources and prevent inconsistencies in hiring practices that could lead to allegations of unfairness and discrimination 32 all local staff hired should be subject to prob ation for period of time so managers can assure their integrity and competency 33 staff should be notified that the payment of re ferral fees is violation of united nations staff rules and regulations to insure that all staff and especially potential local staff are aware of the rules and the conseque nces of their violation local and national staff should complete an integrity questio nnaire designed to identify relationships and to verify knowledge of the rules 34 united nations agencies should have common dat abase for ngos newly created ngos in addition to the usual duediligence verification requirements eg financial records registration documents staff li sts references history of delivery etc should be asked to produce sample documentation suc h as proposals and terms of reference under the supervision of manager ngos should also be involved in an interactive exercise concerning united nations expec tations of integrity to ensure that the standards are understood 35 agencies should submit list of ngos presently and prospectively engaged to the financial company for verification of their bon fides as part of the pro bono activities for the united nations 36 concerning use of united nations identification by ngos and implementing or operational partners the office of legal affairs ola should issue an opinion on the inappropriateness of this practice agencies should retrieve their logos agencies should provide ola with list of entities which refuse to return their logos and ola should formally advise these entities to cease using the l ogos and that the united nations is not responsible for any mishaps by these entities c staff security risk exposure 37 currently the security threat to the united nati ons in aceh province is low according to united nations department of safety an d security undss most united nations agencies have their own premises which are 80 mos minimum operative security compliant because of the conflict betwe the local group and the indonesian military the international community mu st comply with curfew laws and united nations convoys are not permitted to travel at night three world food programme wfp convoys escorted by the indonesian military reportedly have been caught in skirmishes between the local group and th indonesian military 38 oios investigators were also able to develop in formation on risks to staff security as united nations staff move from their p rotected common areas and immerse themselves in local life particularly since there is local bias against the united nations see the section on programmatic matters their differe nces will be noted and individuals possibly targeted given that there have been terro rist attacks in bali and against the australian embassy in indonesia that terrorists wi th international links have been convicted in indonesia for such acts and that the united nations has become target of terrorist acts it is not unreasonable to assess th at the security threat to united nations staff and its buildings although low at the moment could increase with little or notice local police may not be willing or able to assist for variety of reasons including political pressures lack of training and dependen ce on the military 39 oios investigators were advised that representa tives of groups who have record of activity in international terrorism by action ndor sympathy are active in aceh province with respect to staff security it was n oted that the united nations agencies in banda aceh united nations development programme und p united nations childrens fund unicef united nations high commi ssion for refugees unhcr united nations fund for population activities unfpa united nations human settlements programme unhabitat and wfp and soo n undss maintain their own separate facilities many without security pe rimeter after the bombing at the facilities in baghdad such practice should not hav been allowed even for short periods of time security lapses permit those who would be inclined to plan harm against the united nations to hold an operational advantage for surveillance planning and target selection moreover with these agencies being phy sically separated it is difficult to coordinate united nations policy and information t organize rapid evacuation programme and to maintain confidentiality of inform ation when needed different communication devices also militate against good curity practice 40 an additional risk posed by the separate housin g of the united nations agencies is that each needs its own agencyspecific security this is problematic because there are different levels of training for security officers loyalty is to the specific agency rather than to the united nations officers consider the s ecurity needs of their agency rather than that of the united nations as whole and in general there is little experience in sophisticated security measures again the lack of overall professional coordination in security gives operational advantage to those who w ish to harm the united nations and raises the risks to the united nations 41 one representative of one united nations agency expressed the view to oios investigators that colocation may be more dangerou s to staff than the fragmented situation as it exists in banda aceh currently in explaining this theory the representative stated that if terrorist were to hit any of the gencies fewer people would be killed than if the terrorist hit the united nations building tha t would house the entire united nations staff risk mitigation 42 first all united nations agencies in aceh provi nce should be housed in one limited area in order to better protect staff to m aintain secure perimeter and to reduce any operational advantage of groups hostile to the united nations second security should be coordinated solely by undss rather than b individual agencies so the overall safety of staff is protected and threat ass essment information gathering can be conducted in more sophisticated and professional manner under centralized system information can be synchronized information can be shared confidential sources can be properly assessed vetted and registered and threa ts identified prioritized and analyzed the united nations dss must take leadership role i n this area 43 additionally interpol may be able to provide dditional expertise and assistance d united nations regulations and rules risk exposure 44 regulations and rules can provide procedural solutions to range of everyday problems that arise in the field oios in vestigators found that managers and staff in the aceh province had an underdeveloped u nderstanding or knowledge of them in addition these avoidable misinterpretations som etimes lead to inconsistent actions by managers which in turn can lead to lengthy or dela yed administrative action opportunities for misconduct and greater fraud risk s to the organization risk mitigation 45 it would be beneficial to train managers on the applicable procedures in their areas of responsibility and hold them accountable f or them and for endorsing exceptions to them also the current versions of the regulati ons and rules as well as other instructions particularly those related to procure ment and finance should be electronically accessible where possible and in har d copy for ease of local reference finance risk exposure 46 banking facilities were unavailable in aceh pro vince due to the tsunami obviously creating risk in the field of finance lthough banking facilities have now been reestablished and are functioning in banda aceh critical risk exposure is the continuing need by united nations agencies to transport cash often large sums to remote locations in order to pay salaries of personnel who work ther the finance officers who deliver the cash often through inexperience use official radio channels which can be accessed by the public to organize transport and therefore inadvertently provide details of route and destination 47 lack of experience by some finance officers as well as certifying and approving officers can create additional risks risk mitigation 48 all united nations agencies in aceh province sho uld place their cash reserves in banks as soon as possible 49 united nations agencies need to limit as far as possible situations in which united nations staff transport cash local banks sh ould be asked to transport cash to areas where it is to be distributed then any s through theft or ambush would be the responsibility of the bank when united nations st aff must transport cash an escort programme arranged by united nations dss should be d eveloped on an expedited basis 50 consideration should be given to greater coordi nation of finance activities by the united nations agencies to ensure greater availabili ty of trained personnel f assestsinventories risk exposure 51 at this point the assets and inventories of th united nations in aceh province are subject to unnecessary accumulation duplicatio n and amassing of resources which is inefficient and wasteful for example 1 every ag ency has its own premises security generators and car fleets 2 agency radio networks are incompatible with those of other agencies 3 procurement of generic goods and servi ces such as building materials stationary fuel and computing services cleaning painting etc is at the agency level 4 procurement of air transport is at the agency level and 5 leasing of properties is at the agency level and if united nations agencies bid for the same properties prices are artificially inflated some united nations agencies have entered into 12 month leases for properties which are structurally unstable particu larly problem since earthquake tremors at significant levels continue 52 with respect to fuel oios investigators observ ed that this is an area of both small and major risk from the street vendors who s ell black market fuel from the roadside to the pilfering of considerable quantitie s of fuel for resale to local businesses as every agency has its own system of recording l use it is difficult to control or even to assess if unowned fuel is being stolen other risks appear to be the theft of building materials from insecure sites the misuse of local day labor for personal matters and the variations in inventory tracking practices in the gencies risk mitigation 53 situating all united nations agencies in comm on area and coordinating procurement of goods and services would mitigate th risk of waste of resources for example common secured warehouse and common cured vehicle repair and housing area could be better protected than small i solated locations in addition this would also permit other risk mitigation measures s uch as theft of fuel by coloring it which makes it easily identifiable as united nation s property and limiting use of united nations materials and locallyengaged staff for pr ivate purpose g programmatic matters risk exposure 54 while every united nations agency in the aceh rea has rehabilitation programme this report does not focus on the indivi dual programmes but on the risk to rehabilitation programmes as whole presently ited nations presence is accepted and welcomed but that may change to resentment caused by ideologicalreligious differences as discussed supra the indigenous muslim community finds some practi ces of united nations staff such as use of alcohol and casual attitudes disrespectful and abhorrent information was received that present in aceh province are representatives of militant religious groups who are mingling with the international community covertly filming humanitarian activity with the intent of po rtraying it as christianwestern encroachment on local religious ideology it is li kely that the presence and activities of these groups will increase in addition there are currently christian ngos operating in the aceh province whose goal includes proselytizing the local population who may find it difficult to differentiate between these groups and united nations staff risk mitigation 55 the risk to programmatic matters is that the hu manitarian efforts of the united nations may be portrayed to the local population by religious militants as attempts to christianize westernize and democratize to prot ect the reputation and viability of the united nations and its programmes in this region em phasis must be on the united nations speedy and effective efforts to fulfill bas ic human needs after this disaster and its humanitarian nonpartisan nature and character of its programmes ngos which work with the united nations should be cautioned abo ut their activities vi fraud and corruption reporting risk exposure 56 there is fraud andor corruption prevention reporting system to deal professionally and rapidly in the region with poten tial or actual violations of united nations regulations and staff rules although most m anagers from the different agencies oios spoke to claimed that they had some r eporting system most as described by managers are ad hoc in some cases agency man agers believe that because the operational manager is under obligation to report c omplaints to its headquarters such obligation functions as reporting system none of the mechanisms described to oios investigators had the necessary features that mod ern transparent and proactive system require in order to safeguard the united nations and its staff against the risk either that unfair allegations would go unredressed or that ser ious wrongdoing would not be exposed and wrongdoers held accountable clearly the united nations cannot afford to allow this to continue risk mitigation 57 it is recommended that the united nations agenci in aceh province have central and professional fraud and corruption preve ntion centre fcpc managers and staff should be notified of the fcpc and informed t hat matters reported will be treated expeditiously and confidentially those staffing th fcpc also can provide advice on procedures to deal with fraud corruption and other violations of the rules and regulations oios has found that this type of preve ntive collection system serves as repository for information that may be analyzed and used to detect trends and patterns of emerging problems thus preventing problems before they arise or mitigating their occurrence 58 within the fcpc there should be an ethics hot l ine to facilitate the reporting of fraud abuse of authority waste mismanagement or violations of the code of conduct for united nations staff the hotline should have three components telephone line web based complaint system and case management syste m since many of the funds and programmes operating in the area already have inter net communications capability digital hotline would take advantage of this and pr ovide significant economies of scale some of the benefits of digital hot line include the following 1 receiving and storing large numbers of complaints f rom whistleblowers or informants who want to remain anonymous providin g facility for informants to identify themselves if they want 2 rapid notification to officials of the fcpc when complaint is received 3 supporting an online dialogue with whistleblower and several officials of an entity who are in different time zones thru the capabilities of online web communications 4 capacity to immediately classify the types of compl aints received ie thefts abuse of power harassment failure to perform duti etc ability to quickly customize the category of complaints to adjust to c hanging needs 5 ability for informant to log in anonymously and t rack progress on hisher case 6 maintaining case log of investigation of compla int that is keyed to the original complaint ability to record the disposi tion of that case such as actions taken against the staff member and whether assets were recovered 7 quick generation of reports on the complaints that are received and ability to customize reports 8 details of specific case that was reported 9 summary of complaints by geographical area by or ganization by type of complaint by date 10 ability to quickly generate reports on cases on an regular schedule and distribute those reports to officials within an org anization 59 vendors who provide the services of establishin g and managing both telephone and digital hotlines for organizations should be ap proached to determine if the cost is reasonable in comparison to the benefits of having an automated complaint reporting system that would complement the efforts of investi gators in the fcpc in the meantime the establishment of the fcpc is an urgent requirem ent 60 additionally interpol maintains database of information on known criminal enterprises and could be approached to provide advi ce information and assistance regarding persons and businesses in the region mor eover their contacts with and reputation among police agencies may well serve the interests of the relief programme by providing liaison assistance in cases of fraud and corruption referred to them vii conclusions 61 there is perception in the international comm unity that fraud and corruption are endemic in indonesia even indonesians in law enfo rcement whilst they do not condone it agree that fraud and corruption are accepted however indonesia is signatory to the convention on anticorruption and the perceptio n by indonesians and members of the international community working there that fraud an d corruption are inevitable is unacceptable and must be changed the risks identif ied and analyzed in this report in the areas of procurement personnel management assets and programmatic matters point to the need of addressing and investigating these risk s through appropriate procedures and using experienced professionals 62 first the undss must take an immediate and acti ve role in security for all agencies the agencies security coordination shoul d be primary and include being housed in discrete area in order to coordinate curity as well as other activities second ocha should coordinate efforts of united nat ions agencies ngos and governments to maximize efficient use of resources and procurement activities to rehabilitate life in the aceh province third p rofessional and central fraud and corruption prevention reporting system should be tablished which can professionally and expeditiously analyze and act on information an d note trends for early warning purposes fourth the united nations should have proactive approach to risks anticipating and confronting potential problems ra ther than waiting for scandal to occur viii recommendations 63 oios has provided number of suggestions for r isk mitigation in each area considered of these oios believes the following c rucial recommendations need to be emphasized and acted upon early recommendation 1 it is recommended that dss be actively involved i n assessing security risks and implementing necessary measures including staff training and emergency evacuation planning on an ongoing basis to protect the work of the agencies and the safety of united nations staff and that dss be given final decision making authority on security matters including housing an d office locations id rec iv0455801 recommendation 2 it is recommended that ocha arrange to coordinate procurement activities and establish mechanisms as those descri bed in this report to avoid losses due to fraud and corruption id rec iv0455802 recommendation 3 it is recommended that professional fraud and co rruption prevention centre fcpc be established risks moni tored information shared and cases that are reported be investigated immediately ando r referred to the various agencies with the assistance of interpol as necessary and appropr iate id rec iv0455803 recommendation 4 it is recommended that the dpa in consultation wi th ola consider how best to explain the role that the united nation s is undertaking and to ensure that it is well understood that the united nations does not as sociate itself with any proselytizing activities of any ngo id rec iv0455804 recommendation 5 it is recommended that information regarding funds disbursed to implementing or operational partners be coordinated through ocha and passed on to pwc to be incorporated into their financial trackin g system id rec iv0455805 recommendation 6 it is recommended that staff assigned to the regio n be given training on working in the region so as to avoid misundersta ndings regarding cultural differences and to better ensure their own security id rec n iv0455806
