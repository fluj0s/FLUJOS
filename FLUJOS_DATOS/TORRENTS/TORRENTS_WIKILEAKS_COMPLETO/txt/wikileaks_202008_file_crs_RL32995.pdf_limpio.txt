immediately stimulated speculation about the impact of her leaving the court and of her replacement by nominee of president george w bush speculation that has only grown in the da ys since justice oconnor has for years been perceived as swing vote in the center of the court and the key to the creation of majorities in many of the most contentious issues that have reach the court while this perception may not be wholly accurate in large part it does reflect picture picture that helps enable interested parties to assemble helpful assessment of her role and the parts of it that could be changed by successor of markedly different philosophy of judging and interpretation in this report we identify signifi cant number of opinions authored by justice oconnor opinions of the court concurrences and dissents as well as opinions of others that she joined or dissent ed from which may be useful in evaluating possible areas of future change in the courts jurisprudence justice oconnor began serving as asso ciate justice in 1981 and she has written thousands of opinions and joined many thousa nds more that have been written by other justices obviously our selection can c over only portion of the opinions she has authored selection that we have arranged by general categ ories although we refer from time to time to her position with respect to an opinion that she did not write we have not attempted to be comprehensive while we are aware that numerous stories in the press opinion pieces on weblogs and other assessmen ts have discussed her opinions and the various issues covered

therein church state lynch v donnelly 465 us 668 1984 in this her first religion case justice oconnor wrote an important concurrence ar guing for the displacement of the reigning but often disparaged test for determining violations of the establishment clause the so called lemon test the justice advocated the use of an endorsement test that is the establishment clause is violated if the gove rnment intended its acti on either to endorse or disapprove of religion or of one religion as against another so as to create classes of citizens on the basis of religi on this case upheld the di splay of creche on public property during the christmas season and the 5 to4 court relied heavily on the inclusionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32995crs2 in the display of several secular items the socalled plastic reindeer motif her test has been influential and has been used by th court although it has never been formally adopted as the accepted test see also county of allegheny v aclu greater

mccreary county v aclu of kentucky 125 sct 2722 2005 van orden v perry 125 sct 2854 2005 in this her fina l churchstate case before she retired justice oconnor joined in making 5to4 majority to hold mccreary that the display of ten commandments plaque in the hall ways of two courthouses violated the establishment clause becaus it was evident that the county commissioners intended to endorse and foster particular religion by the displays the court also recurred to the lemon test and that subsequent additions to the displays did not remove the taint in her concurrence she revisited he r endorsement test and the reasons she thought it served society best by different 5to4 majo rity without majority opinion the court sustained the display of the ten commandments among numerous monuments and displays on the texas statehouse grounds in austin justice oconnor dissented simply pointing to her mccready concurrence lee v weisman 505 us 577 1992 santa fe independent school district v doe 530 us 290 2000 justice oconnor joined the court well after the invalidation of officially composed prayers in the public school but she did join the majority in these two cases without writing separately finding an establishment clause violation in the inclusion of clergyled prayer s at public school graduation lee and at public school football games santa fe wallace v jaffree 472 us 38 1985 the court held that statutory provision for moment of silence each day in the public sc hools of the state violat ed the establishment clause because the record showed that it was enacted solely to officially encourage prayer during the moment of silence justice oc onnor did not join the opinion of the court but she did submit concurrence that agreed fully with the court except that she also dwelt on her endorsement test elk grove unified school district v newdow 124 sct 2301 2004 the court did not reach the merits of this case in whic h was challenged the po licy of california public schools to have the pledge of allegiance including the words under god recited in class each day finding that the plainti ff lacked standing justice oconnor in concurrence did not agree with the standi ng resolution but on the merits would have found establishment clause violation usin g her endorsement test to formulate her analysis agostini v felton 521 us 203 1997 in the 1970s and 1980s the court drew fairly hard line with respect to public funds going to religious schools and other religious institutions in many of these cases justi ce oconnor either disse nted or entered limited concurrences the movement in recent ears has been toward judicial acceptance of many programs in which public moneys could be spent in religious settings in this case justice oconnor writing for the majority either limited earlier cases or in some instances overruled them the decision pproved program unde r which public schoolhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32995crs3 employees provided instructional services on parochial school premis to educationally deprived children zelman v simmonsharris 536 us 639 2002 mitchell v helms 530 us 793 2000 these two cases substantially expa nd the opening for governmental provision of financial assistance to re ligious schools building on agostini the courts opinion in zelman finds that so long as assistance is provi ded to parents and so long as they freely choose where to send their children to school the fact that great amount of the money provided through vouchers goes to religious schools does not conde mn the program under the establishment clause justice oc onnor joined the opinion of the court and submitted concurrence that explored some of the legal issues involved helms involved federal program that channels money through state agencies to local educational agencies which lend educational materials nd equipment such as library and media materials and computer softwa re to public and private elem entary and secondary schools to implement secular neutra l and nonideological progra ms the plurality in upholding the program would have remove d many of the restraints on the use of public moneys but justice oconnors concurren ce disagreed with the plurality in several respects and reiterated that money must be given indirectly and not be diverted to religious uses goldman v weinberger 475 us 503 1986 the court sustained the application of military regulation denying the petiti oner an orthodox jewish officer the opportunity to wear yarmulke while he wa s in uniform and on duty justice oconnor dissented arguing that the free exercise of religion clause required the court to scrutinize the governmental need for the policy and balance it against goldmans interests and she further argued that the government should accommodate goldmans in terests congress by statute subsequently changed the policy permitting wearing of the yarmulka employment division oregon dept of human resources v smith 494 us 872 1990 in case challenging the dismissa l of two native american employees because they used peyote as sacrament in their church the court withdrew from the principle of whole line of cases though not from the results in many of them under which government was required to exempt persons from the application of general laws that incidentally forbid or require the performance of an act that their religious beliefs require or forbid only laws that ban or require acts solely because of the religious beliefs of the actors violate the free ex ercise clause justice oconnor concurred in the result because she thought it comported with precedent but she rejected the courts departure from wellsettled line of precedent requiring acco mmodation of religious beliefs in city of boerne v flores 521 us 507 1997 the court held unconstitutional as applied to the states the religious freedom restoration act law smith had prompted congress to pass justice oconnor dissented although sh agreed that if rfra were truly before them it should be held unconstitutiona l but stressing she still thought smith was wrongly decided and ought to be reconsidered and overruled federalism new york v united states 505 us 144 1992 this case is one of the earliest in which the court asserted the federalism principle as measure of protection of the states from the exercise of federal power the court sometimes has cited the tenth amendment as the embodiment of this princi ple for the court justice oconnor found that federal imposition of obligations on th states respecting nuclearwaste disposalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32995crs4 constituted commandeering of state resources for federal purposes the case has been either asserted or followed number of times notably in the striking down of the imposition of duties on state and local fficials under the brady handgun law printz v united states 521 us 898 1997 justice oconnor briefly concurred united states v lopez 514 us 549 1995 united states v morrison 529 us 598 2000 in these cases 5to4 court struck down two federal statutes law prohibiting the possession of firearm with in 1000 feet of school and provision of the violence against women act that created civil cause of action by abused individuals against private parties as exceeding congress commerce clause powers the court essentially held that with respect to intrastate acts that were noneconomic it was impermissible to aggregate class of individual acts in order to establish substantial effect on interstate commerce justice connor joined both opinions for the court but also joined justice kennedys concurrence which to some extent limited the scope of the two decisions these cases were second venture in attempting to cabin congress commerce powers after national league of cities v usery 426 us 833 1976holding congress could not apply federal wage and hour ws to the states in areas of traditional governmental functions was overruled 5to4 in garcia v san antonio metropolitan transit authority 469 us 528 1985 justice oc onnor submitted strong dissent in garcia asserting her belief that this court will in time again assume its constitutional responsibility gonzales v raich 125 sct 2195 2005 the court drew back from its federalism limitations on congress commerce powers in this case holding that congress had validly enacted drug laws that applied to intr astate noncommercial cultivation exchange possession and use of marijuana by persons w ith doctors prescription for the drug in order to ameliorate the pain of serious diseases justice oconnor filed lengthy dissent arguing that principles of federalism and com ity for state decisions respecting the practice of medicine made the unlimited reach of federal drug laws as interpreted by the court unacceptable kimel v florida board of regents 528 us 62 2000 board of trustees of the university of alabama v garrett 531 us 356 2001 nevada dept of human resources v hibbs 538 us 721 2003 tennessee v lane 541 us 509 2004 these cases reflect simultaneously an arcane area of federal judicial jurisdiction and federalism concerns that seek to articulate delineation between national and state powers the eleventh amendment as construed by the court limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts and it seem s of the state courts over the states and the power of congress to use its powers to abrogate state immunity congress may not abrogate pursuant to its article i powers but it can under its power to enforce the fourteenth amendment however the court has over the last few years imposed tougher and tougher burdens on congress exerci of its power to abrogate kimel and garrett struck down attempted abrogations unde r age discrimination and disa bility discrimination laws but the latter two cases sustained abroga tion under the family and medical leave act on the theory that it prevented sex disc rimination and under th disability law with respect to the fundamental right of access to the courts the sign ificance of these cases is that justice oconnor was the only justice who was in the majority in all four cases creating problems of defining consistency although one can reconcile them justice oconnor contributed the opinion in kimel which spells out much of her construction of the opposing powers here httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32995crs5 south dakota v dole 483 us 203 1987 the court upheld the validity of restriction congress placed on fe deral highway funds that is the states must impose and enforce drinking age of 21 the court appl ying long line of precedents sustained this exercise of power and set out an understanding of the limitati ons on this power justice oconnor dissented not disagreeing much w ith the courts understanding of the power to condition funds but on the basis that fixing the drinking age is power reserved to the states by 2 of the twentyfirst amendm ent the provision that repealed national prohibition abortion planned parenthood of southeaste rn pennsylvania v casey 505 us 833 1992 the justice had dissented from earlier elaborati ons of and expansions of abortion rights and when this case arrived at the court it was commonly assumed that there were sufficient votes to overrule roe v wade 410 us 113 1973 instead justice oconnor justice kennedy and justice souter formed threejustice plurality and jointly authored an opinion that purported to re tain the core holding of roe actually in number of respects the opinion joined with that of dissenters modified in several respects roes approach to and impact on state restric tions on access to abortion the plurality dispensed with the fundamental rights appro ach requiring strict scrutiny of state laws and policies and instead it dopted the undue burden appr oach advocated in previous oconnor dissents the test is more flexible th an the standard previously in effect for instance the court struck down requirement that woman desiring an abortion notify her husband before having it but it sustained state law imposing mandatory waiting period between the time the woman applies for an abortion and the time she actually receives it see also webster v reproductive health services 492 us 490 1989 but the plurality also significantly modified jurisdictional rule that made the litigation of the validity of abortion rest rictions easier in united states v salerno 481 us 739 1988 the court established the principle that facial challenges to the constitutionality of laws could proceed only if under conceivable set of circumstances could the law be applied in valid way most such litigation must therefore be brought on an as applied basis which means that each person affected by law must bring separate suit instead the plurality provided that facial challenges could be brought to abortion restrictions under the undue burden test as long as the restri ction would affect significant minority of people stenberg v carhart 530 us 914 2000 th most r ecent abortion case to be decided by the court held invalid state law criminalizing partialbirth abortion method under which the fetus woul d be partially delivered into the vaginal tract and then aborted method used generally but not exclus ively in thirdtrimester abortions justice oconnor joined the 5to4 majority and also submitted concurrence of her own in which she reiterated the majority rationale that the law in its definition included earlier term abortions and that while it contained lifeendanger ment exception for the woman it contained health exception for her it should be noted that one of the casey plurality justice kennedy was in dissent in this case contending the standard there adopted did not condemn this law cong ress has since enacted national law barring such abortions and the law is in litigation rust v sullivan 500 us 173 1991 before the court were regulations implementing federal statute the w provided that federallyfunded familyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32995crs6 planning services could be used in prog ram in which abortions were method of family planning the regulations prohibited familyplanning clinics from engaging in counseling referrals for and activities advocating abortion as method of family planning 5to4 court held that the regu lations were permissi ble construction of the statute and as so construed we re constitutional justice connor dissented in separate opinion and joined part of nother dissent she did not reach the constitutional issue but she contended that the regulations di d not faithfully construe the statute affirmative action city of richmond v j croson co 488 us 469 1989 the justices position on affirmative action has been generally nuanced but restric tive but all her opinions do not point in the same direction in this cas in which she authored the opinion of the court she wrote that affirmative action for minorities was valid if narrowly tailored to correct demonstrable wrong but she voted to invalidate the particular plan city set aside of fixed percentage of public contr acts for minority businesses in the absence of an identifiable wrong adarand constructors inc v pena 515 us 200 1995 justice oconnor also wrote the opinion for 5to4 court in this case except that the justices in the majority were not entirely in agreement with each other at issue in the case was federal policy that awarded highway construction contracts on basis that encouraged prime contractors to give subcontracts to companies preferring those that were certified as being controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals company that lost contract it had bid on to minority firm sued the court did not reach the actual merits of the dispute but it sent the case back to the lower courts with express instructions to evaluate the constitutional issue under the same strictscrutin standard that applied to actions that disadvantaged racial minorities the case has been upanddown several times but it has never been finally decided on the merits grutter v bollinger 539 us 306 2003 gratz v bollinger 539 us 244 2003 not since the decision in regents of the university of california v bakke 438 us 265 1978 had the court decided case involving the permissibility of affirmative action in admissions of applicants to institutions of higher learning it was something of surprise therefore that after the passage of so much time the court but especially justice oconnor recurred to jus tice powells singular opinion in bakke as providing the key to resolution of these two cases justi ce powell insisted that racial preferences in education must be evaluated under strictscrutiny standard and that creating diverse student body in an educational setting was compelling governmental interest that would survive strict scrutiny analysis both mich igan cases here were 5to4 decisions and justice oconnor was the only justice in th majority in both cases she wrote the opinion in grutter in which admission applications to the university of michigan law school were individually cons idered and decided using ll the educational and other components standards for admission but also considering the racial and ethnic diversity of the potential students that individualiz ed consideration was sufficient for the majority although not for the dissent gratz concerned admission to the university of michigan undergraduate school and it did not involve individualized consideration rather of the 150 points obtained by evalua ting many factors the school awarded 20 points based solely upon membership in an underrepresente d racial or ethnic minority group and generally 100 points were sufficient to gain admission this method the fivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32995crs7 justice majority held failed st rict scrutiny much more is involved in the two cases and there was multitude of concurrences and dissents shaw v reno 509 us 630 1993 miller v johnson 515 us 900 1995 shaw v hunt 517 us 899 1996 bush v vera 517 us 962 1996 easley v cromartie 532 us 234 2001 these cases brought to bear on legislative and congressional districting the standards developed by the justices to evaluate the constitutionality of affirmative action that is they concerned dist rict lines that were drawn at least in part to enhance the opportunities of minority voters to either elect candidates of their choice or to play significant role in influencing the choices made the decisions were complicated by the existence of the voting rights act which was interpreted by the justice department to mandate the greatest representation of minorities possible justice oconnor played significant role in thes cases the first four of which found equal protection violations in the degree to whic h racial and ethnic factors were relied on by legislators she wrote the opinion of the court in reno heavily critical of the bizarre lines that had been drawn and she contribut ed both the majority opinion and separate concurring opinion in bush v vera significant points made in the third and fourth cases are that drawing lines to comply with the voting rights act is not compelling governmental interest that will save racial gerrymander but that the creation of reasonably compact majorityminority district s in order to remedy past discrimination or to comply with the requirements of the voting rights act would probably survive strict scrutiny in the easley case justice oconnor switched to join the four dissenters in the other four cases to hold that some what modified version of the plans voided in the two shaw cases was constitutional when the predominant purpose of drawing lines advantaging africanamericans served permissible partisan purpose because blacks voted heavily democratic georgia v ashcroft 539 us 461 2003 not constitutional decision the case marks substantial rein terpretation of the voting rights act that should be noted in an opinion by justice oconnor 5to4 court he ld that the effective exercise of the electoral franchise could be promoted not only by rule of nonretrogression in the position of racial minorities through redistricting but it could also be achieved by the reduction of racial strength in some districts so that th ey were longer safe for the minorities if at the same time the legislature moved minority voters into other districts where they became sufficiently numerous that they could influence the choice of candidates in those districts separation of powers hamdi v runsfeld 542 us 507 2004 rasul v bush 542 us 466 2004 although it was the position of the bush administration that the president in the exercise of his war powers the commanderinchief au thority and the inherent powers of his office had plenary and exclusive power to treat the prisoners captured in afghanistan and iraq as he chose and to imprison them and other persons apprehended elsewhere including american citizens without any in terference by the courts the supreme court disagreed in hamdi justice oconnor wrote plura lity opinion for the court which was in effect agreed to generally by all but one justice in which she held that due process requires that united states citizen being held as an enemy combatant be given fair opportunity in some tribunal to object to his detention and she was in the majority inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32995crs8 rasul in which the court held that federal courts had habeas jurisdiction over alien prisoners being held at guantanamo bay in cuba campaign finance regulation mcconnell v fec 540 us 93 2003 justice connor in tandem with justice stevens authored the primary opinion of the court in sustaining the bipartisan campaign reform act mccainfeingold the major provision of which imposed ban on soft money campaign contributions by individuals and organizations the first amendment implications of regulations that limit both contributions and expenditures to and for political purposes the former of which the court has recognized as constitutional and the latter of which the court has invalidated have been explored throughout much case law for lengthy period mostly since buckley v valeo 424 us 1 1976 in which the court adopted the cont ributionexpenditure distinction for other cases see austin v michigan chamber of commerce 494 us 652 1990in which justice oconnor joined justice kennedys dissent objecting to the expenditure limitation and fec v massachusetts citizens for life inc 479 us 238 1986concurring in part and in th judgment on the impermissibility of limiting fundraising for groups engaged in campaigning first amendment speech reno v aclu 521 us 844 1997 united states v playboy entertainment group inc 529 us 803 2000 ashcroft v free speech coalition 535 us 234 2002 ashcroft v aclu 542 us 656 2004 in all thes cases justice oconnor dissented in whole or in part from decisions striking down governmental regulations of indecent materials at least sexually explicit materials in the electronic context reno voided the first internet indecency statute enacted by congress and ashcroft v aclu invalidated the followup child online protection act the playboy case struck down law that mandated adult channels to scramble cable channels in order to prevent bleeding of offensive materials that would enable the materials to be seen by unwilling viewers and children and free speech coalition held unconstitutional st atute criminalizing the creation and broadcasting of virtual child pornography that is material not produced with the use of real live children in the first case the justice offered the view that congress could create adult zones on the in ternet like municipa lities have been upheld in zoning those areas in which dultsonly businesse s could operate florida bar v went for it inc 515 us 618 1995 justice oconnor has frequently joined opinions upholding restric tions on commercial speech but in this case she wrote the opinion of the court upholding state bar association in prohibiting attorneys from soliciting accident victims within 30 days of an accident property rights hawaii housing authority v midkiff 467 us 229 1984 kelo v city of new london 125 sct 2 655 2005 cases brought under the fifth and fourteenth amendments claiming taking of property are of two different kinds the first of which these two are exemplifications concern an actual physical appropr iation of property by government which is permissible so long as it is for public use and justhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32995crs9 compensation is paid to the dispossessed owners both of these cases tested what is public use midkiff involved state landre form plan in hawaii in which the state took with compensation land from the few big landow ners on the islands and transferred it to their tenants justice oconnor wrote for unanimous court sustaining the use of the eminentdomain power as way to remedy the ill effects of the land oligopoly in the state public use was genera lly construed to mean public benefit as in the due process standard for exercise of the police power see berman v parker 348 us 26 1954 in kelo justice oconnor wrote the princi pal dissent protesting the courts validation of the citys exercise of eminent domain to take private property with compensation from homeowners and businesses in an area that was not flourishing but certainly was not blighted for purposes of stimulating econo mic development and enlargement of the tax base through the f unctioning of privat nonprofit instrumentality in cooperation with major cor poration the justice complain ed that taking property and turning it over to private entity for purposes of economic growth was not public use but she was hampered by her need to distinguish midkiff and berman necessity that did not bother justice thomas in dissent who wa nted to overturn the conflation of public use and public benef it that the court had adopted for more than hundred years eastern enterprises v apfel 524 us 498 1998 the other branch of takings jurisprudence is the socalled regulatory takings cases that is the court long ago developed the principle that if regulation goes too far in the sense of reducing too much the value of the regulated property courts can treat it as taking and invalidate it justice oconnor has been generally with those jus tices who are very protective of property in regulatory takings cases joining the opinions but not writing any eg lucas v south carolina coastal coun cil 505 us 1003 1992 dolan v city of tigard 512 us 374 1994 and sometimes in the ma jority denying taking tahoesierra preservation council inc v tahoe regional planning agency 535 us 302 2002 illustrative of her singular voice is the eastern enterprises case in which justice oconnor in plurality opinion insisted that the uncompensat ed taking of funds from coal operators to pay miners for the workrelated ravages of the mines violated the fifth amendment justice kennedy provided the fifth vote for i nvalidating the act but he relied instead on dueprocess grounds sexual liberty lawrence v texas 529 us 558 2003 in this case justice kennedy wrote the opinion of the court finding that laws cr iminalizing homosexual sodomy violated the liberty guaranteed by the substantive duep rocess clause justice oconnor joined the result of the case but did not agree with the ra tionale instead finding that the law violated the equalprotection clause of the fourteenth amendment inasmuch as the law applied to sodomy engaged in by homosexuals but not by heterosexuals in this respect she followed romer v evans 517 us 620 1996 another kennedy opinion that she joined striking down law that discriminated against homosexuals which the court said failed even the rationalbasis st her concurrence in lawrence noted that she would not overrule bowers v hardwick 478 us 186 1986 which she had joined in which the application of sodomy law to both hom osexuals and hetero sexuals was upheld httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32995crs10 criminal law and procedure penry v lynaugh 492 us 302 1989 the justice has attempted to follow nuanced standard in capital cases supportive of the constitutionality of the death penalty itself with respect to the execution of convicted murderer but in individual cases closely scrutinizing the administration of the punishment in the states this case illustrates her general support fo r the penalty she wrote the opinion of the court finding that national consensus existed to justify preclusion of the execution of mildly or moderately retarded person the justice so provided the critical vote and rationale in refusing to find that the execution of persons for capital crimes committed while they were 16 or 17years old was not cruel and unusual stanford v kentucky 492 us 361 1989 although she agreed on more limited grounds than the plurality that execution of persons who were younger than 16 at the time they committed the offense was not permitted thompson v oklahoma 487 us 815 1988 subsequently she silently joined the opinion of the court overruling lynaugh and holding that national consensus existed that the execution of the retarded was impermissible atkins v virginia 536 us 304 2002 but justice oconnor dissented from narrowlydivided courts holding that the execution of persons who were 16 or 17years old at the time of their offense was unconstitutional both because of nationa l consensus and because of the justices own evaluation of the standards of human decency roper v simmons 125 sct 1183 2005 kyllo v united states 533 us 27 2001 the effect of new technology upon what constitutes search for fourth amendment purposes has frequently divided the court as it did in 1928 when the court held that wiretapping of tele phones without invading the property of the person liste ned to was not search whi ch has since been overruled recent example is this case in which justice scalia speaking for the court held that the utilization of thermal imaging device to measure the heat given off in home in order to ascertain that marijuana was being grown there was search requiring warrant supported by probable cause justice oconnor dissented joining another justices dissent vernonia school district 471 v acton 515 us 646 1995 board of education of independent school district 92 v earls 536 us 822 2002 in its jurisprudence dealing with drug testing that is not suppor ted by probable cause or reasonable suspicion the court has developed special needs doctrine permitting random testing of various classes of persons with which the justice ge nerally agreed these two cases concern an expansion of that standard to approve in the first case mandatory testing of school athletes and in the second case testing of all students engaging in extracurricular activities justice oconnor dissented from bot h decisions protesting that the policy permitted intrusive searches of school children most of whom are innocent united states v booker 125 sct 738 2005 an upheaval has taken place in the court and thus in federal nd state sentencing schemes respecting the necessary role of juries in finding facts and factors by proof beyond reasonable doubt as against the trial judges permissible finding by less than proof beyond reasonable doubt after the jury has returned guilty verdict for basic crime of additional facts and factors authorizing her to enhance the sentences to be given for the offenses that the jury had convicted the defendant of committing the court in the pa st had generally found sentencing schemes empowering the judge to act to be valid but in apprendi v new jersey 530 us
