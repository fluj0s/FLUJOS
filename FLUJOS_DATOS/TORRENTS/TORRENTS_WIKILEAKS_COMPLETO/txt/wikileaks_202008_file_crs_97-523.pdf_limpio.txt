recordings internationally are consider ed subordinate to the rights of authors consequently related rights are generally gran ted for shorter period than the term for copyrights and the rights

postponed to another diplomatic conference both becau there was insufficient time to examine this proposal at the december 1996 diplomatic conference and because manycountries thought that the proposal had been given insufficient consideration duringthe preparatory work to enable them to make an informed decision the draft database treaty would have established sui generis protection against misappropriation of databases created with substantial effort and investment even if the database did not represent an intell ectual work within the meaning of copyright law this report

the house of representatives passed hr 2281 with further amendments on august 4 1998 s 2037 and hr 2281 have many common pr ovisions but the bills also differ significantly most notably perhaps hr

amisappropriationtype regime the collections of information antipiracy acttitle vi would enact protection for the ove rall shape or design of vessel hulls larger than rowboat but smaller than 201 feet the vessel hull design protection act background the wipo performances and phonograms treaty was developed as by product of wipo work program to modernize the major international copyrighttreaty the berne convention for the prot ection of literary and artistic works berne convention the original pur pose of the socalled berne protocol process was to make explicit the international copyright protection for computerprograms and databases and generally to update the berne convention concerning use of copyrighted works in digital electronic environments initially the united states sought to include updated protection for sound recordings in the berne protocol pro cess the european union and many other countries strenuously resisted inclusi on of sound recording protection in the copyright treaty since sound recordings ar not copyright subject matter under their laws or they insisted under the berne convention majority of industrialized countries protect sound recordings under related or neighboring rights laws the prin cipal neighboring rights convention is thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97523crs5 9the united states adheres to more narrow sound recording treaty the convention

10phonograms is the international term comm only used to refer to sound recordings technically under united states law sound recordings are works of authorship which maybe embodied in variety of material objects records cassettes compact disks etc called phonorecords the international term phonograms refers both to material objects embodying recorded sounds and to the conten t that is the object of legal protection throughout this report the terms phonogram s and sound recordings will be used interchangeably to mean the intellectual crea tion that is the object of protection under the treatyinternational convention for the protecti on of performers producers of phonograms and broadcasting organizations known as the 1961 rome convention orneighboring rights convention the ited states is not member of this convention 9 as the berne protocol process develope d the viewpoint of the european union prevailed sound recording protection is not covered internationally by the berneconvention thus an updated version of the berne convention could not be thevehicle for improved international protection for sound recordings in 1992 decision was taken to split th berne protocol process into two phases an update of copyright provisi ons and preparation of possible new instrument ie separate treaty on the protection of the rights of performers and producers of phonograms 10 the issues relating to the new instrument were considered by six committees of experts this dual work program copyright update and new instrument culminated in th adoption of two new treaties at the wipo diplomatic conference which met in ge neva switzerland from december 220 1996 the major policy issue involving the performancesphonograms treaty was the inclusion or exclusion of protection for audiovisual performances and performers eg actorsactresses in motion pictures this issue was resolved by the exclusion of audiovisual performances from the treaty the possibility of extending newrights to audiovisual performances will be pursued in future meetings within thewipo in the fields of copyright and related rights multilateral treaties or conventions generally establish few basic principles concerning the scope of protectioneligibility of foreigners to enjoy protec tion permissible range of limitations and exceptions to the rights granted and duration of protection intellectual propertytreaties like the berne convention nd the 1961 rome convention do not govern protection for countrys own nationals do not govern who is liable for any infringement of rights and do not regulate the enforcement of rights in any detailhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97523crs6 11suits alleging infringement of treaty rights by private persons are not brought before any international forum such as wipo or the intern ational court of justice under article 30 of the 1961 rome convention disputes about treaty interpretation or application between two or more member countries may be brought before the international court of justice at therequest of any one of the disputants that one party can bring the case to the international court is unusual article 33 of the berne convention represents the more commonformulation concerning recourse to the intern ational court the suit cannot be brought if one of the parties has declared itself not bound by article 331 of berne 12as will be discussed later the wipo performances and phonograms treaty does permit reservation concerning national treatment in the case of the broadcasting remunerationright and communications to the public article 153 of the performancesphonogramstreaty the president in his treaty transmittal message to the senate has requested that the united states invoke this reservation 13the wipo performances and phonograms treaty will not come into force for any country until 3 months after the 30th country to accede or ratify h as deposited its instruments of accession or ratification with the director genera l of wipo each country follows its own treaty approval process in accordance with national lawan intellectual property treaty generally establishes its basic principles in language that is less explicit than statutory language this level of generality andflexibility of language is ordinarily essen tial in order to achieve an international consensus among so many countries with widely differing national legal systemsthe details of intellectual property policy ar left to national legislatures there is usually some flexibility in carrying out even relatively explicit treaty obligations very commonly the treaty will specifically provide that certain issues are left entirely to national legislation if however implementing legislation is not adopted the treaty obligation may be interpreted by the courts of country depending uponthat countrys system of jurisprudence an intellectual property treaty like the new wipo performances and phonograms treaty establishes general principles or framework within whichnational copyright or related rights laws fo r example are enacted and enforced the treaty operates primarily to harmonize nati onal laws concerning minimum rights and duration of rights national copyright or related rights laws do not have extraterritorial effect suits for copyright or related rights viol ations are ordinarily brought in the place where the infringement occurs the court of the country where suit is filed applies its own law which includes both national c opyright or related rights laws and any relevant treaty to which the country adheres

international ip treaties to da have not specified who is liable but they fix the major parameters for assessing liability by specifying rights and permissiblelimitations on rights 15in introducing s 1121 senator hatch ch airman of the senate judiciary committee expressed the view that the united states must act promptly to ratify and implement thewipo treaties in order to demonstrate leader ship on international copyright protection so that the wipo treaties can be implemented globally and so that further theft of our nationsmost valuable creative products may be pr evented 143 cong rec daily sheets at s8582 july 31 1997conform united states domestic law to the treaty obligations for this reason the senates consent to treaty ratification usually occurs after or concurrently withenactment of any necessary implementing legislation unless the existing united states law is consistent with the obligations of an intellectual property treaty implementing legisl ation is necessary to avoid situation in which the united states would fail to m eet its commitments to international law intellectual property ip law treaties ve not been considered selfexecuting under us law even though the supremacy clause of the us constitution makes ratified treaty the law of the land if it is later in time than statute ip treaties have not been considered selfexecuting primarily because they represent private international law rather than public international law copyright treaty for example creates personal property rights in authors and perhaps otherpersons and fixes civil liability at least for persons who infringe those propertyrights 14 the property rights and the specific acts that give rise to liability are ordinarily detailed in national laws any inconsistencies between the provisions ofthe treaty and the existing national laws are ordinarily resolved by the time the treaty is ratified in order to satisfy united stat international treaty obligations and to make clear the rights of ip owners and the potential liability of ip users the exact content of the implementing legi slation is subject to public debate and legislative consideration this legislative process ordinarily involves an assessmentof the minimum obligations of the treaty analysis of and some consensus on thesettled interpretations of existing us law and the impact of the treaty and any changes in us law on various groups in this country the congress also maydecide to specify certain policies in statutory form and leave certain details toadministrative regulation or to the casebycase decisions of the courts the wipo performances and phonogram s treaty has now been forwarded to the senate for its advice and consent and bills introduced to implement the changesin united states law deemed necessary by the administration 15 the original bills have now been replaced by amended and successor bills s 2037 and hr 2281 known as the digital millennium copyright act of 1998 dmca as passed by the senate and house of representatives the different versions of the dmca address broader copyright policy issues in the digital environment thanoriginally proposed by the administration

1997 17senator hatch in introducing s 1121 conf irmed that the bill takes minimalist approach and is based on the assumption that t he substantive protections in us copyright law already meet the standards of the new wipo treaties and therefore very few changesto us law are necessary in order to impl ement the treaties 143 cong rec daily sheets at s8582 july 31 1997 18adam eisgrau representing

1998 19this difference in the approach of the copyri ght and related rights treaties is primarily concession to the united states which is not member of the 1961 rome convention andwould have great difficulty in applying some of its provisions in fact primary reason for continuedcertain technology companies the online service providers telephone companies and other communications entities these groups have successfully urged congress to clarify their liability for internet uses of copyrighted works in conjunction with any ratification of the wipo treaties16 content owners and many large computer software companies originally urged early congressional action on both wipo treaties and on the implementinglegislation by adoption of the minima list approach of s 1121 and hr 2281 17 as originally introduced they initially argued that online service and access providerliability and other intellectual property policy issues could be addressed if necessary in separate legislation apart from the wipo treaties implementation bills the versions of the dmca passed by the senate and house of representatives however generally embody consensus compromise agreements on formerlycontentious issues that apparently enjoy the support of both users and owners ofcopyrighted material except with respect to titles v and vi of hr 2281 18 wipo performances and phonograms treaty summary nature of legal instrument the wipo performances and phonograms treaty is new treaty which has few links to the existing 1961 rome convention in contrast however to theapproach taken in the wipo copyright treaty where adherents must apply thesubstantive articles of the 1971 paris act of the berne convention adherents to the performancesphonograms treaty are not required to apply the 1961 romeconvention unless they are already members of that convention 19httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97523crs9 19continued development of the new performancesphonograms treaty is the wish of the united states to improve international protection for sound recordings without updating the 1961 rome convention as the vehicle for that improved protection 20art 12 this provision reflects the european viewpoint that related or neighboring rights protection must always be subordinate to copyright protection for authors hereafter allreferences to treaty article refer to articles in the wipo performances and phonogramstreaty unless the context makes clear that another treaty is referenced 21art 13 this provision clarifies th at the performancesph onogram s treaty does not supersede or replace other intellectual prope rty treaties such as the geneva phonograms convention the universal copyright convention or the berne convention article 11 of the treaty expressly provides that nothing in the performances phonograms treaty shallderogate from the 1961 rome convention 22phonogram is defined in article 2b to mean the fixation of the sounds of performance or of other sounds or of represen tation of sounds other than in the form of fixation incorporated in cinematographic or other audiovisual work 23the states also agreed that nothing in artic 12 precludes party to the treaty from providing exclusive rights to performers or producers of phonograms in excess of thoseprovided by the treatyadherents to the performancesphonogram s treaty are required to promise that its provisions shall in way affect the protection of copyright in literary andartistic works 20 nor have any connection with or prejudice any rights and obligations under any other treaties21 the diplomatic conference also adopted an agreed interpretation with reference to article 1 concerning the relationship between rights in phonograms under thetreaty and copyright in works embodied in the phonograms 22 the states agreed that where permission to use phonogram is needed from both the author of work embodied therein and performer or pr oducer the need to obtain the authors permission does not cease to exist because permission is also required from the performerproducer and viceversa this interpretative understanding merelyconfirms that copyright ri ghts and related rights are separate and may be held by different rightsholders where there are di fferent rightsholders permission from one is not sufficient to authorize use of the phonogram 23 form of legal protection the performancesphonograms treaty creat new rights for performers and producers of sound recordings without speci fying the theory of law under which the rights are enjoyed that is country may provide the protection specified in thetreaty under related or neighboring rights under copyright or sui generis law if existing patterns of protection for sound recordings are maintained the majority of the countries will extend protection through related rights laws theunited states presumably will continue to rely upon copyright law as the primaryvehicle for sound recordi ng protection supplemented by criminal penalties forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97523crs10 24the first federal legislation protecting the rights of performers who are not also authors was passed in 1994 as part of the fasttrack legislation implementing the 1994 generalagreement on tariffs and trade gatt p ub l 103465 secs 512 and 513 act of december 8 1994 the law known as the federal antibootlegging statute created civil andcriminal penalties for unauthorized fixation nd trafficking in audio recordings of live musical performances the civil penalties are c odified at chapter 11 of title 17 of the us code the copyright act the criminal pena lties are codified in title 18 of the us code 2319a 25state law may be relied upon for example to provide the moral rights protection for performers required by article 5 of the treaty 26as discussed under the next point however the performancesphonograms treaty applies the eligibility criteria of the 1961 rome convention including its possible reservationsconcerning the criteria of publication and fixation 27art 31 28art 32 the rome conventions eligibility criteria for performers are found in article 4 of that convention the criteria are live performance takes place in anothercontracting state b the performance is fixed in phonogram whic h is protected under rome article 5 or c live performance is transmitted via broadcast protected by rome continuedknowing infringements for purposes of commercial gain24 in addition to federal law the united states may rely in part on st ate statutory and common law protection to satisfy some treaty obligations25 national treatment article 4 of the treaty obliges party to accord the same treatment to foreigners that the party accords to its own nationals with regard to the exclusive rights specifically granted and the right to quitable remuneration provided by article 15 except where reservation is made concer ning the remuneration right of article 15 in that case other countries are not bound to grant right of equitable remuneration for the broadcast or communication to the public of phonograms in essence thepublic performance of sound recordings to the nationals of the country invoking the reservation other than in the case of this exception foreigners must be granted the same rights as citizens nationals the national treatment article represents an enhanced level of international protection for sound recordings since th 1961 rome convention permitted several reservations rather than just one reservation 26 beneficiaries of protection performers and producers of phonograms who are nationals of other parties to the treaty must be accorded the protection granted by the treaty27 the term national means those phonogram performersproducers who meet the eligibility criteria of the 1961 rome c onvention based on the legal fiction that all members of the performancesphonogram s treaty are also members of the 1961 rome convention28 if reservation has been made concerning under rome articlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97523crs11 28continued article 5 these eligibility criteria are thus not based on nationality in the same sense as the berne copyright convention the first criterion is territorial the last two depend upon protection for either the phonogram producer or the broadcaster then concerning theeligibility criteria for producers rome arti cle 5 establishes three possibilities the nationality of the producer if national of nother contracting state b first fixation in another contracting state or c first publica tion in another contracting state reservations are possible regarding the publication and fixation criteria 29art 2a definition 30art 2d definition 31art 1753 that state will not apply either th criterion of publication or the criterion of

rights of performers and produ cers of phonograms must be protected generally for minimum of 50 years comput ed from first fixati on of the sounds in phonogram31 the fixation criterion always applies in computing the term for performers because primary right of performer is to authorize the first fixation of theperformance in phonogram in the case of producers the 50year term is computed from the year of publication if the phonogram is published if the phonogram is not published the 50year term for producers is computed from first fixation exclusive rights performers and producers of phonograms generally enjoy the same exclusive rights under the performancesphonograms treaty except that i performers aregranted moral rights and rights in unfixed performances but producers are not and ii technically speaking performers are gr anted rights in their performances and producers are granted rights in their phonogram that is in the fixation of the sounds for claritys sake the treaty

after the death of the performer the mo ral right must generally be maintained at least until expiration of the performers economic rights the post mortem moral rights can be exercised by persons or ins titutions authorized by the national law of the country where protection is claimed as an exception however those stateswhose law at the time of ratification or accession to the treaty does not maintain all of the moral rights after the death of the performer are permitted to terminate someof the rights on the death of the performer 33 the details of moral rights protection are left to the national law of the country where protection is claimed34 performers right in unfixed performances performers but not producers are granted rights under the treaty in unfix ed performances this economic right basically means that performers have the ri ght to authorize the first fixation of their performances they also have the right to authorize the first broadcast orcommunication to the public of their unfixed performances 35 this right is in addition to the qualified remuneration right of article 15 to share in payments for the broadcast or public communication of commercially published phonograms httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97523crs13 36arts 7 and 11 these articles which grant reproduction right but do not address reproduction in computers xplicitly were accepted in th performancesp honograms treaty apparently because of their narrow application to phonograms online service providerswho successfully insisted upon deletion of the reproduction right article from the wipo copyright treaty perhaps did not perceive the same risk of liability concerning reproductionof phonograms as they did in the case of reproduction of other copyrighted works or if theysought deletion of the express reproduction right were not successful 37agreed statement concerning articles 7 11 and 16 diplomatic conference document crnrdc97 december 23 1997 the agreed statement interpretive device adoptedby the 1996 diplomatic conference is unusual in international intellectual property treaties the weight as well as the meaning of some of the statements such as the statement interpreting the reproduction right will be deba ted in legislative fora and argued in the courts the debate will likely focus on the mean ing of storage in digital electronic media some will argue that the statement means any storage beyond few nanoseconds otherswill argue that the statement allows consider able room for limiting storage to instances of more permanent retention of the phonogram and perhaps for purposes of further distributionfor commercial purposes 38arts 81 and 121 39art 82 these doctrines are applied usually to limit the public distribution right to the first sale authorized by the rightsholder that is the purchaser of copy of phonogrammay resell or otherwise redistribute the phonogram without obtaining permission from therightsholder see for example section 109 of the us copyright act title 17 usc in recent years commercial rental rights have b een granted to copyright owners of computer programs and sound recordings by qualifying th application of the first sale doctrine to these works at the international level ma jor issue exists concerning national regional or international exhaustion of the public distribution right that is assuming the exhaustion doctrine is legislated does the first sale in given country exhaust the continuedthe remaining exclusive rights apply to performances fixed in phonograms performers and producers have separate rights of reproduction public distribution commercial rental and making available to the public by wire orwireless means reproduction right the reproduction right applies to direct or indirect reproduction in any manner or form of the fixed performance or the phonogram 36 the diplomatic conference adopted an ag reed interpretation of the reproduction right in article 7 performers right and article 11 producers right and thelimitations permitted by article 16 the statement says that the treatysreproduction rights fully apply in the digital environment in particular to the useof performances and phonograms in digital form it is understood that the storageof protected performance or phonogram in digital form in an electronic medium constitutes reproduction within the meaning of these articles 37 public distribution right performers and producers enjoy the exclusive right of authorizing the making available to the public of copies38 like the wipo copyright treaty the performancesphonograms treaty permits but does notrequire the states to limit the distribution right by the first sale or exhaustion of right doctrines 39httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97523crs14 39continued

8 and 12 distribution rights and articles 9 and 13 rental rights as used in these articles the expressions copies and original and copies being subject to the right of distribution and the right of rental under the said articles refer exclusively to fixed copies that can be put intocirculation as tangible copies 40 commercial rental right performers and producers enjoy generally exclusive right of authorizing the commercial rental of phonograms41 this right however is subject to qualification as mere right of remuneration if on april 151994 42 country granted only remuneration right for phonogram rentals43 the possibility of mere remuneration right for rentals is concession to japan primarily since their national law provides only right of remuneration for rental of phonograms the treaty contains the furt her condition that such country may maintain the remuneration right provided there is material impairment of thereproduction right making available right performers and producers enjoy the exclusive right of authorizing the making available to the public of phonograms by wire orwireless means in such way that members of the public may access them from aplace and at time individually chosen by them 44 this public availability right is in essence an interactive ondemand public transmission right it will apply to interactive and subscription methods oftransmitting phonograms to the public including dissemination via computernetworks and other electronic means principal difference between the articles10 and 14 public availability right and th articles 8 and 12 public distribution right is that the latter applies to distribution of copies of phonograms the former applies to transmissions the existence of these separate article s together with the somewhat ambiguous statement of the reproduction right is arguably consistent with view that at the international level public transmission of phonograms via computer networks does not amount to public distribution of the phonograms the validity of this viewpoint will be tested by the consensus that may develop on the meaning and legalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97523crs15 45information infrastructure

published commercially these rights are not strictly exclusiverights since they are subject to mere right of equitable remuneration 46 that is the rightsholders cannot prohibit the use the

ratification of the wipo performances andphonograms treaty while invoking the permissible reservation to the broadcasting right 51art 154 52this distinction between the requirement of an exclusive right for interactive transmissions of sound recordings and possible compulsory licensing for other broadcasts of sound recordings is consistent with the digital audio transmission right of united

uses to establish acompulsory licensing mechanism or not grant any rights concerning broadcasts and communications to the public of phonograms the treaty specifies that where phonograms are made available to the public by wire or wireless means in way that permits individual access those phonograms shall be considered as if they had been published for commercial purposes 51 although reservation is possible on the broadcastingpublic communication rights reservation is possible on the public availability right of articles 10 and 14 this means member states must provi exclusive rights where the transmission is made available on an interactive or ondemand basis the states can electhowever not to extend any rights to traditional broadcasts or to noninteractive public performances of phonograms subject to the right of the performer under article 6 to authorize the broadcast or public communication of unfixed performances that is the treaty re quires protection of performers against unauthorized broadcast of live performa nce but does not require protection for performers or producers against noninteractive broadcasts of phonograms soundrecordings 52 the diplomatic conference adopted two agreed statements concerning article 15 one statement simply recognizes the reality that the delegations to theconference were unable to achieve cons ensus on differing proposalswithout the possibility of reservations nd have therefore left the issue to future resolution the second statement expresses an understanding that even though article 15ordinarily applies only to commercially published phonograms member states are not prevented from granting broadcastingpublic communication rights in recordingsof folklore where the phonograms have not been published for commercial gain limitations on rights the performancesphonograms treaty permits limitations to the rights granted on the same basis as the wipo copyri ght treaty any limitations or

rights in certain special cases which do not conflict with normal exploitation of theperformance or phonogram and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimateinterests of the performer or of the

stating that article 10 of the copyright treaty applies mutatis mutandis that is in the same way also to ar ticle 16 of the performancesphonograms treaty the statement has three main points i member states may extend into the digital environment any existing limitations and exceptions that have been consideredacceptable under the berne copyright conventi on ii the states may also devise new exceptions and limitations appropriate to the digital network environment and iii article 102 of the copyright treaty neither reduces nor extends the scope of limitations permitted by the berne

not to extend retroactive protection to the moral rights of performers for performances which occur before the state becomes bound by the treaty59 this incorporation by reference of berne article 18 means in essence that member states must provide some form of retroactive protection for performances and phonograms that were unprotected by the new member before it joined thetreaty but remain under protection in the country of origin formalities prohibited article 20 requires that the enjoyment nd exercise of the rights provided for in this treaty shall not be subject to any formality this means

and technical amendmentsconcerning eligibility of foreignorigin wo rks to claim us copyright protection those who held this viewpoint argued th at the treaty mainly clarifies certain rights and subject matter issues and that to the extent the treaty grants new rights it tracks recent changes in united states c opyright law most not ably the federal antibootlegging statute which prohibits unaut horized fixation and trafficking in live musical performances 71 and the digital performance right in sound recordings act of 1995 which created narrow public performance right in digital audiotransmissions of sound recordings 72 also some have argued that the courts could deal with the few if any remaining issu concerning the consistency of us law with the treaty that were not covered by the original implementation bills the opposing viewpoint is that united stat law relating to use of copyrighted works including sound recordings on the in ternet and other electronic or computer networks is not settled some argued that existing us law is inconsistent withcertain treaty obligations others argued that at minimum legislation would be needed to achieve higher degree of certainty

for two articles which require i legal protection against circumvention of anticopying technology article 18 and ii legal remedies against knowing pe rformance of prohibited acts relating to removal

consequential adjustments to thosedefinitions of the copyright act that aff ect treaty relationships and the eligibility of foreigners to claim copyri ght in the united states technical amendments are proposed for the same reasons in three s ubstantive sections of the copyright act section 104 which governs eligibility of foreign authors to claim copyright underunited states law section 104a which

implementation bills the digital millennium copyright act does nothowever address issues relating to the ec onomic and moral rights of performers of sound recordingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97523crs23 75since the bills do not contain any definition of commercial advantage or private financial gain it seems likely that the mens rea standard of existing copyright law asdeveloped by court deci sions would apply 76the same proposals in the implementation bills would implement article 18 of the performancesphonograms treaty and article 11 of the copyright treatycircumvention of anticopying systems the implementation bills would add new chapter 12 to the copyright act title 17 usc creating civil and criminal liability for circumvention of anticopying systems the proposed section 1201 would prohibit the manufacture importation offering to the public or other trafficking in any technology product service device component or part thereof that is primarily designed or produced to circumvent an anticopying system proposed civil penalties include injunctions impoundment of infringing material or equipment actual damages or statutory damages ranging from 2002500 per act of circumvention

bonito boats v thunder craft boats 85 holding that state law protection of boat designs was an unconstitutional interference with the federal patent and copyrightlaws the boat design title would enact design protection proposal that has been presented to the congress over several decad and rejected for various reasons when the proposal extended to designs of useful articles in general the pending proposalis restricted to boat designs simply by few definitions eg the definition of useful article one of the objections to the legislation may be that this is the firstunwelcome for some step toward enactme nt of general design legislation which has been controversial in the past again like database protection design pr otection is the subject of european union harmonization project for american designers to obtain design protectionin europe the united states would have to enact new design legislation when design protection was considered by earlier congresses objections from the insurance industry consumers retailers and others concerned about the alleged anticompetitive effect of design protection led to the rejection of the design bill additional possible implementation issues moral rights of performers as noted earlier the administrations original implementation bills did not propose any amendments to united states lawconcerning existing rights of sound recording copyright owners the economic ormoral rights of performers or any lim itations on rights s 1146 hr 3048 hr 2180 and hr 3209 proposed amendments affecting the rights and limitations on the rights of sound recording copyright owners 86like the administration billshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97523crs29 86continued and to limitations on those rights although sound recordings are covered by the proposed amendments since sound recordings are copyri ghtable subject matter under us law the practical effects of most of the amendments are likely to be felt more significantly by worksother than sound recordings 87art 51 88art 52 89pub l 103465 decem ber 8 1994 codified as section 1101 of title 17 usc the parallel criminal penalties are codified at 18 usc 2319a 90art 6 also art 2b definition of phonogramhowever these alternative implementation bills did not address the moral rights of performers or the economic rights of nonauthor performers of sound recordingsthe same is true of s 2037 and hr 2281 as passed by the senate and house ofrepresentatives respectively sec 416 of hr 2281 does extend new contractual rights to performers of motion pictures with respect to assumption of collective bargaining agreementsthis provision does not however apply to performers of sound recordings apparently the united states copyright law does not extend moral rights protection to performers of live aural performances or performances fixed in phonograms which rights apparently must be protected under the performancesphonograms treaty 87 arguments may be made that combination of state laws and section 43 of thelanham act may provide the minimum mo ral rights protection required by article 5 of the treaty some performers may cha llenge the adequacy of us moral rights protection if the united states intends to limit protection of performers moral rights after the death of the performer those limits must be established in us law at the timeof ratification 88 performers rights in unfixed broadcastspublic communications the united states copyright law generally does not extend rights in unfixed works an exception is made for unfixed musical performances which are granted protection in the federal antibootlegging statute89 the adequacy of us law to protect non musical performances may be raised however since the treaty requires protection of nonmusical sounds performances and phonograms90 reliance upon state law protection for performers may be seen as problematical especially in the case ofbroadcasting of performances separate economic rights of nonauthor performers the treaty requires that performers be granted the rights of authorizing the reproduction publicdistribution commercial rental and making available to the public by wire orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97523crs30 91articles 710 inclusive 92the work for hire definition of the copyright act establishes two types of employee works works prepared by employees within the scope of their employment and certain categoriesof specially ordered or commissioned works if the parties agree in writing that the work is done for hire sound recordings qualify for the scope of employment type of work forhire dispute exists about application of the commissioned work provisions to sound recordings which are not expressly mentioned in the section 1012 listing of the categories of works that if commissioned may qualify as works for hire under written agreement record producers in the past however have taken the position that albums at least andcertain other collaborative recordings qualif as collective works and can therefore be deemed works for hire by written agreement 93if this argument is advanced by record pr oducers the following questions would likely arise do the record producers concede that ll performers are authors who then assign their economic rights through contracts if so these assignments are subject to termination afterapproximately 35 years as provided in 17 usc 203 if not all performers are authorsis nonproprietary right based upon collectiv bargaining agreements in compliance with the treaty obligations to grant separate proprietary rights to performers 94art 15wireless means of their performances parate and independent of the producers rights91 since the united states protects these economic rights under the copyright law the rights belong initially to the authors of the sound recording some but not all performers are considered authors under us law if performer is not an author the copyright law grants rights to au thorize reproduction public distribution commercial rental or making available to th public of their performances under united states law if the copyrighted work is made for hire as defined in 17 usc 10192 the employer is the author the individual employeecreator is not an author many sound recordings are considered works made for hire and theperformers are employees rather than authors they have rights as performers under the copyright act but the performancesphonograms treatygrants rights to performers query are the implementation bills which are silent onthese rights consistent with the minimum treaty obligations in the course of senate considera tion of the performancesphonograms treaty and congressional consideration of the implementation bills the record producersmay argue that the performers separate authorization rights are recognized underexisting us law through collective bargaining agreements and other contractualarrangements and that the performers ssign their economic rights to the producers through these contracts producers may further argue that implementinglegislation is needed to assure the economic rights of nonauthor performers 93 remuneration for broadcasts and public communications performers and producers of phonograms are entitled to single equitable remuneration for use ofcommercially published phonograms for broadcasting or any communication to thepublic 94 unless country exercises the reservation permitted by article 153 the existing united states copyright law does not provide full right of remuneration for broadcasts and communications to

under us copyright law eligibility to claim protection the performancesphonograms treaty like most intellectual property treaties establis hes certain rules or criteria to determine who is eligible to claim the benefits of the treaty 98 these rules are called eligibility criteria or points of attach ment the performancesphonograms treaty is unusual however in that it incorpor ates by reference the eligibility criteria of another treaty the 1961 rome convention the united states is not member of the 1961 rome convention so it is not rprising that our law may not be fully consistent with romes eligibility criteriahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97523crs32 99the eligibility criteria of us law are set forth in 17 usc 104 100sec 514 of pub l 103465 act of december 8 1994 codified as 17 usc 104a 101sec

and phonograms treaty by the 1996 geneva diplomatic conference culminates an international effort to modernizeprotection for performers and producers of phonograms that began as spinoffin 1992 from the related effort to modernize the berne copyright convention httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97523crs33 the united states had initially sought to include updated protection for sound recordings in the berne convention protocol process the united states proposalto protect sound recordings through the copyright convention was successfullyresisted by the european union and other countries who protect sound recordingsunder related or neighboring rights laws rather than under copyright laws the united states achieved another ma jor policy objective however the performancesphonograms treaty applies only to sounds of performance orrepresentations of sounds audiovisual performances such as performances byactors and actresses in motion pictures are not protected the diplomaticconference recommended further consider ation of protection for audiovisual performances through the development of protocol to the treaty by the end of1998 the performancesphonograms treaty significantly increases the international level of protection for phonograms ie sound recordings the term of protectionincreases from the 20 year minimum of the 1961 rome convention on neighboringrights to 50 year minimum the ri ghts of reproduction public distribution commercial rental and making available of phonograms to the public by wire orwireless means are recognized protection for phonograms expressly extends todigital electronic environments such as the internet and other computer networkssince these rights are granted separately to performers and producers of phonograms authorizations of both are required to us phonograms in the ways restricted by these exclusive rights single remuneration right however is gr anted in the case of broadcasts and communications to the public this nonexclusive right is also subject to areservation which allows country to qualif the right or not even grant the right at all this right applies to traditional one way broadcasts and public communications as distinguished from interactive communications which are covered by theexclusive making available to the public by wire or wireless means right performers are given two additional rights socalled moral rights and rights in unfixed performances moral rights include the right to be identified as the performer generally and the right to object to distortions or other modifications ofthe performance that prejudice the performers reputation limitations on rights are generally left to national law except that 1 some qualifications are expressed in the grant of rights articles and 2 article 16 specifically permits national law to enact limitations that do not conflict with normal exploitation of performances or phonograms and do not unreasonably harm thelegitimate interests of performers nd producers of phonograms in an agreed statement the diplomatic conference in terpreted article 16 of the treaty as permitting appropriate limitations in digital computer network environments the treaty also includes general article on enforcement of treaty rights an obligation to provide adequate and effective legal remedies to prevent thecircumvention of technological measures designed to inhibit unlawful copying and an obligation to assure adequate and effective legal remedies against knowingremoval or alteration of electronic rights management informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97523crs34 the

enactment of the minimal changes proposed in s 1121 and hr 2281 as introduced they initiallyargued that united states law is already consistent with the minimum obligationsof the treaty with respect to exclusive rights and limitations on rights they favored early ratification of the treaty and enactme nt of the bills to send an appropriate signal to other countries which would encourage other countries to adhere to thetreaty and generally upgrade protection for th use of sound recordings in electronic digital environments since the united states is major producerdistributor ofsound recordings it was asserted that enhanced international protection under theperformancesphonograms treaty will benefit the united states recording industry and the us economy in general groups representing the telecommunications and electronics industries libraries and other educational interests generally support the ratification of thewipo performances and phonograms treaty in principle but only on the basis ofimplementing legislation that addresses th eir concerns about osp liability fair use ephemeral copying distance learning and othe r issues concerning use of copyrighted works in digital electronic environments they argue that united states law is not settled concerning the scope of rights and lim itations on rights in digital electronic environments it is asserted that these issu must be addressed legislation rather than through judicial decisionmaking s 1146 and hr 3048 responded to many of the concerns of these groupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97523crs35 through the legislative process of hearings debate consideration and amendment the original implementation bills have been substantially modified s 2037 has replaced s 1121 as amended s 2037 and hr 2281 have

these proposals were not considered part of the wipotreaties implementation issues until titles v and vi were added to the bill passedby the house of representatives it appears that compromises have
