original enactment in 1975 one of the most contentious issues addressed in the 1997 legislation related to the discipli nary procedures applicable to children with disabilities idea was originally enacted in 1975 because children with disabilities often failed to receive an education or received an inappropriate education this lack of education led to numerous judicial decisions including parc v state of pennsylvania1 and mills v board of education of the district of columbia2 which found constitutional infirmities with the lack of education for children with disabilities when the states were providing education for children without disabilities as result the states were under considerable pressure to provide such services and they lobbied congress to assist them3 congress responded with the grant program still contained in idea but also delineated specific requiremen ts that the states must follow in order to receive these federal funds the statute provided that if there was dispute between the school and the parents of the child with disability the child must stay put in his or her current educational placement until the dispute is resolved revised stay put provision remains in idea issues relating to children with disabilities who exhibit violent or inappropriate behavior have been raised for years and in 1988 the question of whether there was an implied exception to the stay put provision was presented to the supreme court in honig v doe4 although the supreme court did not find such an implied exception it did find that ten day suspension was allowable and that schools could seek judicial relief when the parents of truly dangerous child refuse to permit change in placement in 1994 congress amended ideas stay put provision to give schools unilateral authority to remove child with disability to an interim alternative educational setting if the child was determined to have brought firearm to school in 1997 congress made significant changes to idea in pl 10517 and attempted to strike careful balance between the leas local education agency duty to ensure that school environments are safe and conducive to learning for all children including children with disabilities and the leas continuing obligation to ensure that children with disabilities receive free appropriate public education5 this current law does not immunize child with disability from disciplinary procedures but these procedures may not be identical to those for children without disabilities in brief if child with disability commits an action that would be subject to discipline school personnel have the following options suspending the child for up to ten days with educational services providedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20558crs3 6 for more detailed

hr 4141 106th cong one amendment offered by representative norwood concerned the discipline of child with disability who carries or possesses weapon the other amendment offered by representatives talent mcintosh and tancredo concerned the discipline of child with disability who knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs at school or commits an aggravated assault or battery at school the amendment offered by rep norwood required that each state that receives funds under the act shall require each local educational agency to have in effect policy which would allow school personnel to discipline child with disability who carries or possesses weapon at school in the same manner in which school personnel may discipline child without disability this would have included expulsion or suspension and child who is suspended or expelled would not have been entitled to continue educational services including the provision of free appropriate public education fape if the state does not require child without disabili ty to receive educational services after being expelled or suspended however local educational agency may have chosen to provide educational or mental health services for such child if such services are provided there was requirement to provide the child with any particular level of service and the location of the services is at the discretion of the local educational agency school personnel were permitted to modify the disciplinary action on case by case basis child with disability who is disciplined under this amendment would have been able to assert defense that the carrying or possession of the weapon was unintentional or innocen t this provision could have helped to address the problem of child with limited mental capacities who had someone place gun in his or her backpack however the exact implications of this provision are somewhat uncertain since it was not specified to whom or when this defense would be asserted the term weapon was defined as having the meaning given to dangerous weapon at 18 usc 930g2 that definition stated the term dangerous weapon means weapon device instrument material or substance animate or inanimate that is used for or is readily capable of causing death or serious bodily injury except that such term does not include pocket knife with blade of less than 2 ½ inches in length the amendment offered by representatives talent mcintosh and tancredo required that each state that receives funds under the act shall require each local educational agency to have in effect policy under which school personnel may discipline child with disability in the same manner as child without disability if the child withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20558crs5 disability 1 knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs

expelled would not have been entitled to continue educational services includ ing fape if the state does not require child without disability to receive educational services after being expelled or suspended however local educational agency may have chosen to provide educational or mental health services for such child if such services are provided there was requirement to provide the child with any particular level of service and the location of the services was at the discretion of the local educational agency school personnel were permitted to modify the disciplinary action on case by case basis as with the norwood amendment child with disability who is disciplined under this amendment would have been able to assert defense that the possession or use of the illegal drugs or the sale or solicitations of the controlled substance was unintentional or innocent this provision could have helped to address the problem of someone placing drugs in the backpack of child with limited mental capacities however the exact implications of this provision were somewhat uncertain since it was not specified to whom or when this defense would be asserted the amendment did not provide for any similar defense for an allegation of aggravated assault or battery the definition of controlled substance was the same as the definition in section 4141 of hr 4141 this section states that the term controlled substance means drug or other substance identified under schedule i ii iii or iv or v in section 202c of the controlled substances act 21 usc 812c illegal drug means controlled substance
