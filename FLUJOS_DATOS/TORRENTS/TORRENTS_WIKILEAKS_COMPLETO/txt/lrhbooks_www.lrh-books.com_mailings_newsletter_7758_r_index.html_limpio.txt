bridge publications inc newsletter date dear name what is the ultramysterious object every thetan creates continually yet which remains totally invisible to him lrh explained it this way in the first postulate lectures well when i discovered this one that the mind was obsessively mocking up something and then inhibiting it obsessively it became very clear why there was reactive bank and when you say rock you mean the core center of the reactive mind not for this lifetime not for the body not for freud but for the whole track it is what the thetan has been accumulatingly wrecking himself with from time immemorial and explains the dwindling spiral lrh from the rock delivered on 22 july 1958 and what exactly is the rock now definition of rock is that facsimile which the preclear is continuously and obsessively creating and which he is suppressing below his level of consciousness with an inhibitor the rock in other words is an obsessive creation it is almost totally identified with anything and everything wrong with the bank its keynote is aaa reference book one lrh from the rock delivered on 22 july 1958 its not just minor aberration that destroys an individuals ability but something much more sinister the very core of all aberration this and much more is the subject matter of the rock it was in july 1958 when lrh discovered this allimportant factor to handling cases and setting people free so important was this discovery that an entire advanced clinical course would soon follow dedicated to indoctrinating auditors on the subject the toughest and most exciting acc yet delivered the 20th advanced clinical course of 1958 was the toughest and most exciting acc yet delivered the knowhow of clearing was in place and the most profound secrets of unraveling the reactive mind were being taught by lrh and drilled and learned to perfection by these students since the release of the book dianetics the modern science of mental health in 1950 lrh had been actively codifying the language and the discipline that would allow others to clear people and in december of 1957 for the first time an auditor other than lrh had produced clear during the 19th acc in january 1958 student coauditors had begun clearing each other using the powerful new techniques lrh had developed then lrh isolated an even more direct route to the most fundamental aberration of any being but he knew that in order to successfully guide preclear down that route the auditor himself would need not only topnotch auditing skills but comprehensive understanding of the bank and how it works thus on 14 july 1958 the 20th advanced clinical course opened in washington dc with fiftytwo auditors in attendance the stage was set for broadscale clearing to occur the likes of which this universe
