six selected european countries belgium fr ance germany italy spain and the united kingdom none of these european count ries currently has single ministry or department equiva lent to the us department of homeland security in most of these countries responsibility for differe nt aspects of homeland security and counterterrorism is scattered across veral ministries and intergovernmental cooperation plays key role in addressing threats and challenges to domestic security in some countries such as the uk germany and belgium responsibility for homeland security affairs is also split among federal and regional or state governments the approaches of many european c ountries to protecting their publics and infrastructure have grown out of decades of experience in dealing with domestic terrorist groups such as the ira in the uk the basque terrorist movement eta in spain or the anarchist red army faction in germany even after the terrorist attacks of the last few years european c ountries have continued to view combating terrorism primarily as task for law enforcement and intelligence authorities some critics suggest that many european countri have been slow to bolster domestic protection efforts reduce societal vulnerabilities strengthen border controls and transport security and push the defense of european territory as far out as possible others contend that european governments have sought to integrate counterterrorism and preparedness programs into existing emergency management efforts thereby providing greater flexibility to respond to wide range of security challenges with often limited pers onnel and financ ial resources european parliamentary systems influe nce government decisions regarding homeland security policy and budgetary prior ities in the uk for example the government has parliament ary majority and as resu lt the governments proposedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33573crs2 budgetary levels are not usually contested in the same way as they often are in the united states strong executive in france largely directs homeland security efforts with minimal parlia mentary oversight spending prio rities in the different countries vary but most have devoted increased funds over the last severa l years to intelligence and law enforcement efforts against terrori sm funding for measures to strengthen transport security improve emergency pr eparedness and response counter chembio incidents and protect critical national infrastructure are more difficult to determine and compare among the countries given th at responsibility for these various issues is often spread among the budgets of different govern ment ministries all of the countries discussed in this report are members of the european union eu which in the years since september 11 has sought to boost police and judicial cooperation among its 25 member states bolster external border controls and harmonize immigration and asylum policies some analysts believe however that the eu should take more active role in ensuring european homeland security given the eus largely open borders and the acce ssion of central european countries that border less stable regions such as the balkan s they also argue that more extensive eu efforts to coordinate hom eland security affairs would help bring order and greater coherence to the myriad of government institutions engaged in protecting domestic security within each eu member state and encourage common security and budgetary priorities among all members some have proposed that the eu should establish at minimum homeland secur ity czar similar to its recently appointed counterterrorism coordinator other experts are skeptical that member states would be willing to cede greater sovereignty to the union in the area of domestic security which is central to national authority similar to the united states european c ountries are also struggling to find the appropriate balance between measures to imp rove security and respect civil liberties in the uk there has been vigorous debate on such issues germany spain and italy have traditionally guarded civil liberties strongly in light of their histories with authoritarian regimes but recent terrorist activity has prompted greater discussion of strengthening measures to ensure domestic security while france has long championed civil liberties such as free speech and freedom of religion french society also emphasizes the need for public order and has take n steps to enhance security since september 11 some us policymakers and members of congress are taking an increasing interest in how european countries are organizing and managing homeland security issues and emergency preparedness and re sponse in light of both recent terrorist activity and hurricane katrina which devastated the us gulf coast in august 2005 in seeking to protect us interests at home and abroad many us officials recognize that the actions or

official of the belgian embassy march 2006belgium1 belgian homeland securitycounterterrorism efforts background after the terrorist attacks of 911 an am erican offici characterized belgiums political will to cooperate in the global war on terrorism as fairly strong chiefly because it is linked to belgiums selfinterest the belgians do not want any terrorist activity to occur on their territory2 because the european union eu and nato are headquartered in their country the belg ians are sensitized to the terrorist threat but they are said to be anxious over whethe r they have sufficient resources to protect personnel at the two institutions some analysts believe that the belgians ability to deliver on their promises is at times somewhat challenged and that any type of domestic coordination is problematic in belgiums federated system of government in which policies must navigate the shoals of severa l levels of governme nt and three official languages in addition belgiums domestic political dynamic s act as something of constraint on cooperation the ethnic mistrust between the dutchspeaking flemings and the frenchspeaking walloons complicates matters finally some observers believe that brussels tends to place great deal of emphasis on process and as result the government is slow and bureaucratic belgium showed early leadership in c oordinating internati onal counterterrorist activities at the time of the september 11 attacks belgium held the revolving presidency of the european union s hortly thereafter police and antiterrorist officials from germany the netherlands and france met with their belgian counterparts in brussels to discuss effo rts to share information and coordinate counterterrorist strategy in additi on belgium pushed within the union for acceptance of euwide fasttrack extraditi on procedures for serious crimes like other eu countries however belgium has refused to deport suspected terrorists to countries where they might face the deat h penalty in 1987 belgium and the united states signed bilateral extradition treaty mutual legal assistance treaty signed the following year expedites communications by permitting requests to bypass standard diplomatic channels and be made directly between the us department of justice and the belgian ministry of justi ce extraditions may now be sought using provisional arrest request pending ex tradition and are conducted in accordance with mutual legal assistance treaty signed in january 20043 in june 2002 the us and belgian g overnments initialed an agreement permitting us

department official march 2006 8 background for this and other sections of the memorandum is based in part on information provided by officials of the us embassy in brussels work with belgian officials to screen freig ht containers to be loaded on vessels bound for the united states the accord is part of the bush administrations container security initiative csi under which foreig n ports are checked to prevent shipment to the united states of w eapons of mass destruction however belgiums laws on securityrela ted matters have pr oved controversial in the past for example the two suic ide bombers who assassinated former afghan northern alliance leader ahmed shah massoud on september 9 2001 were found to be carrying belgian passports until 1998 belgian pa ssports were issued by municipal officials and an estimated 3500 passports were stolen annually from poorlyguarded city halls af ter the united states applie d pressure even indicating that it might begin requiring visas for belg ians the country centralized its passport issuance process4 in 2004 belgium became the firs t country to introduce biometric based electronic passports the new travel documents are compliant with both us and eu requirements5 in addition in 2001 an article in the wall street journal criticized belgium for having some of the weakest antiterrorism laws in the european union making it popular among terrorists as place to hide out and plan attacks citing belgian sources the article maintained that because belgium had not suffered directly from terrorist acts in the recent past brussels had largely relegated the terrorism issue to back burner in the 1980s in an editori the newspaper singled out belgium as simply the only country whose elected offi cials have failed to ensure that the bureaucracy does not provide an obs truction to broa der interests6 belgium has since taken steps to address some of these issues in 2003 the legislature passed the terrorist offence act which amended th criminal code by introducing definitions relating to terrorism and spelling out punishme nt for belonging to or aiding terrorist groups in 2004 belgium passed law addressing the financ ing of terrorism and the following year approved legislation creating the legal framework for special anti terrorist investigations7 policies budget and institutional structure8 belgiums approach to homeland

to the final approval of the council of ministers as noted earlier the attacks of 911 made counterterrorism and emergency preparedness priority in belgium the subs equent terrorist bombings in madrid

napoleonic eras in wh ich authority lies primarily in the hands of the president and the prime minister france lacks the resources to undertake homeland security efforts comparable to those of the

french res ponse to terrorism violent radical groups have been active in france for many decades and strong state action has been used in response the greatest challenge from terrorists came in the

among all member states29 france and other eu members are attempting to control illegal immigration the effort has become enmeshed in debate that sometimes links terrorism to illegal immigration from the middle east point of view evident on the extreme right and in such antiimmigrant political organizations as jeanmarie pens national front party while france is part of the schengen plan which

the provisions of italys antimafia act to crimes committed for the purpose of international terrorism it extends the ability of law enforcement authorities to place suspected terrorists under surveillance to investigat the financial assets of family members to confiscate assets and to facilitate wiretapping and other searches following the july 2005 london bombings the italian par liament

september 11 italian authorities have encountered some difficulties in securing convictions while some analysts maintain that italys evidentiary bar remains set too high and that italys anti terrorist laws still contain some weaknesses others point to the lack of central anti terrorist prosecuting body as key problem currently antiterrorist investigations around the country are led by 26 diffe rent regional prosecutors who do not automatically share their findings with each other or with the intelligence services in addition there is central database of terrorist suspects as there is for the

terrorist attacks in madr id threw into sharp relief the threat of islamist terrorism in spain during the morning rush hour of march 11 2004 bombs exploded on four trains on madr id commuter rail line killing 192 persons and wounding over 1500 spanish author ities later said that the alqaedalinked moroccan islamic combatant group was invol ved in the attacks many observers believe that the march 11 attacks help ed determine the outcome of spains parliamentary election held three days later the socialist party won the election although preelection polls take n before the attack gave the thenruling popular party narrow majority prime minister zapatero has been careful to note that he does not see military solution to the problem of terrorism preferring to focus on law enforcement cooperation and by pursuing an alliance of civilizations with the muslim world spain unlike the united states has rejected wholesale reorganization of its homeland security institutions this is due in large part to the decadeslong struggle with the basque terrorist movement eta even before the 311 attacks spain had substantial body of law and institutional capacity to fight terrorism perhaps more than some european countries and th united states fo r this re ason the parliamentary commission that investigated the 311 attacks and the zapatero government focused instead on overcoming resource shortfalls in dealing with the specific threat posed by islamist terrori sm and on better coor dination within and among existing security and intelligence institutions76 another factor conditioning spains appr oach to the issue of homeland security is that the socialists and many other spaniards are leery of draconian security polices due to the countrys experience with francos authoritarian rule on the other hand civil liberty concer ns have not been as prominent in post311 discussions in spain as they have been in the united states since 911 this is in part because these issues have already been long debated in the context of the conflict with eta77 spains security structures the chief spanish ministry in homeland security affairs is the ministry of the interior the interior

civil guard which conducts border patrolling including at sea finance ministry force also conducts antismuggling patrols the civil guard has primary responsibility for security at critical infrastructure sites such as ports and airports as well as firearms and explosives control both the national po lice corps and the civil guard have special antiterrorist units and intelligence bodies local police forces play lesser role in counterterrorism efforts with the excepti on of police in the semiautonomous basque and catalan regions the march 11 co mmission recommended that local police be given more training in counterterrorism particularly involving islamist groups homeland security budgetary and policy priorities are set by the interior minister with the aid of his deputy the state security secretary the finance ministry sets the overall amount for inte rior ministry spending proposed 2006 interior ministry funding for all purpos is over 57 billion euros 68 billion78 the national police and civil guard which each have their own chains of command play key role in setting their own budg etary priorities the march 11 commission pointed out coordination problems between the national police and the civil guard such as failure to share key intelligence from their informants with each other and overlapping and redundant expe nditures the interior ministry formed unified command executive committee to coordinate the efforts of the two forces however the separate ope rational command structures of the two forces remain intact the creation of the unified command is intended to lead to the establishment of joint units of officers dealing with terrorism and organized crime as well as joint database on these issues the two forces would also pool resources in forensics intelligence and the disarming of explosives79 it remains to be seen whether these efforts will result in real change or whether old bureaucratic rivalries may reemerge the ministry of the interior is also responsible for emergency preparedness and response in spain general directorate for civil protec tion within the ministry is charged with developing and managing emergency preparedness programs spain has federal system of government each local government and autonomous community roughly equivalent to us state develops its own emergency preparedness plans however in the case of national emergency the central government can take over relief operations immediately the interior ministry has few small cbrn units after the march 11 attacks the ministry of the interior put

commission report bemoaned the lack of true intelligence community in spain concerns about the lack of coor dination between the cni and the interior ministry led to the establishment of national

operational coordi nation as well as information collection and exchange changes in spains secu rity policies since 311 as noted above the 311 commission cr iticized spanish authorities for not focusing enough on islamist terrorism for example spanish officials have admitted that police threw away wiretapping transcripts on march 11 terrorist suspects because they lacked sufficient numbers

double that currently received by local author ities from the central governments civil defense grant per year from 35 milli on to 70 million to better enable local authorities to carry out emergency planning in light of the threat from international terrorism this increase appears to respond to criticism that local authorities did not have the necessary resources to plan for terro rist incidents given that the civil defense grant had significantly decreased between 1991 and 2001 as result of the end of the cold war the civil contingencies secretariat reportedly played crucial role in securing this increase in resources for the civil prot ection work carried out by local authorities extra funding of about 543 million in 20062007 and 614 million in 20072008 will also be devoted to

jobs of high labour intensity that enta il difficult choices for police and intelligence services103 strengthening border controls and transport security t h september 11 terrorist attacks gave adde d momentum to uk efforts to tighten its immigration and asylum procedures to curtail illegal immigration and prevent terrorists or other criminals from abusing the uks asylum system among other measures the nationality immigration and asylum act 2002 introduces new right to carry scheme requiring air and sea carriers to check database to confirm that passengers pose known immigration or security

especially in the aviation sector were instituted after the bombing of pan am flight 103 ove r lockerbie scotland in 1988 but since september 11 the uk has further increased aviation security measures

reportedly ongoing following the july 2005 london bombings the uk will conduct trial screenings of passengers and baggage at small number of national rail and london underground stations during

department for transports transport security and contingencies director ate transec has insufficient personnel to carry out frequent and thorough inspections of port and airport secur ity measures and that the uk immigration service is also understaffe d others note that the uk has been struggling to balance new transport security requirements with the costs to the transport industry and the tr

parliament and to pass regulations deemed necessary for preventing or controlling crisis such as restricting public access to certain sites evacuate affected areas requisition property or ba n public gatherings during its passage through parliament the act encountered some re sistance from human rights and civil liberty groups concerned that its definition of an emergency was too broad and that it could lead to an unnecessary curtailment of freedoms to secure parliamentary approval the government tightened the finition of an emergency and included triple lock guarantee to ensure that the emergenc powers were only evoked in the event of serious threat that they were deemed necessary to cope with the situation and were propor tionate to the threat110 although analysts assess that the uk
