seven classifications lecture given on 28 november 1963 your applause is well received thank you all right what is the date audience november 28th twentyeight nov were still in the month of the russians your saint hill special briefing course ad 13 you notice that the daylight is fading and so forth daylights fading and that has nothing to do with the communist plot theypurely coincidental that they never have any sunshine in russia and so forth i just wanted to reassure you and the missilesthe missile situation is very good just nowvery very good just now they used them all up on guy fawkes day so they have i want to talk to you for momentthis lectures going to concern most anything its one of these potpourri type lectures of all ingredients that you can never realign in your notebooks that you can never assign on checksheet i wanted toi ended your last lecture with remark on classesnew classifications and this mightyou might find very very interesting and id better give you some rundown on this and so forth because were off for the long shoot now you see and i said that scientology would go as far as it worked and not as far as it was administered and that i could have gotten very busy on administration many many years ago and administered it out to some considerable distance and so forth so administration actually while getting great deal of attention and many instances very ably done in general has suffered for concentration because until you had the full technical picture i suspected all the waywere not now talking about clearing were talking about all the way until you had the full technical picture you could not lay out the administrative picture you see and i just had hunch without even thinking about it or articulating it that it would be impossible to lay out the administrative pattern of scientology and all of its administrative angles and designations without having clearcut and across the boards the technical data and this is very fortunate that this came about and was done this way because the technical data turned out to be pill that you took after breakfast or sudden shot in the gluteus maximus to make you clear or something or grow wings it turned out to be highly precise fantastically coordinated activity at the highest levels and it also turned out that individuals could not actually be audited at these levels unless they had been brought up to that point in gradients and it turned out that this was the case ill give you what imwhat im talking about here now i think you will agree that this is it because its not only just at the highest levels it also falls in at the lower levels lets try to pull some missed withholds on somebody who doesnt know what one is you say has anybody missed withhold on you well you know what missed withhold is so you say well missed withhold is soandso and soandso and its suchandsuch and its when you did this and when you did that and so forth and that is because of this and that and then theres double stimulusresponse cycle in scientology it goes like this the psychologist you see he thought that there was stimulus and response and he thought there was one cycle when you stimulized you got one response that was the limit of his thinkingness if you pushed button the button got pushed and that was all he thought ever happened and thats why psychology was limited you see but there is actually second curve you cant have in this universe stimulusresponse without getting stimulusresponse so its double cycle you see and this is all very simple but actually when you push the button when you push that buttoneven though it only said click remember when it clicked it was stimuli and your ears or hearingness responded to the click of the button didnt it so when you pushed button you got one stimuli response you pushed button and then it clicked well that was stimuli to which of course you get response yourself so there are always matter how slight the situation is you always have second stimulusresponse cycle going on for every stimulus response and the pc will sit there looking at you wondering well let assure you the middle of an intensive is not time to take up this information youve thrown him philosophic conundrum which has never before been propounded in the literature and philosophy of this planet which is to say you cannot act without consequences thats philosophic see there must be consequences for every action the buddhist ran up against this same thing and he answered it in an entirely different way he said the buddhist said well in view of the fact that you get consequence for everything you do he dimly understood this was the case you see he didnt articulate it why you better not cause anything and his answer to it is dont cause in other words the only way to avoid stimulusresponse consequences of another stimulusresponse occurring is of course start stimulusresponse mechanisms push buttons do nothing cause nothing and that was his answer to the situation well the worldand believe the chaps who are walking up and down the highways and byways and sitting in the palaces and at thein the day of gautama siddharthawere as reasonable if not more so at the rawmeat level you see than they are today i mean youve got the same breed of cat theres reason to downgrade the people he was talking to you see and he came to this conclusion and from that day to this the buddhist you see tries not to cause anything that was his solution to problem well we have another solution to the problem is you can audit it out thats much more forward method of doing so but at what level is all this taking place im afraid that youre really not talking to the man in the street you must be talking to trained scientologist and i dont think youll even put this across at level ii i think this is level iii proposition according to my new levels here you get theyou get the idea this is pretty profound actually its the question of right conduct is it right to cause things can you really cause anything if somebody gets into total chaos he sayshe gets this proposition can you cause anything do you ever really cause anything you find some birds wandering around and they will tell you well by association you never really caused anything because where do you find the start of the cause cycle of course the start of the cause cycles very easily answered the start of the cause cycle is where you say the cause cycle started you just nominate it but youll get this and if you want to really throw somebody say all right take rifle all right now somebody gets killed now if we examine this very carefully from stimulusresponse mechanism we find out that the trigger of the riflewell we say the rifle really killed somebody because that actually you see had the bullet and the powder and had the barrel to direct the thing you see and so it actually was the cause point wasnt it its obviously because its the start of the causepoint so your comm cycle there is causedistanceeffect it naturally starts with rifle all right the fellow comes along and he says well this couldnt possibly be true because somebody squeezed the trigger and therefore it was the impulse that squeezed the trigger that caused the rifle to fire and therefore the finger was the start of the stimulusresponse cycle somebody else comes along and he says that isnt so it was the thought pull the trigger which caused the finger to pull and which caused the rifle to fire so therefore the stimulusresponse cycle takes place at the thought pull the trigger and then somebody comes along and he says it couldnt be that at all because obviously there was some motivation for this it must have been the motive the person thought that he had reason to do this so therefore the reason he had to do this was actually the start of the stimulusresponse cycle somebodybehaviorist comes along and he says that couldnt be the casecouldnt be the case at all because the fellow got that reason from his early childhood and so forth so actually what started the whole cycle was the persons early childhood you see people were mean to him or something of this sort and they complained when he threw spitballs at them you know and so therefore it was really his early childhood that caused this whole thing and the child psychologist comes along and he explains to you very rapidly that of course you cant just say something nebulous like early childhood you see you must assign it to something so therefore whose influence was the greatest over him was it his mother or his father all right and they finally figure it out that his mother pulled the trigger with you see the nonsense we get into as soon as we startwell actually you just take anyanything in this universe of course is so tied in with the rest of the universe that you can just keep tracking back endlessly and so on fortunately for us there is prime thought and its way back there on the track at the beginning of the actual gpms and you could track all cause for the individual back to prime thought well thats great there is stopping point somewhere but without knowing that particular data the rest of this data gets very esoteric and the philosophical conundrums which it gives and the number of humanitarian quote sciences which it gives birth togenetics behaviorist philosophies and so on you can just start counting these things on the fingers of fivearmed wonder see and theres just lots of them and youve got yourself ayouve got yourself where did anything start and then you must then conceive that it must have started nowhere see must have started nowhere and it was all out of everybodys control to begin with so you better not do anything about it well the people get so intrigued you see trying to trace this cause this initial impulse for the stimuli back that they never realize that that stimuli actually causes another stimuli cycle right in front of it you squeeze the finger around the trigger of rifle which then fires and theres going to be some repercussions it might only be the recoil of the rifle dont you see but in actual fact the puller of the trigger is going to receive something from the act it might only be the recoil of the rifle it might only be the responses whichor pardon the stimuli which then start at the other end which come back and hit the individual dont you see weve recently had very gruesome example of this i think in twentyfour hours the guy was dead see he fired rifle and twentyfour hours later boom hes dead you see stimulusresponse well if he hadnt fired the rifle he wouldnt be dead see thats very interesting to examine from philosophical standpoint all right now you get your overt actmotivator sequence and now we can go into whole bunch of other thinkthink on this thing did he get shot because he shot was it very involved wasnt it just that he delivered an overt of shooting and received motivator of shooting wasnt that just about what that amounted to or was it wider than this would the word consequence have to do with the moral values of his act see we can go into another big wide perimeter of think here see moral values of his act dluhh so on and so on and so on we can get awfully spread out truth of the matter is you cant pull the finger of the rifle without receiving another stimulusresponse cycle it cant be done in this universe its impossible simply that it doesnt matter if i now ill give you an example we havent said how much stimuli and how much response dont you see how much cause and how much effect we put it into scientology language now we take this emeter and now i am going to turn on the sensitivityi mean the onoff switch of this emeter see now listen all right thats fine i turned it on and then that click occurred at this particular point and it itself was new cycle of stimuli which then i heard and impinged on my eardrum see im not talking about the seriousness of things were not even really talking about the comparable magnitude were certainly talking however about stimulusresponse mechanisms are met with stimulusresponse mechanisms cause and effect cycle is always met with cause and effect cycle you cant have cause and effect cycle without receiving cause and effect cycle then it gets to be contest of how tough are you and how much can you confront therefore what you cause is monitored only by how much you can confront if you can confront getting shot shoot you see if you cant confront getting shot dont shoot and actually moral conduct would simply be only causing those things which can be confronted by those theyre caused to and there in scientology is an actual route around the overt actmotivator sequence there is an answer to this dont cause things others cant confront this way you certainly minimize the stimulus response stimulusresponse curves you go around shooting people youre liable to get shot all right maybe this would be all right if you can confront getting shot yourself maybe or maybe not but thats very first dynamicy proposition let assure you exclusively on the first the trouble is we do not live alone you can go out and sit on satellite for umpteen trillion years sooner or later youre going to youre going to meet somebody else sooner or later i can guarantee it ive sat on some satellites and things for quite few years and sure enough somebody always turned up you wait long enough somebody always turns up that youve got guarantee of see now if we look over the proposition which is put before us here we find out then that if you cause things which others can confront or which others wish to confront and so forth why you lead rather unrestimulated existence but if by your acts of omission and acts of commission are causing things others cant confrontthat is to say itd be greatly to their detriment if they even tried to confront them such as of course starting war or something like this with its fantastic ramificationsif you set yourself up to be directly responsible for this particular type of cycle why you can expect to get your head knocked off thats for sure eventuallyeven though you think you could confront it you see you could say well i can confront all the effects of war so therefore its all right if i start war its going to generate some effects you cant confront because you generated some effects they couldnt confront the overt is generating effects which are unconfrontable and the motivator is inevitably going to be the generation of effects which are unconfrontable so you see the limited first dynamicy view of well i can shoot somebody because i dont mind getting shot therefore it makes it all right if i shoot somebody that doesnt hold good because actually the overt isnt shooting somebody the overt is causing an effect somebody else couldnt confront and the motivator of it is going to be the cause of an effect that you cant confront i dont care it might be some entirely different type of effect but itll be something you cant confront well thats the story of this universe whats omitted from all this that any given instant the thetan can get an idea totally independent of all other ideas and thats what puts in randomity into the whole situation and any given idea any given moment any given thetan can thunk one independent of everything else thats going on now the psychologist didnt believe this so his work is limited other earlier philosophers didnt believe this the idea was never really envisioned which was independent postulation he always thought you had to do it on association and they set you up trap the old idea of you will always make goldthe alchemist jokeyou will always make gold if you go to the top of mountain at midnight and you get on the top of this mountain and you take an old stump and you put three pieces of lead in the stump and you say this charm over those pieces of lead providing the phase of the moon is full if you do not think of the word hippopotamus the lead will turn to gold you can see it now all right somebody will always think of the word hippopotamus because hes not supposed to all right similarly theyll set up proposition like thistheyll prove it to you conclusively you cannot think of an independent thought the reason you cant think of an independent thought you see is every time you try to think of an independent thought you will see that it is associated with some thought that has already been thought then theyll look at you smilingly like cheshire cats having set up the hippopotamus mechanism you see and just leave you in vain struggling through trying to think of an independent thought that is not associated with any independent thought well of course thats silly because you are already in association by having the idea that you should think of an independent thought without associating it with any other independent thought so that is the independent thought you get the trickery and trappery involved in this kind of stuff well just because you could always do weird tricks with association is reason association is total all of everything and association the idea of association you think of ice cream you think of hot day you think of child see stream of consciousness writers call it and you think of this and then youcause that you thought of that and everybodys got his life all dreamed up as all thoughts were consecutive to an associative base someplace or another which in itself didnt exist so they dont ever look for primary or independent base therefore they start to predict human behavior in very interesting and peculiar way they predict human behavior along this particular line and say that it is predictable see they want to predict human behavior so they never recognize that human behavior can be unpredictable as part of its prediction part of the prediction of human behavior is the fact that it is unpredictable and the reason for that is any thetan at any given time in any given place can get totally independent idea all off his own bat without any assistance from anything now thats rather weird and wild proposition which exists exclusively in the area of scientology that somebody can think an independent thought well of course you can prove to everybody conclusively that people cant think independent thoughts by telling them that any thought they think is associated so try to think of thought now that is not associated with any indepenwith awith guy will go lets see i canall right ill think of that door i couldnt think of that door because its there and of course the fact that its there made think of to think of the door you eventually go down scale you say well i cant think of an independent thought in other words selfdeterminism of think is taken away from person in this particular universe and then we get up to the proposition then of how much think can person tolerate how much think can person think he has thunk we see that all the time in the overtmotivator sequence we start running somebody on what have you done what have you withheld what have you done what have you withheld and that sort of thing and they give you motivator motivator motivator movitator motivator motivator motivator motivator you say what have you done and they will say well i sat down here so you could ask meive done something to myself by sitting down here and letting you ask these horrible questions thats the overt see youd be surprised weve got quite catalog around here of overts that are motivators we used to keep lists on them some kinds of questions that students would answer in motivatorish fashion see now what have you done since you came to saint hill dont you see well i made myself come to saint hill and ive done something to myself so therefore that is an overt you see they go on this way by the hour and of course theyre giving nothing but motivators motivators and not really answering the question theyre making it very reasonable but theyre really not answering the question it gets worse and worse and worse and their tone arm will get stickier and stickier and theyll plow in harder and harder see until all of sudden they say well i did this and i did that and i pinched another students biscuits and so forth and all of sudden theyll start coming up the line again dont you see well this is concept of responsibility so what is the relative concept amongst beings well you find the fellow out there in the street and man its all been done to him this was the great appeal of dianetics see its all been done to you somebody tries to tell you dianetics and scientology are the same thing you might bring up this fact of responsibility in dianetics it was all done to you and responsibility level of scientology is you done it makes scientology relatively not unpopular but makes it higher toned somewhat different but there is difference between these two subjects one concerns the mind and the interrelationships of mental image pictures and the other concerns the adventures of the human spirit but man is spirit he is not an animal these are entirely different subjects if you want to look at it bluntly all right so we are faced with problem then of the tremendous popularity of irresponsibility it was all done to the individual then can conceive so easily in this universe that it was all done to him that he never had an independent thought that he never thought of anything that ever had anything to do with anything that he himself never started an action youd be surprised kleptomaniacs are always pulling this as defense that the garment just moved off the counter and into their bag and they actually say this and people think they are joking see they dont realize that the kleptomaniac thinks thats what happened hell see his armhell see this independent arm go up and pick the article off the counter and put it in the shopping bag you see he sees this happen very detachedly see he had nothing to do with it you know arm comes up arm comes up the common criminal the common criminal knows at levels of responsibility which are quite interesting they watch themselves do things and they see these things have happened but they know they didnt do it that its due and owing to some other factor or force that it occurred they have all sorts of ideas for instance they think that everybody pretends that people own things see they know thisthey know this is lie that everybody else knows is lie and that has been dreamed up everywhere and that everybody has agreed on for one reason only to get them to give you slighter amplification of this the fellow knows that nobody owns anything you see he knows that nobody really owns anything anywhere but they have entered into conspiracy which they pretend see they pretend that people think people own things and this is done for only one reason these other people pretend this to get them personally in trouble that is actually the thinkingness level of criminal that accounts for the little sly sneer you see on their faces sometimes they know everybody else is just pretending that it was crime they can be gotten to just because everybody else pretends its crime see everybody else is being very nasty to them they say certain things exist you see and thats just to get them in trouble these things dont really exist and people believe these things just to get them in trouble courts and that sort of thing only existnot because there is such thing as crimethey just exist so that they can pretend outrageous and unreasonable things so that they can get this poor guy you see and they know thats the way things are and of course operating in that frame of work why they then have the total reality of the uncriminalness of all criminal acts now the police are going up against mechanism of this particular kind and character in order to stamp out crime now thats one of the most remarkable situations in the world the cop actually they have rather widely particularly in the us borrowed lot of our definitions with regard to crime criminal cant work criminal rahrahrah that i wrote some little essays on at one time or another and theyve gotten about ive heard them echoed back but they dont realize this horrible fact that anybody theyre arresting for stealing the carthe guy just overtly stole this carthe person that they are arresting would horrify them if they could look into his head and find out what he was really thinking he knows he knows this fellow who stole the ear that the police are just bunch of frauds that the car really never belonged to anybody and that the police are fraudulently pretending that cars are owned in order to get the fellow who drove this one off in trouble and that somebody else who owned the car is just pretending that he owned the car this is one of the reason mest goes to pieces amongst criminals and so forth they know nobody owns it doesnt belong to them doesnt belong to anybody this is very fantastic frame of mind of course thats total unreality total this and that maybe at the highest levels and so forth maybe it is kind of joke that everybody owns everythnothat anybody owns anything and so forth nevertheless these are the agreements upon which this society is built and failure to recognize the rights of other individuals with regard to their zones and spheres of ownership is bound to bring about chaos of magnitude and to not respect those spheres of ownership of course is to sow overt acts that are just madness themselves nothing can operate actually communism gets very accurate designation because it really believes nationally that nobody really ever owns anything and of course they enforce it as state thats why it tends to attract so many hot rod criminals into its commissar ranks and they got plenty this idea is basically criminal idea all right now lets go little bit further than this there of course is very subnormalsubusual i should sayidea that is much below the social level youre getting into ideas which are down into the bottom of the sewer you see theyre way below what you would consider normal now youre dealing however with what is basically neurosis and at some levels this becomesit becomes worse it becomes of course some kind of psychosis its perfectly all right to kill people because they dont exist is one of the homicidal characteristics of thought i didnt shoot him i didnt shoot him and one of the reasons hes basing thisi didnt shoot anybody hes more likely to say because of course the other person didnt exist so therefore you know how could he have shot him his reasonabilityperson will be lying there in mass of blood and hed say well ii didnti didnt do anything to anybody see why because there was nobody there everyone around that person is figment of his own imagination and he recognizes the delusory nature of his own imagination which gives him universe which is quite interesting but we are not talking actually now in classification about such subnormal levels of thought were not talking about psychosis were not talking about neurosis were just talking about this guy out here in the street and this boy out here hes walking around he has his own difficulties the most common difficulty at this particular time and space common to most nations of the planet is that it was done to them this is pretty much the common denominator of their think it was done to them the way they areas they are right nowis the way they are because something was done to them that made them that way that is their big think about it the responsibility for their state of beingness is exterior to their own control they cannot control their own state of beingness its always exterior to them iveas writer i usedmy hair used to stand on end on one peculiar little phobia i used to have i have just published story or something like that and itd be all over the newsstands and id be all swelled up on myself something like this andnever seem to wear off matter how many stories you publish youre always glad to see them and i dont know its probably second dynamic manifestationthetans always happy to see his creations around you know for some reason or other and some fellow you know one of these lipmoving writers you know tongue inheld between his teeth you know and little stub of pencil and you know fellowsto sign his name you see or make out bill or something like that hell say oh he says i always wanted to be writer i always wanted to be writer but the trouble was i didnt have the education it always used to strike as peculiar because not one fellow said it to this is totally generalized remark i heard it everywhere it was inevitable that this remark would be made in the course of any conversation oh yes youre hubbard i saw one of your pictures recently or something like this see or i saw something or other and so forth and you just wait for moment because here it came you see i always wanted to write but i didnt do so because i didnt have the education you know i never really figured out the pat response for that stimuli i could be counted on to change the subject or to ask them how the weather was going to be or how their wives were or something of the sort but it was almost inevitable this was of course from one point of view on one profession but the generalization of this particular activityit didnt mean that some of them wouldnt have written dont you see it didnt mean that they were being in contest with anything it didnt mean they were probably doing anything but agree but what im calling to your attention is itthe reason they didnt write had to do with their education and this made to in the first couple of years as pro writer particularly stood my hair on end because all during that period of time i was hectically fiendishly frantically trying to jettison and throw overboard all of the education i had gratuitously and horrifyingly been given on the subject of writing i was writing in spite of very good training in this particular field almost killed by the time you get over all these instilled phobias from somebody else you have hard time now whats this mean it means that in little banal ordinary type of conversation that didnt have anything to do with anything somebody else had the responsibility that personperson wasnt writing because they werent writing or because they were too lazy to write or they didnt have time to write or they just werent writing they couldnt say this it had to be an exterior stimuli of which they were the response it had to be an exterior cause of which they were the effect you bring up almost anything with the average being and he will always handle it in this fashion ordinarily handle it in this fashion and then he will say theres an exterior cause that which i am the effect his conversation if you want toever want to read letters exchanged by members of the american middle westthose are the most educative letters on the subject of health i think i have ever really read ive read lots of them at one time or another ive seen lots of them around for awhile i was so horrified that i had the fixation of the you couldnt stand to look at it so you went and looked at it you know this kind of fixation on the subject and id see letters from mrs johnson you see to mrs brownand mrs brown in sioux city was being told by somebody in kansas city just the common news of the day you see and uncle ralph you see has his lumbago and so forth and so forth and they had to take poor irmas blahblah out the other day and so forth and it runs off this horrible medical catalog the letter you think of holding it up you know and the blood just drips off of one corner of it you see and the rest of it is unreadable because of the disease germs effecttheyre just fixated on the idea of effect causative cause is just lost to this wide greatest majority of peopleanything causative now one of the things which you err in when you try to disseminate scientology is not estimating this exact aspect where it comes about on the this mythical characterthe man in the street you dont estimate how much cause he is willing to be responsible for see you hit him at where you live which is youre willing to be responsible for some cause dont you see well hes not willing to be responsible for any cause hes effect life has done it to him if he had just been left million dollars then he would be able to go down and look at the ocean once in while himself if he hadif he hadyou see if it hadnt happened to him that if his uncle snodgrass had not died then if you see hes effect effect hes telling you all the time im the effect of this horrible thing called life im effect of all this trickery im the effect of all this nonsense im the effect of all these other things well he gets into that mood quite honestly because believe he is the effect of an awful lot of interesting things you see theres not some lack of truth in this see at any given instant why his boss can take sudden dislike to him or something like that and hes out in the rain dont you see at any given instant why some bug comes walking down the boulevard you know and gives him nip and hes up there in the hospital with four thousand dollar bill facing him you see wild and horrible things can happen to this individual he can be the effect of so many things that he actually cant think of himself as ever being cause of anything at all so you have some mother whose boy has gone zigzag down the bad road or something like this and she cant think of herself as ever having any part of any of that you know cant think of herself as having caused any part of it cant take responsibility for anything that ever happened to this fellow you see shed take refuge in such thingsall famous criminals mothers incidentally almost uniformly say at the time the criminal is executed he was good boy its just happened again in america he was good boy thats right oswald was good boy that was the adjudication of his mother see they dont think any further than that but they can actually go into an inversion of this and just try to deny all reality with regard to any of the existing situation one doesnt say that she should take full responsibility for the matter but why is she interested in being an effect of it if she couldnt cause it and one of the errors which you make on dissemination of course is try to make the fellow take hold of any cause at all dear old peggy conway told one time or another i was going along in life she says i was going along in life and i was doing all right and i was doing okay i just knew that everybody else was the reason for all of my troubles and difficulties and that i had nothing to do with it whatsoever at all and i knew that if i believed in certain things and i acted in certain ways and so forth then somehow or another i would get through somehow not very well and all of sudden you come along and you tell just all right stand out there in the open now stand on your own two feet now be responsible for whats going on in your life she says it was horrible shock tis too you justbut look look at how low this level is look at how low this level is if you just intimatedthis would be gradient on it if youd just intimated there may be certain zones and sections in your existence which if you think them over very carefully you may find you have had causative action in if you think them over very carefully and sort them out you may find that some zone of your life you have actually caused something we dont say it very much we say at one time or another you decided to read book and you decided to read the book and your cause there was deciding to read the book see well perhaps theyd buy it on that but ordinarily if you just dump it on their heads say look youre responsible for everything that ever happened to you whats really wrong with you is youve been doing so many weird things with your bank and coming along and thinking of postulating this sort of thing and so forth and moving on up to present time and so forth wonder youre in horrible condition see and they go uhhhhh well they want to be an effect thats the comfortable agony to be in thats the most comfortable conceivable agony is to be at the total effect point of all of existence now you take this fellow and you show him or her you show them this little little bit thatyou show them there are couple of rules in life and you show them something or other and they get bit wiser suddenly they look at these things and then they apply rule or two of this well you tell them about communication arc triangle or something like this if youve got them up that high and they apply this or you show them how to do touch assist and train them up just like you were training pro auditor you see until they could really stick there and you know feel my finger you know do that touch assist real good give them very disciplined run of touch assist and so on and they all of sudden are working on somebody one day and horrible shooting pain goes through the guys skull and he suddenly snaps out of it and hes okay see fantastic hes caused something the person who did that touch assist has caused something entering it philosophically saying look old fellow you in actual fact are the cause of certain things in your life just to think it over he might be able to pick this up on thinkthink basis but in actual fact he wont believe it if you show himif you show him that he can talk to his wife or he can do touch assist on his friend or something like this it gradually starts dawning on him that he can cause something he doesnt really wish particularly to look back that youre the one who taught him to do it because he is doing the action and at that entranceand he can cause an effect and he realizes that he is causing the effect now people who are the most saddled with religious superstition are the hardest to bring out of this rut ireland was terrible example to us in that particular line because the one lecture that laid complete egg every week was the lecture which was devoted to creation and of course this ran straight into the eighth dynamic and went up beautifully exploded and fell to the ground in little bits and pieces because nobody could create anything and finally the instructors over there got very clever and they got up to point of saying you could make chair could you make chair therefore you have created chair and eventually itd get around it was heresy dont you see utter heresy god had created everything and therefore they could not have created anything without actually running into heresy its the first time i noticed this principle at work actually create is the wrong word to use its cause cause did they cause anything and we wouldnt have had that much difficulty but you can argue with the man for long time as to what he can cause you can process him in this direction and so forth you might get someplacewould get someplace but you could be very philosophic and you could be very involved without making very much progress can you cause anything do you cause anything ah but the areas where he knows everybody fails are the areas of human relationship communication health wellbeingnessthese particular areas these are very desirable effects these are effects that somebody else wants good communication feel better and so forth all right well hes then obeying this original rule that i gave you cause only those effects which others can confront or that want see now youve given him that and then you give him some tools and train him up well in the use of these tools and let him find out that he can cause an effect and you have snapped him out of this endless cycle of stimulusresponse stimulusresponse everything has consequence anything you do youd better not do anything because if you do do it then youll get your teeth kicked in therefore you better be very idle therefore youd better be nothing but an effect because your teeth have been kicked in already thinkthinkthink figurefigurefigure does anybody ever really start an original action see all of theseall of these questions you see the point is it isnt these people are ignorant of philosophy these people have failed in the field of philosophy its not that anybody doesnt want philosophy they just dont believe it could exist anymore you see these men out here on the street we dont care what the savants up in the university are saying about matters of life and death and is it true or isnt it true that eight needles can stand on the head of an angel were not interested about any of their philosophic conundrums were not the least bit interested nor in their opinions because they are not the living world theyre pretty dead one if you want to know the truth of the matter i went into university one time dusted off professor and talked to him for few minutes put him back in his chair and left i suppose hes there yet thats very very cruel of actually that particular university they were very very anxious to see methey were very very happy to see because theyd been trying to write science fiction stories around there too and theyd never made the grade thats far from the totality of my writing but that was why they were interested anyway these savants and their definitions and so forth seem to upgrade the field of philosophy to point where it is an untouchable area its plateau that nobody could ever ascend to one must know propounding words and propound words like telekinesis and must be able to have an insight into the writings of hume as locked into the writings of locke as modified by hecouldnt mr kant see and one must be able to give forth verbatim whole page pocketapocketapocketapocketa of lucretius you see without even pausing for colons in order to be philosopher and actually this is their zone and area of philosophy and that isnt the zone or area that philosophy was ever designed for that isnt the zone or area where its ever bought and it must be that theyre studying some kind of dead philosophy that nobody wants for it to reach plateau of this particular kind so it leaves the whole world open to this very very marketable commodity called philosophy i say marketably not for financial reasons but everybody wants this thing because the philosopher the fellow is that little guy out in the street except hes failed in this particular field he wants to know vaguely dimly almost forgotten wanting to know it who am i what am i what am i doing here what are people where did this universe come from what happens to when i die where am i going why is it that you really cant succeed in life here what is thawhat happens to people why dont they like what is the truth about raow and actually some circuitry in the head of every skull on this planet and the guy himself is going around at some low level saying those exact questions and those are the basic questions of philosophy and that philosophy hasnt answered them has put it on plateau so that everybody can pretend that philosophy has answered it but cant ascend to the plateau to find out the greatest defeat philosophy ever had was immanuel kant saying oh well theres the knowable and the unknowable and some things are so unknowable that nobody ever knowsis going to know them and so forth the unknowable is just unknowable and thats all thats insanity man will you please explain to how he would ever find out there was an unknowable if nobody could ever know about it and as far as religion is concerned and its answers are very unsatisfactory because god made everybody thats wonderful thing i mean it doesnt take any time at all to say it god made everybody see and people go running around with this one god made everybody god made everybody you know thats wonderful glib prime cause is announced right there bang ecclesiastical councils can sit around and propound this for thousands of years dont you see boy are we learned marvelous learnedness here goes out by the ream and they say it in latin with organ music awful waste of good organ music anyhow what this all adds up to herewhat all this adds up tois one question from little child can puncture the whole thing little child says who made god so we go on this stimulusresponse track looking for answers forever you see and were just on an endless treadmill of course we come to full stop until we realize that every being is an independent being who is himself capable of expressing thought or intention independent of all other thoughts and intentions at any given instant as soon as we recognize that every individual is capable of himself being causative we have slightest approach to answers we cant answer anything but as soon as we accept that as basis for action basis for thought as soon as we realize that its the degree that an individual can accept or execute causation independent of other influences that brings about his state of case we then have cracked the whole riddle of philosophy theres nothing left to philosophy to be stupid about now if we introduce physics into it and say all things are relative to all things in time stream and the time stream is invariable and uneradicable and so forth weve already accepted our distance into prime thought were that far from prime thought weve already postulated time now of course youre on the treadmill of you must never be able to escape this time so all things happening in the past must influence all things that happen in the future and then everything is inevitable and lets all go down and die quietly in the barn together see i mean that becomes utter nonsense as soon as we got time stream dont you see then all befores influence all afters and then we can prove because the time stream exists that nobody can be cause until we realize that the time stream is capable of postulation time stream can both be caused and escaped from and if this is possible then of course we get another higher level of cause so i tell youlisten to nowthe only thing im giving you all this aboutyou might find it useful you might find it entertaining in the field of dissemination it might give you some answersyou say to somebody all right now you realize that youre the cause of this bad marriage now just be more causative and straighten out the bad marriage see bloomm that isnt just an error thats an arc break that is so far from this individuals reality on the subject you see so you might have some answers to dissemination along in this particular line but what im trying to tell you here what im trying to tell you here is the basis of classification now weve hadgotten lot of technology and technology is very valuable and anybody tried to swallow it all off one spoon hed get an awful bellyache theres one rule about it by the way theres one rule in disseminationbefore i leave the subject of dissemination i will give you one little tip on the thing if you only tell people things about scientology that you yourself have an excellent reality on and have experienced youll find youll just communicate like shot to almost anybody because your rfactor in you is so high that you cannot help but put it across to others its an interesting rule in dissemination youll hear more of this later and it probably could be stated much more aptly than i have just stated it because i havent worked it over at all for good statement but its just more or less that if you talk to people about things that you yourself have an excellent reality onand the best way to have reality on it is of course to experience somethingwell youll find out youll communicate like bomb and nobody ever doubts you then they say this scientologys wonderful wonderful stuff i mean the fellow and so forth just look at him you know and there he is and so on i was very interested at level of reality that charles in here my man there hes an old sailor and hed been everyplace and done everything you know and so on he met somebody up in pub and some student or other had not really acquainted this fellow with the facts of scientology and he was able to communicate to this person and he had this person swinging over from their bunch of bums and rats over in time he actually was unconsciously applying this rule he said well ive been down at saint hill he said for several months and i feel much better that was his total argument in selling scientology been down at saint hill for several months and i feel much better i think that youi think that you will consider this an interestingly mild little piece of dissemination but in actual fact that was his reality see he does feel better for having been down here for several months see but that of course carried fantastic conviction it was just like bullet that was his total reality on the subject and he just delivered it across and that was all there was to it it arrived with complete truth because it was complete truth from its point of origin dont you see it isnt the startling thing you say its the real thing you say and it isnt whether or not its real to the fellow youre talking to but whether or not its real to you youd be surprised how well you could communicate if you had wart in your left ear at one time and you had some processing and it disappeared tell this person all about this wart disappearing you know and they say scientologys good thing you know and youre good communicator you know youre really talking sounds wild see or maybe i had ai had ai used to worry all the time i used to worry all the time about whether it was good or bad thing or id been bad boy for not going to church and i dont worry about that now the guysa benefit hes had see and the fellow hearing it at the other end will what do you know youll find out itll arrive in every case with terrific impact by the way this was called to my attention by people talking about things on which they had reality and i suddenly got codification of exactly how you could talk to somebody with total reality i thought that was helpful people dont often tell things that are helpful but that one did all right in this other particularthats enough of that i want to tell you about this classification scale because it doesive had to work it out one way or the other and ive seen the necessities for it and so forth but all classification scale is is willingness to accept cause over ones destiny and that of others thats all classification scale is its scale of willingness to accetake cause over theones own destiny and that of others be at cause in other words degree of being at cause now of course down scale madmen get into an obsessive cause you know and every once in while somebody will come along and consult on the fact that he has to have processing because hes got to take over control of england or something of this sort and wipe out europe you know it doesnt seem to to be very real then we try to find out if the guy can remember what he ate for breakfast and we find out he cant so this of course is susceptible to various reinterpretations but in actual fact you could get it every time just by test of ow what is the fellow what has he done and what has he withheld now of course this of course is also susceptible to misinterpretation because some fellows have done horrible things and they tell you these things without any responsibility whatsoever but there you are merely looking at lack of social sense we are not discussing however how you measure this we are not discussing how you measure this were just giving it to you as the basic formula on which classification is founded and cause is not expressed in actions in life but in case responses you understand its cause over or in ones own case that we are discussing were not asktalking about the person being causative in various zones and dynamics and areas were just talking about his level of responsibility in his own case level now lot of these factors can shake out and they can actually be plotted person of very high levels of responsibility has certain abilities and perceptions mentally which are very evident theyre quite evident theyre processing of one kind or another theseyou only get fooled with these for lack of experience some fellow who apparently never arc breaks may be totally incapable of assuming cause see he never arc breaks hes very quiet good pc but never makes any case gains see unless theyre very carefully processed and you dont realize this until after while you see that this case is not making any progress whatsoever his level of cause is not increasing or improving and he eventually may come up to point where he will arc break this is your propitiation case of which you are well acquainted always tell the auditor in sort of sadlookingfrom sad looking eyeabout his case oh yes i made some good results insession thank you so on you hear him afterwards saying well yes he isnt so good but i have to be nice you see its all sort of washed out ive even seen propitiative manic the like of which you never saw you know process the person gets better gets tone arm action nothing of the sort and at the end of the session you know tell you brightly oh it was wonderful session wonderful session and so forth but these are just variations of lower harmonics of the same thing people make progress in processing or they dont and you quickly get so that you can plot up case as to whether or not that case is doing well under processing or isnt doing well under processing lets take one level of case that cant sit still and answer an auditing question thats pc manifestation in processing you say do fish swim and they say whooo wiggle wiggle off and so forth cans raow and so forth yes and you explore it afterwards they answered the auditing question and they were answering the question is any sun coming in the window you see i mean this thing is all disconnected and they really never answer the auditing question and they never seem to get any this they never seem to get any that and they dont get over this they dont get over this manifestation in other words theres change one of the ways you tell this is they always set the same goals you can look over goals lists and when an individual starts setting the same goals session after session after session after session after session this individual is not making any progress in processing its one of the ways you tell you want to look for the arc break session and so forth you look at the goals set in that session and set in the next session and violent changes between these two thingsnot gradient change but violent changewill denote that that was the session in which you should look for the arc break and then you see what was done in that session and you can straighten the case out accordingly by inspecting the goals for the session all of this is very interesting but it means that case under processing follows up rather smooth steady gradient cases do not leap up suddenly what the case is doing is becoming more at cause over matter energy space time forms and other beings and the individual is assuming greater and greater cause he isnt being necessarily more causative he is simply assuming greater cause and hes more capable of cause we arent asking him to throw bricks around and keep them hoisted up in midair at glance were asking him whether or not he would be willing to do this dont you see would hewilling to cause that but it actually is not even thenot even the single act that were interested in its just he is more causative he can handle his mind better as he handles his mind better he is more capable of handling other things around him better and so forth and his responses in processing are your very best possible indicator this is not then quick test so it tends to be neglected and you actually have to process somebody for while to find out if theyre making some progress in processing you cant take some fellow and in the absence of his case folders and in the absence of everything else and so forth just suddenly test whether or not he can do this do that and the other thing it would be nice and maybe we could devise set of tests of this character that would give you good index however they dont exist you can however take somebodys case folder and find out how he was last year and how he is this year that would make marked jump or somebody has had two or three hundred hours of processing and how was he before these two or three hundred hours of processing how is he now well that jump is big enough so that he knows and so forth and you actually have to plow around for little while to find out how he was two or three hundred hours ago because its all negative gain the things that were wrong with him two or three hundred hours ago are not wrong with him now and so are not occupying any attention as far as hes concerned and sometimes fellow would have to sit there and think it over for quite while to tell you if hes made any progress or not but he has case progress case progress that is direct index of cause take this fellow out here in the street this common fellow hes totally going to be an effect of everything he wants to be told hes an effect of everything and so forth wrong thing to do is tell him to get causative the right thing to do is to give him little training and give him some tools which when he applies them will demonstrate to him that he is now little bit more at cause now he finds this out and in the course of being processed and processing he becomes more and more causative he comes up higher and higher he can accept more responsibility life in its zones and areas does not find him as puppet or marionette dancing at set of strings hes likely to have snapped few of the strings you see or hes likely to stand still when somebody shakes the crossbar in other words hes moved up to that degree hes become more causative therefore hes less of an effect of life and these things are the things on which this class scale is drawn thats all that is the index one to the next within the ramifications of the things ive given you here as indexes as to how to measure it and that sort of thing you dont realize how far youve come you see until you get ahold of joe blow out here someplace working in garage and try to ask him if fish swim now thats not particularly educated process or another lets not ask him process lets just ask him if he has any problems and listen to some of his answers this is quite interesting fascinating what he considers problem what is bedeviling his days and so forth its horrible i mean the fellow is living in madhouse from his viewpoint dont you see all right you just tell that fellow be more causative and that sort of thing and hes not likely to love you for it but if you can bring him up the line and you can teach him little bit about processing you can teach him little bit and you can get him processed and work back and forth at very very low level of processing you see why he will assume more cause and at that time hes quite capable of assuming enough cause to assume new level of processing others and being processed and when hes completed that he would be at another level where he was quite capable of assuming new level of causativeness and being able to handle processes at that particular level and so on up the line all the way to ot this gives us essentially seven classes and these seven classes are in actual fact eight now you think we went up to the eighth dynamic but we didntwe went down to zero there is zero classification and thats the person who isnt classed so you see you have an unclassed class that you can refer to as class 0 and seven classes which makes the statement i gave you in the first place quite accurate but in actual fact theres another class that is the unclassed now if you wanted to be very precise about this thing you would say that person who was class 0 was higher than an unclassed person if you wanted person who had never heard of scientology at all and wasnt in any direction whatsoever you could maybe call that unclassed or something to differentiate actually we havent really got any word for that but raw meat but an unclassed person class 0 however that gets divided up finds the person putting his rung on the ladder when he leaves class 0 and becomes class i has this certificate is restored for good and adequate reasons that its different route now than book auditor route class 0 person could be class 0 and have certificate which had not yet been classed dont you see because hes only classed by the classification not by the certificate he can have certificate without being of that class thats important because in training activities you will have certain number of people who absolutely get their hearts utterly broken if they do not get certificate or something to show they have been there and worked at it and theyve tried and theyve passed their checksheets and theyve done what they could and all of sudden you turn around and say were going to give you recognition for all the work youve done well maybe it was ten times as much work as somebody who did pass it all dont you see but weve done nothing for this chap so therefore we make the certificatethe piece of paperthe certificate is inevitable for the completion of certain course of study but it doesnt make it inevitable that the person would be of that class they would remain in the class they were in until they have their classification requirements met classification requirements absolutely cut and bang right on monkeying with it fooling about with it youll find out then that you can hold your classification requirements much more tightly if you do not try to hold your piece of paper certificate requirements so tightly you understand nobody will argue with you particularly youre training some people youre training some people up through class 0 and i all right youre going to give them certificate when theyre class 0 theyre class 0 and they completed certain course of study and that sort of thing and there they are with class 0 certificate which is has but it hasnt got any class on it they can still run those processes that they were permitted to run at class 0 which is practically everybody processes and the class 0 level of processing is touch assist see he can do touch assist he can do something of that level of process at class 0 nobody really requires anything very desperate of them to do so dont you see now class i becomes itsa now weve got itsa for class i thats the process of the class just to give youjust as anot necessarily total final processes that belong to these classes but itll give you an idea of this gradient itsa is processes theyre class i repetitive processes recall communication that sort of thing normally the first processes taught in an academy course but this tremendous panorama of repetitive processes theyre not complicated beyond repetitive theyre not even complicated with meter dont you see theyll have meter at this stage but mostly for reading the tone arm action the meter is not significant at this level and that is class ii with the repetitive process and they get all of those oldtime repetitive processes that are way back theyre strung out across the years and theyre so valuable and that have done so fantastically workhorse job dont you see they all belong in that particular class and we relegate missed withholds and overtwithhold processes and all prepchecking to class iii thats missed withholds ows prepchecking that would be class iii i have learned by experience that its pretty hard to teach meter with great accuracy in an academy and so forth it leaves lot to be desired so it had better be grooved up into its own class and that sort of thing well theyre taught about meter in the academy in cursory fashion this is the tone arm this is how you switch it on and off but the real hammer and pound on meters comes in here at class iii they really start using meters at this level and they can prepcheck and at prepcheck levels of course youve got tremendous numbers of processes again this carries with it little bit of an assessment not much of an assessment but enough assessment to carry through in these things you can find out what was the principal problem of this guys existence and then prepcheck the old hgc twentyfivehour intensive all of those processes belong in this thing see heres whats funny its this whole thirteen years of research is suddenly coming alive before your eyes it is not just deserted and neglected and lying there never to be seen again and your skills will never again be used as matter of fact that stuff had value value value whats happened to everybody is they followed the research line up you see and they moved on up and tried to move up to the top of the research line doggedly with their tongues hanging out and that sort of thing and in many instances have actually never gone through thoroughly any one of these levels as they came on up therefore they get to the higher grade and they find the door barred they actually never completed one of these lower steps and they get up to the upper level and theyre moving like the dickens with the research line and it has unsettled them to that degree that doesnt mean were just throwing everybody into class 0 either ill take that up in moment but this is essentially what happened but theres tremendously valuable processes lying back along those lines theres fantastic things have been done in times well the old hello mama for heavens sakes you take guy with toothache and have him say hello and okay to it have the tooth say hello and okay to him for awhile and the most remarkable things can happen in other words theres all kinds of processestons of them lying back along the lineand they fit into these various slots just as they were you see and grouped up and made neat but just as they were theres vast reformation or change what the process was youll find for instance class ii will be studying comm lag on comm lags of equal length as to when to end the process remember those old ones you see all that stuff is all back in action see anyhow heres prepcheck at class iii and service facsimiles and assessments and doing assessments and supervising the doing assessments and all that sort of thing service facsimiles all of that kind of work you know assessmentreal heavy assessment workand so forth belongs at class iv in anything weve ever assessed or done except 2 i dont think ill ever let anybody run 212 212 was interesting training ground it taught people lot of things and so forth but in running case i have found out that 212 of all the processes we had was itself about the only one capable of pulling an ri out of place in gpm process just has just little bit too much smoke to it its just little bit too hot because ive refound misworded 212 ris in running case to ot and i found them man they were sitting right there and they had an ri pulled out of line the case jammy at that particular point in other words its just too powerful process it just reaches little bit too deep into the case so just skip your 212 and 212a and so forth they dont fit in this hierarchy at all but there are tremendous numbers of assessment processes even so and they were the old processes of the prehav scales and you assess people on the prehav scales and ran brackets and all this kind of thing and so forth well they belongtheyre terrific you knowand they belong at this level of ivclass iv now class v implants the whole track case analysisall that sort of thingrunning implants for practice and so forth class v you dont just run implants for practice you can make considerable case gains from running implants what we now call r3r and so forth can swing in at that particular level but r3r might as easily go into service facs so i havent made up my mind about that dont you see might crowd the level too much we might be able to put engram running as an old process you seeit was wrapped up process we ought to preserve it so it goes at one or the other of those two classes and i wont tell you at this time which one it goes in but implant running definitely definitely implant gpms that sort of thing at v and your present what youre calling now r4 materialand it was r3 material now r4 materialgoes to class vi that is the actual running of actual gpms for ot goes to class vi and then at vii we have old route one with frillsthetan drills so forth now these by the wayjust in rapid summary and reviewthese by the way will have certain designations for classes for instance there are three types of pin that give this type of thing theres the small s and double triangle which is your normal thing and that serves in your earliest classes the first two or three classes you see just have that plain s and double triangle dont you see but it has little enameled plate in the middle of it i dont know if youve seen the release pins that were issued at one time or another but little disc there which is colored disc in the middle of the s and double triangle with roman numeral on it of course with class 0 they can wear that but itsthe circle itself makes zero but your class i of course has roman numeral i on it now theres color scheme brought up the line for each one of these classes for designation and it has in addition to thatyour second type of pin covers the next two or three classes got small circle around the s and double triangle with the colored plate in front of it and the class number on it and then the large circlea great big circle around the s and double trianglefor the very upper classes on the thing just to get everything neatly in line im just reading that not to sell you some pins because theyll probably be given to you but just to give you an idea of how far the planning goes and this sort of thing yourcertain certificates will move on up the line well probably reactivate every certificate weve ever had you know theres certain designations were dropped out there was an hubbard advanced auditor at one time or another and so forth exactly how we pattern these certificates against these various classes were going to have some certificates thats all going to try to follow this now exactly what is happening exactly what is happening here of course your key main certificates of hubbard professional auditor and hga and so forth those things are definitely preserved but we may have to fill in some slots here in order to keep this thing neat now weve got thethe whole situation here what were trying to do is were trying to open bridge if anybody says to you you see theyre getting classconscious yeah you bet were classconscious its limitation and scope of processes and an auditor should be audited inside his class only and he should be audited by auditors of his class only an auditor should not be audited outside of his class perfectly all right for somebody in practice were not trying to knock people in the head for processing for fees or something like that and were not particularly interested in whether or not some class iv or something audits some people of lower classes and so on but if he audits them outside their class levels he will be hearing from because hes not going to make case gain with them this is an effort to graduate cases up the line and i have found out that they do not advance further than they are trained and its an effort to advance cases up the line toand preparatory step level with information and skill and auditing availability right straight on up the line and the way weve got it rigged right now people dont know where they are they dont know where theyre going they dont know whats expected of them weve got professional preclears from 1950 standing around waiting for somebody to process them to ot dont you see and bless these people they have been of benefit to many of us in many ways but at the same time i notice their cases arent running much better than they were running i consider this quite interesting its because theyve never really learned anything theyve hit certain ceiling and the door is barred well this is an effort to bring people all the way through all the way up the line so that makes it easy then you take an hca hpa level process this fellow then yes whats he going to do is he going to process people well he wants to process people thats all right and were not going to raise any devil with him about processing people but were going to expect him to train class 0 and were going to expect him to be able to award class i and we expect him to do just those things and we expect him to do that to people and expect him to get them to coauditing with one another at those levels of process and teaching them to do the things necessary for those particular levels and then we expect those people to go and get themselves real fast training course and be able to answer up were not asking for vast lengths of time in training because you notice there are more courses involved here so they can afford to be shorter courses and so the fellow can get himself piece of training of some kind or another and make sure theres someone in his neighborhood and so forth thats also trained and he winds up with somebody to audit with in other words were not trying to cost somebody fortune to get up to ot because if hes laying out the money to buy all the processing necessary to get to ot hell never get there on educational basis alone and its going to cost him fortune in order to get there whereas by audit inside your class the guy will inevitably eventually get there why because his auditing isnt limited he can have unlimited quantities of auditing he normally will get auditing as good as he gives so therefore its of very very great interest to him to be as good an auditor as he possibly can be otherwise nobody will audit with him i mean it isnt whether or not i say so you see what i mean all right well this opens the door and this opens the channel all the way up and by giving these classes were not interested in whether or not were classconscious we are extremely interested however in people knowing where they should go and what they should do next were going to give you chart very very soon which carries all of these classes and all of the processes and training skills of each class and sometime after that much much more distant than that we will have textbook for class and questionandanswer book for the class and so forth all the way up and that will be very very neat package indeed in other words theres the whole road its all laid out and the person can go from this level to this level to that level to that level to that level that level and they can move on up the line well itll take some of them ten twelve fifteen twenty years whats the hurry theyve been in this universe this long we got the gate open why should we expect themwhy should they expect to kill everybody in the rush dont you see well its leisurely leisurely proposition whereby were simply saying time isnt valuable or something like that its just what can they do within the framework of this well possibly somebody could go all the way through this theres possibility that somebody could go all the way through this in about eighteen months or two years you know just flat out all the way somebody could go through this but in any event it would take him that long look at us its taken you years its taken years and so forth you suppose somebodys going to better that i dont think so the stuff that got bred in the bone in you as scientologist on your way along the line youve still got at your fingertips and that sort of thing and youre rather surprisedsome johnnycomelately and you say well what he needs is some op pro by dup that i think that and the fellow says huh oh yeah well thats process you know book and bottle huh latch he missed it someplace along the line and youll find big gaps and holes and stuff like this and actually his duplication is terrible and its just hole in the fence and his case will leak out through that hole he wont go on up now this gives us this gives us in essence then ladder that can be climbed line that can be followed and it tells people where they can go to the next step it puts auditors in the picture all the way on up the line and rather than knock everybody in the head were toying with exactly what we are going to do with the pre1963 scientologist and weve had under discussion title or designation type of class for this particular individual having lived through the period this usseewhy hes permitted certain amount of liberty and scope in that zone and benefit of the information which has been developed while hes been coming along the line in other words we arent leaving these people out in the dark or throwing everybody back to 0 thats not the point but we are pulling this foul and terrible trickthis horrible trick i say we thats because i dont want to be that causative just now im halfway through bank and im not being causative at the moment its i dont want individuals to get pitched out on their ear but i do think in all fairness that people whose classifications exist as of now should not particularly be changed until theyve earned them now thats horrible blow to some people but imy candid opinion is is theyre not doing too well with the material which lying right under their hands and it gives them chance to catch their breath and level out at their particular level that they are in catch up little bit get themselves oriented and move on up the line i think it would be unfair to them i think anybody right now out in the field running what we have been calling r4 is going to fall on his silly head i just dont think he can do it i just dont think he can do it itsi dont care if he was even trained some on it here he just isnt going to do it thats all he isnt going to make it its very very precise piece of technology this is aweinspiring man im not trying to tell you how horrible or how hard it is im just saying its horrible and its hard this is rough piece of cake to try to get down and the instructors around here right now are just getting their hands in on the line on this and trying to pin this down oh man if saint hill instructors having trouble with this one right now i dont expect anybody out in north poughkeepsie is going to be having good time of it do you so i think itd be unfair to throw the class level up on everybody around the thing but therell be certain latitude in this particular lineup some of the hcas hpas perforce will have to be classed to class ii and so forth well that means that youre pretty lucky right here and right now you will get of course the class that you have earned
