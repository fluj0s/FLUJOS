september 30 2008 abstract the valueadded tax vat is type of broadbased consumption tax imposed in about 136 countries around the world domestically it is often mentioned in policy discussions as potential new or supplemental funding source for such largescale social programs as social security medicare national health insurance etc an example of such proposal is hr 15 introduced in the 110th congress in addition the vat figures prominently in most fundamental tax reform discussions order code rs22720 updated september 30 2008 taxable base of the valueadded tax maxim shvedov analyst in public sector economics government and finance division summary the valueadded tax vat is type of broadbased consumption tax imposed in about 136 countries around the world domestically it is often mentioned in policy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22720 discussions as potential new or supplemental funding source for such largescale social programs as social security medicare national health insurance etc an example of such proposal is hr 15 introduced in the 110th congress in addition the vat figures prominently in most fundamental tax reform discussions the key determinant of the vats revenueraising potential is the size of its taxable base this report estimates its size under two frequently used generic policy options broadbased vat and vat with certain frequently mentioned exemptions under the assumption of the broadbased vat the potential revenue base could be equal to 86 trillion in 2007 exempting certain expenditures such as food housing healthcare and others would reduce the taxable base to 46 trillion in 2007 these estimates are likely to overstate the sizes of the taxable bases somewhat as they assume behavioral responses and perfect compliance with the law this report briefly discusses these important caveats and their implications for further policy analysis this report will not be updated valueadded tax vat is type of broadbased consumption tax even though it is levied on firms value added at all stages of the production chain the value added by firm is the difference between the total value of the firms sales and its purchases from all other firms about 136 countries around the world impose some form of the vat1 there are several ways to impose the vat the so called credit method is the most widely used while different in form all methods are economically equivalent to each other but may vary in terms of simplicity administrative costs and compliance 1 organization for economic cooperation and development international vatgst

revenue source by james m bickley in the united states the vat is often mentioned in policy discussions as potential new funding source for such largescale social programs as social security medicare national health insurance etc in the 110th congress representative john dingell introduced hr 15 which proposes levying 5 vat to pay for national health care system in addition the vat figures prominently in most fundamental tax reform discussions this report estimates the size of the vats taxable base the key factor determining the taxs revenueraising potential under two frequently considered generic policy options option 1 generic broadbased valueadded tax conceptually the vat is type of consumption tax imposed on sales of goods and services even though it is collected at all stages of the production chain thus the vat taxable base can be estimated as the value of all consumption spending taking place in the economy table 1 presents calculations of the broadbased consumption tax base2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22720 table 1 taxable base for broadbased vat 2007 2007 description billions of dollars the sum of personal consumption expenditures pce 97102 residential private fixed investment in owneroccupied structures 3967 owneroccupied nonfarm dwellings space rent 10633 rental value of farm dwellings 152 net foreign travel 89 sales taxes 4365 taxable base of the broadbased vat 85830 sources bureau of economic analysis data and crs calculations totals may not add due to rounding the size of the taxable base is estimated at 86 trillion 85830 billion in 2007 using bureau of economic analysis bea data3 the largest contributor to the base at 97 trillion 97102 billion is personal consumption expenditures pce private real estate investments in owneroccupied structures add an estimated 3967 billion 2 the methodology follows with modifications congressional budget office reducing the deficit spending and revenue options march 1997 p 391 3 us

periodically revises its estimates after their initial publication which frequently results in changes typically relatively small in magnitude in the reported amounts crs3 the deductions from the base include the imputed rental value of owneroccupied housing and farm dwellings 10633 billion and 152 billion respectively these are the amounts homeowners would have had to pay if they had rented an identical property from somebody else it is easier to understand this concept by considering homeowner in dual capacity an owner of the property and tenant at the same property the tenant homeowner consumes housing services provided by him or herself bea includes this value in pce because from an economic standpoint this transaction is different from regular explicit housing rental actual monetary exchange occurs in this case however and therefore unlike regular explicit housing rental these hypothetical transactions would be nontaxable state sales taxes 4365 billion are also deducted from the base because presumably vat would be imposed on the price net of state sales taxes pce data report the amounts consumers pay including the state sales taxes the estimate also accounts for net foreign travel the difference between expenditures in the united states by nonresidents and foreign travel spending by us residents this estimate has an important limitation it does not incorporate the likely taxable httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22720 base reduction triggered by changes in taxpayers behavior the effect would be more pronounced if the vat rate were higher it would also depend on the comprehensiveness of the taxable base and other specifics of the law to make the estimate more realistic it would be necessary to account for taxpayers noncompliance and lawful change in behavior socalled tax avoidance in the absence of specific proposal and historic data on the vat in the united states however making reliable quantitative predictions about the magnitude of the taxable base reduction is problematic international experiences range widely and therefore cannot serve as proxy on the other hand it would be reasonable to expect the size of the taxable base to grow with time in proportion to nominal economic growth the estimates in this report do not incorporate such growth after 2007 the rate of economic growth also might depend on the vats taxable base and rate as well as the eventual use of the collected revenues option 2 valueadded tax with certain exemptions another policy option would be vat with narrower taxable base which exempts for example food medical care housing higher education and religious and welfare activities4 in selecting the set of potential exemptions we attempted to choose the most frequently proposed ones of course any specific proposal does not have to incorporate all of them 4 for examples of similar but not identical estimates see congressional budget office reducing the deficit spending and revenue options march 1997 p 391 or william g gale and c eugene steuerle tax policy solution in alice m rivlin and isabel sawhill eds restoring fiscal sanity 2005 washington brookings institution press 2005 p 113 crs4 table 2 shows the estimated taxable base of this policy option given these exemptions the vat taxable base would be 46 trillion 45633 billion in 2007 or about 53 of the aboveestimated broad base similar to the estimates of the previous section noncompliance and tax avoidance would reduce the taxable base in this case as well in addition as exemptions add complexity to the tax system the reduction in revenue might be somewhat more pronounced compared to the broadbased vat in addition the categories in table 2 are quite broad depending on the implementation exemptions from the vat under the actual law might encompass less than the whole segment of the economy for example the housing exemption might apply only to owneroccupied housing but not to the housing rental payments if so the vat taxable base would be larger than this estimate indicates on the other hand if some additional categories such as the financial sector were excluded from the base it would be smaller table 2 the vat taxable base after certain exemptions 2007 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22720 taxable base 2007 description billions of dollars broadbased vat taxable base 85830 exemptions food excluding alcoholic beverages 11638 medical care 16811 housing included in the broad base 7791 higher education 1430 religious and welfare activities 2527 total exemptions 40197 total after all exemptions 45633 sources bea data and crs calculations totals may not add due to rounding revenue projection using these estimates revenues from vat would equal as first approximation the vat rate multiplied by the taxable base there are however number of issues that make revenue projection more complicated first this simple calculation works reasonably well only for low vat rates as the rate gets higher the discrepancy between this simple projection and the real revenue yield would likely grow due to various feedback effects in more sophisticated analysis the level of the vat rate affects the size of the taxable base through economic agents behavioral responses economic theory suggests that there would be some kind of revenuereducing response to imposition of the vat but its magnitude is highly speculative beyond the rate per it would depend to great extent on specifics of the vats implementation second the estimates presented above are based on single year of observation 2007 and thus depend on the specific economic situation that year for example to the crs5 extent housing values were above their longterm trends in 2007 the absolute value of all estimates involving housing would be above the trend too third any revenue projections should also account for any transitional or cash flow issues which may be significant there would also be some administrative costs involved finally estimates of the vat taxable base size might serve as starting point for calculating the taxable bases of other consumption taxes such as national retail sales tax it is important to remember however that behavioral responses and other issues discussed in this section may be even more pronounced with national sales tax or other consumption taxes the analysis may yield misleading picture of the revenueraising potential of tax if such feedback effects were overlooked5 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22720 5 for an overview of the issues please see crs report rl32603 the flat tax valueadded tax and national retail sales tax
