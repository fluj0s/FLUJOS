6407c09 shspec28 studying data assimilation these are the points to watch in assimilating data 1 nomenclature knowing what word means 2 the subject matter itself arrangement and understanding of the subject matter part of the issue of nomenclature is knowing what definition means we cant use psychiatric terms in scientology because the field of psychiatry has different basis and purpose than ours and their terms have implications that would give utterly unwanted twists to our knowledge if we used them it doesnt matter that they are the authorities an authority in fact is someone who can produce result the world has elected people as authorities on subjects when these people cant do the subjects so if you recognized these authorities you would get all crossed up with fields that had failed and that would enter degree of failure into scientology so we leave their technology and nomenclature alone we get results so we are the authorities the existing terminology is actually false since it is from field that gives result our terminology has evolved and has become fixed on the printed page we have to safeguard what weve got or knowledge gets wiped out we must first try to evolve nomenclature cleverly so that it wont conflict with earlier terms then we must carry it forward as standardized item to maintain constant another responsibility is to avoid developing too many new terms any technical field has specialized terminology they are all snob languages showing superior understanding you dont dare use carnival terminology in front of circus performer when referring to the same thing as one becomes more expert in field and gets more familiar with subject his terminology becomes less formal and serious it becomes more like slang having passed through phase of formal terms we shortcutted this process by leaving out the pompous formal nomenclature stage reverence for nomenclature is symptomatic of being at the novice stage of memorizing the terms knowledge is tremendously dependent on nomenclature this fact is almost never appreciated by teachers and students they are trying to talk and use language that they dont know this can get so bad that they think the subject is incomprehensible or that they are incapable of understanding it when in fact they just havent grasped the meaning of some symbols being used to designate things or their grasp is fumbly not instantaneous as person goes on studying past point of uncomprehended nomenclature he stacks up the opinion that he doesnt know about it carried on forward from the one term that he didnt totally grasp he thinks he doesnt know or cant know subject when in fact he only doesnt grasp the nomenclature the basic lie that makes incomprehension persist is that it is the subject that is not understood when it is word that is not understood person will develop an automatic comm lag at the point of the nonunderstood word he will misassign the lack of understanding to whatever area it appears in comprehension of the nomenclature used is vital in studying anything you put yourself in the soup as soon as you leave one word not understood behind you besides the subject of nomenclature we have the subject matter itself the arrangement and understanding of it ie what is being named one should get very thorough grasp of the thing under discussion person can misunderstand something that he has read because it conflicts with the usual idea or he can even find it unbelievable if you dont agree with something that is true it is either misunderstood or there is button that you are running into when you find something unbelievable be sure you know what you are unbelieving first be sure that you have understood the words used then be sure that you have got the thing the phenomenon right ninety percent of the time you will find that you had something in crosswise in the other ten percent of the cases you can handle it by setting up examples of how it applies to you and to life get examples of how it is that way and how it isnt that way you will generally find then that some button was in the way of your grasping it following this sort of routine you will find yourself able to study former methods of study what few there have been have not been very successful when there is training available about the only reliable method of studying is to read everything you can find on the subject from cover to cover in studying scientology it is imperative to know how to study since we are studying that which we are studying with to classify students as fast or slow or bright or dull is to make false classification since this classification leads to improvement of anyones ability to study there are students who can memorize words and pages virtually at glance but this does not guarantee that they will be able to do anything with what they memorized you can find out by seeing whether they can define the words the direction and end purpose of study is understanding with an unknown word or phenomenon in the middle of subject you will have mystery and nonapplication one of the primary criticisms of modern education is that it doesnt immediately result in application you should be able to take any textbook direction and if you have understood it apply it directly and effectively without familiarity if you also have familiarity as in studying auditing while auditing you should be whiz
