activities updated october 23 2008 patricia moloney figliola specialist in telecommunications and internet policy resources science and industry division the federal networking and information technology research and development program funding issues and activities summary in the early 1990s congress recognized that several federal agencies had ongoing highperformance computing programs but central coordinating body existed to ensure longterm coordination and planning to provide such framework congress passed the highperformance computing and communications program act of 1991 pl 102194 to enhance the effectiveness of the various programs in conjunction with the passage of the act the white house office of science and technology policy ostp released grand challenges highperformance computing and communications that document outlined research and development rd strategy for highperformance computing and framework for multiagency program the highperformance computing and communications hpcc program the hpcc program has evolved over time and is now called the networking and information technology research and development nitrd program to better reflect its expanded mission proponents assert that federal support of information technology it rd has produced positive outcomes for the country and played crucial role in supporting longterm research into fundamental aspects of computing such fundamentals provide broad practical benefits but generally take years to realize additionally the unanticipated results of research are often as important as the anticipated results another aspect of governmentfunded it research is that it often leads to open standards something that many perceive as beneficial encouraging deployment and further investment industry on the other hand is more inclined to invest in proprietary products and will diverge from common standard when there is potential competitive or financial advantage to do so finally proponents of government support believe that the outcomes achieved through the various funding programs create synergistic environment in which both fundamental and applicationdriven research are conducted benefitting government industry academia and the public supporters also believe that such outcomes justify governments role in funding it rd as well as the growing budget for the nitrd program critics assert that the government through its funding mechanisms may be picking winners and losers in technological development role more properly residing with the private sector for example the size of the nitrd program may encourage industry to follow the governments lead on research directions rather than selecting those directions itself the fy2009 budget calls for 3548 billion for the nitrd program an increase from the fy2008 projected budget of 3341 billion because the nitrd program budget consists of the budgets allocated to the 13 participating agencies final budget figures

information technology research and development program funding issues and activities overview of the federal nitrd program the federal government has long played key role in the countrys information technology it research and development rd activities the governments support of it rd began because it had an important interest in creating computers that would be capable of addressing the problems and issues the government needed to solve and study one of the first such problems was planning the trajectories of artillery and bombs more recently such problems include simulations of nuclear testing cryptanalysis and weather modeling that interest continues today such complexity requires there be adequate coordination to ensure the governments evolving needs eg homeland security will continue to be met in the most effective manner possible nitrd structure the networking and information technology research and development nitrd program is collaborative effort in which 13 agencies coordinate and cooperate to help increase the overall effectiveness and productivity of federal it rd1 of those 13 members the majority of funding in descending order goes to the national science foundation national institutes of health department of energy doe office of science defense advanced research projects agency darpa and doe national nuclear security administration dr christopher

the nco became the national coordination office for networking and information technology research and development the director of the nco reports to the director of ostp the nco supports the subcommittee on nitrd also called the nitrd subcommittee2 and the presidents information technology advisory committee pitac3 the nitrd subcommittee provides policy program and budget planning for the nitrd program and is composed of representatives from each of the participating agencies ostp office of management and budget and the nco two interagency working groups and five coordination groups reporting to the nitrd 2 the nitrd subcommittee was previously called the interagency working group for it rd iwgit rd 3 the pitac was established on february 11 1997 to provide the president ostp and the federal agencies involved in it rd with guidance and advice on all areas of high performance computing communications and information technologies representing the research education and library communities and including network providers and representatives from critical industries the committee advises the administrations effort to accelerate development and adoption of information technologies additional information about the pitac is available at httpwwwnitrdgovpitac the most recent pitac executive order expired on june 1 2005 crs3 subcommittee focus their work in eight program component areas pcas4 the pitac is composed of representatives of private industry and academia who are appointed by the president the group provides expert independent advice to the president on the federal role in maintaining us preeminence in advanced it and works with the nitrd program agencies and the nitrd subcommittee the nitrd program is funded out of each member agencys individual budget rather than in single appropriations bill eg nitrd program activities conducted by the national institutes of health nih are funded through the nih appropriations bill the programs nco is not explicitly funded rather the nitrd member agencies contribute toward nco operations the nitrd program has undergone series of structural changes since its inception in 1991 and both it and the nco have had number of different names over the years when the program was created in december 1991 it was named the high performance computing and communications hpcc program and when the nco was created in september 1992 it was named the nco for hpcc the name was changed to the national coordination office for computing information and communications per the fy1997 supplement to the presidents budget also known at that time as the blue book the name was changed to the national coordination office for information technology research and development per the 4 the eight pcas are 1 highend computing

the aggregated nitrd budget increase for these three agencies from 2006 estimates to 2007 request is 186 million 17 above 2006 estimates which accounts for over 85 of the overall nitrd program budget increase for 20077 nco pitac and related reports as explained earlier the nco provides technical and administrative support to the nitrd program the nitrd subcommittee and the pitac this includes supporting meetings and workshops and preparing reports the nco interacts with ostp and omb on nitrd program and pitac matters federal plan for advanced networking research and development this plan was developed by the interagency task force on advanced networking established under the nitrd national science and technology council by the director of the ostp to provide strategic vision for future networked environments8 the overall conclusions of the task force can be summarized as follows improved networking security and reliability are strategic national priorities new paths to advanced networking are required federal rd efforts will support spectrum of advanced networking capabilities close cooperation is needed to integrate federal rd efforts with the full technology development cyclethis cycle includes basic and applied research and partnerships with researchers application developers users and other stakeholders and testbeds and prototype networks enable research on network challenges in realistic environments the report notes that the internets phenomenal growth and elasticity have exceeded all expectations at the same time we have become captive to the limitations and vulnerabilities of the current generation of networking technologies because vital us interests for example national defense communications financial markets and the operation of critical infrastructures such as power grids now depend on secure reliable highspeed network connectivity these limitations and vulnerabilities can threaten our national security and economic competitiveness 7 the fy2007 nitrd budget request is at httpwwwnitrdgovpubs2007supplement 8 this report is available at httpwwwnitrdgovpubsitfanfinalpdf crs6 research and development to create the next generation of networking technologies is needed to address these threats the plan is centered on vision for advanced networking based on design and architecture for security and reliability that provides for heterogeneous anytime anywhere networking with capabilities such as federation of networks across domains and widely differing technologies dynamic mobile networking with autonomous management effective quality of service qos management support for sensornets nearrealtime autonomous discovery configuration and management of resources and endtoend security tailored to the application and user the report outlines four goal for realizing this vision provide secure network services anytime anywhere make secure global federated networks possible manage network complexity and heterogeneity and foster innovation among the federal research commercial and other sectors through development of advanced network systems and technologies leadership under challenge information technology rd in competitive world this report assesses global us competitiveness in networking and information technology and provides recommendations aimed at ensuring that the nitrd program is appropriately focused and implemented the report makes specific recommendations for federal rd that would enhance us competitiveness in this economically critical area in developing the report the pcast consulted extensively with experts from industry and academia the pcast concluded that while the united states is still in leadership position other nations are challenging that lead in number of areas and that the nitrd program must focus on visionary research and work with universities to keep the united states at the cutting edge some of the report recommendation areas follows both the us federal government and the private sector need to address the demand for skilled it professionals including such steps as updating curricula increasing fellowships and simplifying visa processes with respect to the federallyfunded research portfolio the nitrd program should emphasize largerscale and longerterm multidisciplinary it rd and innovative higherrisk projects the united states should give priority to rd in economically important areas including it systems connected with and embedded in the physical world software use and management of digital data and advanced internet capabilities the pcast noted that with an annual federal investment of over 3 billion in the nitrd program crs7 changes in the programs interagency process to strengthen assessment and planning are needed9 federal plan for cyber security and information assurance research and development in april 2006 the nitrd subcommittee released its federal plan for cyber security and information assurance research and development10 this report sets out framework for multiagency coordination of federal rd investments in technologies that can better secure the interconnected computing systems networks and information that together make up the us it infrastructure the plan outlines strategic objectives for coordinated federal rd in cyber security and information assurance csia and presents broad range of csia rd technical topics identifying those topics that are multiagency technical and funding priorities the plans findings and recommendations address rd priority setting coordination fundamental rd emerging technologies roadmapping and metrics nsa superconducting technology assessment in august 2005 nsa released its superconducting technology assessment11 as part of its participation in the highend computing pca of the nitrd program nsa had been concerned about projected limitations of conventional technology and wanted to explore possible alternatives to meet its future missioncritical computational needs this report presented the results of the technology assessment which found the following government investment is necessary because private industry currently has compelling financial reason to develop alternative technologies for mainstream commercial applications with aggressive federal investment estimated between 372 and 437 million over five years by 2010 next generation technologies would be sufficiently mature to allow the initiation of the design and construction of an operational petaflops12scale system although significant risks exist the panel has developed roadmap that identifies the needed technology developments with milestones and demonstration vehicles 9 this report responds to reporting requirements of the highperformance computing act of 1991 public law 102194 and the next generation internet research act of 1998 public law 105305 the laws call for presidents information technology advisory committee pitac to assess periodically what is now known as the nitrd program executive order 13385 signed on september 29 2005 assigned the pitacs responsibilities to pcast this report is available at

flops or flops is an abbreviation of floating point operations per second this is used as measure of computers performance especially in fields of scientific calculations that make heavy use of floating point calculations petaflopsscale machine operates at 1015 flops crs8 computational science ensuring americas competitiveness in june 2005 the pitac released computational science ensuring americas competitiveness13 the report identified obstacles to progress in this field including rigid disciplinary silos in academia that are mirrored in federal research and development agency organizational structures according to the report these silos stifle the development of multidisciplinary research and educational approaches essential to computational science the report recommends the following both academia and government fundamentally change their organizational structures so that they promote and reward collaborative research the national science and technology council commission the national academies to convene one or more task forces to develop and maintain multidecade roadmap for computational science with goal of assuring continuing us leadership in science engineering and the humanities the federal government establish national software sustainability centers to harden document support and maintain longterm vital computational science software the federal government provide longterm support for computational science community data repositories these should include defined frameworks metadata structures algorithms data sets applications and review and validation infrastructure it should also require funded researchers to deposit their data and research software in these repositories or with other approved access providers the federal government provide longterm funding for national highend computing centers at levels sufficient to ensure the regularly scheduled deployment and operation of the fastest and most capable highend computing systems that address the most demanding computational problems the federal government implement coordinated longterm computational science programs that include funding for interconnecting the software sustainability centers national data and software repositories and national highend leadership centers with the researchers who use those resources the federal government should rebalance its rd investments to create new generation of wellengineered scalable easytouse software suitable for computational science that can reduce the 13 this report is available at

new questions b design prototype and evaluate new hardware architectures that can deliver larger fractions of peak hardware performance on scientific applications and c focus on sensor and dataintensive computational science applications in light of the explosive growth of data cyber security crisis of prioritization in february 2005 the pitac released cyber security crisis of prioritization14 that report outlined four key findings and recommendations on how the federal government could foster new architectures and technologies to secure the nations it infrastructure specifically the pitac urged the government to significantly increase support for fundamental research in civilian cyber security in 10 priority areas intensify federal efforts to promote the recruitment and retention of cyber security researchers and students at research universities increase support for the rapid transfer of federallydeveloped cybersecurity technologies to the private sector and strengthen the coordination of federal cybersecurity rd activities also in february 2005 the nco released the fy2006 supplement to the presidents budget15 the supplement provides brief technical outline of the fy2006 budget request for the nitrd program the fy2007 supplement has not yet been released nitrd enabling and governing legislation the nitrd program is governed by two laws the first the highperformance computing act of 1991 pl 10219416 expanded federal support for high performance computing rd and called for increased interagency planning and coordination the second the next generation internet research act of 1998 pl 10530517 amended the original law to expand the mission of the nitrd program to cover internetrelated research among other goals 14 this report is

112 stat 2919 october 28 1998 the full text of this law is available at httpwwwnitrdgov congressionallawspl_h_105305html crs10 highperformance computing act of 1991 this law was the original enabling legislation for what is now the nitrd program among other requirements it called for the following setting goals and priorities for federal highperformance computing research development and networking providing for the technical support and research and development of highperformance computing software and hardware needed to address fundamental problems in science and engineering educating undergraduate and graduate students fostering and maintaining competition and private sector investment in highspeed data networking within the telecommunications industry promoting the development of commercial data communications and telecommunications standards providing security including protecting intellectual property rights developing accounting mechanisms allowing users to be charged for the use of copyrighted materials this law also requires an annual report to congress on grants and cooperative rd agreements and procurements involving foreign entities18 next generation internet research act of 1998 this law amended the highperformance computing act of 1991 the act had two overarching purposes the first was to authorize research programs related to highend computing and computation humancentered systems high confidence systems and education training and human resources the second was to provide for the development and coordination of comprehensive and integrated us research program to focus on 1 computer network infrastructure that would promote interoperability among advanced federal computer networks 2 economic highspeed data access that does not impose geographic penalty and 3 flexible and extensible networking technology 18 the first report mandated information on the supercomputer agreement between the united states and japan be included in this report separate onetime only report was required on network funding including user fees industry support and federal investment crs11 context of federal technology funding in the early 1990s congress recognized that several federal agencies had ongoing highperformance computing programs19 but central coordinating body existed to ensure longterm coordination and planning to provide such framework congress passed the highperformance computing program act of 1991 to improve the interagency coordination cooperation and planning of agencies with high performance computing programs in conjunction with the passage of the act ostp released grand challenges highperformance computing and communications that document outlined an rd strategy for highperformance computing and communications and framework for multiagency program the hpcc program the nitrd program is part of the larger federal effort to promote fundamental and applied it rd the government sponsors such research through number of channels including federally funded research and development laboratories such as lawrence livermore national laboratory singleagency programs multiagency programs including the nitrd program but also programs focusing on nanotechnology rd and combating terrorism funding grants to academic institutions and funding grants to industry in general supporters contend that federal funding of it rd has produced positive results in 2003 the computer science and telecommunications board cstb of the national research council nrc released synthesis report based on eight previously released reports that examined how innovation occurs in it what the most promising research directions are and what impacts such innovation might have on society20 one of the most significant of the cstbs observations 19 highperformance computing is term that encompasses both supercomputing and grid computing in general highperformance computers are defined as standalone or networked computers that can perform very complex computations very quickly supercomputing involves single standalone computer located in single location grid computing involves group of computers in either the same location or spread over number of locations that are networked together eg via the internet or local network house of representatives committee on science supercomputing is the united states on the right path hearing transcript httpcommdocshousegovcommitteesscience hsy88231000hsy88231_0fhtm 2003 pp 56 20 national research council innovation in information technology 2003 p 1 this report continued crs12 was that the unanticipated results of research are often as important as the anticipated results for example electronic mail and instant messaging were byproducts of governmentfunded research in the 1960s that was aimed at making it possible to share expensive computing resources among multiple simultaneous interactive users additionally the report noted that federally funded programs have played crucial role in supporting longterm research into fundamental aspects of computing such fundamentals provide broad practical benefits but generally take years to realize furthermore supporters state that the nature and underlying importance of fundamental research makes it less likely that industry would invest in and conduct more fundamental research on its own as noted by the cstb companies have little incentive to invest significantly in activities whose benefits will spread quickly to their rivals21 further in the boards opinion government sponsorship of research especially in universities helps develop the it talent used by industry universities and other parts of the economy when companies create products using the ideas and workforce that result from federallysponsored research they repay the nation in jobs tax revenues productivity increases and world leadership22 another aspect of governmentfunded it rd is that it often leads to open standards something that many perceive as beneficial encouraging deployment and further investment industry on the other hand is more likely to invest in proprietary products and will diverge from common standard if it sees potential competitive or financial advantage this has happened for example with standards for instant messaging23 finally proponents of government rd support believe that the outcomes achieved through the various funding programs create synergistic environment in which both fundamental and applicationdriven research are conducted benefitting government industry academia and the public supporters also believe that such outcomes justify governments role in funding it rd as well as the growing budget for the nitrd program critics assert that the government through its funding mechanisms may be setting itself up to pick winners and losers in technological development role more properly residing with the private sector24 for example the size of the nitrd program may encourage industry to follow the governments lead on research directions rather than selecting those directions itself 20 continued discusses all federal funding for rd not only the nitrd program 21 ibid p 4 22 ibid p 4 23 ibid p 18 24 cato institute encouraging research taking politics out of rd september 13 1999 httpwwwcatoorgpubswtpapers990913catordhtml crs13 overall cstb states that government funding appears to have allowed research on larger scale and with greater diversity vision and flexibility than would have been possible without government involvement25 activity in the 110th and 109th congress there has been nitrdspecific activity in the 110th congress the 109th congress introduced one bill and held three hearings related to the nitrd program major legislation 109th congress representative judy biggert introduced hr 28 the highperformance computing revitalization act on january 4 2005 the bill would have amended the highperformance computing act of 1991 and further delineate the responsibilities of the nitrd program including setting the goals and priorities for federal high performance computing research development networking and other activities and providing more specific definitions for the responsibilities of the pcas the bill was referred to the house committee on science which reported the bill on april 12 200526 the committee also approved by voice vote an amendment that stated that the results and benefits of federal supercomputing research should be shared with the private sector the committee rejected by vote of 1719 an amendment offered by representative brad sherman that would have directed the national science foundation to investigate the societal ethical legal and economic implications of computers that one day might be capable of mimicking human abilities to learn reason and make decisions hr 28 was agreed to by voice vote in the house on april 26 2005 and received in the senate where it was read twice and referred to the committee on commerce science and transportation on april 27 200527 further action was taken hearings 109th congress on july 17 2006 the senate committee on commerce science and transportations subcommittee on technology innovation and competitiveness held hearing to discuss issues related to supercomputing research in particular the witnesses expressed concern that although supercomputers are now faster than ever us government investment in supercomputers had decreased significantly over the past decade leaving such investment to the private sector however number of witnesses noted that the bush administrations fy2007 budget calls for increased supercomputing research investment and that consistent investment over the next few years would prompt industry and academia to invest more steadily as well 25 national research council innovation in information technology 2003 p 22 26 see hrept 10936 27 see hrept 10936 crs14 on february 16 2005 the house committee on science held hearing to discuss the federal rd budget for fy200628 this hearing covered the entire rd budget and included an overview of nitrd activities by dr john marburger the director of ostp on may 12 2005 the house committee on science held hearing entitled the future of computer science research in the us29 that hearing focused on three primary areas of investigation what effects are shifts in federal support for computer science eg shifts in the balance between short and longterm research shifts in the roles of different agencies having on academic and industrial computer science research and development what impacts will these changes have on the future of the us information technology industry and on innovation in this field are the federal governments current priorities related to computer science research appropriate if not how should they be changed what should the federal government be doing to implement the recommendations of the recent pitac report on cybersecurity at this hearing the committee heard testimony from dr marburger ostp dr anthony j tether darpa dr william wulf national academy of engineering and dr tom leighton akamai technologies and member of the pitac testimony from drs marburger and tether stressed the growing budget of computer research and their belief that the overall health of the us science and technology research community remains strong however doctors wulf and leighton representing the research community stated that they believed government needed to provide even more funding as industry was not willing to fund the levels of fundamental research they believed necessary to sustain the united states research needs issues for congress federal it rd is multidimensional issue involving many government agencies working together towards shared and complementary goals most observers believe that success in this arena requires ongoing coordination among government academia and industry 28 the charter and submitted testimony for this hearing is available at httpwwwhousegovsciencehearingsfull05indexhtm 29 the charter and submitted testimony for this hearing is available at httpwwwhousegovsciencepress10910971htm crs15 through hearings the house committee on science has been investigating issues related to us competitiveness in highperformance computing and the direction the it rd community has been taking those issues and others remain salient and may merit further investigation if the united states is to maintain comprehensive it rd policy included among the possible issues congress may wish to pursue are the united states status as the global leader in highperformance computing research the apparent bifurcation of the federal it rd research agenda between grid computing and supercomputing capabilities the possible overreliance on commercially available hardware to satisfy us research needs and the potential impact of deficit cutting on it rd funding many members of congress as well as those in the research community have expressed concern over whether the united states is maintaining its position as the global leader in highperformance computing rd that concern was highlighted in 2003 when japan briefly surpassed the united states in possessing the fastest and most efficient supercomputer in the world30 while this was reason for some concern it was also viewed by some as an indicator of how the united states research agenda had become bifurcated with some in the rd community focusing on traditional supercomputing capabilities and others focusing more on cluster computing or grid computing each type of computing has its advantages based on its application standalone supercomputers are often faster and are generally used to work on specific problem for example cryptanalysis and climate modeling applications require significant computing power and are best accomplished using specialized standalone computers cluster computing however allows the use of commercially available hardware which helps contain costs the cluster configuration is useful for applications in which problem can be broken into smaller independent components31 therefore one possible course for congress could be to monitor closely the work that was begun by the highend computing revitalization task force and is now being performed by the nitrd programs highend computing interagency working group and provide ongoing feedback and guidance without clear plan as to how to proceed pursuing two disparate research agendas with goals that could be viewed as being at odds with each other could split the research community further damaging its ability to provide leadership in either area the nitrd program already is working on roadmap for future directions in supercomputing therefore one possible course for congress at this time would be to monitor closely the work of the highend computing revitalization task force and provide input or more visible forum for discussion ie additional hearings involving task force participants congress may wish to conduct its own inquiry into the debate over grid versus standalone computing for example at july 2003 hearing one of the overarching questions the panelists were asked to address was whether federal agencies were pursuing conflicting rd goals and if so what 30 house of representatives committee on science supercomputing is the united states on the right path hearing transcript httpcommdocshousegovcommitteesscience hsy88231000hsy88231_0fhtm 2003 p 13 31 ibid p 67 crs16 should and could be done to ensure they moved toward more coordinated unified goal another issue is whether the united states is relying too heavily on commercially available hardware to satisfy its rd needs while use of computers designed for massmarket commercial applications can certainly be part of successful highend computing rd plan congress may wish to monitor how this reliance may be driving the new emphasis on grid computing as noted earlier critics of it rd funding often state that industry should conduct more fundamental rd on their own without government backing and that fiscal restraint dictates that less funding should be made available conversely supporters of government funding would point out that it rd has very long cycle from inception to application and that any reductions in funding now could have significant negative impact for many years to come in terms of innovation and training of researchers therefore congress may monitor and assess the potential impact of deficitcutting plans on progress in it rd for other versions
