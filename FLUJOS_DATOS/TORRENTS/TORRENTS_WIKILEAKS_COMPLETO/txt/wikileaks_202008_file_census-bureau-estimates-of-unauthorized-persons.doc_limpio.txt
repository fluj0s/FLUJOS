united states census bureau census bureau is to produce more accurate in terms of refinement of categories andor up todate estimates of current available categories estimates of the foreign born by legal status and select method for the production of future estimates on an annual basis the immigration statistics staff iss of the census bureau has been funded under the international migration initiative measuring migration across us borders to develop annual estimates of the foreignborn population by legal status legal temporary unauthorized migrants quasilegal migrants at the national level1 this memo is an evaluation of the work done in the first phase of this initiative to develop annual estimates of the foreign born population by legal status totals at the national level under this phase iss is comparing the utility of different methods and datasets for estimates by legal status potential methods include residual methods statistical modeling and algorithmic assignment definitions of legal statuses and terminology there is substantial debate as to the exact legal categories that migrants fall into and what language to use to describe these categories more importantly reports from different agencies and sometimes from different parts of the same agency2 use terminology that is either undefined or inconsistent major area of potential confusion in defining immigration status categories involves foreignborn residents who have pending applications the reason is that 1 these pending applications have different objectives and potential immigration status outcomes and 2 in some cases an immigration status may be defined in terms of the reasons for estimating immigration status rather than in strict legal terms regarding 1 for example pending application may involve petitioning for legal immigrant status such as lawful legal permanent resident or lpr change of temporary or nonimmigrant status such as student applying to be temporary worker or an extension of nonimmigrant status seeking permission to remain in the united states for longer period of admission than was originally granted regarding 2 there are legitimate reasons for interpreting the immigration status of the resident foreignborn population in multiple ways for example an agency may need to render legal classification for an enforcement budget or program purpose while policymakers may want to estimate how many foreignborn residents may qualify for or be affected by proposed legislation thus there may be single uniquely correct way to estimate numbers of foreignborn residents with pending applications by immigration status classifying foreignborn residents with pending applications is also complicated because many of them 1 have also been issued employment authorization documents also called eads and 2 may or may not be legally present in the united states and may or may not become legal immigrants ie lprs with green card or granted some other immigration status3 having an ead andor being illegally present in the united states may complicate identifying correct immigration status for some foreignborn residents who are asked to identify their immigration status in survey for example those who have been issued eads 1 have some basis for thinking of or identifying themselves as documented but 2 may not know or identify themselves according to their correct immigrant statuses this applies of course to direct survey questions rather than aggregate demographic estimates there is apparent consensus by immigration researchers or federal agencies on whether or not or how to define some foreignborn residents with pending applications as unauthorized that is illegally residing in the united states because their immigration status may be ambiguous the department of homeland security dhs for example uses the term unauthorized to describe foreignborn persons residing illegally in the united states but includes some unauthorized immigrants who have pending applications in the legally resident foreignborn population4 since there is apparent consensus it is eincumbent upon us to be as clear as possible in our used of terminology therefore in order to avoid confusion we propose the following table which gives terminology and definitions for how we shall describe describing each legal status the major categories are in bold below the universe of discussion is all foreignborn persons whose place of residence is in the united states on the estimates july 1 or enumeration april 1 day5 table 1 legal status terminology term legal and procedural definition authorized legal immigrant naturalized has obtained us citizenship lawful permanent has applied for lpr status and has resident lpr been formally admitted authorized lawful temporary application has legal temporary been accepted and legal terms of admission have not been nonimmigrant violated and neither naturalized nor lpr status has been granted even if application exists refugeeasylee has applied for refugee or asylee status and been granted same or present in the us citizen of temporary protected statusrecognized country and has not converted status to legal temporary lawful permanent or naturalized residual all other unauthorized application in process but not yet or granted or other entered without inspection or violated terms of residence application in process but not yet granted within residual quasilegal has applied for lawful permanent resident legal temporary status refugee asylee or temporary protected status and status not yet granted table notes we believe that this category definition is equivalent to the office of immigration statistics ois definition we note for the record that table 1 is primarily conceptual exercise few if any data sources literally correspond to these categories either questions sufficient to classify cases are not asked or the data source is transaction database instead of person database or the lag or slippage between the data source and the population of interest is sufficiently great so that the database cannot properly represent the population of interest this lack of sufficient data is one of the greatest difficulties in estimating the foreignborn population by legal status evaluated data sources the two primary sources of data in this research project are the decennial census census 2000 and the american community survey acs for the period 2000 to 2005 in addition the survey of income and program participation sipp will be described as an alternative data source each of these data sources will be described in the following manner 1 the questionsvariables that are available and useable for studying international migration research 2 strengths and limitations 3 coverage the current population surveyannual social and economic supplement cps asec was not used in the production of these estimates because the american community survey is considered more comprehensive survey including more geography and more comprehensive universe definition than the cpsasec decennial census census 2000 description in the 2000 decennial census international migration data were collected for the entire us resident population including people residing in group quarters questions of place of birth citizenship status year of entry ancestry residence five years ago and language spoken at home were part of the decennial census long form to date the decennial census has provided the sole means by which to study small groups of the foreignborn population at the national and detailed subnational levels ie state county and subcounty strengths and limitations the main strengths of the decennial census are that it has large sample size and full geographic coverage however the census has the limitation that it is collected once every 10 years thus making it provider of comprehensive but not contemporaneous information coverage the 2000 decennial census covers all residents within the united states both household and group quarters residents further it has full geographic coverage of the united states below even the level of geographic detail needed for this project however evaluations of potential undercoverage of the foreignborn in general and unauthorized persons in particular are lacking american community survey acs description the american community survey acs is an annual nationwide survey designed to provide communities fresh look at how they are changing it is intended to eliminate the need for the long form in the 2010 census the acs collects information from us households similar to that which was collected on the census 2000 longform the foreignborn related questions in the acs are similar to those asked in census 2000 strengths and limitations the main advantage of the acs is that it is collected on an annual basis with substantial sample size however the sample size is much smaller than that in the decennial census the questions on the acs are designed to be similar to those on the decennial census long form thus making the two datasets comparable substantively though the codes available on some questions are less refined than on the decennial finally the geographic coverage of the acs for years 20002005 is as yet less complete than the decennial census coverage the acs survey years evaluated in this memo do not cover residents of group quarters the implementation of the acs was full only starting in 2005 though the number of sites and counties sampled increased annually the acs from years 20002005 was implemented at less than full geographic coverage finally as with census 2000 evaluations of potential undercoverage of the foreignborn in general and unauthorized persons in particular are lacking survey of income and program participation sipp description the survey of income and program participations sipp is national longitudinal survey of the us civilian noninstitutionalized cni population primarily collecting data on the source and amount of income labor force information and program participation and eligibility the current sample size is approximately 40000 households us census bureau december 2000 since 1984 the sipp has included migration history topical module asking respondents when they moved to their current residence the location of any previous residence and place of birth for respondents born in foreign country questions are asked on legal status citizenship status and year of entry strengths and limitations the survey of income and program participation sipp asks directly about the foreignborn persons legal status upon entry to the us using six categories 1 immediate relative or family sponsored permanent resident 2 employmentbased permanent resident 3 other permanent resident 4 granted refugee status or granted asylum 5 nonimmigrant eg diplomatic student business or tourist visa 6 other in addition second question identifies whether the respondent has converted their citizenship status from one of the non permanent categories to permanent and third question identifies if the person has become naturalized citizen major limitation to using the sipp survey is that it is currently under significant redesign the implications of the redesign are not clear at this time since it is longitudinal survey sipp suffers from sample attrition which may affect results6 in addition the immigration status questions are subject to quite high allocation rates coverage interviewing for the sipp 2004 panel began in february 2004 wave 1 interviewed eligible housing units for the fourmonth period between october 2003 and january 2004 wave 1 started with sample of 43700 eligible housing units of which 36100 were interviewed the remainder could not be interviewed due to either refusals or unavailability supplemental data sources other supplemental data sources that have been used in these estimates include data from office of immigration statistics ois office of refugee resettlement orr us citizenship and immigration services uscis and national center for health statistics mortality data methods to be evaluated four methods are evaluated in this research project the first method produces stock estimates using residual component method based on passel van hook and bean 2004 which we shall refer to as pvhb 2004 the second method produces stock estimates also using residual component method based on cassidy 2004ab which we shall refer to as cassidy 2004 the third method produces flowbased stock estimates which we shall refer to as flowbased stock finally the fourth method is an imputation modeling method which we shall refer to as sipp imputation model all of these methods will be discussed more thoroughly in this section each of these methods will be described in the following manner 1 description of the method 2 assumptions 3 strengths and limitations method 1 stock estimates residual components pvhb 2004 description the basic residual components method was used prevalently throughout the 1980s and 1990s to measure the size of unauthorized migrants in essence the approach subtracts the count of the legally resident foreign born from the total enumerated foreign born the pvhb 2004 method evaluated here is variant of the basic residual components method and derives from work by passel van hook and bean 2004 contractors with the immigration statistics staff from 20012006 in this adaptation in order to construct the residual the lawful permanent resident population is estimated using ois estimates for 2002 2004 rytina 2004 2005 2006 and extrapolated for 20002001 and for 2005 for other components this version begins with individual level survey data ie microdata from the decennial long form and the acs using characteristics such as persons place of birth year of entry age sex education occupation and spousal characteristics we attempt to match the microdata information to the requirements for the legal statuses naturalized citizens nonimmigrants and refugeesasylees the resulting algorithms or approximations of the legal status criteria are used to allocate with probability 1 each foreign born observation on the microdataset to one of these three statuses all cases that do not appear to match the criteria of one of the legal statuses are considered to be in the residual category which includes both the unauthorized eg entries without inspection and visa overstayers and the quasilegal the estimate of the residual category of the foreign born is then calculated as either the total weighted number of people in the residual category or else b the total foreign born population subtracting the weighted estimates of naturalized citizens lawful permanent residents and legal nonimmigrants assumptions this method utilizes survey data as its primary data source so assumptions associated with survey data are also assumptions in this project for instance we assume that the geographic and sampling coverage are adequate and appropriate for the measurement of legal status of the foreign born we assume that the foreign born of any legal status participate in the surveys and that any undercoverage by legal status geography or other characteristics is correctible an assumption specific to this method is that the assignment algorithm accurately measures visa lpr and naturalization requirements also the assignment is 100 assignment which assumes that everyone with the same characteristics ie matching certain visa requirements has the same status strengths and limitations this method has number of advantages as well as disadvantages for instance the method uses survey data without direct questions on legal status so the components are constructed from estimating imputing legal status rather than from administrative ie actual legal status however using microdata which has more information available than most tabulated administrative data has the advantage of more textured analysis in the future with potential legal status estimates by characteristics or at state level geography moreover continued access to relevant survey data is another advantage since the us census bureau is not an administrative or enforcement agency and does not have regular access to other agencies data an important limitation of this method assumes that the information used from the microdata actually reflect the visa lpr and citizenship criteria moreover each case matching certain characteristics is allocated as either meeting or not meeting the criteria for the legal status this 100 assignment is in actuality not always or even necessarily accurate necessarily appropriate in other words ssome cases with characteristics that appear to match the criteria of legal category may not actually have that legal status while others who by their surveyed characteristics appear not to match legal category may still have that legal status the result is slippage between the estimate and the actual number of people with legal status the slippage between the estimated and reality however is balanced by the method being highly flexible and easily adapted to accommodate three important scenarios first the requirements for the visa citizenship and lpr statuses themselves may change and change very quickly for instance by policysetting agency the algorithm method is easily changed to meet these new conditions second the algorithms can be reproduced under alternate assumptions regarding the matching between the microdata information and visa or lpr criteria in fact the approximations developed by bean passel and van hook and used in the present study incorporate corrections for overreporting of native birth and of naturalized citizenship and consistency checks between spouses and parents with their children these corrections are attempts to refine the data to reflect more accurately actual legal status but can also be altered to check on the robustness of the estimates to changes in assumptions third this method is portable to other survey datasets that have similar information on them in fact the method is being produced in the present study on two survey datasets the decennial census 2000 long form and the american community survey 20002005 while this 100 assignment by algorithm method does not assign legal status without error it has the overall advantages of flexibility reproducibility and portability method 2 stock estimates residual components with refugeeasylee modeling cassidy 2004ab description this method is an amalgamation of processes obtained from work by cassidy 2004ab and passel van hook and bean 2004 contractors with the immigration statistics staff from 2001 2006 it combines an algorithm for assigning legal temporary migrant status to us noncitizens with another algorithm for identifying the probabilities that migrant has come to the us under voluntary or humanitarian conditions the results of this combined process are estimates of the nonus citizen foreignborn population across four distinct legal status categories lpr legal temporary quasilegal and unauthorized the cassidybased method starts with the total foreignborn population for given survey year census 2000 or acs 20002005 and first removes from this pool the naturalized foreignborn in this document this will be labeled group the remaining population is put through an algorithm to extract people who are suspected lprs and not ideal candidates to be assigned legal nonimmigrant status specifically those people who entered the united states more than 10 years prior to the survey year received some form of public assistance had children who entered the us prior to them or whose spouse or householder is us citizen are not put into the temporary migrant algorithm group b this group will later be parsed into lprs and unauthorized foreign born by means of the humanitarian status algorithm the remaining foreign born are subjected to the temporary migrant algorithm which put simply assigns foreignborn people to various legal nonimmigrant categories according to various demographic conditions that they meet and performs consistency checks to ensure that spouses and children of assigned legal nonimmigrants are also classified as legal nonimmigrants group c this algorithm operates on 100 assignment based on met criteria those people who pass through the temporary migrant algorithm but are not assigned category represent the residual group d which is assumed to contain refugees asylees quasilegal migrants and unauthorized migrants when the four major groups have been formed the total foreignborn population is then subjected to the humanitarian status algorithm in this stage of the methodology each case in the dataset is assigned probability of being an involuntary migrant refugee asylee or quasi legal on the basis of their country of birth and year of us entry these probabilities are derived from uscis administrative records of annual lpr refugee and asylee flows after this process the probability assigned to each case is multiplied by the personweight original or reweighted to create new grouping weight when aggregated according to the grouping weight estimates of humanitarian and voluntary migrants for each migrant status group are generated naturalized citizens group and legal nonimmigrants group c do not need to be parsed further so they are left as is among the suspected lprs group b most of the cases are assigned to lpr status with the exception of the aggregated estimate of voluntary migrants who entered the us between 10 and 20 years before the survey year that do not meet any other condition used to create group b these people are instead assumed to be unauthorized migrants finally among the residual group d the aggregated estimate of involuntary migrants are assumed to be quasilegal refugees or asylees whereas the aggregated estimate of voluntary migrants are assumed to be unauthorized migrants assumptions many of the same assumptions mentioned in the method text above are also pertinent to this method strengths and limitations this method has number of advantages as well as disadvantages because it is an amalgamation of processes it shares many of the strengths and some of the limitations mentioned in the method above method 3 flowbased stock estimates description in essence this method follows similar type of demographic accounting procedure to that used for producing national state and county population estimates for the total resident population ie administrative records component of population change method for population estimates the components of population change are births deaths net domestic migration net international migration and net military movement to and from overseas however for estimating foreignborn population by legal status the appropriate components of population change are bit more complex the equation for each type of legal status category i has the following flow equation between time t1 and time t2 pic where picforeignborn population of legal status i at time t2 picforeignborn population of legal status i at time t1 picnew arrival foreignborn population of legal status i between time t1 and time t2 picadjustment of foreignborn population into legal status i between time t1 and time t2 picadjustment of foreignborn population out of legal status i between time t1 and time t2 picforeignborn population of legal status i expelled between time t1 and time t2 picforeignborn population of legal status i emigrated between time t1 and time t2 picforeignborn population of legal status i who died between time t1 and time t2 in addition the sum of each legal status category i at time t must equal the total estimate of the foreignborn population at time t as shown below pic where fb total foreignborn population nat naturalized foreignborn population lpr legal permanent resident foreign born population lt legal temporary foreignborn population ref refugeeasylee foreign born population ql quasilegal foreignborn population oth other foreignborn population conceptually the above equation fully represents the appropriate flows of the foreignborn population from one category to another as well as movement from outside the system and exits to outside the system in practice however the data sources required to construct stock estimate based on appropriately accounting for movement between legal status categories have not been available many alternatives have been attempted each one simplifying one or another category combining flows etc assumptions major assumption underlying this approach is that the components of population change are closely approximated by measuring change in selected administrative or survey data sources in order to apply the model census bureau demographers estimate each component of population change and legal status category separately in addition this method makes the crucial assumption that the administrative and survey data that are used to construct demographic flows are comparable that is that the time reference time frame for data production and concepts can be appropriately compared to one another strengths and limitations using data to approximate the measures of components of change that can be updated on an annual basis could prove to be invaluable as this would be more representative of the process that is actually happening in the population however the assumption that there is available data that closely approximates the measure of each of the components of change within particular legal status category may prove to be difficulty and should be viewed as potential and important limitation to the use of this method of estimation if certain components of the equation cannot be accurately approximated by the data then it is possible that the residual category will be significantly overestimated while other legal status categories will be underestimated since the sum of all legal status categories at time t must be equal to the total foreign born population at time t this slippages between data sources is significant limitation of this method such slippage is result of transactionbased data that we have been unable to convert to personbased estimate transitions between categories that are asyet unaccounted for the requirement of various assumptions eg foreignborn emigration that we deem to be excessive special note on flowbased stock estimates as of the writing of this memorandum while many attempts to construct flows that would be appropriate have been attempted the results are as yet infeasible thus in this memorandum we will not present the flowbased estimates method 4 sipp imputation model description developing legal status imputation model with the sipp and applying that model to acs data provides an alternative method with very different basis than the preceding three methods the method uses sipp data as tool for developing statistical imputation model in the following fashion 1 recode the sipp questions into categories that can be used to predict legal status 2 determine comparability between sipp and acs variables and concepts 3 develop multinomial logistic regression model that uses sipp data to predict persons immigration status 4 using the estimated parameters from sipp apply the model to acs respondents 5 tabulate acs respondents by applying predicted probabilities to the acs person weight thereby creating vector of probability weights assumptions in this concept the american community survey acs serves as the base for constructing stock estimates the acs data sets contain individual person records and associated address data the model that links the two data sets requires equivalent or approximately equivalent variables as right hand side predictors this imputation method is not new it has been used in place of statistical matching or other hot deck procedures in other contexts eg imputing health insurance status or imputing tax statuses there are many assumptions included in this method 1 the sipp data can be recoded in way that is reasonable representation of the respondents current migration status 2 the imputation model will have sufficiently high goodnessoffit properties to make it feasible to impute individual legal statuses and 3 the parameters estimated on the sipp will be successful when applied to acs strengths and limitations the main strengths of this method are that the multinomial logit model allows the use of more refined characteristics to derive estimates in addition using probabilistic approach allows for the creation of probabilistic weights and aggregate estimates by category and range of probabilities may be specified for each individual observation allowing for the extension of microsimulation finally this method allows for multiple estimates including for subgroups by age race sex and educational attainment and is relatively easy to implement the main limitation of this method involves the timing and availability of data sipp estimates are static estimates for spanning january to april 2004 acs estimates are being derived for multiple years policy and behavioral changes that affect immigration patterns may not be captured in the models vector of probabilities another important limitation is that different sample designs are used for data collection the sipp sample is panel where all households are interviewed in fourmonth collection window the acs sample is collected on rolling basis using 12month reference period corresponding roughly to calendar year that along with the fact that we are predicting probabilities based on monthly data while predicting probabilities using annual data is another potential concern finally with sample size of less than 50000 households sipps sample is comparatively small relative to other nationally based surveys eg cpsasec and acs the foreignborn portion of the sipp sample is only 9825 unweighted cases 625 of which are children under the age of 15 these cases form the basis for the imputation model evaluation criteria and preliminary results the goal of this internal memo is to first give initial or preliminary results of the four methods documented above with regards to total foreign born population estimates by legal status at the national level the second goal of this internal memo is to document the criteria that we propose to use to evaluate these methods for selection recommendation purposes as well as show preliminary results of this evaluation while recommendation of finalized estimates is not feasible currently we can begin to discuss set of evaluation criteria that these finalized estimates will be evaluated against the first objective is to produce timely estimates of migrants by legal status so that the data and information available to the american people are relevant second set of highpriority objectives involves the refinement of the legal status estimates in three ways one refinement is to produce estimates by characteristics or subpopulations such as age sex race and hispanic origin and place of birth second refinement is to disaggregate the residual legal status category finally the objectives for this project are always balanced with the general objectives of maintaining the accuracy quality and production value of the data evaluation criteria description the questions we were attempting to answer included the following 1 timely information is the dataset and method expected to be available for future estimates will the estimates be able to be produced annually will the method accommodate changes in law regarding legal requirements and definitions for different visa categories 2 refinement of legal status estimates will the method produce reasonable estimates by subpopulations particularly by place of birth will the method produce reasonable estimates in four categories ie disaggregate the residual legal status category 3 production will the method maintain accuracy of the estimates will the method maintain consistency or robustness of estimates under alternative assumptions will the estimates relate to the estimates of net international migration nim or with the existing population estimates area estimates with the aforementioned questions and objectives in mind this paper seeks to recommend and select dataset and method for producing finalized estimates as well as population characteristics and geography by which to produce finalized estimates towards this end we use several evaluation methods to decide on the most appropriate estimation method we compare estimates across different methods within the same dataset and b across datasets within the same method if time allows specifically the comparisons we make are as follows 1 compare acs 2000 to census 2000 stock figures within method 2 compare stock estimates from acs 20012005 from the passel van hook and bean method the cassidy method and the sipp imputation method 3 preliminary assessment

hispanic origin persons sipp acs implementation same as above it should be noted that none of the uscb methods use group quarters data in either the census 2000 or the acs 20002005 datasets only household data the ois 2006 method adjusts the acs data for group quarters because the administrative records used for lprs refugees and asylees do include group quarters although one may point out that the cassidybased method also employs the uscis administrative records the distinction in this case is that the cassidybased method uses the records in an indirect application creating humanitarian status probabilities whereas the ois method uses the records directly as components in the formula the ois 2006 estimates derived from the acs pums data are generated with the original personweight which is based upon the most current population controls available in that survey year over time the population controls are prone to change as more information about the us population is discovered thus personweighted acs estimates from two different survey years are not strictly comparable since they are based on different assumptions and therefore control totals about the population therefore two ois 2006 estimates of the unauthorized foreignborn from different years would also not be strictly comparable the estimates presented here however are based on an internal weighting series that uses the same and most recent set of population controls for all survey years from 2000 to 2005 the estimates derived by these consistently controlled weights are comparable across time

d each set has two tests the first using combined legal immigrant category and the second disaggregates the category into the naturalized and lawful permanent resident populations the numbers for the tests are given in 1000s rather than millions outstanding research questions and future work while the production of these preliminary experimental estimates represent substantial achievement for the immigration statistics staff the work is by means complete in fact constructing these estimates has raised even more questions about our available data sources and their uses in this section we summarize five threads of research some of which are ongoing that we see as being valuable in the near future in order of priority evaluation of the usefulness of these methods four methods were tested one the flowbased stock method while conceptually appealing could not be properly supported by data andor modeling assumptions are there weaknesses in our implementation of the methods do there exist other creative solutions that we have not yet explored we have funded substantial evaluation project httpswwwsabresystemscomnewasp that will examine and criticize these methods and suggest improvements analysis of coverage levels and the effect of coverage on estimates repeatedly in this memorandum we have made reference to supposed undercoverage many believe passel van hook and bean 2004 passel 2006 sum fogg and harrington 2002 that the decennial census and ongoing surveys fail to capture the foreignborn population in general and the unauthorized in particular at rates higher than the rest of the population this assertion seems intuitively reasonable and some empirical evidence supports this belief marcelli and ong 2002 however what is not known at this time is what rate this supposed undercoverage takes rates ranging from 25 to 20 have been proposed depending upon the particular subgroupand indeed the final resulting estimates are sensitive to the assumed rate situation where the resulting estimate depends heavily upon an assumed rate that is itself not wellknown is both statistically and demographically unacceptable we expect to perform research in the near future to attempt to address this lacuna in current knowledge continued attempts to construct feasible demographic accounting flow based methods despite the difficulties with demographic accounting flowbased methods for estimating the foreignborn population by legal status they continue to remain demographicallyprincipled alternative to the three methods whose results we present here in particular we would like to probe ois concepts and data for method to unduplicate flows of legal temporary migrantsthe category that appendix b will reveal as most problematic for flow methods continued attempts to estimate emigration of nativeborn and foreignborn populations it appears that all methods of population estimation and virtually all countries of the world have struggled with attempts to estimate emigration of nativeborn and foreignborn populations very few countries monitor their borders sufficiently to provide reliable and consistent emigration data despite this we have funded several studies eg van hook zhang bean and passel 2006 schacter 2005 and analyses of internal data sets to determine whether better estimate of emigration by nativity status in particular is possible analysis of additional data sets many data sets were examined in one form or another including international data sets to construct these four experimental estimates yet we have not yet reached the limit of possible candidate databases some of these reside in the office of immigration statistics and require careful analysis of strengths and weaknesses as well as appropriate interagency agreements to determine if and how they can be used others have already been acquired by the us census bureau and it is matter of determining whether they can be used for this estimates purpose summary in summary we have tested and evaluated four methods for estimating the foreignborn population by legal status we have researched and adapted methods for constructing such estimates

background certain aliens who are temporarily in the united states may file form i765 application for employment authorization to request an employment authorization document ead there are more than 40 eligible categories under which aliens may apply for an ead including temporary protected status spousedependent of foreign government official spouse of class treaty trader or treaty investor nonimmigrant fiancee of us citizen public interest parolee and certain legalization applicants some aliens who are issued eads separately apply for and can be expected to receive legal permanent resident lpr or green card or other status allowing them to live permanently in the united states others such as the spouse of class l intracompany transferee temporary worker may leave the united states after their lawful period of admission expires or become overstays an overstay is an illegal alien who was legally admitted to the united states for specific authorized period but remained here after that period expired without obtaining an extension or change of status or meeting other specific conditions under certain circumstances an application for extension or change of status can temporarily prevent foreign visitors status from being categorized as illegal 4dhs defines unauthorized immigrants as foreignborn persons who entered without inspection or who violated the terms of temporary admission and who have not acquired lpr status or gained temporary protection against removal by applying for an immigration benefit 2002 yearbook of immigration statistics department of homeland security washington dc us government printing office 2003 p 213 these definitions are taken from separate report estimates of the unauthorized immigrant population residing in the united

migration topical module data used here are from wave 2 which minimizes attrition 7 of course it is also clear that the decennial census and american community surveys ask directly about citizenship status thus giving those estimates basis in data that is not available to the other legal status categories therefore it is not surprisingly that this category should be estimated well 8 other estimates or partialestimates also exist for example justich and ng 2005 or sum harrington and fogg 2002 we note for the record that often these estimates focus on illegal or undocumented immigration and do not attempt to estimate naturalized lawful permanent resident refugeeasylee or legal nonimmigrant populations
