dissatisfaction with bulgarias political class experts note that it has been common phenomenon in central nd eastern europe that when former communist party such as the bsp moves to the center often as part of european integration efforts its place in the political spectrum is often taken over by populist and nationalist groups the process of forming new government proved difficult in part because of the scattered distribution of the vote and persona l animosity among party leaders including within the centerright portion of the politi cal spectrum the stalemate was finally resolved on august 15 when the parliament approved new coalition government it is composed of the bsp mrf and nmsp with bsp leader sergei stanishev as prime minister critics claim that stanishev is relatively weak leader and that real power rests in the hands of party barons particularly in the bsp and mr f this situation they say has hindered reform imp lementation and the fight against corruption despite the defection of some nm sp deputies to the opposition in 2007 the government retains majority and appears determined to stay in power until 2009 when new elections must be held new party citizens for

purvanov backed by th bsp won reelection in 2006 although purvanov is one of bulgarias most popular po litical figures most political power is held by the prime minister and government the bulgarian presidency is relatively weak economic situation bulgaria is one of the poorest countries in europe according to the world bank its per capita income is only 56 of that of the eight central and eastern european countries that joined the eu in 2004 as in many other transition countries sofia and other urban areas are more prosperous than rural ones which have suffered an exodus of young people bulgaria is also battling rapidly shrinking and aging population due partly to low birth rate and partly to the emigrati on of large numbers of young bulgarians to betterpaying jobs in western europe mistakes and fitful reforms made by previous governments culminating in disastrous policies pursued by previous bsp government in 19951996 were serious setbacks however bulgarias econo mic situation has improved substantially since 1997 when the countrys currency was pegged to the euro under currency board arrangement which gives the bulgarian central bank little discretion in setting monetary policy from 1998 through 2005 bulgaria has had an averag economic growth rate of more than 5 per year gross domestic product gdp grew by just under 6 in the first three quarters of 2007

activities as trafficking in persons drugs and weapons money laundering counterfeiting optical disc piracy and credit card fraud highlevel corruption is also critical issue powerful politicians are perceived as operating their ministries as corrupt fiefdoms with relative impunity one of bulgarias biggest challenges is longdelayed judicial reform the bulgarian system remains weak corrupt and sometimes politicized1 experts believe that bulgaria must also overhaul its education and health care systems foreign policy bulgarias foreign policy in recent years has focused on joining nato and
