from the prophet mohammed has ruled morocco since the 17th century although the country was protectorate of france from 1912 until indepe ndence in 1956 king hassan ii aged 69 has led morocco for 37 years his heir pparent is crown prince sidi mohammed aged 34 but interior minister driss basri is wide ly regarded as the second most powerful man in the realm soon after he ascended to the throne th king initiated process of gradual controlled democratiza tion constitution providing for representative government was approved in 1962 but two unsuccessful coup ttempts in the 1970s derailed the process for some time the kings heightened atte ntion to democratizati on in recent years may result from concern about succession he is of advancing age and s intermittent health problems the crown princes fitness to succeed and personal conduct have been questioned the kings steadfast commitment to political change and stable political system may partly reflect his appreciation of his sons weaknesses the crown prince goes on selected foreign missions and has b een increasingly visible at imageenhancing charitable events 1992 constitution created uni cameral legislature with more responsibilities than previous parliaments c onstitutional amendments in 1996 changed the framework to bicameral parliament on november 14 1997 the 325seat lower house chamber of deputies was elected by direct vote on december 5 labor unions professional organizations and local government offici als selected the 270seat upper house the chamber of counsellors which has the unpr ecedented power to topple government by vote of confidence and may amend laws some older political parties had coalesced over time into three blocs the opposition koutla bloc the kings loyalists of wifaq consensus and the wasit or centre independents the koutla s socialist union of popular forces usfp won the most lowe r house seats and its leader abderrahmane youssoufi was named to be prime minister on february 4 1998 the king had long desired an opposition government to bring fresh approaches to the countrys problems and revitalize the political system yet the c oup attempts of the 1970s had made him fear threats to his regime and depend on interior minister basris sometimes brutal oversight of national security therefore the king would not grant the koutlas demand for basris removal which had been the koutlas condition for participa tion when youssoufi abandoned that demand he was chosen to the head what emerged as coalition government of seve n parties from the koutla and centre basri remains interior minister with control over security matters elements of the nonsecurity part of his portfolio have been shifted to the ministry of administr ation in ddition youssoufi has rapidly established himself as the kings point of contact with the government supplanting basri in that role youssoufi has been attempting to reduce basris influence in other matters the few other retained ministers include abdellatif filali former prime minister who is foreign minister koutla controls the economic portfolios and the government program emphasizes economic and social issues with unemployment and
