and privacy summary in april 2003 the sequence of the hum an genome was deposited into public databases this milestone which has been compared to the discoveries of galileo and other advances in gene tics have created novel legal issues relating to genetic information the human genome project pr oduced detailed maps of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes and sequenced 99 of the three billion nucleotide bases that make up the human genome the seque nce information should aid in the identification of genes underlying disease raising hope for genetic therapies to cure disease but this scientific accomplishment is not without potential problems for instance the presence of specific genetic variation may indicate predisposition to disease but does not guarant ee that the person will manife st the disease how should an employer or insurer respond the ethi cal social and legal implications of these technological advances have been the s ubject of significant scrutiny and concern the legal implications of such informati on have been addre ssed in various ways largely by states but also by congress the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 pl 104191 is the first federal law to specifically address discrimination and insurance issues relating to genetic discrimination congress is currently consid ering genetic disc rimination legislation hr 493 the

stated with completion of the human genome sequence scientists will now focus on understanding the clinical and public health implications of the sequence information all disease has genetic component and therefore genomic research has the potential to substantially reduce the collective burden of disease in the general population clinical genetic tests are becoming available at rapid rate with 1013 clinical genetic tests currently available4 in addition private insurers are beginning to include some clinical genetic tests in their health insurance benefits packages as evidence of the tests clinical validity accumulates5 for example some health plans have coverage policies for specific conditions such as hereditary cancer testing cystic fibrosis tay sachs dis ease and hereditary hemochromatosis these scientific advances in genetics while promising are not without potential problems the ethical social and legal imp lications of genetic research have been the subject of significant scrutiny and portion of the funds for the human genome project are set aside to support the anal ysis and research of these issues6 s scientific knowledge about genetics becomes increasingly widespread numerous researchers and commentators including dr francis collins have expressed concerns about how this information will used7 in congressional testimony dr collins stated while genetic information and genetic technology hold great promise for improving human heath they can also be used in ways that are fundamentally unjust genetic information can be used as the basis for insidious discriminationthe misuse of genetic information has the potential to be very serious problem both in terms of peoples access to employment and health insurance and the continued ability to undertake important genetic research8 this concern has encompassed fear of discrimination in many aspects of life including employment and health and life insurance study on

by an adoption agency to allow woman at risk for h untingtons disease to adopt based on the womans genetic risk and termination from em ployment after disclosure of risk of huntingtons disease10 similarly another study reported that twentytwo percent of the respondents indicated that they or family member were refused health insurance as result of genetic condition11 both the us chamber of commerce and americas health insurance plans ahip have countered that there is convincing evidence that employers or insurers engage in genetic discrimination and that federal legislation to prohibit discrimination based on genetic information is unnece ssary12 larry lorber representing the us chamber of commerce stated in congressional testimony that there is little to evidence of employer collection or misuse of genetic information in todays workplace this is despite continued predictions that in the absence of bill the fear of increased insurance costs absenteeism and low productivity would inevitably drive vast numbe rs of employers to genetic testing of the workforce and employment discrimin ation based on genetic makeup whether it is due to the threat of liability under ex isting protections fear of public backlash moral concerns or simply lack of interest employer collection and misuse of genetic information remains largely confined to the pages of science fiction he goes on to state that the current body of federal law including the ada title vii of the civil rights act hipaa and other federal laws are more than ample to deal with any misuse of genetic information13 in discussions with the secretarys advisory committee on genetics health and society sacghs the chamber stated that while it does not believe that employers are engaging in genetic

activities moreover federal and state laws currently prohibit the inappropriate use of genetic information15 legal cases of genetic discrimination have been few however studies have shown that public fear of discrimination is substantial and negatively influences the uptake of genetic testing and the use of ge netic information by consumers and health professionals sacghs lear ned that 68 of americans are concerned about who would have access to their personal genetic information 31 state this concern would prevent them from having genetic test and 68 agree that insurers would do everything possible to use genetic in formation to deny health coverage16 2004 survey conducted by the genetics and p ublic policy center found that 92 of americans oppose employer access to pers onal

report by the department of labor the department of health and human services the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and the department of justice summarized the various studies on discrimination based on genetic information and argued for the enac tment of federal legi slation the report stated that genetic predisposition or conditions can lead to workplace discrimination even in cases where work ers are healthy and unlikely to develop disease or where the genetic condition has effect on the ability to perform work and that because an individuals genetic in formation has implications for his or her family members and future generations misuse of genetic information could have intergenerational effects that are far broader than any individual incident of misuse20 concluding that existing protections are minimal the report went on to call for the enactment of legislation wh ich states that 1 employers should not require or request that employees or pot ential employees take genetic test or provide genetic information as condition of employment or benefits 2 employers should not use genetic information to discriminate against limit segregate or classify employees and 3 employers should not obtain or disclose genetic information about employees or potentia l employees under mo st circumstances21 according to the labor department report employers

issues affecting individuals with disabilities published position paper arguing for the enactment of federal legislation prohibiting genetic discrimination on ma rch 4 2002 the ncd argues that recent advances in genetic research have brought an increas ing potential for genetic discrimination that genetic discrimination is historical and current reality that genetic discrimination undermines the purposes of genetic research nd testing that genetic test information has little value for purposes of making employment decisions and insurance decisions and that existing laws are insu fficient to protect individuals from genetic discrimination23 president bush has also made the prohibition of genetic discrimination one of the key components of his health care reform agenda in his june 2001 radio address to the nation the president stated that g enetic discrimination is unfair to workers and their families it is unjustified among other reasons because it involves little more than medical speculation genetic predisposition toward cancer or heart disease does not mean the condition will deve lop to deny employment or insurance to healthy person based only on pred isposition violates our countrys belief in equal treatment and individual merit24 the administration has indicated that it favors enactment of legisla tion to prohibit the improper use of genetic information in health insurance and employment25 it should be emphasized that legal issues relating to genetics may vary depending on whether insurance employme nt or other types of discrimination or medical research are involved approaches to addressing the issues raised in these contexts vary from taking legislative action addressing certain specific concerns as was done in the health insurance port ability and accountability act or more far reaching approaches such as comprehensiv legislation on genetics or legislation focused on all medical records including genetic information generally legal issues raised regarding genetics have been based on two main concepts privacy and discrimination the privacy interests of an individual in his or her genetic information have been seen as significant and protecting these interests is seen as making discriminatory actions based on this information less likely however another approach would be to prohibit this potential misuse of the information by prohibiting discrimination some statutes like the americans with disabilities act ada 42 usc 12101 et seq take twopronged approach tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30006crs7 26 65 fed reg 82460 dec 20 2000

informati on about disabilities by both protecting the confidentiality of the information nd by prohibiting discriminatory acts currently there are federal laws that directly and comprehensively address the issues raised by the use of genetic information there are however few laws that address parts of these issues but the only federal law that directly addresses the issue of discrimination based on genetic information is the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa on february 8 2000 president clinton issued an executive order prohibiting discrimination against federal employees based on protected genetic information on december 20 2000 the depa rtment of health and human services issued final regu lations on medical privacy which are not specific to genetics but cover all persona l health information including genetic information26 this rule went into effect on april 14 2001 but was amended in 200227 in addition many states have enacted laws which vary widely in their approaches to the protecti on of genetic information discrimination the health insuran ce portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa pl 104191 the health insurance po rtability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa28 has been hailed as taking impor tant steps toward banning genetic discrimination in health insurance but s also been criticized as not going far enough29 the act prohibits group health plan or issuer of group health plan from using genetic information to establish rules for eligibility or continued eligibility and provides that genetic information shall not be treated as preexisting condition in the absence of the diagnosis of the condition related to such information it also prohibits group health plan or issuer of group health plan from using genetic information in setting premium cont ribution these protections apply to individuals within the group plans they do not apply to the acceptance of the whole group or to the premiums set for the group thus hipaa prohibits group health plans or issuers of group health plans from charging an individual higher premiumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30006crs8 30 it should also be noted the hipaa c ontains certain requirements regarding the standardization of claims that raise potential privacy issues hipaa addressed these issues by requiring either congressional action or re gulatory action to protect privacy more detailed discussion of this issue is contained in the section on privacy 31 42 usc 12102 32 rep owens stated that these protections of the ada will so benefit individuals who are identified through genetic tests as being ca rriers of diseaseassociated gene there is record of genetic discrimination against such individuals most recently during sickle cell screening programs in the 1970s with the advent of new forms of genetic testing it is even more critical that the protections of the ada be in place under the ada such individuals may not be discriminated against simply because they may not be qualified for job sometime in the future the determina tion as to whether an individual is qualified must take place at the time of the empl oyment decision and may not be based on speculation regarding the future moreover such individuals may not be discriminated against because they or their children migh t incur increased health care costs for the employer 136 cong

2000e et seq may provide so protection against certain kinds of genetic discrimination since an argument coul d be made that discrimination based on genetic disorders that are racially or ethnically

because of concerns bout matters such as cps productivity insurance costs and attendance r is treating cp as having an impairment that substantially limits major life activity accordingly cp is covered by the third part of the definition of disability 38 prior to the supreme courts decisions there were three major limitations on the eeoc interpretation first the ada specifically excludes insurance from its coverage except that continuedterri seargent filed with the eeoc alleging genetic di scrimination and received determination on november 21 2000 that the eeocs i nvestigation supported her allegation of discr imination under the ada34 eeoc interpretation of the ada re garding genetic discrimination the ada has been interpreted by the qual employment opportunity commission eeoc as including genetic information relating to illness disease or other disorders35 the legislative history was cited by the eeoc in its guidance to the definition of disability for its compliance manual in this guidance the eeoc examined the definition of disability unde r the ada noting that the definition was composed of three prongs disability means 1 physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual 2 record of such an impairment or 3 bein g regarded as having such an impairment36 it was under the third prong that the eeoc determined that di scrimination based on genetic information relating to illness disease or other disorders was prohibited37 although this eeoc interpreta tion was widely heralded as significant step for the protection of rights for individua ls whose genes indicate an increased susceptibility to illness disease or other disorders it is limited in its application and may be even more limited after the recent supreme court decisions on the definition of disability38 however the eeoc has not wit hdrawn this guidance and at senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30006crs10 38 continued this exclusion shall not be used as subterfuge to evade the purposes of title i and iii the exact parameters of this provision especially as it relates to genetic information are unclear although it would appear fair to say the nondi scrimination protections for individuals with certain genes would be considerably stronger in the employment context than when such individuals are being considered for insura nce coverage second the eeoc interpretation is part of guidance issued in its compliance manual specific prohibitions of discrimination in this area were not included in the stat ute and were also not part of the eeocs regulations even if court gives deference to the guidance as indicative of the agencys view of the statute court would not likely give such guidance the deference it would accord to statutory or regulatory language in addition even ssuming the ada was found to apply it may not protect employees from having their employers have access to their genetic information although the ada prohibits an employer from making medical inquiries prior to job offer the employer may obtain medical information in certain cases after the offer of employment has been made even if the prohibitions against discrimination in the ada would apply it would be difficult to prove that genetic information was the reason for discrimination 39 statement of commissioner paul steven miller

decisions on genetic testin g is barred under the adas regarded as prong as stated in eeocs 1995 policy guidance on the definition of the term disability moreover genetic testing as conducted in this case also violates the ada as an unlawful medical exam42 supreme court ada decisions although the combination of the adas legislative history and the eeocs guidance has led commentators to argue that the ada would cover genetic disc rimination the merit of these arguments has been uncertain since there have been reported cases holding that the ada prohibits genetic discrimination this uncertainty has increased in light of supreme court decisions on the definition of disability under the ada43 the first supreme court ada case to address the defi nition of disability was bragdon v abbott 1998 case involving dentist who refused to treat an hiv infected individual outside of hospital44 in bragdon the court found that the plaintiffs asymptomatic hiv infection was physical impairment impacting on the major life activity of reproduc tion thus rending hiv infection disability under the ada in two 1999 cases the court examined the definitional issue whether the effects of medication or ssistive devices should be taken into consideration in determining whether or not an individual has disability the court in the landmark decisions of sutton v united airlines45 and murphy v united parcel service inc46 held contrary to the interpretation given by the eeoc that the determination of whether an individual has disability shoul d be made with re ference to mitigating measures in reaching this holding the court l ooked to the first prong of the definition of disability having physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activitie s of an individual and emphasized that the phrase substantially limits appears in the present indicative verb form requiring that person be presently not potentially or hypothetically substantially limited in orde r to demonstrate disabilitya person whose physical or mental impairment is corrected by medi cation or other measures does not have an impairment that presently substantially limits major life activity47 in albertsonshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30006crs12 48 527 us 555 1999 49 534 us 184 2002 50 527 us 471 491 1999inc v kirkingburg48 the court held unanimously that the ada requires proof that the limitation on major life activity by the impairment is substantial the court in sutton also looked at the findings enacted as part of the ada which stated that some 43000000 americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities and found that this figure was inconsistent w ith the argument that the statute covered individuals without looking at the mitigating effects of medications or devices the individualized nature of the inquiry into whether an individual was an individual with disability was emphasized more recently the court held in toyota motor manufacturing v williams49 that to be an individual with disability under th act an individual must have substantial limitations that are central to daily life not just limited to particular job the court held that to be substantially limited in performing manual tasks an individual must have an impairment that prevents or verely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most peoples daily lives significantly the court also stated that the impairments impact must also be permanent or long term although the courts decision in sutton did not turn on the third prong of the definition of disability being regarded as having such an impairment the court did address the interpretation of this part of the definition there are two ways the court stated that an individual can fall w ithin the regarded as prong 1 covered entity mistakenly believes that person has physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities or 2 covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities the court found that on its own the allegation th at an entity has vision requirement in place does not establish claim that the tity regards an individual as substantially impaired in the major life activity of working the term substantially limits was regarded as significant it requires at minimum that plaintiffs allege they are unable to work in broad class of jobs50 the court emphasized that it was assuming without deciding that working is major life activity and that the eeoc regulations interpreting substantially limits are reasonable and found that even using the eeoc interpretation the plaintiffs in sutton failed to allege adequately that their vision is regarded as an impairment that substantially limits them in major life activity being precluded from being global airline pilot was not sufficient since they could obtain other although less lucr ative jobs as regional pilots or pilot instructors the regarded as prong was directly at issue in murphy in murphy the court held that the fact that an individual with high blood pressure was unable to meet the department of trans portation dot safety standards was not sufficient to create an issue of fact regarding whether an individual is regarded as unable to utilize class of jobs like sutton the holding in murphy emphasized the numerous other jobs available to the plaintiff httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30006crs13 51 eeoc compliance manual vol 2 section 902 order 91500290245 1995 the supreme courts decisions on the ada did not directly address genetic discrimination and it is possible that th ada could be interpreted to cover particular genetic defect however the reasoning used in the courts recent decisions appears to make it unlikel that an ada claim based on genetic discrimination would be succe ssful there are several factors that lead to this conclusion first the supreme court in sutton specifically struck down an interpretation by the eeoc regarding the use of mitigating factors and raised questions concerning the validity of the eeocs interp retation the court also found statutory authority for agency interpretation of the definition of disability the eeoc had taken the position that whether or not an individual has disability shoul d be determined by what his or her condition would be wit hout medication or an assistive device rejecting this eeoc interpretation in sutton the supreme court noted that agency was given the authority to interpre t the term disability but that because both parties accepted the regulations as valid we have occasion to consider what deference they are due if any similarly in murphy the court clearly stated that its use of the eeoc regulations did not indi cate that the regulations were valid however in its earlier decision in bragdon v abbott the court had found its conclusion that hiv infection was cove red by the ada to be reinforced by administrative guidance issued by the jus tice department the cases subsequent to bragdon did not examine this seeming cont radiction so exactly how future decision would view eeoc regulations and guidance is uncertain this issue is especially important regarding potential cases of genetic discrimination since the eeoc has published guidance indicating that the ada covers genetic discrimination51 and there are reported cases similarly the supreme court showed little indication to examine the legislative history of the ada the court in sutton held that it was not necessary to consider the legislative history of the ada regardin g the issue of whether individuals should be examined in their uncorrected state or with the use of mitigating medications or devices it found that the statutory langua ge was sufficient to support its holding on this issue although the issue regarding genetic discrimination is distinct from that of the use of mitigating medications and devices the courts general reluctance to examine legislative history in sutton may indicate that the language on genetic discrimination quoted above from the c ongressional debates also would not be examined the courts reliance in sutton upon the findings in the ada that 43000000 americans have one or more physical disabilities also indicates that the court may not find genetic defects to be covered the number of individuals cited in the findings as having disability was seen by the court as inconsistent with the argument that the statute covered individuals whose disabilities were mitigated by medications or devices since the preval ence of genetic defect s is believed to be widespread coverage of genetic defect s could arguably include almost every individual thus it is possible that the court could use the sa rationale as in sutton to find genetic defects not included httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30006crs14 52 in testimony before the senate committ ee on health education labor and

discriminati on in some instances the protections it affords offer little security to people with genetic mark ers and health conditions that have not yet developed into fullblown debilitating

feb 13 2002 reprinted at httphelpsen ategovhearings2002_02_13imparatopdfin bragdon v abbott where the court found that hiv infection was covered under the ada the majority opinion spen t considerable time discussing the immediate physiological effects of the infection this woul d appear to be consistent with the holding in sutton that the substantially limits definitional language requires that the substantial limitation not be potential or hypothetical in addition in toyota motor manufacturing v williams substantial limitations were seen by the court as those that are central to daily lif not just limited to particular job this reasoning could be contrasted to the situ ation presented by ge netic defects which in many cases do not ever manifest inte restingly in his dissenting opinion in bragdon v abbott then chief justice rehnquist who was in the majority in sutton stated that the argument regarding coverage of hiv infection taken to its logical extreme would render every individual with genetic marker for some debilitating disease disabled here and now because of some possible future effects whether the court would now share this view that such coverage of genetic discrimination is an invalid interpretation of the definition is uncertain especially since the court in bragdon was discussing the first prong of the defi nition not the regarded as prong which is the most likely basis for c overage of genetic defects in other cases the court provided c onsiderable guidance concerning the regarded as prong of the definition of disability the most likely aspect of the definition to be used to find coverage of genetic defects including the requirement that the individual be regarded as substantially limited in major life activity the court found that this language meant that being precluded from particular job was not sufficient to be substantially limited in the major life activity of working if other jobs in the same class coul d be obtained and when this specific issue was raised in murphy the plaintiff was not found to be re garded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working the main point of this rather complicated discussion is that making the case that one is regarded as substantially limited in major life activity particularly the major life activity of working is likely to be difficult the supreme courts decisions do not directly address ada coverage of genetic discrimination they emphasize an individualized approach to the determination of whether an individual has disability under the ada although an argument could be made that the ada woul d cover individuals w ith genetic defects in certain cases the courts decisions particularly sutton and murphy use reasoning that would make it unlikely that most ada claims based on ge netic discrimination would be successful52 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30006crs15 53 42 usc 12182 54 42 usc 121817f 55 for more detailed discussion see robert b lanman an analysis of

although the ada prohibits an employer fro m making medical inquiries prior to job offer the employer may obtain medical information in certain cases after the offer of employment has been made assuming that the prohibitions against discrimination in the ada would apply it is difficult to prove that genetic information was the reason for discriminati on this raises issues relating to the privacy of genetic information the ada and health insurance title iii of the ada provides that individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods services facilities privilege s advantages or accommodations of any place of public accommodation53 place of public accommodation is defined in part as an insurance office54 it could be argued that discrimination in insurance on the basis of genetic information would be violation of title iii of the ada55 however such an argument would be limited since in addition to the limitations of the definition of disability discussed previously the ada specifically states that titles i throug h iv shall not be construed to prohibit or restrict an insurerfrom underwriting ri sks classifying risks or administering such risks that are based on or not inconsistent with state law56 the ada also provides that this provision shall not be us ed as subterfuge to evade the purposes of titles i and iii57 the issue of insurance was discussed by the department of justice in its technical ssistance manual which observed that the ada therefore does not prohibit use of legitimate actuarial considerations to justify differential treatment of individuals with disabilities in insurance58 thus if an insurer uses legitimate actuarial considerations regarding providing insurance to an individual with genetic condition it is unlikely that there would be violation of the ada executive order on february 9 2000 president clinton signed executive order 13145 prohibiting genetic
