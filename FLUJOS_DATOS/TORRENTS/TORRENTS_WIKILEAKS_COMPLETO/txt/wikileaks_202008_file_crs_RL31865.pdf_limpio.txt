liheap established in 1981 pl 9735 is block grant prog ram under which the federal government makes annual grants to states tribes and rritories to operate home energy assistance programs for lowincome households the liheap statute authorizes two types of funds regular funds which are allocated to all states using st atutory formula and contingency funds which are allocated to one or more states at the discretion of the administration the formula by which regu lar funds are distributed was changed by congress in 1984 and is some times referred to as the new liheap formula the implementation of the new formula eff ectively depends on the level of funds appropriated by congress as result if appropriati ons for regular funds do not exceed certain level about 2 billion funds are distributed according to the proportion of funds that each state receive d in fy1984 this is sometimes referred to as the old liheap formula states may use liheap funds to help households pay for heating and cooling costs for crisis assistance weatherization assistance and services such as counseling to reduce the need for energy assistance according to the most recent data available from hhs for fy2005 the majority of liheap funds 552 was used to pay for heating assistance 28 of funds was used for cooling aid 176 of funds went to crisis assistan ce and 106 was used for weatherization the liheap statute establishes eligibility for households with incomes at or below 150 of poverty or 60 of state median in come whichever is higher although states may set lower limits in fy2005 an estima ted 348 million households were eligible for liheap under the federal guidelines according to hhs 53 million households received heating or winter crisis ssistance and approx imately 400000 households received cooling or summer crisis assistance that same year on september 27 2008 congress passed continuing resolution for fy2009 the consolidated security disaster assi stance and continuing

appropriations law further specified the way in which these regular funds were to be distributed approximately 840 million was to be distributed according to the new liheap formula the new formula was enacted in 1984 and allocates funds to states on the basi s of the heating and cooling costs of lowincome households fo r more information about the liheap formula see the section of this report entitled funds and their distribution the remaining 367 billion was to be distributed according to the proportion of funds that states received under the old liheap formula which existed prior to the enactment of the new formula in 1984 approximately 590 million of the total 51 billion appropriation was allocated to contingency funds the same amount that congress appropriated in fy2008 the fy2009 continuing appropriations act further specified th at states could use these fy2009 funds to serve households w ith incomes at or below 75 of state median income at their discretion2 ordinarily states may set eligibility for liheap assistance at the greater of 60 of st ate median income or 150 of poverty3 pl 110329 also required hhs to obligate all fy2009 liheap funds including the contingency funds within 30 days of enactment of the law on october 16 2008 hhs released tables showing how both liheap regular and contingency funds would be distributed to the states tribes and territories in addition hhs announced that it would distribute fy2009 leveraging incentiv and residential energy assistance challenge reach gr ants on the basis of fy2008 applications submitted by states and tribes in fy 2008 congress did not authorize funds for leveraging incentive and reach grants in the appropriations law as result awards were made to grantees for more information about this issue see the next section of this report fy2008 liheap funding to see how fy2009 liheap funds were allocated to the states see table 3 at the end of this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31865crs3 4 pl 110161

section 528 after application of the rescission 198 billion is available for regular funds and 590 million for contingency funds prior to application of the rescission the stated appropriations levels in pl 110161 are 2015 billion for liheap regular funds and 596 million to contingency funds of the amount appropriated for contingency funds 250 million is designated as emergency spending the rescission does not apply to the 250 million in emergency fundsfy2008 liheap funding consolidated appropriations act pl 110161 on december 26 2007 the president signed the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl 110 161 the funding bill provided total of approximately 257 billion for liheap see division g of pl 110161 of this amount 198 billion was for regular funds the same amount ppropriated in fy2007 590 m illion was allocated for contingency funds4 the regular fund appropriation exceeded the presidents fy2008 budget request of 15 billion by 480 million and his contingency fund request of 282 million by approxima tely 308 million the regular fund appropriation in pl 110161 was the same amount that was requested in the conference agreement for the fy2008 departments of labor health and human services and education appropriations bill hr 3043 hrept 110424 which was vetoed by the president on nove mber 13 2007 for contingency funds however the consolidated appropria tions act provided 158 million more than would have been provided in the house and senate conference agreement which would have appropria ted just under 432 million the h ousepassed version of hr 3043 contained 682 million for contingency funds while the senates substitute version of hr 3043 would have provide d the same level ppropriated in fy2007 181 million on june 26 2 008 hhs announced that it would distribute funds that were thought to have been allocated to leveraging incentive and reach grants in the fy2008 appropriations act as part of the regular fund formula grants since the early 1990s leveraging incentive and reach gr ants have been made to states and tribes according to their ability to obtain nonliheap resources for energy assistance leveraging incentive grants and for increas ing the energy efficiency of lowincome households reach grants these funds are di scussed later in this report in recent years congress has allocated around 27 milli on for these two funds an amount that is taken out of the liheap regular f und appropriation however in fy2008 pl 110161 did not appropriate funds for leveraging incentive and reach grants when hhs discovered that language to ppropriate the funds was missing from the appropriations act it released to the st ates the 267 million that would otherwise have been distributed as leveraging incentive and reach grants under the liheap formula additional liheap funding legislation some members of the senate attempted to add funds to the fy2008 li heap appropriation on three occasions in fy2008 the first attempt was part of the economic stimulus package hr 5140 which was considered by th senate in early february 2008 however the liheaphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31865crs4 provisions were ultimately re moved from hr 5140 prior to the bills passage by the senate an early nate version of hr 5140 which wa s eventually signed into law on february 13 2008 as the economic s timulus act of 2008 pl 110185 contained an additional 1 billion for liheap the funds would have been divided evenly between regular and contingency fund s this would have brought the total regular fund allocation for fy2008 to 248 b illion and contingency funds to over 1 billion the liheap provisions would have required the contingency funds to be distributed within 30 days of the laws enactment and to be distributed according to the old liheap formula see discussion of the liheap formula later in this report the second attempt to provide funds for liheap was pa rt of the fy2008 supplemental appropriations act hr 2642 in th senate appropriations committee markup an amendment was adopted that would have provided 1 billion for liheap with 500 million allocated as formula f unds and 500 million as contingency funds as with the provisi on in the economic stimulus package the amendment directed that the contingenc funds be distributed according to the old liheap formula however prior to nate passage of the bill the language directing how the contingency funds should be distributed was removed as passed by the senate on may 22 20 08 hr 2642 would have appropriated 1 billion for liheap without specifying if or how th funds would be divided however the house removed the funds for liheap from its version of hr 2642 prior to approving the bill on june 19 2008 the third attempt to appropr iate additional funds for liheap was made through s 3186 the warm in winter and cool in summer act the bill introduced on june 24 2008 proposed to add more than 25 billi on to the amounts already appropriated for liheap in fy2008 under s 3186 funding would have been divided evenly between liheap regular funds and tingency funds with 1265 billion going to each the bill bypassed committee consideration and went directly to the senate floor for cloture vote on july 26 2008 the cloture vote on s 3 186 failed however so the senate did not consider the billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31865crs5 table 1 final fy2006fy2009 liheap

the old liheap formula for discussion of the formula see the section funds and their distribution later in this reportof funds that states received under the old liheap formula5 and 100 million would be released to seven states where at least 30 of low income households use heating oil to heat their homes the seven stat received funds according to the proportion of funds they received under the old liheap formula weighted by their share of low income heating oil users these seven recipient states were alaska connecticut maine massachusetts new hampshire rhode island and vermont for the amount of contingency funds received by each state in fy2009 see table 3 at the end of this report fy2008 contingency funds congress appropriated just over 590 million in liheap contingency funds for fy2008 to be released at the discretion of hhs to states according to their energy needs the administration has distributed contingency funds on three occasions in fy2008 for the total amount of funds distributed to each state in fy2008 see table 3 first on ja nuary 16 2008 the administration announced the release of 450 million to all states tribes and territories the total amount was distributed in three ways 150 million was distributed to all stat tribes and territories on the basis of the percentage of funds that each receives under the old liheap formula6 50 million was distributed to 11 states where the percentage of low income households that use heating oil is 20 or more the allocations were based on the percen tage of funds each state receives under the old liheap formula weig

training and technical assi stance pl 99425 it also authorized leveraging incentive grants pl 101501 and the reach option pl 103 252 both of which it generally funds out of regular liheap funds these debits on the regular funds account were not in place for fy1984 because they affect the level of regular funds available for state grant allotments by little more than 25 million it is possible but not certain that hhs would not implement the newer formula before regular funds appropriation level of approximately 20028 billionwith minimal consideration of cooling co sts and did not provide for the use of updated data including popula tion and energy costs the new distribution formul provides that in determining state allotments the department of health and human services shall use the most recent satisfactory data available and consider home ener gy costs of lowincome households not simply all households as was previously th case these changes to the calculation of state allotments mean that some states will receive smaller percentage share of regular funds while some will r eceive larger share in order to offset the losses to certain states resulting from the formula change and prevent severe disruption to programs22 congress implemented two hold rmless provisions in pl 98558 to prevent states from losing too much fundi ng this resulted in the threetier current law formula which is descri bed in more detail below tier i the tier i formula is used to allocate funds when the total liheap regular fund ppropriation is less than 1975 billion neither hold harmless provision applies at the tier i level and hhs allocates funds according to the allotment percentages used under the pr e1984 formula the old formula is used because the amount of appropriated funds required to trigger the new formula is 1975 billion the liheap statute stipulat that for fy1986 and succeeding years state shall receive less money than it would have received in fy1984 had the liheap funding in that year been 1975 billion23 according to hhs then the liheap statute requires use of the old allotment percen tages when funding is less than 1975 billion24 until fy20 06 funding vels for liheap only twice exceeded the 1975 billion level in fy1985 and fy1986 thus from fy1987 through fy2005 states continued to receive the sa allotment percen tages they received under the previous liheap formula tier ii for appropriations above 1975 billion and up to 225 b illion the tier ii rate applies and hhs uses the formula enacted in 1984 to calculate state allotments under the tier ii formula
