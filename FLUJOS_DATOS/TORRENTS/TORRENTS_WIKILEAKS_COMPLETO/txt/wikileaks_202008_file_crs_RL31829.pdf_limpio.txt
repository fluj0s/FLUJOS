are based on cbo estimates that include both direct appropriations and the costs of fee changes and unemployment benefits extensionaid the house slightly to 798 billion nd the senate more significantly to 845 billion mainly due to 600 million amendment for additional food aid for iraq for homeland security the house measure was slightly below the presidents request mainly because of the denial of funding for the white houses proposed emergency fund while the senate increased homel and security by about 770 million to 514 billion hr 1559 provided 32 billion for airline industry relief while s 762 included an estimated 35 billion2 as requested the conference versi on of the bill provi des 6258 b illion for defense but as recommended by appropriators in both houses the enacted legislation reduces the flexibility in using those funds that was requested by the administration as passed hr 1559 appropria tes most of the funds to regular appropriations accounts however it also sets up new 157 billion iraq freedom fund to give dod additional flexibility within the ne w fund established for iraqi relief and reconstruction the conference bill appropriates f unds to the president giving him the flexibility to allocate those funds to various agencies including the department of defense in response to administr ation concerns the conference version eliminated restrictions that would have prevented dod from administering any of these funds the enacted appropriation how ever provides that the funds are to be designated as bilateral economic assistance and spent consistent with the foreign assistance act of 19613 for homeland security the confer ence version provi des 512 b illion 749 million more than requested for airline relief the final bill provides for 31 billion package including direct appropr iations authority to extend by 26 weeks unemployment compensation for displaced workers and temporary suspension of certain passenger and air carrier secur ity fees from june 1 to september 30 20034 while details of each of these compone nts are discussed below one overriding theme that was apparent throughout the supplementa l package was the presidents desire for the maximum degree of flexibility in managing and allocating these resources under the proposal most of the funds would be have been placed in emergency response funds which the presiden t the secretaries of defense justice and homeland security coul d draw upon purposes for which the resources would be used were justified in general terms but extensive discretion would have been allotted to executive officials among the proposed emergency funds were defense emergency response fund 599 billion iraq relief and recons truction fund 24 billion department of homeland

million legislative branch emergency response fund 125 million administration officials argued that such flexibility was needed due to constantly changing circumstances in and around iraq and uncertainty over the duration and magnitude of the military campaign the demands posed for nearterm humanitarian relief and longerterm rec onstruction of the country and the ongoing global war on terrorism in the enacted legislation reflecting both house and senate action funds are generally directed for more specific pur poses than proposed by the white house the iraqi relief and reconstruction fund is the exception where congress gives the president flexibility to allocate funds to five federal agencies including the department of defense previous vers ions of the supplemental appropriation as passed by the house and the senate would have limited the presidents ability to apportion the funds directly to dod and re quired that fund be managed by the state department and the us agency fo r international development usaid for defense the conference version allocates much of the 599 billion requested by the department of defense in the defense emergency response fund to regular appropriations accounts reserving 157 billion in new iraq freedom response fund to be allocated by the presid ent subject to various ceilings and floors set in the bill hr 1559 substitutes the presidents re quest for two depar tment of homeland security funds totaling 35 billion with speci fic allocations for port security state and local government law enforcemen t and national gu ard reimbursements checked baggage explosive detection syst ems at airports among others the conference report also allocates most of these funds to specific accounts the enacted supplemental also distributes nearly all of the 500 million proposed justice department counterte rrorism fund among several activities allocating portion for fema disaster re lief hr 1559 further

congressman nadler amendment to increase port security funds by 15 billion ruled out of order the senate also rejected an amendment by senators byrd and hollings that would not have increased homeland security spe nding but would have allocated resources to specific accounts rather th an leaving the secretary of homeland security with broad discretion the administration generally supported actions by the house and senate but raised objections in few areas largely related to executive flexibility matters the white house suggested that senate langua ge allocating defense funds to specific accounts might slow timely and effecting funding of urgent needs the administration raised the same concern regarding house text that allocated homeland security resources to specific activities rather than placing the money in central fund this the white house claimed w ould hinder the ho meland departments secretary from applying the funds to the mo st critical threats the executive further expressed concerns about the house bill which directed that iraq relief and reconstruction fund resources be managed by the state department and the us agency for international development usaid

appropriate d 75 of the funding in the supplemental to specific accounts and added various re porting requirements to give dod flexibility to deve lop and exploit cooperative military relationships with other nations in the global war on terrorism the defense department requested 14 b illion for military and logistical s upport to pakistan jordan and other key cooperating nati ons in the war on terrorism 150 million to support indigenous or irregular foreign military forces and 50 million to support the regular forces of foreign nations working with the united states in the global war on

of the secretary of fense and combatant commanders for unanticipated military re quirements including support for foreign military forces dod again cited the war in iraq and the global war on terrorism as the rationale for these changes the reque st also proposed major increase from 2 billion to about 9 billion in the total amount of funding that dod could transfer between appropriations after notif ying the appropriations committees12 the enacted version raises the statutory limits and give s dod additional transfer authority but at levels lower than requested in remarks at the pentagon president bush characterized the fy2003 supplemental as urgent and dod officials called for quick passage to ensure that dod does not face shortages in operating expenses dod characterized 303 billion of its 626 billion request as costs in curred for the buildup phase of the iraqi war including expenses such as transpor tation of equipment and personnel or as committed costs such as those for the re turn of troops and equipment theater of operations13 in the enacted version of the suppl emental congress appropriated these costs in regular appropriati ons accounts rather than providing them in the defense emergency response fund as requested by dod issues in the dod request the major issues that arose during congressional consideration of the supplemental and that are

to fund foreign militari in the global war on terrorism increases another area of controversy was dods request for additional flexibility in reimbursing foreign military forces who cooperate with the us in combating terrorism the conference ve rsion of the fy2003 supplemental gives dod some but not all of the flexibility requested coalition support although congress allows dod to spend up to the

truction is currently unclear in addition to the amounts requested for the new account the administration requested 24 billion for iraq relief and reconstruction fund with the president having discretion about who would manage these funds see section reconstruction efforts below from administration ac tions it appears that dod may play major role in managing these funds established by the president in janua ry 2003 as the nerve center of us postwar activities the new office of reconstruction and humanitarian assistance was placed within the department of defe nse and is headed by lt

request totale d little less than half of the 162 billion appropriated previously by congress for fy 2003 foreign operations activities the proposal as detailed below in table 5 was roughly divided into two components iraq relief and reconstruction about 285 billion56 and aid to coalition partners and other nations engaged in the war on terrorism about 47 billion reconstruction efforts under the administrations plan the bul k of iraqi reconstruction funds would be deposited in special iraq relief and reconstruction fund which would be managed by the white house out of this 244 billion fund resources would be drawn and transferred to implementing agencies to pay the costs of immediate humanitarian relief and reconstruction activities over 12month period following the end of hostilities normally it would be presumed that transfers for rec onstruction and post conflict aid would be made to usaid the state depa rtment and other traditional foreign assistance management agencies but with plans for the defense department to oversee the governing of iraq immediately after the end of hostilities the white house wanted to have maximum flexibility over the distribution of resources so the president could transfer some or all of the funding to dod the proposal stimulated immediate controversy with number of critics including members of congress arguing that aid programs should remain under the policy direction of the state department and under the aut horities of broad and longst anding body of foreign aid laws they pointed out that during othe r recent reconstruction initiatives in bosnia and kosovo resources and policy decisions flowed through the secretary of state others argued that groups which would play significant role in postwar rehabilitation efforts nong

economic and institutiona l capacity this second phase would target the restoration of roads sc hools hospitals markets irrigation systems and electrical generation together with the construction of framework within which to operate education economic agricu lture and good governance institutions apart from the relief and reconstruction fund the administration also sought 200 million to replenish refugee disaster and other economic aid accounts that had already financed the costs of food and ot her commodities portion of these funds would also bolster the size of humanitari an accounts so that future borrowings from other aid sources to meet the needs in iraq would be minimized the state department and usaid furthe r requested appropriations to establish safe and secure temporary facilities

further directed to usaid the report accompanying s 762 specifically noted that the funds were not expected to be transferred to the secretary of defense nevertheless the white house continued to argue for greater flexibility and authority to place reconstruction resources under dod auspices and u ltimately conference committee members agreed the enacted legislation however specifies that the iraq fund will fall under the authorities of the foreign assistance act of 1961 and that congress will be notified five days in advance of any ob ligation of amounts from the fund further these

prohibits loan resources from supporting any activity in geographic areas that were not administered by israel prior to june 5 1967 this is similar to condition attached to the 1992 10 billion loan

included 50 million for the palestinians 25 million for djibouti and 200 million for the middle east partnership initiative the administration chose to fully allocate amounts for the palestinians and djibouti but cut resources for the middle east partnership initiative including muslim outreach to 100 million half of the level requested the state department also chose to modify its distribution of military aid grants to several central europe states most significantly the executive branch decided to add funds not requested for albani macedonia and ukraine and increase amounts above the requested levels for estoni latvia lithuania and bulgaria as offsets the state department cut funds for hungary and eliminated the 5 million request for slovenia see footnote i in table 6 above for sp ecific amounts allocated to each recipient key issues regarding iraq reconstruction and international assistance the proposed supplemental raised numbe r of issues and concerns including those focusing on the extent of executive flexibility sought by the president how much more iraq reconstruction might co st and whether these demands would erode funding for other foreign aid priorities whether the purposes and amounts of country assistance were appropriate and whether dods request for authority and funds to aid indigenous forces was consistent with traditional us military assistance programs managed by the state department executive flexibility and congressional oversight throughout the supplemental request in both the defense and iraq reconstruc tioninternational assistance sections the president sought authorities that would maximize flexibility in responding to fluid and rapidly changi ng demands among the most significant authorities affecting the use of foreign aid funds were iraq relief and reconstruction fund the administrations budget justification for the white house managed 244 billion fund offered only broad purposes for whic h the money would be used and divided the money into three genera l categories iraq reconstruction plans submitted by the state department to congress offered some details on specific sectors how the us would respond and the timing of actions over the next year funding amounts for each activity however were not provi ded as is usually the case with foreign aid justifications mo reover since the funds would be appropriated into presidential fund it would be possible for the white house delegate the resources to any agency including the defense department for reconstr uction implementation as noted above this prospect of dod manageme nt raised disputes within the administration and the american international ngo community with critics arguing that it would be inappropriate for the military to control civilian operation the pr oposal to establish central fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31829crs44 58 section 610 of the foreign assistance act of 1961most closely resembled how the administration programmed us relief for victims of hurricane mitc h in central america in 1999 and bosnia reconstruction efforts in 1996 in both cases congress appropriated money into special funds but placed them under the control of usaid and added numer ous directives over how portions of resources should be used and va rious notifications for informing congress in advance of committing the money moreover the supplemental request for the relie f and reconstruction fund would make the appropriations available notwithstanding any provision of law this would remove any of the numerous restrictions and conditions that generally apply to us foreign assistance including provisions relating to human ri ghts proliferation government legitimacy contract negotiations among others waivers of these restrictions are generally applie d only to humanitarian programs congress rejected similar request last year for supplemental economic and military aid to the frontline states in the war on terrorism us emergency fund for complex crises for many years administrations have asked congress for various types of contingency resources that can be drawn upon immediately to address unanticipated foreign policy emergencies except in the case of humanitarian situations however congress has been reluctant to support such requests st ating that the president has other mechanisms and special authorities for temporarily borrowing funds from other aid accounts over wh ich congress can more closely maintain scrutiny and consult in advance as the purposes of the transfers the presidents 100 million fy2004 request to create the crises fund had already raised concerns among some members during hearings on next years budget request transfer of funds among diffe rent accounts the supplemental proposed that up to 200 million of in ternational assistance state department money and the iraq relief and reconstruction fund could be transferred between the accounts for any purpose longstanding foreign aid laws place percentage caps on the amount that can be taken from most accounts 10 and how much the receiving account can increase 2058 annual foreign operations appropriations further require the president to consult and justify the transfer in advance with h ouse and senate appropriations committees in some circumstances the administrations supplemental proposal could ve resulted in transfers ex ceeding the percentage caps the request further did not require any congressional notifica tion or consultation as noted above the acted supplemental establishes the relief and reconstruction fund proposed by the president but with added oversighthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31829crs45 59 for more discussion of th issues see crs report rl31814 humanitarian issues in postwar iraq

reconstruction assistancemechanisms put in place while the pres ident may apportion resources directly to dod as well as the departments of state treasury health and human resources and usaid the iraq fund falls under the aut hority of existing foreign aid laws hr 1559 also adds several repor ting requirements as men tioned above and requires notification 5 days in advance of any f und obligations the enacted supplemental further deletes appropr iations for the presidents emergency fund for foreign crises and limits to 100 million the amount that can be transferred among the various aid accounts costs of iraq reconstruction and the impact on other aid programs like the costs of military operations it is nearly impossible to estimate what the longerterm expenses of humanitari an relief and reconstruction in iraq will be the administrations 35 billion included in the supplemental request represented general projection of need s over the next 12 months but state department activity justifications cautioned that the timetable was tentative dependent largely on the extent of dama ge that resulted from the conflict and how future assessments might alter aid priorities some believed that reconstruction needs beyond this initial allotment would be met largely throug h proceeds from the sale of iraqi oil and the release of frozen assets the international aid community is currently discussing how pos tconflict relief effo rts will proceed but there is great deal of uncertainty over the administrations intentions and the actual final outcome how soon and in what amounts iraq might gain access to borrowing from the international financial institutions will also be factor in how much additional resources will be needed or expected from the united states59 in the meantime usaid and the state department have been drawing resources for iraq from emergency refugee and di saster relief accounts and from other economic aid programs that had been inte nded for other countries and purposes as of march 25 usaid had utilized an estimated 506 million including drawdowns from the child survival and health csh development assistance da and economic support fund esf accounts for child survival and development programs amounts diverted to iraq contin gency activities repres ented nearly 8 of fy2003 appropriations the supplementa l request included about 410 million for either replenishing chh da and esf acc ounts or increasing disaster and refugee resources so that future borrowings mig ht be avoided and adequate funds would be available for contingencies that might arise later in the year in other regions but the supplemental did not appear to fully c over usaid transfers already made for iraq programs moreover the supplemental provided up to 200 million may be used out of the relief and recons truction fund to repay these accounts this discretionary language left the final decision up to th white house as to whether these funds would be available for the purposes and pr ograms for which they were originally intendedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31829crs46 the conference agreement on hr 1559 adds substantial amounts as noted above for replenishing foreign aid account s from which money has been drawn for iraq operations the enacted supplemental provides over 900 million to restore funds for several programs including th addition of 369 million in food assistance that had not been requested country assistance the administration asked not only for funds to assist coalition partners and nations that face significant economic and political risks due to the iraq conflict but also to augm ent support for broader set of countries cooperating in the global war on terrorism some questioned whether supplemental appropriation intended to provide resources specifically related to the iraq situation should include nearly 700 million for this latter group especially since congress approved in midfebruary fy2003 money for this purpose pl 1087 among the countries covered by the request but whic h are outside the conflict in iraq were afghanistan the administration proposed 325 million to meet immediate shortfalls in afghan istans fy2003 program including resources for the kabulkandahrh erat road budget support for the afghan government president karzais protective detail demining and military training and equi pment costs although the administration did not submit an official fy2003 afghan aid request congress increased assistance to over 300 million pakistan the supplemental proposed an additional 175 million in military aid to strengthen pakistans ability to track and disable terrorists operating in its own territory and 25 million for better border security colombia included in the s upplemental request was 71 million in military and counternarco tics assistance for supporting colombias unified campaign agai nst drug cartels and terrorists the proposal also included an additional 34 million of dod funds for narcotics interdiction opera tions in the fy2003 foreign operations appropriation cong ress approved 700 million for the andean counternarcotics initia tive for colombia and other countries in the region 31 million less than the president had requested palestinians the request would extend 50 million to support middle east peace objectives generally and specifically for humanitarian activities in the west bank and gaza and for palestinian civil reforms congress had appropriated in august 2002 similar 50 million package together with 200 million for israel in the fy2002 supplemental appropr iation president bush chose not to spend the funds because they were part of much larger appropriation for programs he had not requested instead he amended the fy2003 foreign opera tions request to include the palestinian and israeli funds but congress did not increase overall appropriations to accomm odate these additionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31829crs47 philippines the 30 million in military support would allow the philippines to upgrade its counter terrorism capabilities like the palestinian funds above cong ress provided 30 million for the philippines in the fy2002 supplemental which the president chose not to spend slovenia not member of th coalition slovenia would receive 5 million in military assistance in recognition of its efforts in providing access and overflight ri ghts in operating enduring freedom and contributing to the afghan national army and demining program beyond this list some questioned the administrations 1 billion request for turkey that could be converted into as much as 85 billion in loans the united states had negotiated with the turkish g overnment for months over allowing the deployment of us forces in turkey for military operations for sec ond front in norther iraq reportedly the united states offered 6 billion aid package that could be leveraged into 26 billion in comb ined grants and loans on march 1 however the turkish parliament rejected the us request to base troops for operations in iraq and the united states wit hdrew the aid offer turkeys government has subsequently granted us overflight rights for the iraq campaign the administration justifies the 1 billion request on the basis of turkeys role as an ally and frontline state in the war on terrorism and for the significant political and economic risks faced by ankara due to the iraq conflict as noted above the enacted supplementa l for the most part supports the presidents foreign aid allocations for re quested countries conditions are added to funds for turkey but amendments to elimin ate or reduce the 1 billion package failed in the house hr 1559 as approved how ever will require the administration to make some economic aid reduc tions for some countries nd programs not earmarked possibly including those for the palestinia ns djibouti turkey or the middle east partnership initiative dod authorities to provide military aid under sections relating to defense department funds nd authorities the supplemental proposed two items that drew particular congressiona l attention the key issue was whether they infringed on congressional oversight and the state depa rtments traditional role in directing foreign aid policy and res ource allocations they we re both similar to proposals made last year in the fy2002 supplemental that focused on the war on terrorism and were closely scrutinized by congress the first would provide 14 billi on for the defense department notwithstanding any provision of law to pay jordan pakist an and other nations that have provided logis tical and militaryrelated suppor t to us military operations in iraq or in the global war on terrorism in the past defense officials argue competing demands on regular military aid resources have delayed reimbursement to key friends that provide services to american forces congress

terrorism decisions to draw on these funds would be made by the secretary of defense with the concurrence of the secretary of state the defense department defines indigenous forces as irregu lar forces and resistance movements and notes that such forces generally conduct military and paramilitary operations in enemyheld or hostile terr itory and conduct direct offensive low intensity cover or clandestine operations60 although it was unclear from the budget justification and bill text exactly what groups and under what scenarios the administration would utilize these resources senior administration official suggested that the intent was to have res ources available for groups in iraq deputy secretary richard armitage stified on march 27 that becau of the uncertainty of the wars duration it might be necessary to transfer additional arms and equipment for kurdish and other forces and that the 150 million would provide hedge in case of more prolonged conflict61 in last years supplem ental appropria tion debate dod had asked for 30 million to support indigenous forces funds that would be exclusively under the control of the secret ary of defense congress rejected the

that the administration has the necessary authorities under existing foreign aid laws to undertake the requested activities62 hr 1559 as enacted pr ovides the 14 billi on for nations supporting us
