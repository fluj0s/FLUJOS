the 107th congress policy developments 20012002 summary in the wake of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks against the united states us and peoples republic of china prc foreign policy calculations appeared to change the administration of george w bush assumed office in january 2001 viewing china as us strategic competitor administration officials faced an early test in april 2001 when chinese naval aviation jet collided with us navy reconnaissance plane over the south china sea after september 11 though us officials came to see beijing as potential ally in the fight against global terrorism while prc officials saw the antiterrorism campaign as chance to improve relations with washington and perhaps gain policy concessions on issues important to beijing such as on us arms sales to taiwan us antiterror priorities led some to suggest that cooperation against terrorism could serve as new strategic framework for sinous relations many however saw complexities and pitfalls on this road to cooperation for one thing the prcs definitions of what constitutes terrorism are significantly more expansive than those of the united states and include any political expression of independence both violently and peacefully expressed by tibetans uighur muslims taiwanese and others since the united states maintained that the anti terror campaign must not be used to persecute these groups sinous cooperation already faced early limits also us dominance of the antiterrorism effort made washington suddenly appear to be more threatening competitor for influence in central asia where beijing had been making successful political inroads in recent years and in pakistan with which beijing has had traditionally close relations moreover although the antiterror campaign appeared likely to overshadow more traditional uschina bilateral problems it seemed unlikely to eliminate them sensitivities remained over longstanding issues such as chinas abusive record on human rights issues and on accusations that it routinely violates its nonproliferation commitments increasing the possibility that weapons of mass destruction can fall into the hands of terrorists the prc remained suspicious about the accidental nato bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade in 1999 concerned about what they see as an encircling us presence in asia and wary of us technological advantages and global influence taiwan remained the most sensitive and potentially explosive issue in sinous relations with us officials increasingly supportive of taiwans security and its quest for international space and prc officials adamant about reunifying taiwan under the one china policy the 107th congress was legislatively active on issues involving china enacting pl 10710 authorizing the president to seek observer status for taiwan in the world health assembly and enacting pl 107228 the foreign relations authorization act containing provisions on china taiwan and tibet among others the purpose of

1989 us relations with the peoples republic of china prc have followed an uneven course with modest improvements overshadowed by various recurring difficulties and setbacks longstanding bilateral difficulties have included us problems with the prcs worsening human rights record growing tensions over the prcs southern military buildup opposite taiwan and taiwans political status and continued controversy over allegations of chinese proliferation of weapons to unstable regimes punctuating these have been periodic crises including the prcs provocative livefire missile exercises in the taiwan strait in 199596 allegations of chinese espionage and leaking of us military secrets in 19971998 the accidental nato bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade in may 1999 and the collision of prc jet fighter with us navy reconnaissance plane over the south china sea in 2001 all these problems have occurred against steady drumbeat of growing mutual suspicion over the perceived security threat that each poses to the other the george h w bush administration spent its four years from 1989 1992 trying to protect uschina relations and field policy of engagement with china against mounting congressional opposition in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square crackdown the clinton administration initially adopted markedly different position stating that the united states should use its economic leverage to promote democracy and change in the prc but like his predecessor president clinton also came to favor policy of engagement with china policy that clinton officials came to call strategic partnership the overall engagement policies that both the bush and clinton administrations pursued continued to be criticized by segment of american observers including members of congress who increasingly came to see the prc as americas principal longterm security threat upon assuming office in january 2001 the george w bush administration promised tougher approach than that of either of his predecessors describing the prc as strategic competitor of the united states bush administration officials indicated they would broaden the focus of american policy in asia concentrating more on japan and other us allies and deemphasizing sinous relations the administration faced an early test of its policy on april 1 2001 when chinese jet fighter collided with us navy ep3 reconnaissance plane over the south china sea forcing the us plane to make an emergency landing at military base on chinas hainan island in tense standoff the prc held the 24member us crew for eleven days and required the us military to dismantle the ep3 and ship it back to the united states rather than repair it and fly it back crs2 the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks against the united states appeared to affect the policy calculus for both washington and beijing the bush administration appeared to see the potential for sinous cooperation against global terrorism as priority and us officials downplayed other key differences and problems in the relationship evident during much of 2001 us officials sought prc antiterrorism support with countries in the region and in initiatives put before the united nations security council where the prc is permanent member but bush administration officials also suggested that only limited cooperation would be possible and in the intervening months since september 11 the president and others in his administration continued with policy approach that appeared tougher toward the prc and less solicitous of beijings views in response to these tougher bush administration initiatives beijing took what many view as surprisingly low profile although prc leaders were thought to be wary of the precedents being set by newly assertive us policy toward taiwan and an expanded us presence in central and south asia their statements on these and other us initiatives remained muted in fact some suggest that prc leaders appeared anxious to assure smooth sinous relations in 20012002 going out of their way to be nonprovocative despite greater us assertiveness it may be that this lowprofile prc approach was the result of an ongoing leadership transition with which beijing was and remains preoccupied1 from november 8 14 2002 for instance the communist party held its 16th party congress during which it selected hu jintao as the new party secretary named new 24member politburo and new ninemember standing committee and made substantive changes to the party constitution some observers have suggested that beijings views toward us policies may undergo some change once the leadership transition is completed later in 2003 key events in bilateral relations us reconnaissance planeprc fighter collision uschina relations faced an early crisis during the george w bush administration on april 1 2001 when us navy ep3 reconnaissance plane and chinese f8 jet fighter collided in the air over the south china sea the chinese fighter was reported to have crashed and the damaged us plane accompanied by the second chinese fighter made an emergency landing at military base on chinas hainan island us officials claimed that standard military procedure calls for the planes crew to destroy sensitive information and technologies prior to landing in such instances but it is unclear to what extent the crew was able to do this the chinese military proceeded to hold the 24 us crew members for 11 days and the plane for longer period as both sides disputed the facts questions of international law and each others obligations 1 for more on the 16th party congress decisions see crs report rl31661 chinas new leadership lineup implications for us policy by kerry dumbaugh crs3 us officials stated that the ep3 was conducting routine solo reconnaissance mission approximately 5060 miles off the chinese coast when it was intercepted and followed by two f8 chinese jet fighters us military officials say that such reconnaissance missions have been routine for decades including interception by chinese fighters but that chinas interceptions had grown increasingly aggressive in 2001 resulting in us diplomatic protests according to the us account in this particular case one of the chinese fighters swooped under the us plane and then collided with it perhaps as the slowermoving us plane was banking to turn us officials contend that in such emergency situations international law allows for the plane to remain inviolate sovereign territory of the owner country the united states asked the chinese to respect the integrity of the plane and demanded its return as well as the safe and immediate return of the crew while apparently agreeing that the us plane was approximately 50 miles off the chinese coast chinese officials claimed that the us plane had violated chinas airspace and caused the accident that resulted in the crash of the f8 chinese fighter they claimed that the plane landed at the chinese military base without permission and they rejected the us assertion that the plane could not be boarded under international law several days after the incident the chinese military permitted us officials to begin sporadic meetings with the planes crew members going into the weekend of april 78 2001 bush administration officials expressed cautious optimism that crew members would be released within few days but the chinese media and highranking chinese officials began insisting on us apology and implying that this was prerequisite for any further discussions about the fate of the crew and plane us officials insisted that apology was warranted because the collision was purely an accident and the us plane was operating lawfully in international airspace on april 12 2001 the prc released the 24 american crew members it had been holding since april 1 2001 the crews release came after secretary of state colin powell expressed regret and sorrow over the apparent death of the chinese f8 pilot which caused the collision and after the us ambassador to china retired admiral joseph prueher delivered letter to chinese officials which stated that the us government was very sorry that the us plane entered chinas airspace and made an emergency landing without receiving verbal clearance an account by xinhua an official chinese media outlet continued to adhere to chinas line that the us plane had rammed the chinese jet fighter many observers believed that the heart of the ep3 standoff ultimately concerned the status of the island of taiwan which beijing claims as part of china one important function of us military reconnaissance flights off southern china is presumed to be monitoring the systematic military buildup china has been conducting on its coast opposite taiwan chinese officials have been critical of us policy toward taiwan and vocal in insisting on chinas right to use force against taiwan initially many us observers believed that uschina relations would suffer lasting damage as result of the ep3 crisis perhaps jeopardizing chinas normal trade relations ntr status and its chances of success in its bid to host the 2008 olympic games ultimately however the incident appeared to have lasting affect on the bilateral relationship crs4 september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 against the world trade center the pentagon and the plane that crashed in rural pennsylvania appeared to alter some of the policy calculations for both washington and beijing bush administration officials quickly focused on the antiterrorism campaign as top us priority in light of which other us foreign policy objectives including those associated with sino us relations appeared secondary us officials sought prc support with countries in the region and in initiatives put before the united nations security council where the prc is permanent member and holds veto power beijing for its part appeared to see the us antiterrorism effort as chance to improve sinous relations and demonstrate that china could be responsible global player the initial prospects for mutual support and cooperation were encouraging in message to president bush on september 11 2001 prc president jiang zemin condemned the terrorist attacks and offered condolences according to the white house in phone call with president bush the following day jiang promised to cooperate with the united states to combat terrorism the prc also voted with others in the security council for resolution 1368 2001 which among other things unequivocally condemned the terrorist attacks and expressed its readiness to take all necessary steps to respond to the terrorist attacks on september 20 party secretary jiang zemin declared that the prc offered unconditional support in the antiterrorism campaign and the prcs foreign minister tang jiaxuan reportedly assured president bush late in september that beijing would share intelligence with the united states on september 24 2001 group of counter terrorism experts from the prc arrived for meetings with their counterparts in washington many began to speculate that the us antiterrorism effort could serve as new framework for uschina relations but in other ways the prc sent mixed signals early on about its support for the antiterrorism campaign strong statements of unconditional support were qualified by later expressions of concern about us or nato military action faultfinding with us intelligence information and warnings that civilians should not be targets of allied military action also the prc strongly preferred that global antiterror efforts be conducted through the auspices of the security council where it had voice and not purely through us unilateral effort or coalition of us allies the prc itself has been the target of bombings sabotage and other terrorist attacks primarily thought to be committed by small groups of muslim extremists largely uighurs based in xinjiang in chinas far northwest for years there have been unconfirmed reports that some muslim activists were based in afghanistan receiving training from the taliban reports that appeared to gain more credence late in 2001 when it was revealed that number of uighurs from xinjiang had been captured in afghanistan prc officials also have strong connections to and influence with pakistan which in the past had aided the taliban government and which became key country in usled antiterrorism efforts after september 11th in addition beijing also is an active member in what is now the shanghai cooperative organization sco sixmember consortium involving russia and the muslim countries of uzbekistan tajikistan kazakstan and kyrgyzstan part of the groups stated goal is to curb fundamentalist terrorist activities in the region crs5 but since the september 11 attacks bush administration officials have appeared to be neither seeking nor expecting significant prc support for the anti terror campaign this may be partly for political reasons in the past the united states had warned prc officials that the antiterror campaign should not be used to suppress legitimate political dissent among chinas own muslim populations in as visit to beijing in december 2001 for instance the state departments top counter terrorism expert francis x taylor said that washington did not believe muslim separatists in china who supported an independent east turkestan were part of the global antiterror network but on august 26 2002 us deputy secretary of state richard armitage announced that the united states had added the east turkestan islamic movement etim to its list of terrorist groups some european allies questioned the motivations behind the unexpected us move the washington post for instance quoted one unnamed diplomat as suspicious that the united states was doing the chinese favor as tradeoff for prc support in the security council for the us campaign against iraq2 on august 28 2002 officials at the us embassy in beijing further announced they had evidence that the etim was plotting terrorist bombing of the us embassy in bishkek kyrgyzstan on september 11 2002 the united nations announced that at the request of both the united states and china it was placing the etim on list of terrorist organizations requiring that all members freeze the groups financial assets and ban its members

president bush and with range of other senior us officials on october 25 2002 president jiang zemin made state visit to the united states meeting with president bush at the presidents ranch in crawford texas initially largely symbolic the meeting became vehicle for bilateral consultations on north koreas nuclear weapons program and on chinas support for resolution condemning iraq see crs report rs21351 sino us summit october 2002 human rights in uschina relations since the 1989 tiananmen square crackdown the prcs human rights abuses have been among the most visible and recurrent points of contention in sinous relations and this more or less continued during the 107th congress according to the state department report on human rights released on march 4 2002 the prcs human rights record remained poor in 20014 the government continued to maintain strict controls over religious organizations political discourse and publications law enforcement agencies continued to carry out extrajudicial killings executions after summary trials torture and other cruel punishment and there continued to be lack of adequate medical care arbitrary arrest and detention judicial corruption denial of fair trial and other arbitrary official interferences with individual privacy and liberty the report also cited major flaws and deficiencies in chinas criminal procedure law it stressed that the judiciary is not independent despite constitutional provisions to the contrary and that judicial and police corruption is endemic in china however the report said there were ongoing government efforts to correct systemic weaknesses in the legal and judicial systems that there was growing public debate in china over the inadequacies in the legal system and that an increasing number of citizens were seeking redress through the courts and making use of the new legal remedies available to them but the george w bush administration appeared to shift from the traditionally broad and generalized us approach on human rights in china in favor of more selective intense pressure on individual cases involving human rights and on rule of law in 2002 in particular the prc government periodically succumbed to heavy 3 for full text see httpwwwchinaembassyorgeng33977html 4 in response to the 2002 state department report on march 11 2002 the information office of the prc state council issued white paper human rights record of the united states in 2001 the full text of the prc white paper can be found at httpwwwchinaembassyorgeng26488html crs7 us pressure and released early from prison political dissident usually citing health reasons such releases included the december 2002 release of xu wenli co founder of the china democracy party and the january 2002 release of ngawang choephel tibetan scholar but such gestures were infrequent and overshadowed by other human rights troubles as in previous us congresses members of the 107th congress remained both interested in and active on human rights issues with respect to the prc detention of american chinese scholars late in 2000 the prc ministry for state security began arresting and detaining chinaborn american citizens and permanent residents who were traveling in or visiting china questioning them about their travels and alleging that some were suspected of espionage those who were detained included businessmen scholars writers and journalists one of the more wellpublicized cases involved the detention on february 11 2001 of ms gao zhan researcher at american university and permanent us resident gao was arrested and charged with espionage detained along with her were gaos husband xue donghua and her five yearold andrew us citizen the father and were held 26 days before being released ms gao was convicted of spying on july 24 2001 sentenced to ten years in prison and released two days later on medical parole prior to secretary of state colin powells visit to the prc in another notable case an american citizen professor li shaomin was detained on february 25 2001 and was later arrested tried for and convicted of spying for taiwan he also was released just prior to secretary powells visit5 north korean refugees in march 2002 international attention focused on north korean refugees who had been living clandestinely in china in several wellpublicized cases these refugees had begun rushing into the diplomatic compounds of various foreign governments in china asking for asylum chinese security forces were accused in some cases of forcing their way into foreign diplomatic compounds to remove them on may 8 2002 chinese police entered the compound of the japanese consulate in shenyang to remove two north koreans seeking asylum on june 13 2002 south korean diplomats scuffled with chinese police as they hauled away north korean refugee seeking asylum after standoff of several weeks during which prc officials demanded that the refugees be handed over to chinese security forces beijing reversed its decision on june 23 2002 and allowed 26 north koreans living in various foreign diplomatic compounds to leave the country in the past the prc had largely ignored the large number of north koreans illegally living in china cracking down only periodically but the new activism of 5 representative chris smith and senator robert torricelli introduced resolutions in 2001 hres 160 and sres 128 calling on the prc government to immediately and unconditionally release all detained american scholars of chinese ancestry hres 160 passed the house on june 25 2001 3790 sres 128 passed the senate on july 24 2001 by unanimous consent crs8 the north korean refugee population in 20012002 involved complexities that concerned china number of other governments the united nations and the international community the united states and the governments whose diplomatic offices were involved canada japan and south korea protested the chinese forced intrusions into foreign diplomatic compounds as blatant violations of the vienna convention chinese officials countered that the north koreans were not covered under the vienna convention because they were fleeing economic hardships and not political repression that beijing has had longstanding refugee repatriation agreements with north korea which it must honor and that chinese security officials had permission to enter the foreign government compounds6 although the north korean refugee issue was not high foreign policy priority for the bush white house in 20012002 it did receive action in the 107th congress7 religious freedom membership data on religious organizations in the prc suggested that the number of religious adherents in china continued to grow in 20012002 despite rigorous restrictions on religious practice put into place in 1994 among other things prc restrictions continued to prohibit evangelical activities and required all religious groups to register with the religious affairs bureau rab registration has required religious groups to reveal the names and addresses of members their contacts in china and abroad and details about leadership activities and finances churches and other religious institutions seen conducting public services in large chinese cities have been among these registered and therefore legal groups groups whose members have refused to register with the rab are known as unofficial or house churches during the 107th congress the prc intensified further the campaign against these independent religious groups that it had begun in 1999 when american news accounts began to give wide coverage to reports that the government was arresting religious practitioners and giving them harsh jail sentences on july 22 1999 for instance the government outlawed falun gong spiritual movement in china said to combine buddhist and taoist meditation practices with series of exercises the november 6 1999 peoples daily suggested that falun gong presented the greatest danger to the nation that had ever existed in its 50year history in the intervening years the government continued to arrest falun gong leaders impose harsh prison sentences and close the sects facilities as consequence of falun gong the national peoples congress on october 30 1999 adopted resolution outlawing religious sects and cults in china but without defining what cult or sect was in extraordinary displays of public dissent falun gong practitioners periodically cut into regional cable television networks and broadcast profalun gong programs in 20012002 on september 25 2002 for instance the group hacked into the prcs 6 for further details see crs issue brief ib98045 korea uskorea relations issues for congress by larry niksch 7 in august 2001 representative edward royce introduced hconres 213 expressing the sense of congress in protest to the prcs seizure and repatriation of north korean refugees the measure passed the house on june 11 2002 4090 and was referred to the senate which took action crs9 premier national tv satellite system broadcasting segments of profalun gong materials across the country during the 107th congress beijing also objected to the activities of falun gong in the united states where the group has growing presence and visibility8 few prc officials at times chastised us visitors for what they saw as worrisome us tolerance of the groups activities on american soil saying that the group was danger not only to the prc government but potentially also to the us government partly in response to the falun gong group the prc established central government entity the office for preventing and handling cults although observers believed this measure targeted the falun gong many feared it may come to include christian churches and other more mainstream groups in the future9 prc officials also suppressed religious activities and nationalistic sentiments among ethnic minorities particularly in buddhist tibet and in the xinjianguighur autonomous region heavily muslim amnesty international issued report in april 1999 which accused the prc government of gross violations of human rights in xinjiang including widespread use of torture lengthy prison sentences and executions in august 1999 during the visit of an american congressional staff delegation to xinjiang wealthy well known uighur businesswoman rebiya kadeer was arrested by prc security forces on her way to meeting with delegation member on february 20 2002 84 members of congress signed letter to president bush urging that he seek kadeers release during his official visit after september 11 2001 prc officials sought to link their ongoing crackdown against uighur and other muslim separatists in xinjiang with the global anti terrorism campaign on october 12 2001 prc foreign ministry spokesman said we hope that our fight against the east turkestan xinjiang forces will become part of the international effort against terrorism although us officials warned that the antiterror campaign should not be used to persecute uighur separatists or other minorities with political grievances against beijing some believed that the us government appeared to make concession to beijing on august 26 2002 when it announced that it was placing one small group the east turkestan islamic movement on the us list of terrorist groups10 family planningcoercive abortion bitter controversies in us family planning assistance have surrounded the prcs population programs abortion and the degree to which coercive abortions and sterilizations occur in the prcs family planning programs has been prominent issue in these debates prc officials have routinely denied that coercion is an authorized part of national family planning programs but they have acknowledged 8 falun gongs founder and leader li hongzhi is said to have sought refuge at an undisclosed location in the united states after fleeing from the prc 9 for further details see crs report rs20333 china and falun gong by thomas lum 10 the 107th congress considered number of human rights resolutions relating to the prc for relevant bills see the legislation section of this report crs10 that some provincial and local officials have pursued coercive policies direct us funding for coercive family planning practices is prohibited in provisions of several us laws as is indirect us support for coercive family planning in addition legislation in recent years has expanded these restrictions to include us funding for international and multilateral family planning programs such as the population fund unfpa that have programs in china in the fy2002 foreign operations appropriations bill pl 107115 for instance congress provided for not more than 34 million for unfpa the bush administration froze those funds in january 2002 asserting coercion still existed in chinese counties where unfpa had programs despite followup finding by state department assessment team that unfpa was not supporting coercion in its family planning programs in china on july 22 2002 us secretary of state colin powell announced that the 34 would remain withheld11 labor issues prc prisonsprison labor for years prc prisons have been criticized for their conditions treatment of prisoners and stringent work requirements for members of congress key issue has been the extent to which products made by prisoners are exported to the us market prison labor imports have been violation of us customs law since 1890 under the mckinley tariff act 19 usc section 1307 criminal penalties also apply under 18 usc section 1761 and 1762 although the 107th congress was not active on the subject of prc prison labor imports the uschina security review commission uscc in its july 2002 report to congress recommended that congress improve the enforcement of the prohibition against prison labor imports from the prc12 the uscc recommended that private american companies be required to certify that their imported products are not made by forced labor and further recommended that congress establish corporate code of conduct for us businesses operating in the prc labor unrest economic reforms and more stress on making stateowned enterprises profitable led to rising labor unrest in china during the 107th congress in 2002 laidoff and unemployed workers estimated to number in the tens of thousands demonstrated to protest job losses insufficient severance pay local corruption and local government decisions to shutdown selloff or privatize unprofitable stateowned factories worker unrest is particularly troubling issue for beijing regime founded on communistinspired notions of workers paradise increasing labor unrest also placed greater pressure on the

see crs report rl31164 china labor conditions and unrest crs11 in the late 1990s the prc government had signed two key human rights agreements the covenant on economic social and cultural rights october 27 1997 and the international covenant on civil and political rights march 12 1998 on february 28 2001 the prc government announced that it would ratify the former with qualifications the covenant on economic social and cultural rights which requires signatory countries to ensure their citizens have access to food medical care housing and education also requires countries to guarantee workers the right to strike and form labor unions in ratifying the agreement china appeared to equivocate on the labor provision saying it would deal with such issues in line with relevant provisions of the chinese constitution14 labor unrest and labor conditions in the prc routinely prompt debate in congress over competing policy goals in this debate some members argue that prc workers are exploited under economic reforms and that the united states should seek to limit its economic and financial dealings with the prc until chinese workers gain full collective bargaining rights other members argue that us investments in the prc have helped improve workers lies and incomes and have contributed to greater public pressure for labor and political reforms the congressionalexecutive commission on the peoples republic of china ceec which the 106th congress created to monitor human rights and labor conditions in china issued its first report to the 107th congress in september 200215 among its recommendations on worker rights and conditions the ceec included recommendations that congress expand us assistance to legal clinics in the prc seeking to expand worker rights that the us and prc seek to establish collaborative relationship between government and business to expand worker rights that the us secretary of labor make discussion of labor issue with the prc higher priority and that congress seek to fund programs to improve worker rights and safety at the enterprise level in the prc16 prc olympic bid in july 2001 the international olympic committee elected beijing as the host city of the 2008 olympic games the prcs first successful olympic bid the 107th congress considered but did not vote on nonbinding resolutions saying that the prc should not be allowed to host the 2008 olympics until it had released all political prisoners and taken other steps to improve its human rights record an unsuccessful prc bid in 1993 to host the 2000 olympic games had been blamed on legislation the house passed that year opposing the prcs bid hres 188 14 on april 29 2002 the prc state council information office issued white paper labor and social security in

cautiously agreed to resume military contacts after sinous summit in october 1997 and announced they had agreed on military maritime consultative agreement mmca meant to reduce the chance of accidents or misunderstandings at sea but efforts to reenergize military ties since then have met with repeated setbacks in march 2001 us guided missile cruiser made goodwill port call to shanghai but on april 1 2001 prc f8 fighter collided with us navy ep3 reconnaissance plane over the south china sea resulting in the death of the chinese pilot and the forced emergency landing on hainan island by the american plane in may 2001 statement attributed to defense secretary donald h rumsfeld announced that the united states was suspending military exchange programs with the prc military until further notice hours later however pentagon spokesman said the statement was mistake and that the pentagon would review and approve future uschina military contacts on casebycase basis in june 2002 peter

staff chi haotian chinas defense minister and li zhaoxing vice foreign minister17 us and prc militaryrelated reports 2002 us national intelligence estimate on january 9 2002 the cia issued an unclassified summary of its latest national intelligence estimate nie foreign missile developments and the ballistic missile threat through 2015 according to the unclassified report the prc is expected to up to 100 longrange nuclear missiles many on mobile launchers targeted at the united states by 2015 currently the prc has about 20 fixed silos containing nucleararmed missiles capable of reaching the united states the report asserts that the prc is upgrading its missile forces out of concern that us missile defense system if developed and deployed could effectively neutralize its current nuclear deterrent pentagon 2002 report on chinese military power on july 12 2002 the pentagon released its annual report on the military power of the peoples republic of china mandated by congress in section 1202 of the national defense authorization act for fy2000 pl 10665 among the conclusions in the 52page report were that the pentagon sees new emphasis on military modernization decisions that appear aimed at taiwan that chinese defense spending is significantly higher than the 20 billion that the chinese government lists as its official defense budget and that annual military spending by beijing could increase significantly by 2020 the full text of the pentagons report can be found at the website httpwwwdefenselinkmilnewsjul2002d20020712chinapdf 17 for background and further details see crs report 97931 china ballistic and cruise missiles by shirley kan crs13 chinas national defense 2002 white paper on december 9 2002 the prc published its fourth national security white paper entitled chinas national defense in 200218 in assessing the international situation the white paper states that rapid and drastic changes are taking place in the military field around the world and new serious disequilibrium has occurred in the balance of military power but in number of ways the tone of the new national defense paper is more general and less critical of the united states than its third national security white paper issued in october 2000 for instance while the third national defense paper attributed number of negative global developments specifically to the united states the fourth national defense paper does not keeping its discussion of negative global trends general19 similarly while the taiwanrelated language of the 2000 national defense paper refers specifically to us arms sales to taiwan references to taiwan in the new 2002 national defense paper refer only to arms sales by handful of countries with us mention the 2002 nation defense paper also emphasizes the continuing growth of global economic interdependence20 weapons proliferation even before september 11 key security issue for the united states was the prcs track record of weapons sales technology transfers and nuclear energy assistance particularly to iran and pakistan officials in the clinton administration suggested that china was reassessing its weapons sales policies as reasons they cite that the prc 1992 promised to abide by the missile technology control regime mtcr and acceded to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt 1993 signed the chemical weapons convention cwc 1996 signed the comprehensive test ban treaty and 1997 joined the zangger committee of npt exporters critics in the 107th congress and before however charged that confidence in chinas nonproliferation policies is misplaced they pointed out that for years reputable sources have reported china to be selling ballistic missiles and technology for weapons of mass destruction in the international market primarily in the middle east although these allegations have always created problems in sinous relations the issue became more serious in light of number of developments including nuclear weapons tests conducted by pakistan in may 1998 the prospect that weapons of mass destruction wmd are being developed by iraq and iran with whom the prc has had arms sales relationships and in light of north korean assertions in 2002 that it was developing nuclear weapons of its own possibly with prc assistance some us observers are concerned particularly about the security of possible caches of wmd in pakistan iraq and north korea afraid that they may be 18 see text at httpwwwchinaorgcnewhite20021209indexhtm 19 the third national defense report for instance attributes new negative developments in the security situation in the region to among other things stronger us military presence in the region continued sale of weapons to taiwan and consideration of the taiwan security enhancement act by the 106th congress consideration of theater missile defense tmd development and revision of the usjapan defense cooperation guidelines the only specific us mention in the fourth

associated with osama bin laden and other terrorist groups iran also has purchased prc weapons including small numbers of sa2 surfacetoair missiles f7 combat aircraft fastattack patrol boats and c802 antiship cruise missiles some members of congress have questioned whether irans possession of c802s violates the iraniraq arms nonproliferation act of 1992 usc 1701 which requires sanctions on countries that sell destabilizing weapons to iran or iraq21 north koreas nuclear program on october 4 2002 north korea told visiting us officials that it was conducting clandestine uranium enrichment program to produce nuclear weapons technical violation of its pledges under the 1994 usnorth korean agreed framework in exchange for us energy assistance the north korean announcement precipitated the second nuclearrelated crisis on the korean peninsula in decade one that continued to escalate as the year ended the united states responded by suspending its energy assistance under the agreed framework as north koreas only ally the prc is crucial factor in any international effort to mitigate north korean policies and behavior president bush is widely thought to have sought prc support for addressing the north korean issue at crawford ranch summit meeting with jiang zemin in october 2002 at the end of the summit meeting and on number of occasions since then prc officials have emphasized that china had long supported nonnuclear korean peninsula but beijing stopped short of promising further pressure on the north korean regime the prc has number of competing policy conflicts in terms of north korea that raise especially thorny challenges for leaders in beijing and that make the prc potentially important but uncertain partner in us policy efforts on the korean peninsula prc support for nonnuclear north korea is thought to be genuine since an unpredictable north korean regime armed with nuclear weapons could spur regional nuclear arms race among nonnuclear powers along chinas periphery such as taiwan japan and south korea in addition international response to aggression by desperate nucleararmed north korea could prompt assistance to pyongyang by the prc the only country with mutual defense treaty with north korea the prc therefore has ample cause to seek to curb north korean nuclear aspirations and to contain its difficult ally but collapse of the fragile north korean regime could have equally unhappy consequences for the prc leading to floods of north korean refugees into china and to the possible advance of us military forces from south korea to the southern prc border such scenarios tend to convince prc leaders to continue propping up the north korea regime allegations of espionage in the late 1990s us media sources began reporting on investigations into number of cases of alleged prc espionage against the united states dating back to 21 for background and further details see crs report rl31555 china and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles policy issues by shirley kan crs15 the 1980s the most serious case involved chinas alleged acquisition of significant information about the w88 the most advanced miniaturized us nuclear warhead as result of serious security breaches at the alamos nuclear science lab between 1984 and 1988 prc officials denied the allegations while charges of similar import arose during 20012002 some congressional sources in the 107th congress noted periodically surfacing reports suggesting that officials of the prc had collected and were continuing to collect sensitive technological information from us sources in august 2001 fbi agents arrested an american intelligence analyst at dulles airport later charging him with trying to sell classified documents to china libya and iraq his trial begins in 2003 and if convicted he could face the death penalty in periodic hearings through 20012002 the uscc uschina security review commission also examined what it said were recurring allegations of prc interests in sensitive us technologies in its july 2002 report the uscc recommended to the 107th congress that it require an annual classified assessment of these activities in addition based on recommendations by the uscc the 107th congress enacted language requiring the us department of state to produce biannual report beginning in 2004 which would assess and monitor broad range of uschina science and technology cooperation conducted under the usprc science and technology cooperation agreement of 197922 economic issues the prc is one of the worlds fastest growing economies and trade analysts have agreed that its potential as market will increase significantly in the future issues involving trade with china have factored heavily into past us policy debates between 1991 and 1996 us exports to china increased by 905 while us imports from china surged by 1714 the us trade deficit with china surged accordingly from 178 billion deficit in 1989 to an estimated 1421 billion deficit in 2002 during the 107th congress on september 17 2001 member nations of the world trade organization wto voted to accept the prc for membership the prc formally joined the wto on december 11 2001 its wto membership commitments require the prc to make significant changes in its trade and tariff regimes by eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers on many goods and services with the prc as new wto member members of the 107th congress were especially interested in assuring that the prc adhered to its wto obligations in legislation passed by the 106th congress the us trade representative ustr was required to begin monitoring the prcs compliance with its wto obligations and to issue an annual report to congress offering that assessment the 107th congress received the ustrs first such report in december 2002 in which the prc was judged to have made significant progress in many areas with major problems in some 22 section 204 in hr 3338 pl 107117 the department of defense appropriations act for fy2002 crs16 other areas primarily in protection for intellectual property rights and improving the transparency of its trade laws23 chinas trade status ntrmfn during the 107th congress the divisive issue of annually renewing the prcs trade status finally came to an end each year since 1990 congress had faced the contentious decision on whether and under what conditions to renew normal trade relations ntr status with the prc for another year this exercise occurred because under us law chinas ntr status was temporary and the president had to recommend its renewal each year by june 3 although the 106th congress had enacted bill which granted permanent ntr to china and eliminated the annual renewal process permanent ntr would only take effect once china had joined the wto24 since this did not happen until late in 2001 president bush on june 1 2001 was compelled to recommend another temporary extension of chinas ntr status for one year in order for it to continue uninterrupted the 2001 vote on ntr marked the end of an elevenyear congressional battle over the prcs overall trade status synopsis of congressional consideration of the mfnntr issue follows in table 125 chinas fragile banking system in the late 1990s concerns arose about the ultimate prospects for chinas fragile banking and financial systems according to leading authorities on chinas economy official chinese statistics by the end of the 20th century showed that staggering 22 of the total lending of chinese banks was judged to be in non performing loans primarily loans to insolvent state enterprises by comparison in south korea which averted financial collapse during the 1997 asian financial crisis only with record 60 billion international bailout the percentage of nonperforming loans to total bank loans was just over 6 while chinas economic situation in 20012002 had number of mitigating factors primarily high savings rate 42 sizeable inflow of foreign direct investment and insulations against currency speculators many were concerned that financial crisis similar to south koreas in an economy the size of chinas could have significant global impact in addition the banking sectors nonperforming loans made it more difficult during the time frame for china to make the investments in infrastructure energy production and environmental improvements to fuel the rate of economic growth china needs in order to keep pace with its demographic requirements 23 for further details see crs report rs20139 china and the world trade

sovereignty issues taiwan tibet hong kong taiwan taiwan remains the most sensitive and complex issue in sinous relations beijing has not foresworn the use of force should taiwan declare independence from china and chinese officials repeatedly block taiwans efforts to gain greater international recognition at the same time officials in taiwan are maneuvering for more international stature and for independent access to multilateral institutions since the 1970s when the united states broke relations with taiwan in order to normalize relations with beijing us policy toward taiwan has been shaped by the three uschina communiques and the taiwan relations act pl 96826 george w bush administration policy in 20012002 many observers saw the bush administration as having abandoned the longstanding us policy of strategic ambiguity on taiwan in favor of policy clarity that placed more emphasis on taiwans interests and less on prc concerns on april 25 2001 for instance in an abc television interview president bush responded to question about the possible us response if taiwan were attacked by saying that the united states would dowhatever it took to help taiwan defend itself since the united states has defense alliance with taiwan and has never pledged use of american military forces in the islands defense the presidents answer caused considerable controversy over whether the united states had changed its policy toward taiwans security or was moving away from its onechina statements although state department and white house officials including president bush later insisted that there had been change in us policy toward taiwan saying that the presidents april 25 statement was consistent with us commitments in the taiwan relations act subsequent statements and actions by bush administration officials during the 107th congress were judged to be more solicitous and supportive of taiwan than those of previous us administrations policy statements by taiwans president chen like his predecessor before him taiwans sitting president chen shuibian made some controversial statements during the 107th congress which suggested to beijing that taiwan was edging closer to aspirations of independence there are few if any subjects on which prc leaders are more united and vocal than their longheld insistence that taiwan 26 in addition other us statements sometimes have been interpreted as changes in nuance in us policy for example during his summit visit to china in june 1998 president clinton made controversial statement that some interpreted as change in us policy resulting in resolutions in the 105th congress hconres 301 and sconres 107 reaffirming us policy toward taiwan according to white house transcript at the time the president said i had chance to reiterate our taiwan policy which is that we dont support independence for taiwan or two chinas or one taiwanone china and we dont believe that taiwan should be member in any organization for which statehood is requirement so i think we have consistent policy for background information and details see crs issue brief ib98034 taiwan recent developments and us policy choices by kerry dumbaugh and crs report rl30341 chinataiwan evolution of the one china policy by shirley kan crs19 is part of china and not separate country president chens statements then raised the temperature in ustaiwanchina relations and over the longerterm could have global policy implications on july 21 2002 chen said that if beijing continued to reject taiwans overtures for discussions taiwan would not rule out going our own way comment taken as reference to independence on august 3 2002 in televised speech in tokyo to the world association of taiwanese associations chen expanded by describing the situation across the taiwan strait as one side one country and also suggested that he supported national referendum in taiwan on taiwans future possibility that beijing has opposed vigorously critics in beijing said that this violated chens inaugural day pledge made on may 20 2000 not to hold referendum if china did not intend military force against taiwan us visits by taiwan officials in the absence of official us ties with taiwan prc officials argue that highlevel officials of the taiwan government should be received in the united states mindful of prc sensitivities on this issue us officials for years remained unwilling to issue visas to senior taiwan officials for us visits this changed dramatically on may 22 1995 when president clinton bowing to substantial congressional pressure decided to allow taiwan president lee tenghui to make visit to the united states but in his capacity as private citizen not as an official representing taiwan in contrast to previous administrations the george w bush administration has been more accommodating in granting limited visits to senior taiwan officials in 2001 taiwans new president chen shuibian was allowed transit stops in new york city and houston on his way to and from latin america taiwans vicepresident annette lu was accorded similar transit stop in new york in early january 2002 from march 9 12 2002 us officials permitted taiwans defense minister tang yaoming to attend defense conference in florida while here minister tang met with us deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz and us assistant secretary of state james kelly taiwan and the world health organization who for number of years taiwan has sought observer status in unaffiliated organizations primarily the world health organization who as part of its effort to expand its international space and recognition the prc routinely has blocked taiwans bids on political grounds arguing that since taiwan is not state but part of china it cannot be separately admitted to entities for which sovereign status is prerequisite for membership taiwan authorities have argued that it is inhumane for the international community to deny the people of taiwan access to whos substantial medical data and assistance in the event of an outbreak of disease as in june 2002 when taiwan city suffered major outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever taiwan authorities also say that observer status would be an apolitical solution since other nonsovereign entities like the holy see and the palestine liberation organization have been given such status in who the us government is on record as supporting taiwans membership in organizations where statehood is not an issue27 in the past some members of congress have had problems with what they view as the sclerotic nature of this us support 27 state department spokesman in response to press question at the state department press briefing of march 20 2002 crs20 in 2001 and 2002 for the fifth and sixth years in row taiwan again applied for who observer status28 the 107th congress sought to energize us support for this effort by enacting pl 10710 authorizing the secretary of state to seek taiwans observer status in the who at the organizations annual meeting known as the world health assembly in may 2001 and again at the annual meeting in may 2002 pl 10715829 in each case the prc was able to prevent the issue from coming to full vote neither attempt succeeded political developments in taiwan taiwans political scene saw dramatic changes that could have farreaching future implications for us policy in elections on december 1 2001 taiwans nationalist party the kmt lost its legislative majority for the first time in 50 years dropping from 123 seats to 68 this left the largest bloc in the legislature 87 seats in the hands of president chens democratic progressive party dpp proindependence party that beijing finds highly objectionable until the december 2001 elections president chens and the dpps policy initiatives had been largely blocked by the nationalistcontrolled body but contrary to expectations the 2001 legislative elections did not appear to translate into more legislative support for president chens policy agenda instead nondpp minority parties were able to unite in tenuous coalition that wielded substantial influence over taiwans political agenda throughout 200230 the uncertainty and fluidity in taiwans political scene put extra pressure on congress and on american policymakers forcing them at times to chose between supporting taiwans democratic values and selfdefense and broader strategic goals in which washington sought prc support to many observers both the bush administration and the 107th congress appeared to tilt more frequently in the direction of taiwan than did previous american governments still us officials publicly appeared to distance themselves from president chens more controversial comments on taiwans status in future taiwanprc talks taiwanprc dialogue official talks between china and taiwan always problematic last occurred in october 1998 when koo chenfu chairman of taiwans straits exchange foundation sef and wang daohan president of chinas association for relations across the taiwan straits arats held meetings in shanghai at that meeting the two agreed to resume regular discussions and arrange reciprocal visit to taiwan by mr wang progress toward further talks halted however in july 1999 because of controversial statements by taiwans then president lee tenghui that future crossstrait talks should be conducted on special statetostate basis beijing protested this statement vehemently as radical departure from taiwans former embrace of one china policy 28 taiwan has been able to join some international organizations for which sovereign status is not prerequisite such as the asiapacific economic cooperation apec and the international olympic committee ioc 29 on march 14 2002 the european union also adopted nonbinding resolution calling on the who to accept observer status for taiwan docb501322002 b501382002 b5 01472002 b501502002 30 for background and details see crs report rs21093 taiwans december 2001 election results by kerry dumbaugh crs21 during 20012002 the taiwan government sent uncertain and at times conflicting messages on their views about taiwans political status among other things for instance early in january 2001 president chen announced that he would establish direct links between china and taiwans outlying islands of matsu and quemoy the socalled minilinks small but significant step in the direction of further contacts late in 2002 taiwans mainland affairs council mac cabinetlevel office to oversee taiwans relations with the prc completed study to assess the technical features and costs of expanded crossstrait sea and air links and taiwan politicians throughout much of 2002 debated and eventually approved proposal to allow for the first time taiwan charter flights to fly to and from the prc by way of hong kong and macau for the chinese new year proposal on which the prc offered its cooperation in addition prc leaders made their own overtures calling on taiwan to return to the negotiating table and holding out the possibility for postponing certain political disputes in order to resume talks31 these gestures however were tempered by the periodic statements from taiwans politicians noted above and by the prcs continued military buildup in south china opposite taiwan while official talks remained stymied crossstrait contacts during the 107th congress occurred increasingly between mainland and taiwan business representatives and in june 2002 three delegations of taiwan legislators visited beijing for talks taiwans increasing economic interconnectedness with the prc appeared to be putting special pressure on taiwan policymakers as did the taiwan business community to make further accommodations to ease restrictions on direct travel and investment tibet the us government recognizes tibet as part of china and has always done so although some dispute the historical consistency of this us position since normalization of relations with the prc in 1979 both republican and democratic us administrations have sought to minimize areas of potential tension with beijing on sensitive topics such as on the question of tibets political status but the dalai lama tibets exiled spiritual leader has long had strong supporters in the us congress who have continued to pressure the white house to protect tibetan culture and give tibet greater status in us law because of this congressional and other pressure presidents george h w bush sr bill clinton and george w bush each met with the dalai lama in the united states meetings that were deliberately kept lowkey but which nevertheless offended chinese leaders prompted by congressional efforts the clinton white house on october 31 1997 announced it would designate special coordinator for tibetan issues within the state department primary function of which would be to encourage dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama 31 spokesman zhang mingqing on november 28 2002 quoted in cnncom comments about postponing political disputes were made by prc president jiang zemin during sessions at the 16th party congress in early november 2002 crs22 congressional interest in tibet during the 107th congress remained strong the incoming george w bush administration in 2001 announced that it would retain the position of special coordinator for tibetan issues within the state department and named to the post paula dobriansky under secretary of state for global affairs to date the highestranking us official to hold that position in addition to including number of provisions on tibet in the foreign relations authorization act of fy20022003 pl 107228 the 107th congress considered legislation to support the aspirations of the tibetan people to safeguard their own culture and identity hr 1779 as well as various resolutions relating to human rights in tibet and prc dialogue with the dalai lama32 hong kong after the smooth transfer of hong kongs sovereignty from british to chinese july 1 1997 hong kong began to face unique political challenges that it had not encountered when the territory was sovereign british colony having been granted high degree of autonomy from beijing for selfgovernance hong kongs policymakers themselves have had to deal with issues as wideranging as social welfare programs housing industrial competitiveness and education all of which have been subject to an increasingly diverse public debate hong kong officials at times have been criticized as insufficiently vigilant in protecting hong kongs interests against encroachment real or imagined by beijing during the 107th congress series of unpopular government decisions in hong kong contributed to increased public criticism and disaffection as result spirited debate in hong kong focused on number of issues proposed antisedition laws article 23 of hong kongs constitution the basic law requires the government to enact laws to prohibit acts of treason succession sedition or theft of state secrets although it does not specify timetable or deadline for such laws after fiveyear hiatus the hong kong government issued proposal for an antisedition law in october 2002 and opened the issue for public commentary with legislative action expected early in 2003 many fear such law will make it easier for beijing to pressure hong kong to crack down on politically innocent acts eroding hong kongs current favorable human rights environment government accountability hong kongs chief executive is not elected by universal suffrage and its civil service are career employees with lifetime contracts33 this led many to charge that 32 for background and details see crs report rl30983 tibet china and the 107th congress issues for us policy 33 hong kongs basic law lays out procedures for selecting the chief executive for the first two fiveyear terms of that position through 2007 the basic law says nothing specific about selecting the chief executive after 2007 saying only that the ultimate aim is the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by broadly representative nominating committee the basic law of the hong kong special continued crs23 the post1997 government was politically accountable neither to the public nor to other government agencies the government attempted to address this issue in mid2002 by appointing new tier of non civilservice ministers to head government departments facto cabinet for the chief executive which ostensibly owes him political allegiance the new ministerial system remains controversial hong kongbeijing relations prior to 1997 hong kong thought that its interests would best be served by insulating it as much as possible from the prc including assuring the integrity of the hong kong border protecting hong kong from prc labor migration and maintaining separate currency and financial system but by the 107th congress growing view in hong kong was that these protections were increasingly artificial that they were hampering trade and other contacts and that hong kong may be losing business opportunities in the prc to less constrained global competitors pressure quietly built throughout 20012002 for easing travel and other restrictions along the hong kongchina border current us policy toward hong kong is set out in the ushong kong policy act of 1992 pl 102383 in addition to have required an annual us government report on hong kongs conditions through march 2000 this act allows the united states to treat hong kong differently from the way it treats china predicated upon an autonomous hong kong under the act the president has the power to halt agreements or take other steps if he determines that beijing is interfering unduly in hong kongs affairs34 the 107th congress amended the us hong kong policy act to extend the annual reporting requirement through march 200635 in addition on february 7 2002 the house task force on hong kongs transition created at the behest of speaker newt gingrich in 1997 filed its ninth report assessing conditions in hong kong following the transition to prc sovereignty36 33 continued administrative region of the prc chapter iv article 45 34 specific intention of the hong kong policy act was to permit the us government to treat hong kong differently from the way it treats the rest of china in us law thus the united states has an extradition treaty with hong kong but not with china maintains liberalized export control regime with hong kong but restrictive one with china and gives hong kong permanent mostfavorednation mfn trade status or normal trade relations as it is now known but gave that status to china separately upon its accession to the wto 35 section 586 foreign operations appropriations act for fy2002 pl 107115 36 the full test can be found at httpwwwhousegovbereuterpresshtm crs24 us policy trends during the 107th congress the bush administration deemphasized uschina relations broadened the focus of us policy in asia and notably increased and clarified us support for taiwan while it remained receptive to sinous dialogue the bush white house appeared willing to ignore the views of the prc and occasionally of us allies in pursuit of us interests this more assertive policy approach was departure from previous us administrations which had favored policies of engagement with the prc and ambiguity toward taiwan after the tensions over the collision of us and chinese military aircraft early in 2001 beijing responded to this us approach with marked reduction of anti american rhetoric while the prc continued to object to us arms sales to taiwan visas for taiwan officials and sanctions on prc companies its objections were reticent and appeared crafted to avoid disrupting usprc relations as result prc and us officials were able to meet and cooperate on various matters in 2001 2002 even in the midst of continuing real differences on taiwan human rights and other issues some credited this notable improvement in usprc relations with the more assertive policy approach of the bush administration by remaining open to bilateral dialogue but lowering the priority it gave to uschina relations they argued the white house reduced the leverage beijing had over the us policy process and forced beijing to be more proactive in seeking productive relationship with the united states but others attributed the improvement in relations to variety of factors while the us approach may be one they say others include the international realignments brought about by the antiterror campaign and the effort to disarm iraq the ongoing generational leadership transition in china mutual prc us interests in nonnuclear and stable korean peninsula and an increasing prc focus on its considerable domestic economic and social challenges in any event many observers say that the purposeful pragmatism behind the us approach in 20012002 has lowered the temperature in what had become heated american political debate since 1989 over the direction of us china policy according to these observers the current approach appears to have charted an uneasy middle territory between the three different camps into which the us policy community had sorted itself over sinous policy after the tiananmen square crackdown those camps are engagement caution and threat described below engagement the engagement approach toward the prc which dominated us policy since the nixon administration including in the george h w bush and william clinton administrations underlying this approach is belief that trends in china are moving inexorably in the right direction that is the prc is becoming more economically interdependent with the international community and therefore will have greater stake in pursuing stable international economic relationships they contrast this behavior favorably with that of disruptive states such as iraq or afghanistan those who are not part of the international system and who may support the kind of global terrorism that struck the united states on september 11 2001 some also believe that greater wealth in the prc will push chinese society in directions that will develop materially betteroff more educated and cosmopolitan populace that will over time press its government for greater political crs25 pluralism and democracy therefore according to this view us policy should seek to work more closely with the prc in order to encourage these positive longterm trends some proponents of the engagement approach fear that viewing the prc as threat is selffulfilling prophecy that could promote possible breakup of the prc with potentially disastrous policy consequences for us interests caution american proponents of what might be called cautious policy toward the prc stress that beijing officials still view the world as statecentered competitive environment where power is respected and interdependence counts for little this group sees prc leaders as determined to use all means at their disposal to increase their nations wealth and power they suggest that prc leaders may be biding their time and conforming to many international norms as strategy until china builds its economic strength and can take more unilateral action once it succeeds with economic modernization this argument holds beijing will be less likely to curb its narrow nationalistic or other ambitions because of international constraints or sensitivities threat third and more confrontational american approach has been based on the premise that the prc under its current form of government is inherently threat to us interests and that the chinese political system needs to change dramatically before the united states has any real hope of reaching constructive relationship with the prc according to this approach beijings communist leaders are inherently incapable of longterm positive ties with the united states rather beijing seeks to erode us power and arm us enemies in the region despite the statements of support for the us antiterrorism campaign according to this view the prcs repeated violations of its nonproliferation commitments have actually contributed to strengthening and arming nations that harbor global terrorists us policy should focus on mechanisms to change the prc from within while maintaining vigilant posture to deal with disruptive prc foreign policy actions in asian and world affairs key 107th congress actions and legislation relating to china us commissions on china in the year 2000 the 106th congress mandated the establishment of two
