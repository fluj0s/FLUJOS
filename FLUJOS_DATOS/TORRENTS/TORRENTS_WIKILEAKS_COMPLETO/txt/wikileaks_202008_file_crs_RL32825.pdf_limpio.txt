states hawaii puerto rico and the us virgin island are exposed to relatively high levels of risk from hurricanes and tropical storms to address the financial and economic effects of such risks residents and business owners have relied on private insurance statesponsored insurance pools andor federal emergency disaster assistance to manage their natural hazard risk the 2005 hurricane season was devastating to residents and businesses in the coastal highhazard areas of the gulf coast and new orleans although insured catastrophe losses in 2005 totaled 612 billion the industry had the financial resources to pay all insured claims without threatening its solvency and claimspaying ability hurricane katrina losses was 411 billion insurance industry participants legislators and policymakers learned great deal from both hurricane andrew in 1992 and the four major hurricanes during the 2004 season and they took specific actions that had the effect of minimizing the impact of the 2005 hurricane season nevertheless most disaster experts and policymakers did not anticipate nor were they prepared for the magnitude of flood damage and the subsequent number of flood claims filed in the wake of hurricane katrina as result the us congress was called upon to consider major revisions to the national flood insurance program nfip on september 27 2007 the full house approved hr 3121 the flood insurance reform and modernization act of 2007 to restore the financial solvency of the program on november 1 2007 senator christopher dodd introduced s 2284 to reform the flood insurance program while forgiving the estimated 175 billion in debt owed to the us treasury as of december 31 2007 with respect to the broader issues of managing and financing catastrophe risk members of the 110 th congress might also focus attention on the longterm budgetary implications of disaster recovery expenses incurred by the federal government and finding ways to expand privatesector capacity for insuring disaster losses previous congresses responded to insurers concerns by considering legislation to create federal catastrophe reinsurance program for residential property this

g343g561g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 the eighteen states along the us gulf and atlantic coast1 extending from texas to maine along with hawaii puerto rico and the us virgin islands are at relatively high risk from hurricanes and tropical storms2 hurricanes and tropical storms typically produce violent winds heavy rains and storm surges that result in flooding coastal erosion and ecological damage when they strike in populated commercial or industrial areas hurricanes and tropical storms can cause dozens of deaths and billions of dollars in both direct costs eg loss of capital stock and investments and indirect costs eg disruption of economic activity including loss of income employment and services 3 hurricanes are normally described as being in one of five categories depending on their wind velocity category one hurricanes have winds of 74 to 95 miles per hour category two hurricanes have winds of 96 to 110 miles per hour category three hurricanes have winds of 111 to 130 miles per hour category four hurricanes have winds of 131 to 155 miles per hour and category five hurricanes have winds greater than 155 miles per hour lessons learned from the 2005 and 2004 hurricane seasons have led the 110 th congress to focus attention on the mounting cost of federal outlays for disaster assistance involving hurricanes and deciding whether and how the federal government could improve the nations ability to finance the losses created by these events insurers legislators and policymakers learned great deal from the devastation caused by hurricane andrew in 1992 especially in the areas of predisaster mitigation and the financing of catastrophic risk an d actions they took served to minimize market disruption following both the devastating 2005 and 2004 hurricane seasons however the short term insurance solutions designed to finance loss caused by small category one or moderate hurricane category two three or four will not work for catastrophic hurricane category five because state pools lack the financial capacity for financing events of such magnitude prior to the beginning of the 110 th congress some members of congress had begun to rethink federal disaster policy particularly with respect to the financing of catastrophic risk and the unwillingness or inability of insurers to provide property insurance coverage to the extent sought and needed an important issue these members grappled with was deciding how to reconcile the possible roles for the public and private sectors in disaster risk financing and risk reduction several questions arose what has been the experience of using financial tools such as insurance and other financial services to reduce disaster risk what challenges and opportunities exist for disaster risk transfer and risk reduction schemes and lastly what concrete steps must be taken and by whom to form partnerships between the public and private sectors to use insurance and other financial services for disaster risk reduction 1 these 18 states are alabama connecticut delaware florida georgia louisiana maryland massachusetts mississippi maine new hampshire new jersey new york north carolina south carolina texas vermont virginia 2 hurricanes are formed in the north atlantic caribbean ocean gulf of mexico and the pacific coast of mexico the greatest likelihood of hurricane striking land areas is along the gulf coast and the southeastern seaboard as well as hawaii some hurricanes have struck central pennsylvania and the coast of new jersey new york maryland and new england 3 rachel davidson and kelly b lambert comparing the hurricane disaster risk of us coastal counties natural hazards review august 2001 p 132

two options to reduce losses from disasters predisaster mitigation that reduces physical environmental vulnerabilities and risk financing designed to reduce financial vulnerabilities the first step in the disaster management framework is to mitigate damages from disasters the residual economic risk can then be managed with risk financing strategies financing is thus an integral part of managing disaster risk it would not be feasible to quickly reconstruct the damaged property and infrastructure and also to restore the livelihood of the affected persons without adequate financial arrangements insurance is the primary method of financing natural disaster losses in the us risk financing with insurance avoids the time lag that is associated with postdisaster assistance or financing insurers are able to assess damages and reimburse disaster victims for financial losses in providing insurance coverage an insurer will agree to assume portion of the policyholders disaster risk exposure in exchange for premium from this premium payment the insurer sets aside loss reserves to pay expected claims and build up capital reserves to buffer against the risk of insurer insolvency from lowprobability highcost events insurance companies supplement this arrangement by purchasing reinsurance from reinsurance company so that losses from catastrophic event are spread worldwide 4 most insurance experts agree that although primary insurers and traditional reinsurers could absorb the loss shock from moderate category two three or four hurricane eg less than 50 billion in insured losses their financial capacity may not be adequate to cope with catastrophic category five hurricane estimates of the probable maximum losses pmls from catastrophic hurricane striking the us range up to 100 billion and this figure could be even higher depending on the location time and intensity of the event the pml loss from category 5 hurricane directly hitting densely populated area along the gulf and atlantic coast eg the miamift lauderdale area could exceed the total capacity policyholder surplus of the us insurance industry 5 the policyholders surplus of the entire property and casualty insurance industry stood at approximately 5216 billion at the end of 20076 only fraction of this 4 reinsurance provides considerable protection to the prim ary insurer by 1 limiting that insurers loss exposure to levels commensurate with their net ssets 2 reducing the wide swings in profit and loss margins inherent to the insurance business 3 protecting against catastrophic loss and 4 increasing capacity or the dollar amount of risk an insurer can prudently assume based on its rplus and the nature of the business written 5 david j cummins neil doherty and anita can insurers pay for the big one measuring the capacity of an insurance market to respond to catastrophic losses journal of banking and finance vol 26 2 p 557 6 policyholders surplus refers to net worth or owners equity in other industries it is measure of the capacity of insurers to underwrite policies and it must increase to meet the demands of growing us economy and claims resulting from hurricanes and other natural hazards httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32825g10g158g155g155g146g140g138g151g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g6g146g156g138g156g157g142g155g561g20g146g156g148g561g8g146g151g138g151g140g146g151

the industry as whole in the absence of an efficient and effective catastrophe insurance marketone that provides property insurance at reasonable rates to residents and business owners and spreads catastrophe risk globallythe government often becomes the facto financier of disaster recovery efforts through existing government disaster response and recovery programs and the traditional appropriation process as the frequency and severity of natural disasters increase state governments have used their taxing and bonding capacities to establish publicprivate insurance pools to engage in catastrophe risk management and financing recent catastrophes however have strained these pools and most insurance market analysts would agree the private sector insurance industry has enormous capacity to provide catastrophe risk insurance but that coverage is limited as demonstrated by the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons the industry can readily handle series of events with insured damages above 60 billion some reinsurers experts and insurance analysts insist the insurance industry can handle single insured event approaching 100 billion in claims hurricane katrina has focused public debate on whether to implement comprehensive exante or postdisaster financing solution to the problems presented by natural catastrophe exposure in an environment of budgetary deficits and spending constraints policymakers are seeking to find ways to confront the excessive and inequitable reliance upon federal disaster relief the 110 th congress might be asked to consider proposals which would permit federal reinsurance payouts for events over the level of exposure that the private sector can adequately and appropriately insure table 1 which shows the value of insured coastal properties in the 18 states along the us gulf and atlantic coasts indicates that 68 trillion out of 19 trillion in insured property is vulnerable to hurricanes the nation realizes this risk when hurricanes strike and individuals businesses and communities suffer while american taxpayers through the federal government bear the costs associated with indemnifying uninsured victims of natural disasters and

in the last few years is less compared with earlier years insured losses have increased significantly the increasing magnitude of both insured and uninsured losses from natural disasters represent an ongoing challenge for governments and the private sector catastrophes result in large government outlays for disaster assistance and they place financial strain on private disaster insurancereinsurance markets the federal government alone facing fiscal constraints to cover the losses to the private sector will find it challenging to meet longterm di sasterrelated spending further insurers have been and will continue to be reluctant to cover properties in highrisk areas because of high longrun costs which translates into high prices for disaster insurance and low demand for disaster insurance 8 to make insurance available and affordable state governments have created publicprivate partnerships statesponsored catastrophe funds to provide catastrophe insurance or reinsurance coverage at subsidized rates 8 the high longrun costs and low demand for disaster insurance results from insurers having to hold huge amounts of capital to pay claims resulting from rare but potentially larg catastrophe losses and the limited willingness of many consumers to pay riskbased premiums for disaster insurance respectively

katrina given the magnitude of katrinarelated damages and their impact on the nfip the 110th congress might be called upon to consider ways to overhaul the program with respect to the broader issue of managing and financing catastrophe risk the 110th congress might choose to focus attention on the longterm budgetary implications of disaster recovery expenses incurred by the federal government and finding ways to expand privatesector capacity for insuring disaster losses the last time congress took critical examination of the federal disaster policy was in 1998 11 this is likely to occur in 2008 at the same time that the property insurance industry seeks some type of federal assistance in reducing their catastrophe exposure ironically the insurance industry has historically opposed federal intervention in the insurance marketplace but faced with new terrorism risk following the september 11 2001 terrorists attacks and the recognition of possible megacatastrophic hurricane far more devastating than hurricanes katrina rita and wilma some insurers and their trade associations have begun to rethink their support for federal involvement in disaster insurance markets previous congresses responded to insurers concerns about megacatastrophe that threatens the solvency and claimpaying ability of the insurance industry by considering legislation to create federal catastrophe reinsurance program for residential property 12 despite broad bipartisan support for addressing americas exposure to natural disasters the full congress did not approve the creation of federal reinsurance program until the enactment of the terrorism risk insurance act tria of 2002 13 tria provides temporary federal reinsurance backstop for future terrorist acts once high insuranceindustry loss is sustained the law which was scheduled to expire on december 31 2007 was extended through the end of 201414 all federal disaster insurance bills have one thing in common they seek to improve the nations ability to finance catastrophe risk through insurance as opposed to increased direct spending for federal disaster assistance their justification is based on the argument that such initiatives will 1 enhance the current catastrophe funding system 2 make property insurance more available and affordable in highrisk areas 3 promote the funding of research studies ie earthquake science actuarial science economics and finance on disaster insurance issues and 4 expand our knowledge and understanding of the scientific and financial aspects of natural hazards professor howard kunreuther at the university of pennsylvania has suggested that improvements in the scientific and financial areas are thought to be important because of the urgency in finding ways to predict the probability and magnitude of future natural hazards plan for the necessary funding for disaster recovery and devise the optimum allocation of resources after the event in order to promote speedy economic recovery of the affected region and the rebuilding of the damaged residential commercial and public structures 15 11 see us congress house committee on the budget task force on budget process

of federal disaster insurance however say such measures conflict with long established sociological economic and actuarial principles that focus on the truecost of government programs the opportunity cost of the funds the foregone benefits of competitive insurance marketplace eg cost efficiency and rate competition and the absence of consumer choice the ability to decide whether to purchase coverage16 citing the development of innovative financial instruments for natural disaster risk management and expanded reinsurance capacity critics of public insurance systems say there is need for federal insurance program at this time they insist that such programs shield the private sector from loss while creating sizable taxpayerfinanced subsidies that undermine privatesector incentives for efficient risk management further it has been argued that these programs encourage population growth and development in highrisk hurricaneprone areas that should not be developed and would allow insurers to cherry pick the best risks and send the federal government the poor risks rather than providing insurance protection for natural hazard losses critics argue the federal government should take actions to expand privatesector capacity for insuring disaster losses proponents of federal disaster insurance argued that such scheme would reduce dependence on free disaster assistance and support efficient risk management by households and businesses g22g145g142g561g344g342g342g347g561g10g158g155g155g146g140g138g151g142g561g21g142g138g156g152g151g561 the 2005 hurricane season was the most destructive in recent us history there were 27 named storms of which 14 were hurricanes the 27 named storms more than doubled the national average over the past five decades according to researchers at tillinghasttowers perrin global actuarial management and financial services consulting firm over the past 50 years there have been on average 98 named storms 58 hurricanes and 23 intense hurricanes not all of these storms made landfall some catastrophe risk modeling firms contend that while the 2005 hurricane season was above normal it was not so unusual according to their hurricane models insurers should expect to see four hurricanes making landfall in the united states approximately once every 12 years and this is within the range to which most insurers manage their catastrophe risk table 3 shows that the three major hurricanes in 2005 katrina rita and wilma and three of four of the major hurricanes in 2004 charley ivan and frances accounted for six of the top 10 most costly catastrophes in us history before the 2005 hurricane season hurricane andrew ranked as the single most costly us natural disaster at 229 billion in 2007 dollars insured losses from hurricane katrina alone are estimated to be 436 billion the three most destructive hurricanes in 2005 together account for 605 billion total economic losses from katrina will likely exceed 200 billion despite the magnitude of the insured property losses suffered in 2005 the insurance industry has the financial strength to pay the claims from hurricane katrina 16 kunreuther p 93

georgia much of the damage from the storm was the result of flooding rather than wind in response to the devastation from the 2005 hurricane season rating agencies are changing their methods of assessing the adequacy of an insurers capital17 in the past rating agencies examined an insurers exposure to loss relative to 100 year catastrophe event that is they looked at disaster that occurred once every 100 years the new capital adequacy threshold is 250year events because the 100year events are forecast to increase in frequency rating agencies are also considering the potential losses from catastrophes in the aggregate and requiring an insurers estimate of its probable maximum loss to include the increase in the cost of labor and materials as the reconstruction cost rises several insurance coverage issues have arisen in the wake of hurricane katrina for example losses from floods are not covered under homeowners insurance policies and homeowners have filed lawsuits against insurers seeking to void the flood exclusion in homeowners policies in other lawsuits plaintiffs claim that flooding was caused by negligence in the construction and maintenance of the levees which broke and inundated the city rather than an act of god with respect to business and commercial property losses plaintiff lawyers representing homeowners have pursued oil and chemical businesses seeking compensation for damages many of these businesses which face longer and costly business interruption losses and untold amounts of extra expenses incurred in an attempt to restore business operations are suing their insurers insurers are still assessing individual losses and analyzing various scenarios that will affect ultimate claim payments 17 susanne sclafana big cats force change in

aboveaverage activity during seven of the last nine seasons insurers therefore had knowledge of and presumably were prepared for these events according to climatologists the level of activ ities for 2004 was similar to that of 2003 but consumers and insurers were spared huge losses in 2003 because very few of the tropical storms and hurricanes made landfall in the united states23 thus insurers faced limited losses from the 2003 hurricane season in terms of damages relative to their activity but that was not the case in 2004 when four major hurricanes made landfall in august and september the insurance information institute in new york indicated that the four major hurricanes that struck florida and other gulf and atlantic coast states in 2004 caused 210 billion in wind related insured losses and total claims filed of 22 million24 total economic losses were about 56 billion25 the four major hurricanes as whole exceeded the property damages from the 911 terrorist attacks 220 billion and hurricane andrew 229 billion in addition to 18 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa also reported that there was subtropical storm nicole and ten tropical depressions 19 these

g343g343g561difference between the amount of capital insurance available and the demand for coverageand sudden shortage of reinsurance for hurricanes this situation meant major primary insurers operating in coastal highhazard gulf and atlantic coast areas could not adequately spread their catastrophe risks which in turn forced many of them to stop writing new policies in hurricane exposed states or to shut down operations altogether for fear of overexposure financial impairment or even insolvency insurers were caught offguard by the 155 billion 1992 dollars in insured losses associated with hurricane andrew because of significant errors in actuarial estimates of potential hurricane related losses prior to hurricane hugo in 1989 the insurance industry never suffered any loss over 1 billion from single hurricane further most insurance industry experts estimated the probable maximum loss pml for single hurricane in the united states at between 8 and 10 billion and that such an event would occur only once in century hurricane andrew took insurers and forecasters by total surprise in hindsight because of the lull in hurricane activity during the 1970s and 1980s insurance policies were underpriced and insurers accepted far more hurricane exposure than could be supported by their capital resources including reinsurance also there were deficiencies in the stormresistant capabilities of homes in florida as well as poor enforcement of building codes in the region in response to postandrew insurance market di sruption state insurance regulators undertook several steps to restrict insurers products pricing underwriting decision and claims settlement practices for disaster coverage 31 in addition the south florida building codes were extended statewide and the state legislature established the florida commission on hurricane loss projection methodology to review hurricane catastrophe models used for rate filings these two major changes were instrumental in defining how insurers process and analyze hurricane risk insurers prospectively evaluated their catastrophe exposures in coastal areas for the first time and discovered that the magnitude of risk was both unexpectedly high and unacceptable given the risk tolerances of management and the expected longterm return on the business written in hurricaneprone areas in coastal states32 the concern was that insurers with excessive catastrophe exposures would have difficulty achieving or main taining profitability and balancesheet strength and this could lead to rating downgrades insurer insolvencies and insurance availability problems33 one major outcome of insurers assessment of catastrophe risk exposure was that large national property insurers began forming singlestate affiliate insurers to protect the capital of the holding company also with the approval of state regulators insurers began shifting the risk of windstorm losses away from overexposed insurers to all property owners and other consumers through assessments from statesponsored pools this decision allowed consumers and insurers continued c3 31 for example regulators sought to 1 issue moratoriums disallowing cancellations and nonrenewals of homeowners insurance policies 2 suppress homeowners insurance rates in response to political pressure but later approved rate hikes and special hurricane or wind deductibles and 3 open up the market to excess and surplus lines insurers and statesponsored insurance 32 rude musulin property insurance market crisis presentation before the institute for

market disruption in terms of policy cancellations nonrenewals and insurer insolvencies34 the economic rationale for shifting the risk of windstorm loss to property owners through state sponsored insurance and reinsurance pools was that these pools have cost of capital advantage over private insurers statesponsored insurance pools can offer coverage at price below what the risk would normally require private insurer to charge the pooling arrangement works because state insurance pools can largely avoid the accounting and tax rules governing the private sector statesponsored insurance facility is able to defer part of the cost of capital to the future by virtue of the governments authority to issue public sector debt to pay losses and favorable tax treatment but as economists and financial analysts note there are limits to the ability of states to fundcapitalize insurance pools in advance of catastrophe losses that is many consumers could face unpaid claims

modeling and forecasting tools collectively these four marketplace changes allowed private insurers reinsurers and statesponsored insurance pools to withstand significant losses from the 2004 hurricane season and to continue operating in disaster prone states g10g158g155g155g146g140g138g151g142g561g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561g6g142g141g158g140g157g146g139g149g142g156g561 seventeen states and the district of columbia now require property owners to pay hurricane or windstorm deductibles from 1 to 15 of the insured value of the property depending on the type of home eg mobile homes carry higher percentage deductible and where the property is located rather than traditional dollar deductibles used for other types of claims such as fire damage and theft 35 according to the insurance information institute the hurricane insurance deductibles have had the beneficial effects of making insurance coverage more available in high risk areas and getting customers more motivated to invest in disaster mitigation such as hurricane shutters damage resistant windows and homes fortified to withstand severe storms36 by imposing higher deductible for windstormre lated losses property owners assume greater share of the risks associated with living in highrisk areas and therefore they presumably take steps to mitigate potential losses 34 on august 18 2004 florida implemented moratorium prohibiting insurance companies from nonrenewing or cancelling the policies of homeowners hit by this years hurricanes under the moratorium residential insurers have been kept from dropping any policies even in cases involving nonpayment of premiums florida treasurer tom gallagher announced on november 16 2004 that he wanted to extend the order beyond the end of november because thousands of homeowners waiting on insurance checks would not be able to complete repairs by that time and therefore not be able to get coverage elsewhere until the repairs are finished 35

requirement that florida homeowners pay peroccurrence versus seasonal aggregate windstorm deductible emerged as an important state legislative issue following the 2004 hurricane season37 some108000 homeowners were struck by two or more hurricanes and approximately 36000 policies had multiple deductibles applied and the cost to policyholders of second and subsequent deductibles may total about 70 million38 residential hurricane deductibles are typically 2 of policy limits and may be as high as 5 of policy limits or even higher for certain policies 39 for this reason the multiple deductible can result in significant out ofpocket expense for many policyholders after the 2004 hurricane season the florida legislature passed legislationhurricane deductibles for residential insurance policies hb 9athat established program to reimburse policyholders for financial hardships suffered due to multiple hurricane deductibles being applied to their insured losses in 2004 under hb 9a policyholders of residential property insurance policies who paid two deductibles in 2004 were eligible for reimbursement from the department of financial services up to 10000 per storm per policy per structure and up to 20000 if they paid three or more deductibles the multiple deductible reimbursement program is funded with 150 million borrowed from the florida hurricane catastrophe fund cat fund to reimburse residential property insurance policyholders 40 the borrowed funds would be repaid over five years starting in 2006 the cat fund estimates that there was statewide average increase of 05 in homeowner rates to cover the payments41 while insurers were generally pleased with the new law because they will not have to reopen thousands of already settled claims they had lobbied to make it easier for insurers to be reimbursed by the cat fund currently there is 45 billion threshold trigger before insurers can be reimbursed for losses under the cat funds reinsurance agreement floridas chief financial officer tom gallagher had recommended plan to the legislatures joint select committee on hurricane insurance to reduce the cat fund retentio n to 4 billion for each of the two hurricanes and 1 billion for the third and subsequent events in season 42

and investment banks became more active in offering capital market instruments linked to catastrophe risk investors are attracted to innovative financial instruments form natural disaster risk management for several reasons including their aboveaverage riskadjusted rate of return versus the typical fixed income instruments and the fact that the rate of return is not correlated with the returns associated with stock and bond portfolios the first risklinked securities called catastrophe bonds were introduced in 1994 but it was not until 1997 that they gained some acceptance as catastrophe risk financing alternatives total catbond issuance in 2005 is estimated at around 6 billion investors in these securities continue to demand highrisk premium because of their lack of familiarity with catastrophe risk and uncertainty about the likelihood that th instruments will be triggered 44 the full acceptance of this new asset class for securitization has been limited by 1 the tax cost and regulatory treatment of the financial instrumentsthe socalled special purpose reinsurance vehicles sprvsunderlying the securitization 2 the lack of standardization in risk measurements 3 lack of generallyaccepted index on which to base payouts and 4 high transaction costs relative to traditional reinsurance coverage

hurricane andrew in 1992 most insurers had not used electronic information processing systems to keep track of their potential hurricane loss exposure and to help them make informed insurance underwriting decisions 45 after the andrew disaster there was widespread use of catastrophe simulation modelinga type of modeling that allows insurers and regulators to better predict future windstorm losses on the basis of current demographics and construction techniques rather than historical loss experience actuaries had gained access to sophisticated statistical databases and computer modeling techniques that could integrate longterm weather data engineering studies of storm loss potential and population trends46 by combining mathematical representations of the natural occurrence patterns and characteristics of hurricanes tornadoes severe winter storms earthquakes and other catastrophes with information on property values construction types and occupancy classes these computer simulation models provide information concerning the potential for large disaster losses before they occur there are significant limitations to these types of computer modeling techniques for example loss models work best when they are used to develop relative understanding of potential damage rates rather than absolute losses despite the comparative wealth of data and knowledge about hurricanes and the sophistication of insured loss models for these events some experts believe that these models are often wrong by an order of three even if all the important event characteristics are known thus model may predict that given storm will produce 300 million of insured losses but the actual insured losses would vary from 100 million to 900 million

susceptible to hazard risks such as strong winds storm surges heavy rains and flooding insurance as risk transfer mechanism can play key role in helping to minimize disaster losses and reduce the financial and economic impacts of disasters the problem is that multipleperil insurance policies held by homeowners exclude damages caused by wind and water damage to fill this gap in coverage state catastrophe funds such as the california earthquake authority and the florida hurricane catastrophe fund provide coverage for windstorm and earthquake hazards in similar fashion floodrelated damages

generally not available in the private insurance market because flood risk is generally considered uninsurable only people living in flood zones could be expected to purchase flood insurance adverse selection and these people would have frequent claims thus making the coverage prohibitively expensive 47 in addition insurers generally lack the ability to spread risk sufficiently to safeguard their assets against catastrophic flood losses therefore as part of the national flood insurance act of 196848 congress authorized the national flood insurance program nfip to serve as an insurance alternative to disaster relief and to meet the escalating costs of damage to buildings and their contents prior to 1968 the federal government responded to flooding on national scale through the building of flood control structures that restricted the flow of waters eg dams levees and dikes and providing disaster relief to flood victims after decades of federal expenditures for structural flood works and expanded disaster relief the focus shifted to flood insurance as policy tool for reducing loss and for spreading the risk of loss among individuals and businesses it was expected that homeowners and businesses would prefund their own losses by purchasing federal flood insurance at the same time the program would encourage preventive and protective measures to reduce future losses key mechanism for doing so was the development of flood plain maps and the requirement that local communities restrict development in areas most subject to flooding the nfip provides subsidized lowcost flood insurance to homeowners and small businesses in floodprone communities that have agreed to adopt and enforce floodplain management and building code standards federal flood insurance is available in each of the 50 states the virgin islands puerto rico guam the district of columbia and american samoa to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage caused by flood to buildings and contents the nfip operates under statutory mandate that premium charges for prefirm risksie structures built before the issuance of flood insurance rate map firm or before 1975 whichever is latermust be reasonable the subsidy is provided by charging premium rates discounted from full risk rates in order to make up the premium shortfall from subsidizing premiums the nfip establishes target level of premium income for the program as whole that accommodates the combined effect of the portion of nfip business paying less than full risk premiums and the portion of the business paying full risk premiums 47 some insurers provide coverage under homeowners insurance policies for backup of sewers and drains coverage may also be provided for flood damage under the comprehensive section of standard auto insurance policies and some coverage is available under special commercial insurance policies 48 pl 90448 83 stat 476

increasingly aware of the erosion risks facing homeowners and communities due to high intensity storms and coastal flooding61 it is not uncommon for example for hurricane or severe coastal storm to cause the coast to erode 100 feet or more in single day this situation has led to debate over the economic consequences of erosion and the use of federal programs such as the national flood insurance program nfip to address the coastal erosion problem the principal concern is that while the nfip covers erosion damage that occurs in connection with floods it does not account for erosion in setting flood insurance rates in coastal areas the insurance industry and fema have both taken steps to address coastal erosion insurers responded to coastal erosion risk by making policyholders vulnerable to windstorms pay more of the cost of living in hurricane prone areas for example insurers now impose hurricane deductibles equal to percentage of the structures insured value and establish rates for windstorm coverage based on the structures ability to withstand damage from high wind fema has begun to prepare and disseminate maps showing areas subject to erosion created and imposed mandatory

standards nationwide because most of the building in coastal areas were constructed in the 1970 through 1990 period when these building standards did not apply most homes remain vulnerable to damages

of insurance against hurricanes does not take into account changes in the global climate moreover insurers traditionally assume that the average insured losses over recent historical period accurately reflect future losses over some arbitrary future period this assumption works well with automobile insurance and other widely distributed independent risk but is less approp riate for lowfrequencyhigh consequence events like hurricanes in other words the average activity in any arbitrary period of the past is not necessarily good predictor of future activity the inability to predict future

dialogue about the efficacy of our current system for managing and financing natural catastrophe risk central challenge facing members of the 109 th congress is determining what public and private initiatives are needed to mitigate and finance losses stemming from future mega catastrophes is there need to improve the nations ability to finance catastrophe risk and if so how more specifically congress might be called upon to determine the appropriate roles and policies of the public and private sectors in addressing disaster risks how they affect hurricane risk and how they might be restructured to better achieve social objectives three points of view usually emerge when debating the catastrophe funding problem one view is that catastrophes eg hurricanes are uninsurable in the private sector and the federal government should directly take over underwriting insurance this view is not widely supported because the private sector has access to capital market resources that can be used to fund the cost of catastrophic hurricane second point of view argues that catastrophe risk is fundamentally uninsurable and federal involvement in the catastrophe insurance market is needed before really big event occurs only at the higher layers of coverage 66 consensus among insurance and public policy experts seems to have emerged that publicprivate partnership in financing megacatastrophe over the 60100 billion threshold might eventually be needed as demonstrated by the 2005 and 2004 hurricane seasons insurers and reinsurers are able to handle series of catastrophes with insured damages as high as 60 billion some insurance market analysts believe the industry can even handle single insured event approaching 100 billion in claims publicprivate catastrophe insurance partnership would leave the private sector responsible for underwriting property insurance and the federal government responsible for providing capital only where consumers and the private insurance and capital markets are unable to do so the government could facilitate more effective riskspreading which can be achieved by more effective pooling of losses over time and broader pooling of losses among risks more effective pooling of losses over time could be achieved by borrowing mechanisms and tax deferral of loss 66 for more information on this argument see james rutrough funding

g344g347g561reserves for natural disasters broader pooling of losses among risks could be facilitated by requiring property owners to purchase insurance against natural hazards economists note however that any scheme that imposes mandatory insurance requirement for all property owners could create economic distortions such as cross subsidization of risks where low risk individuals subsidize high risk individuals third point of view presupposes that the financial resources available in the private sector are sufficient to make federal involvement unnecessary at this time there have been many proposals considered by congress during the last three decades to address various types of catastrophic losses67 members of the 109th congress could pursue any one or all of the following policy options if it could be shown that potential losses from hurricanerelated hazards are beyond the capacity of private markets to diversify such risks establish an emergency reserve fund to provide timely financial assistance in response to domestic disasters and emergencies provide financial backstop or guarantees to innovative financial instruments and activities involving insurance interstate compacts between states set up to address regional exposure to catastrophic losses involving hurricanes in the gulf and atlantic coast states and earthquakes in the pacific northwest states and other areas exposed to similar hazard risks develop large regional pool for hurricane insurance with potential benefits of spreading the risks across impacted states currently each state relies on its own financial resources to develop substantial pool of funds for insurance some supporters of this policy option have even suggested pooling risks with the same characteristics as hurricanes such as earthquakes volcanos and tsunamis into single national hazard insurance program designed to solve the catastrophe funding problem establish federal hurricane program to provide reinsurance to statesponsored insurance programs establish an explicit federal windstorm insurance program similar to the national flood insurance program focus on tax policy to allow insurers to create taxdeferred reserves to fund future catastrophe losses from natural disasters encourage innovative new financing mechanisms of insurance reinsurance and capital markets to mitigate and diversify disaster risk and implement comprehensive national disaster mitigation policy strategy for reducing future losses these approaches have been debated in previous congresses and some have enjoyed bipartisan support however consensus emerged largely because of concerns that such approaches would 1 encourage home construction in highrisk areas 2 serve as tax giveaway to rich 67 for more information see crs report

g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 during the 2005 hurricane season hurricanes katrina rita and wilma demonstrated both the destructive nature of natural disasters and the importance and shortcomings of insurance as major financial source for postdisaster economic recovery as demonstrated by the 2005 and 2004 hurricane seasons the industry can readily handle series of events with insured damages as high as 60 billion insurers are expected to easily cover the 661 billion in insured losses from the 2005 catastrophes including hurricane katrina without threatening the industrys solvency or claimspaying ability many questions however have been raised about the industrys continued willingness and ability to sell property insurance coverage in hurricaneprone states while some insurance market experts believe insurers and reinsurers can even handle single insured event approaching 100 billion this amount of protection might not be enough for the potential megacatastrophe for example catastrophe modeling firms note that repeat of the 1938 category 3 hurricane that hit the northeast could cause over 300 billion in possible damages as development increases in coastal areas megacatastrophic hurricane could result in huge government outlays for disaster assistance and present insurers with significant financial hazards such as the risk of insolvency rapid reduction of earnings and statutory surplus forced asset liquidation to meet cash needs and ratings downgrade to the extent property insurance markets fail to offer adequate levels of coverage after catastrophic hurricane and the federal government avoids the disaster insurance market with the exception of terrorism risk insurance the states will likely continue to offer various losssharing mechanisms that provide catastrophe insurance or reinsurance coverage at subsidized rates in similar manner the federal government will continue to offer flood insurance under the national flood insurance program nfip to offset repair and rebuilding costs in floodprone regions members of the 110 th congress will likely be called upon to determine whether there is need to improve the nations ability to finance catastrophe risk and if so how previous congresses responded to similar concerns by considering legislation to create federal catastrophe reinsurance program for residential property but despite broad support for several bills over the past few congresses the full congress did not authorize federal reinsurance program until the enactment of the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 finally most observers would agree that for the very highest layers of catastrophe risk the government and consequently the taxpayer is now by default the insurer of last resort in the 110 th congress any one of number of policy options could be pursued but passage will likely be based on whether it can be shown that potential losses from hurricane hazards are beyond the capacity of private markets to diversify catastrophe risks members will likely be grappling with several policy questions for example will reinsurance and securitization be enough to maintain insurance solvency after catastrophic hurricane how can the various funding sources available for catastrophe insurance be expanded and refined to cope with catastrophic hurricane and lastly what role if any should the federal government play in catastrophe insurance
