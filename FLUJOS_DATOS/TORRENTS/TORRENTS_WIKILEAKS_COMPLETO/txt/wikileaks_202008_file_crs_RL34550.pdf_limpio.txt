congress summary every company that terminates telephone calls made to its customers faces some number of calls for which it is unable to obtain its due compensation for variety of reasons significant amount of telephone voice traffic that is originated by the customers of one company and terminated to the customers of another company is not adequately identified making appropriate billing for that traffic difficult or impossible this phantom traffic is more seri ous problem for small rural telephone companies than for other telephone companie s one representative of these small carriers has claimed that betw een 20 and 30 of their in tercarrier traffic cannot be billed because it lacks sufficient billing information there are three interrelated factors that foster phantom traffic under the current intercarrier compensation system charges for the termination of voice traffic vary significantly depending on the source and type of call creating strong incentive for originating carriers to mask traffic that is subject to high termination rates for certain types of calls the fcc has not yet adopted defin itive rules about the interconnection rights and obligations of originating and terminating carriers the call detail information that must be provided by the interconnecting companies to identify the source and type of traffic andor the rate s to be charged by companies for terminating calls originated by customers of other companies thus fostering billing disputes among carriers given the significant differences in network architectures and the multiplicity of terminating charges for different types of calls the signaling and call detail syst ems of many companies cannot accommodate the complex routing of some calls often resulting in terminating carriers not receiving all the call detail information needed to bill for termination from public policy perspective phantom traffic can be viewed as symptom of the shortcomings of the current intercarrier compensation regime and addressed in the context of comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform or it can be addressed narrowly as unique billing problem created by the lack of call detail information needed to identify and bill specific calls each approach has its advantages and disadvantages s 2919 takes the latter approachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550contents v r v i w 1 t h c u s s

600 million to 2 billion in submissions filed in the fccs intercarrier compensation proceeding docket wc 0192 phantom traffic problems billing for the termination of telephone calls issues for congress overview every company that terminates telephone calls made to its customers faces some number of calls for which it is unable to obtain its due compensation for variety of reasons significant amount of tra ffic is not adequately identified making appropriate billing for the traffic difficult or impossible1 this phantom traffic which has never been forma lly defined by congress or the federal communications commission fcc or commission can best be described as telephone voice calls made to telephone companys customers the called parties and that t hus traverse and terminate on that telephone companys network and that originate somewhere outside of that telephone companys network typically as traditional long distance calls cellular calls or voice over internet protocol voip calls originated by calling parties that are the customers of other providers of voice telephone services but for which the telephone company is not receiving from the ca lling parties service providers the compensation it is due under current rules and regulations for the use of its network to terminate those calls some have alleged that lephone companies that ter minate calls are losing as much as 2 billion in compensation annua lly as result of phantom traffic2 and that these revenue losses have pot entially significant public policy implications those lost revenues can force local telephone co mpanies to raise their rates for local service thus undermining the goal of unive rsal service and so can reduce company funds available for br oadband investment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs2 3 both the federal and state jurisdictions have concluded it is not possible to leave it entirely to the market to set rates fo r the termination of traffic be cause the terminating company enjoys in effect monopoly position once the called party has chosen her provider any calls to her must be terminated over her provide rs network if that provider were to impose extremely high charges for terminating long distance or wireless or voip calls to the customer the providers originating those ca lls would have option but to pay those charges or else they would not be able to co mplete the calls originated by their customers in many cases refusing to complete the call is not legal option for example long distance carriers are required to complete all calls originated by their customers even if they would lose money by completing such calls beca use the termination charges they had to pay exceeded the nationallyaveraged retail rates they are required to charge under federal law thus the fcc has intervened to set regulato ry ground rules for the completion of interstate calls and state regulatory commissions have inte rvened to set regulatory ground rules for the completion of intrastate calls these ground rules however remain incomplete 4 statement by raymond henagan general manager rock port telephone company before the senate committee on commerce science and transportation hearing on phantom traffic april 23 2008 at p4 5 p l 104104 110 stat 56 see especially the provisions in part ii development of competitive services and in title iv regulatory reformit is difficult to measure the size of the problem unambiguously however because the fcc has not yet adopted defin itive rules about the interconnection rights and obligations of certain voice services providers and the rmination rates for certain calls3 as result there are strong di fferences of opinion among the parties about what the appropriate rmination charge is for many calls and in some cases whether any payment is due at all in some cases what telephone company that is terminating voice traffic views as phantom traffic the company that is originating that traffic may consider appropriately compensated traffic and there has been definitive fcc ruling to resolve these conflicts as will be explained below phantom traffic is more serious problem for small rural telephone companies than for other telephone companies one representative of these small carriers has claimed that industry estimates show between 20 and 30 of intercarrier tr affic cannot be billed b ecause it lacks sufficient billing information4 the causes of phantom traffic over the past 30 years telecommunications policy in the united states slowly has evolved from government sa nctioned monopoly provision of all telecommunications services to competitive provision of most telecommunications services congress explicitly mandated this competitive market approach in the telecommunications ac t of 1996 1996 act5 today most consumers have access to multiple providers of voice services often with the option of placing telephone calls using traditional wireline technology wireless technology or voip technology in most cases when consumer makes call to reach the called party that call travels not just over the facilities of the company to which the consumer subscribes but also over the facilities of one or more other companies since the calling partyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs3 6 each company bears costs associated with handling the calls that are originated by the subscribers of other companies as an inte rmediate network that is transiting calls andor as final network that is terminating calls at the same time each company benefits from having other companies transit nd terminate calls that are originated by its own customers if the costs and the be nefits to each company from transiting and terminating one anothers calls were wash there would be need for system of intercarrier compensation but traffic patterns are not symmetrical carrier may originate more calls than it terminates for example carrier may have many subscribers who are telemarketers and thus make many calls but receive few or none or vice versa for example carrier may have many subscribers who are internet service providers and receive many calls but originate few or carrier may be at the geographic edge of the web of interconnecting telephone networks that use circuitswitched technology known in aggregate as the public switched telephone ne twork or pstn and therefore never be used as an intermediate carrier to transit calls from other companies but may originate many calls that are transited on other networks moreov er rural companies have higher costs than others because they serve lowdensity highcost areas and thus even if their incoming and outgoing traffic is in balance their costs fo r terminating calls originated elsewhere will exceed the costs borne by other companies term inating the calls that are originated on the rural networks thus the costs and benefits of transiting and terminating one anothers calls are not wash and system of intercarrier compensation is needed for detailed discussion of intercarrier compensation and related policy issues see crs report for congress rl32889 intercarrier compensation on component of telecom reform by charles b goldfarb it is worth noting that carrier might be able to receive compensation for terminating call even if it is not able to charge the originating carrier the fcc has ruled that wireless carriers may seek to receive access charges as compensation for terminating calls by negotiating contracts with long distance and other originating carriers but cannot unilaterally impose access charges in the matter of petitions of sprint pcs and att corp for declaratory ruli ng regarding cmrs access charges wt docket 01316 declaratory ruling adopted july 2 2002 nd released july 3 2002 in the absence of regulatory requirement that they pa wireless carriers terminating access charges however the long distance carriers have refuse d to enter into agreements with wireless carriers to make such payments but the reta il pricing scheme typically used by wireless carriers gives customers bucket of incoming and outgoing minutes of use for set price and then imposes per minute of use charge for any additional incoming or outgoing minutes of use thus the wireless carriers are able to recover at least some of the costs associated with terminating ca lls originated by other companies customers through charges on their own customers incoming minutes of us there is merit however to the wireless carriers argument that their inability to co llect terminating access ch arges from originating carriers the way wireline carriers do places them at competitive disadvantage visavis wireline carriers since many customers do not like having to pay minute of use charges for incoming calls and the wireless carriers end us er rates unlike wireline carriers rates must be higher to take into account their inability to recover terminatin g costs from originating carriers the fcc ruling seems to treat wirele ss service as niche supplement to wireline service rather than as competitor since it does not appear to consider the competitive implications of allowing one set of competito rs to receive intercarrier compensation for terminating calls but not another set of competitorsonly pays the company to which it subscribes for service system of intercarrier compensation is needed to compensate the other companies whose network facilities are used to complete the call6 there are two basic elements of any intercarrier compensation system first it is necessary for each company to be able to identify the amount and source of traffichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs4 7 the single biggest cost for telephone networ k especially in rural areas is the fixed cost continuedon its network that is originated by the s ubscribers to other companies second it is necessary to set rates and bill the appropriate originating voice provider for transiting or terminating that traffic if as curre ntly is the case the charge for terminating traffic varies depending on the type of traffic then information on the source is necessary both to determine who to charge nd the rate to charge for variety of reasons neither of these elements is fully in place today to great extent phantom traffic is symptom and consequence of the current still incomplete intercarrier compensation system there are three interrelated aspects of the current system that foster phantom traffic although the underlying cost to rminating carrier is basically the same for terminating all types of voice traffic the current system sets different rates for the terminati on of voice traffic depending on the source or type of traffic invol ved thus creating incentives for originating carriers to mask the source or type of calls that are subject to high termination charges so that they appear to be calls subject to lower termination charges for certain types of calls the f cc still has not dopted definitive rules about the interconnection rights and obligations of originating and terminating carriers the call detail information that must be provided by the interconnecting companies to identify the source and type of traffic andor the rates to be charged by companies for terminating calls originated by customers of other companies thus fostering billing disputes among companies the various companies signaling and call detail systems challenged by significant differences in the network architectures of the various services providers and the multiplicity of terminating charges for different types of calls still often are incomplete or incompatible and therefore unable to communicate to one another all the information needed for accurate billing of termination charges multiplicity of termination charges to date the intercarrier compensation system has been implemented on piecemeal basis as specific existing telecommunications services were opened to competitive provision and providers offering entirely new services such as wireless service or using new technologies such as voip were allowed to interconnect with the existing web of interconnecting wire line telephone company networks known as the public switched telephone network or pstn inter carrier compensation rules have been adopted that are specific to those services or technologies for example to help keep the rates for local telephone service affordable in rural areas rural telephone companies have been allowed to set abovecost rates fo r the termination of interstate and especially intrastate long distance calls7 these rates tend to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs5 7 continued of providing the telephone line sometimes re ferred to as the local loop from the customer premise to the telephone company switch that serv that customer some of that fixed cost is recovered through monthly subscriber line charge it has been us telecommunications policy to limit the size of the subscriber line charge in high cost areas however by recovering some of those fixed costs thr ough abovecost percall access charges imposed on long distance and wireless carriers that or iginate calls from outside the rural telephone companys service area the access charges for intrastate long distance calls which are subject to regulation by state regulatory co mmissions tend to be higher than those for interstate long distance calls which are subject to fcc regulation 8 these payments vary even among lecs depending on whether the carrier is an incumbent local exchange carrier ilec that is one of the legacy lecs that was government sanctioned local monopoly provider prior to the implementation of the 1996 act small lec sometimes referred to as rural lec th at is an ilec serving small rural area or competitive local exchange clec that is new competitive provider of local exchange service that was allowed to enter the market as result of enactment of the 1996 act 9 written testimony of charles w mckee director of government affairs sprint nextel corporation before the senate committee on commerce science and transportation hearing on phantom traffic april 23 2008 at p 3much higher than the rates for terminating other traffic at the same time in order to encourage new information services the fcc has treated enhanced service providers including informa tion service providers or isps as end users rather than carriers for intercarrier compensation purpos this allows isps to purchase lines out of the local carriers tariffs for busin ess customers which do not include usage based charges rather than out of the ta riffs for interexchange carriers which have usagebased charges for both originating nd terminating calls since isp customers often stay online for long periods of time if isps had to pay minuteofuse access rates it would have made it prohibitively expensive to offer flat rated retail service as result of these piecemeal rules today intercarrier compensation payments vary widely depending on whether the interconnecting part is wireline local telephone company known as local exchange carrier or lec8 long distance company known as an interexchange carrier or ixc wireless carrier known as comme rcial mobile radio service or cmrs carrier or an inform ation service provider isp whether the service is classified by the fcc as telecommunications or information local or long distance or interstate or intrastate and if the call uses ip technology whether the call travels from the calling party to the internet and then to the called party without traversing the public switched telephone network or travels in part or in its entirety over the pstn sprint claims there are at least nine different classifications of rates between carriers9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs6 10 the icf is group of carriers from diffe rent segments of the telecommunications industry that submitted to the fcc proposal for comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform in the matter of developing unified intercarrier compensation regime cc docket 0192 exparte brief of the interc arrier compensation forum in support of the intercarrier compensation and universal reform plan icf plan october 5 2004 11 icf plan at appendix c p 2 in figu re 1 rc refers to reciprocal compensation the costbased system for intercarrier comp ensation between providers of local service mandated by the 1996 act 47 usc 251 b5 252d1a and 252d2a intramta and intermta refer to the di stinction between those calls originating on wireless networks that are treated as local vs long distance for intercarrier compensation purposes all classifications with the words intrastate or int erstate refer to intercarrier compensation rates for long distance calls 12 given the wide variation in intercarrier compensation rules applied to carriers and technologies that are now competing with one another the fcc adopted further notice of proposed rulemaking fnprm in february 2005 to review and reform its rules with the goal of constructing unified intercarrier compensation regime the fcc sought public comment on nine comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform proposals or sets of principles that have been submitted to the fcc as well as staff proposal the issues raised in the icc fnprm were not new to the fcc in 2001 the commission opened rulemaking proceeding and adopted notice of proposed rulemaking seeking information on how to develop unified intercarrier co mpensation regime to date the fcc has not followed through on any of these proceedings for comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform in recent court hearing involvin g the appeal of an earlier fcc intercarrier compensation ruling the fcc attorney stat ed that the fcc chairman has committed to complete the proceeding on comprehensive refo rm within six months see adam bender fcc order on intercarrier comp ensation due in six months communications daily may 5 2008 other fcc commissione rs indicated however they were not aware of such goal see adam bender untitled article in the wireline section of communications daily may 12 2008 13 these intercarrier compensation charges can represent substantial portion of the costs of providing certain services and in the case of long distance calls that interexchange carriers are required by statute and fcc rule to offer at single rate nationally can exceed the retail price for the service the access char ges that some rural local exchange carriers charge long distance carriers for originating the long distance calls made by customers located in those rural areas or for terminatin g the long distance calls made to customers located in those rural areas exceed the nationa lly averaged price that the long distance continuedas shown in figure 1 chart prepared by the intercarrier compensation forum icf10 in 2004 the average intercarrier compensation rate for terminating calls ranged from 01 cents per minute for traffi c bound to an isp to 51 cents per minute for intrastate traffic bound to subscriber of small rural incumbent local exchange carrier individual rates were as low as zero and as high as 359 cents per minute11 this broad range of rates has not changed significantly since 200412 in each case the terminating carrier is providing basically the same functions to complete the call this has created the strong incentive for those companies that are originating calls for which the termination charges are very high to attempt to mask the type of call perhaps make an intrastate call appear to be an interstate call or any type of long distance call appear to be local call so they can pay lower termination charge13 or at the least has created the disincentive for those companieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs7 13 continued carriers charge their subscribers for those ca lls and thus the long distance carriers lose money on each long distance call into or out of those rural exchanges as result long distance carriers are reluctant to make availabl to customers in those areas service packages that are likely to be attractive to heavy long distance users 14 1996 act section 251a1 this legisl ation amended the communications act of 1934 at 47 usc 251ato take any steps that would make it easier for terminating companies to identify traffic that is subject to high termination charges source intercarrier compensation forum undefined interconnection rights and obligations and interconnection compensation rates as part of the mandate for competiti on in the 1996 act the first obligation identified for each telecommuni cations carrier is the dut to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers14 in implementing this requirement the fcc developed ground rules for interconnection including specific requireme nts andor general guidance about where the physical interconnection can take place and the terms cond itions and rates for exchanging traffic and terminating calls as well as the call detail information to be provided to be able to identif the source and type of call figure 1 differences in intercarrier compensation rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs8 15 as explained earlier under section 251a1 all telecommunications carriers have the duty to interconnect their networks with an other requesting telecommunications carrier they have obligation to interconnect their networks with any other entities 16 the fcc has made some rulings relating to the termination charges for voip service it has ruled that pulvercoms free world di alup fwd service which offers users of broadband internet access the opportunity to join other such users worldwide in talking with one another directly over the internet but has transmission capability is an internet application that facilitates using the custome rs broadband access service to make free voip calls but does not directly provide voip serv ice and thus is an unregulated information service subject to fcc jurisdiction under title i of the communications act rather than telecommunications service however it xpressly declined to exercise title i jurisdiction over fwd to impose any economic or entryexit regulation or any other type of regulation at this time see in the matter of petition for declaratory ruling that pulvercoms free world dialup is neither telecommunications nor telecommunications service wc docket 0345 memorandum opin ion and order adopted february 12 continuedthese ground rules covered wide range of issues for example identifying certain situations in which terminating traffic would be subject to tariffed access charges or reciprocal compensation or negotiated rates identifying situations in which one company could request interc onnection with another company and invoke the negotiation and arbitrati on procedures set forth in the 1996 act and imposing certain signaling and call detail requirements on companies as the wireless and voip technologies ve come onstream for certain types of traffic the fcc has not yet adopted defi nitive ground rules there are gaps in the rules about the interconnecti on rights and obligations of the new providers and the incumbent providers in the rules about the call detail information that must be provided by the interconnecting companies t identify the source and type of traffic for billing purposes andor in the rules bout the rates to be charged by companies for terminating calls originated by custom ers of other companies for example certain voip services are provi ded by software applications providers such as skype that do not own their own networks and do not have interconnection rights to the pstn since they are not telecommunications providers15 customer who purchases one of these noninterconnected voip rvices can only make calls to other subscribers of that noninte rconnected voip service unless she also purchases s upplementary service that allows her calls to be terminated on the pstn throug h the use of the network of an interconnected carrier in orde r to reach all telephone users similarly purchaser of one of these noninterconnected voip services can receive calls from parties that do not subscribe to that voip service only if he pays parately for telephone number to which the calls from the subscribers of traditional wireline and wireless can be routed the fcc has not set definitive rules however on how to assess charges fo r the termination of calls that originate with noninterconnected voip service providers and terminate on pstn networks or that originate on pstn networks and terminate with noninterc onnected service providers16 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs9 16 continued 2004 and released february 19 2004 the fcc stated that the customer not pulvercom originates the communication and thus implied but did not explicitly state that pulvercom would not be required to pay intercarrier co mpensation at the other extreme of voice service involving voip technology the fcc has ruled that long distance interexchange service that 1 uses ordinary customer prem ises equipment with enhanced functionality 2 originates and terminates on the public switched telephone network and 3 undergoes net protocol conversion and provides enhanced functionality to end users due to the providers use of ip technology is teleco mmunications service and its provider must pay access charges to the local carriers that or iginate and terminate the call see in the matter of petition for declaratory ruli ng that atts phonetophone ip telephony services are exempt from access charges wc docket 02361 order adopted april 14 2004 and released april 21 2004 17 s in the matter of time warner cabl request for declaratory ruling that competitive local exchange carriers may obtain interconnection under section 251 of the communications act of 1934 as amended to provide wholesal telecommunications services to voip providers wc docket 0655 memorandum opinion and order adopted and released march 1 2007 18 see in the matter of bright house networks llc et complainants v verizon california inc et defendants file eb08md 002 recommended decision adopted and released april 11 2008 at paras 1520the fcc has ruled that wholesale telecommunications carriers are entitled to interconnect and exchange traffic with incumbent local exchange carriers when providing services to other service providers including voip service providers17 this ruling is important because in the 1996 ac t local telephone companies are only obligated to interconnect with requesting telecommunications carriers thus retail voip provide r offering voip service that is classified as an informati on service cannot itself demand interconnection rights with local telephone company and if it could not exchange its traffic with the local telephone company it would not be able to compete with that local telephone company but it can contract with wholesale telecommunications carrier for that carrier to exchange the voip traffic on its behalf several recent fcc actions however suggest that the commission has not yet made definitive ruling on which entities qualify as wholesale telecommunications carriers with interconnection rights in recommended decision in one proceeding18 the chief of the fcc enforcement bureau found that two entities that had obtained state certificates as wholesale telecommunications carriers and had entered into interconnection agreemen ts with local exchange carriers nonetheless did not meet the finition of telecommunications carrier because they did not make their services generally available to nonaffiliated custom ers through tariffs or public written or oral offerings but rather their only customers were their affiliated providers of retail voip services majority of commissioners with the chairman dissenting overruled that recommendedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs10 19 in the matter of bright house networks llc et complainants v verizon california inc et defendants file eb08md002 memora ndum opinion and order adopted

adopted july 2 2002 and released july 3 2002 22 as explained earlier wireless carriers at ast partially recover the costs associated with terminating calls originated by the customers of other voice providers by imposing on their own customers per minute usage charges for incoming calls this does however place them at competitive disadvantage visavis wireline carriers who receive compensation for terminating calls originated by customers of other service providers and who therefore do not have to impose usage charges on their own customers incoming calls to recover their termination costsdecision however19 arguing that the two entities did qualify as wholesale telecommunications carriers but explicitly limited the decision to the specific record in this specific case but because this decision occurred within the context of restricted complaint proceeding for which only parties with direct interest could comment the majority chose not to make general ruling in different case the fcc put out for public comment petition from an incumbent local exchange carrier claiming it did not have to interconnect with company that provided wholesale telecommunications services for its affiliated retail provider of voip service questioning whether the entity qualified as telecommunications carrier despite having received state certification20 the commission has not yet ruled in that case in declaratory ruling21 the fcc found that neither the communications act nor any commission rule prohibits cmrs carrier from attempting to collect access charges from an interexchange long distance carrier for terminating long distance call but it also found that there is commission rule that enables sprint pcs cmrs unilaterally to impose access charges on att an interexchange carrier thus cmrs carriers can receive compensation for terminating long distance calls only if they can negotiate rates terms and conditions with the interexchange carriers since cmrs carriers ar prohibited from blocking long distance calls if for example an interexchange carrier refuses to pay access charges the interexchange carriers have had incentive to agree to such payments and interexchange carrier has made such payments22 the fcc stated its intention to address cmrs carriers requests to be placed on equal footing with wireline carriers in its intercarrier compensation proceeding the goal of which is to move toward unified compensation regime that eliminates the opportunity for arb itrage due to different regulatoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs11 23 in the matter of implementation of th local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of 1996 interconne ction between local exchange carriers and commercial mobile radio service providers cc docket 9698 and 95185 first report and order adopted on august 1 1996 and released on august 8 1996 at 1036 24 united states court of ppeals for the tenth circuit atlas telephone company et appeals from the united states district court for the western district of oklahoma dc 03cv347f march 10 2005 25 see for example in the matter of developing unified intercarrier compensation regime cc docket 0192 comments of ctia the wireless association submitted to the federal communications commission on december 7 2006treatment of different types of traffic but six years later the fcc still has not moved forward with that proceeding when first implementing the requi rement of the 1996 act the fcc determined that traffic to or from cmrs network that originates and terminates within the same mta major trading area is subject to the reciprocal compensation transport and termination rates under section 251b5 of the comm unications act as amended by the 1996 act rather than intersta and intrastate access charges23 since mtas often are very large sometimes call made by the customer of wireline local tele phone company to the customer of wireless carrier is intramta but must be routed over the network of an interexchange long distance carrier to reach the called party some originating wireline carriers have claimed that these calls should be treated as interexchange calls which would mean that the wireless carrier terminating the call would not be eligible for reciprocal compensation and as ex plained in the previous bullet also not able to impose access charges in one appeal of state regulatory commission decision24 the federal court based on and upholdi ng fcc decisions interpreting and implementing the 1996 act found that all intramta calls are subject to reciprocal compensation even if the call was transmitted over an interexchange carriers network the fcc howev er has never issued decision that directly addresses this dispute and there still are many local exchange carriers that maintain they do not have to pay reciprocal compensation on an intramta call if they hand off that call to an interexchange carrier there also appear to be unres olved differences of opinion among industry players about other interc onnection rules as they apply to wireless carriers25 for example local exchange carriers and wireline carriers disagree about what the lecs must do to meet their duty under section 251b3 of the communications act to provide dialing parity to co mpeting providers of telephone exchange service and telephone toll service and the duty to

articlesfeaturephantomtrafficidentifiabl ebutnothtml viewed on june 18 2008 the following discussion is based in part on the chnical explanation provided in this article 28 there are two primary categories of switc hes in the circuitswitched telephone networks that comprise the public switched lephone network tandem switches are hubs in companys network that receive traffic over large trunks from sources both internal to and external to the companys network and then reroute that traffic over trunks to the next destination which also can be either internal to or external to the companys network end office switches are the switches at the edge of the network that are used to route traffic to the companys customers premises all such providers to have nondiscriminatory access to telephone numbers with unreas onable dialing delays26 in the absence of definitive fcc ru lings on the terms and conditions for interconnection call data detailed that each company must provide to the terminating carrier and the rates for such termination companies will continue to have billing disputes that are difficult to resolve technical challenges even if the fcc were to rule definitively on the various companies rights and obligations with respect to interconnection rmination rates and the provision of call detail information however there s till would remain number of technical factors that make it difficult to identif the amount and source of traffic on each companys network and thus phantom traffic would continue to exist the current intercarrier compensation system which sets different termination rates for different types of calls places heavy burden on companies to construct maintain and keep current and interope rable the signaling and call detail data systems needed to communicate with other companies the information needed to identify and bill for calls in many case when the necessary call information is not available to bill terminating traffic the pr oblem is attributable to limitations in the systems of the originating intermediate or terminating company there are many challenges to construc ting maintaining and updating call detail systems and databases needed to identify calls and determine the appropriate rates the biggest problem is the complexity of interconnections used to carry traffic27 telephone calls frequently are routed over the networks of multiple companies and somewhere along that chain the call detail information may be accidentally or purposely lost or modified it is costprohibitive for long distance and wireless carriers to have direct trunks to every local telephone switch in geographic area and especially to the switches of sm all rural telephone co mpanies and other independent telephone companies that serve sparsely populated areas instead they usually have trunks that link their networks single point of presence in the area to large access tandem switch28 which most frequently is owned by the largest telephone company in the region for exam ple verizon att qwest or embarqhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs13 29 consider for example call made by wireless customer located in one end of the iowa wide mta to recipient who is customer of rural telephone company located at the other end of the same mta which qualifies as an intramta local call subject to low reciprocal compensation charges the most fficient way to route that call might be from the originating wireless carrier to long di stance company that is large enough to have facilities throughout the state and then to the tandem switch provider located near the terminating rural telephone company although by fcc rule this qualifies as local call subject to low reciprocal compensation termination charges from the perspective of the rural telephone company that call will look like an intrastate long distance call that should be subject to its intrastate access charges whic h are likely to be very high thus there often continuedbut may be owned by competitive local exchange carrier these access tandem switches provide centralized switching that aggregates and routes traffic between the various carriers in the region the long distance companies wireless companies rural telephone companies nd other independent telephone companies and clecs as result except where company ge nerates enough traffic to particular destination to justify direct trunk all of the traffic destined for particular telephone company end office interstate and intrasta long distance wireline traffic local and long distance wireless traffic local extended area service traffic between neighboring telephone compan ies traffic from clecs may be aggregated at an access tandem switch and put on single direct tr unk to that end office addressing and routing mechanisms are needed to deliver each call to the right point on the right network in order to reach the called party and to provide all the information necessary to identify the appropriate charge for terminating each call creating mechanisms that communicate across networks is challenge when different networks use very different ne twork architectures especially since many calls traverse several intermediate networks before reaching the terminating network for example the pstn employs addressing and routing mechanisms that rely on the information provided by the calling party s 10digit telephone num ber and the called partys 10digit telephone number in the past that provided sufficient information for the terminating carrier to determine how much to bill the originating carrier to terminate the call but today some customers are able to make voice calls using voip services that do not require telephone number which can make it difficult for traditional tele phone companie s to determine who to bill and what rate to bill for terminating call also the billing systems used by some wireline telephone companies are based on locational information that is not relevant for voice services such as wireless and some voip services that are not made from fixed locations even where the location of the calle d party and calling party is known the complexity of the current intercarrier compensation system imposes stiff burdens on billing systems for example the geog raphic boundary for what constitutes local call is different for calls originating on wireline network and calls originating on wireless network the areas considered to be local for wirelineoriginated calls known as local calling areas tend to be mu ch smaller than the areas considered to be local for wirelessoriginated calls known as intramajor trading areas or intramta this means that each companys signaling systems and databases must be able to associate each telephone numbe r with both the appropriate local calling area and appropriate mta in order to bill calls correctly29 unfortunately accordinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs14 29 continued is uncertainty about whether particular call s hould be treated as local or long distance for the purposes of determining the ch arge for terminating the call 30 see the discussion of jurisdictional inform ation parameters jip in

46to one industry source the jurisdictiona l information parameters jip currently encoded in most companies databases are not sufficient to do this and all the relevant parties wi reless carriers both large and small local telephone companies and clecs would have to significantly expand their jip databases to accomplish this30 given the complexity of creating maintaining and upgrading these databases and systems and the lack of incentive on the part of companie s unless required to do so to make upgrades that might not work to their benefit it is not surprising that there continue to be some system incapabilities across networks most companies have installed what is known as the ss7 signaling protocol which provides during the transmission of the call information on the calling party number the called party number and char ge number that depends on the type of call sometimes however as the call is transmitted from the originating carrier through intermediate carriers to the terminating carrier some of this call detail information is lost also some small rural companies have never deployed ss7 capability in addition for calls from mobile sources wireless or voip information on the calling and called lephone number does not provi information on the actual geographic location of the parties or the jip coded into the systems fail to take into account the different jurisdictiona l boundaries employed by wireless and wireline services as result other information often is needed for billing information can be provided after the call is completed through the exchange of records between companies for example although carri er may receive traffic over large trunk that carries lots of different types of traffic aggregated together from multiple sources the company that has aggregated that traffic often can provide information on which companies are responsible for orig inating which traffic the aggregating company and the terminating company mu st negotiate agreements about the collection and exchange of such informati on also in some situations companies negotiate payment factors based on traffic studies that are used to estimate the percentage of calls that are local vs interstate long distance vs intrastate long distance etc in order to determine wh at payment should be but rural telephone companies claim that originating and intermediate carriers often have provided data that are incomplete or inaccurate31 rural telephone companies are employing number of auditing capabilities for example drilling deeper into signaling data from ss7 billing records for data mining to verify and where appropriate challenge httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs15 32 see susana schwartz phantom traffic identifiable but not billable boss billing and oss world july 1 2005 available at httpwwwb illingworldcom articlesfeaturephantomtrafficidentifia blebutnothtml viewed on june 18 2008the provided data32 but these audits impose costs on the rural carriers who seek enforceable fcc rules requiring originating and intermediary companies to provide complete and accurate call detail data for billing one possible arbi trage scenario as explained earlier since many calls pass over multiple networks before reaching the terminating carrier there ar potential opportunities for the call detail data information that would identify call as one that is subject to high termination charges to be accidentally or purposely modified or removed also since there are very positive efficiencies from aggregating different types of calls that would be subject to different termination charges on single large trunk rather than requiring companies to use different trunk for each type of call intermedia carriers have the strong incentive to mix different types of traffic from number of different sources on single trunk but that can facilitate misidentifying the s ource or type of traffic in fashion that allows them to pay lower termination rate an originating long distance carrier is not likely to have direct trunks to every small rural telephone company since it doe s not send enough traffic to those small companies to justify the investment in ch trunks rather long distance carrier with traffic to the customers of small rural company is likely to route that traffic to larger local telephone company located near the small rural company for that intermediate company to aggregate the traffic with other traffic bound for the customers of the small rural company since the originating carriers traffic is long distance traffic the rural company would be eligible to receive access charges which tend to be high for terminating that traffic in contrast the small rural company could only charge reciprocal compensation which is lower than access charges for the termination of local traffic that originates on and is passed from the larger local telephone company to the small rural carrier the originating long distance company and the larger aggregating carrier might find it in their selfinterest to perform arbitrage in the following fashion the aggregating carrier would charge the long distance carrier termination fee that is higher than the rural carriers reciprocal compensation fee and lower than the rural carriers access charge to terminate the traffic at the aggregators network the aggregator would strip off the call detail information from that long distance traffic so that it appears to be local traffic that originated on its own network and then send the traffic to the rural carrier to terminate with the aggregator paying reciprocal compensation to the rural company for terminating the local traffic in practice this might not require the originating or aggregating carrier to actually strip information from the call detail signal that accompanies that call it might simply require these companies not to take all the affirmative steps necessary to ensure that the information needed for billing is passed through the chain of networks from the originating network to the terminating network httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs16 33 statement by raymond henagan general manager rock port telep hone company before the senate committee on commerce science and transportation hearing on phantom traffic april 23 2008 at p3 phantom traffic and rural telephone companies phantom traffic is more serious probl em for small rural telephone companies than for other telephone companies for three interrelated reasons first as discussed earlier it tends to be more difficult to identify the originating company and the rate to be assessed for terminating call if that call has passed over multiple networks or if that call has been ggregated with all types of traffic since rural telephone companies tend to be locat ed at the edge of the public switched network disproportionately large share of their incoming calls pass over multiple networks also since rural telephone companies tend to receive little incoming traffic of any specific type or from any sp ecific company disproportionate share of their incoming calls tend to be aggregated with different types and sources of traffic thus rural telephone compan ies tend to have more in coming telephone calls for which it is difficult to identify the source and type of call for purposes of billing termination charges second the revenues generated from access charges and other forms of compensation for terminating calls that originate outside the local companys network represent far greater share of total revenues for small rural companies than for larger wireline and wire less telephone companies th erefore the loss of revenues due to the inability to identify the source of calls will have larger financial impact on rural carriers than on other carriers one small telephone operator recently told congress that neca the national exchan ge carriers association the organization that administers the fccs access charge pl an for small rural telephone companies has estimated that small rura l carriers across the nation typically receive about 29 of their total net telephone company operating revenues from intercarrier payments33 third although the cost for carrier to terminate call does not vary or varies only very slightly by the type of call the access charges set by the rural telephone companies for terminating cer tain types of tele phone calls tend to be both very high in absolute terms and lot higher than the charge for terminating other types of calls this partly reflects the higher costs associ ated with serving sparsely populated rural areas but also reflects the decision of the fcc and state regulatory commissions to allow access charges that exceed underlying co sts in order to keep the rates for local service low but these high access charges create strong incentive for the wireline and wireless carriers that originate those calls to avoid full payment by failing to provide all the information needed to identif the source of the call or by masking the type of call and making it look like local call or an interstate callhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs17 34 it is likely that under any comprehensive reform plan highcost carriers such as rural carriers serving sparsely populated geographi c areas would continue to have higher termination charges than lowercost carriers to reflect those higher costs but for any individual carrier its termination charges would be the same or similar for all sources and types of traffic also because intercarrier compensation revenues currently represent far higher portion of rural carriers total revenues than of nonrural carriers total revenues the transition to the same termination rates for all traffic likely would be longer for rural carriers than for nonrural carriersissues and proposals comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform vs measures specific to phantom traffic as discussed earlier there are three interrelated factors that foster phantom traffic under the current intercarrier compensation system charges for the termination of voice traffic vary significantly depending on the source and type of call creating strong incentive for originating carriers to mask traffic that is subject to high termination rates for certain types of calls the f cc has not yet adopted definitive rules about the interconnection rights and obligations of originating and terminating carriers the call detail information that must be provided by the interconnecting companies to identify the source and type of traffic andor the rate s to be charged by companies for terminating calls originated by customers of other companies thus fostering billing disputes among carriers given the significant differences in network architectures and the multiplicity of terminating charges for different types of calls the signaling and call detail syst ems of many companies cannot accommodate the complex routing of some calls often resulting in terminating carriers not receiving all the call detail information needed to bill for termination from public policy perspective there are two general approaches to the issue of phantom traffic it can be addressed broadly as symptom and consequence of an inconsistent and incomplete intercarrier compensation system that has created incentives for companies to mask the type of traffic their customers generate in order to pay lower termination charges unde r this approach phantom traffic would be addressed in the context of comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform process that explicitly identifies the rights and obligations of all service and network providers and sets up transitional steps leading to the same or similar costbased rates for the termination of all types of traffic by date certain34 alternatively phantom traffic can be addressed narrowly as unique billing problem created by the lack of call detail information needed to identify and bill specific calls under this approach it would be addressed through the implementation of narrowly focused rules that sethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs18 35 in the matter of developing unified intercarrier compensation regime cc docket 0192 exparte brief of the intercarri er compensation forum in support of the intercarrier compensation and universal reform plan submitted october 5 2004 36 see for example cheryl bolen missoula intercarrier payment plan filed at fcc in hopes of public comment bna inc daily report for executives july 25 2006requirements for companies to provide sp ecific call detail information and perhaps prohibit activities that could make it more difficult to identify and bill calls each approach has advantag and disadvantages comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform is likely to require three concurrent actions rate restructuring to move toward uniform ter mination rates for all sources and types of traffic the creation of explicit and co mpetitively neutral ne twork interconnection rules that set out the technical and financial rights and ob ligations of all the parties and allow diverse networks to interconnect efficiently with one another and the creation of new explicit universal servi ce support mechanisms to replace the implicit support in those intercarrier compensation rates that currently are set above cost such comprehensive reform is likely to reduce phantom traffic by eliminating incentives for carriers to mask the source and type of traffic they generate but given the potential impact of comprehensive refo rm on both providers and consumers it will not be easy to accomplish although the fcc has had open proceedings to address such reform throughout this decade to date intercarrier compensation issues have only been addressed on piecemeal ba sis and many inconsistencies and gaps remain in 2004 the intercarrier compensation forum group of carriers from different segments of the telecommunicat ions industry submitted to the fcc proposal for comprehensive reform35 the commission formally sought public comment on the proposal but there was nough criticism of the proposal that the fcc did not use it as the basis or even as starting point for developing and adopting its own rules two years later the national association of regulatory utility commissioners task force on intercarrier compensation developed comprehensive intercarrier compensati on reform proposal known as the missoula plan that it filed at the fcc on july 24 200636 number of early participants in the development of the plan left the pro cess and ultimately the primary industry sponsors of the plan were att bellsout h cingular and hundreds of small rural telephone companies the fcc also sought comment on this proposal but again did not use it as the basis or the starting point for developing and adopting its own rules the continued lack of comprehensive framework for intercarrier compensation has had significant conseque nces and generated certain unhealthy market symptoms one of which is the growth of phantom tra ffic other consequen ces include distorted investment decisions and uneconomic arbitrage motivated by the existing intercarrier compensation rules rather than by underl ying cost and demand conditions harm to efficient competition as some providers are artificially favored and others are artificially disadvantaged by the inconsiste nt rules and forced carrier expenditures of millions of dollars and scarce inform ation technology resources to develop systems to identify measure monitor bill reconcile audit and dispute the classification of traffichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs19 there would be several be nefits from addressing pha ntom traffic within the context of comprehensive intercarrier comp ensation reform crea tion of consistent rate structure and similar rate levels for the termination charges on all calls would significantly reduce the incentive for companies to mask the source or type of traffic they generate because such activity would longer yield lower termination charges would reduce the amount of call detail information needed to bill calls and thus reduce the costs of all companies to construct maintain and update databases for example if it were not necessary to maintain databases capable of determining whether call was local or interexchange intramta or intermta etc the complexity of coding the necessary information into the call databases would be s ubstantially decreased would reduce the depth of traffic auditing that carriers had to perform in order to ensure that they were receiving proper payment for terminating calls carriers still might want to perform audits to ensure originating and transiting carriers fully report the total volume of calls they generate but it would longer be necessary to perform the level of data mining required to determine the source and type of calls trav ersing their networks in addition removing the implicit universal service support incorporated into above cost access charges would meet the requirement in section 254e of the 1996 act that any universal service support be explicit but there also are disadvantages of addressing phantom traffic through comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform as explained above it is very di fficult to accomplish comprehensive reform parties that benefit financially or competitively from the current intercarrier compensation system will not have an incentive to support change unless they recei ve countervailing be nefits thus tying resolution of the phantom traffic issue to comprehensive intercarrier compensation refo rm could slow down relief from phantom traffic as demonstrated by the inability of the industry and the fcc to accomplish such comprehensive reform this past decade many of the current differences in termination rates represent explicit public policy decisions at the federal and state level to keep termination charges artificially high or low in order to foster other public policy objectives such as maintaining affordable rates for rural local telephone service or foster ing enhanced services if these continue to be public policy obj ectives then rationalization of intercarrier compensation rates would have to be accompanied by efforts to support those other obj ectives for example through creation of an explicit source of uni versal service funding to replacehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs20 37 see crs report rl33979 universal

amended at 47 usc 251 and 252the implicit support currently r eceived from abovecost access charges but there already is concern that the federal universal service fund has grown too larg and there would be resistance from some parties to expanding it to replace the implicit subsidies currently in access charges37 intercarrier compensation rates for intrastate wireline services are within the jurisdiction of state regulatory commissions and thus comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform at the federal level might not be able to address intrastate access charges which tend to be the termination rates that most exceed cost thus unless the reform process includes the active participation and support of state jurisdictions it may not be able to resolve some of the problems underlying phantom traffic section 253 of the 1996 act38 however allows the fcc to preempt state statutes or regulations that are barriers to entry into the provisi on of interstate or intrastate telecommunications service and t hus potentially could be used as the basis for the fcc to modify intrastate intercarrier compensation rates as part of comprehensive re form if the absence of reform can be shown to harm competition measures specific to phantom traffic the alternative approach is to focus narrowly on traffic that is not adequately identified and therefore makes appropriate billing for that traffic difficult or impossible by enacting laws or adopting fcc rules intended to improve identif ication of the source and type of calls and by increasing fcc enforcement of its rules most trade associations and many industry parties have made specific pr oposals andor critiqued the proposals of others representative sample of which are presented here the national exchange carrier associ ation neca the organization that administers the fccs access charge plan for small rural tele phone companies has petitioned the fcc to modify its signaling requirements and to take other actions to address phantom traffic issues39 neca claims that sma ll rural carriers cannot rely upon the process enacted in sections 251 and 252 of the 1996 act40 which allows local exchange carrier

bargaining position and are constrained fro m taking advantage of the arbitration option by the costs of pursuing arbitration instead neca proposes that the fcc impose strict requirements on originating carriers specifically it proposes that the fcc extend its call signaling rules to all interconnected voice service providers require that accurate and unalte red calling party number cpn

numbers as fallback rule to determine the call jurisdiction that is intrastate or interstate local or long dist ance absent actual geographic data or negotiated agreement ustelecom the largest industry trade ssociation with membership that spans broader range of wireline carriers also has multipronged proposal41 with some elements similar to those of the neca proposal specifically ustelecom proposes that the fcc apply the following obligations on all traffic originating on or terminating to the public switched telephone ne twork including traffic originating on other networks every originating provider must transmit in its signaling where feasible with its network technol ogy deployed at the time the call was originated the telephone numbe r received from or assigned to the calling party every provider must transmit w ithout alte ration excep t where not feasible with network technology deployed at the time the call was originated or where pstn indus try standards would dictate otherwise the telephone number in formation that it receives from another provider in signaling it should be deemed an unreasonabl practice for provider to route traffic for the purpose of disguisi ng the identify of the financially responsible provider or the tra ffics originating jurisdiction the initiating carrier must perform local number portability query that would identify who the called party is in order to deliver thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs22 42 this is needed because the telephone numbe r itself does not identify the called partys carrier since customers can change carriers but retain their telephone number if the initiating carrier does not perform local number portability query the call may be routed to the called partys previous carrier and then have to be rerouted with the possibility that some of the call detail informa tion needed for billing is lost 43 see testimony of lawrence sarjeant vice president for federal legislative and regulatory affairs qwest before the nate committee on commerce science and transportation hearing on phanto m traffic april 23 2008 at p 6 44 see for example the testimony of ange simpson director of government affairs covad communications and president of the von coalition on behalf of the von coalition before the committee on commerce science and transportation hearing on phantom traffic april 23 2008call to the tandem switch serving the carrier to whom the called party subscribes42 the fcc should provide incumbent local exchange carriers the ability to invoke the negotiation and arbitration procedures set forth in sections 251 and 252 of the 1996 act the fcc should commit to aggressively enforce these rules and obligations the primary difference in these two propos als is that ustelecom would have the fcc explicitly take into account the capabilities and limitations of the network technology currently deployed when settin g requirements ustelecom also would rely on the negotiation and arbitration provisions in the 1996 act to obtain the signaling and call detail information needed for intercarrier billing qwest claims that comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform is the only true and complete solution to the phantom traffic problem43 it states that the fcc could address phantom traffi c on an interim basis however by 1 reinforcing that the 1996 act requires and enab all types of service providers to enter into agreements for the exchange of traffic and 2 expanding the scope of fcc rules requiring the passage of information nece ssary for accurate billing this approach appears to be similar to that of ustelecom qwest claims the fccs call signaling rules were targeted to narrow subset of traffic interstate traffic using the most common traditional pstn signaling protocol and do not cover voiporiginated calls that terminate on the pstn the voice on the net or von coalition representing the voip industry has very different take on phant omtraffic speci fic proposals44 it claims the fcc already has rules about the ca ll detail information to be provide d for call that is generated and exchanged specifically that carriers that utilize ss7 signaling already are required to transmit the calling party number associated with an interstate call to interconnecting carriers and those rules simply must be enforced it claims some of the blame for phantom traffic falls on incumbent local exchange carriers that have not updated their networks to accommoda ss7 the von coalition could support requirement that where technically and operationally feasible with the networkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs23 45 see for example in the matter of d eveloping unified interc arrier compensation regime dd docket 0192 comments of ctia the wireless association december 7 2006 46 see the written testimony of charles w mck ee director of government affairs sprint nextel corporation before the senate committee on commerce science and transportation hearing on phantom traffic april 23 2008technology deployed at the time the call was originated the originating provider transmit the telephone number r eceived from or assigned to the calling party the requirement would not apply however wher telephone number is assigned to the calling party the von coalition opposes an new obligations to generate call identifying information where such inform ation does not generate organically the von coalition strongly opposes any blocking of voip calls by terminating carriers ctia the wireless associa tion generally supports pr oposed rules detailing the responsibilities of carriers exchanging traffi c to deliver signaling and call identifying information to tandem providers and terminating carriers to facilitate the creation of accurate billing records and identification of the parties responsible for payment45 it does not oppose an obligation on carriers to transmit call originating information pursuant to relevant commi ssion rules and industry sta ndards but does not support mandating any requirements that the indus try standards groups have not mandated for example some of the fields in the ss7 databases are set aside for jurisdictional information parameters but it is not ma ndatory under current industry standards to populate these fields with call detail data since such data often will not identify the jurisdiction of wireless call ctia opposes mandatory population of the jip fields ctia supports imposing an obligation on tandem transit provide rs or any other provider in the transmission chain to pass along all call origination information received from the originating carrier or subsequent carrier in the chain without alteration it opposes requiring carriers to make costly investme nt to enable last generation equipment to make jurisdictional distinctions between categories of traffic while the fcc is considering whether to eliminate those jurisdictional distinctions sprint does not believe the specific issue of phantom traffic warrants legislation46 it would oppose any legislation or rule requiring that the called and calling party numbers always be used to determine the jurisdiction or rate applicable to call for billing purposes because such rule would fly in the face of the trend toward mobile calling using wireless and voip technologies it also would oppose any legislation or rule that required carriers to reengineer their network architecture in an inefficient and costly manner for example by requiring carriers to segregate different types of traffic onto separate facilitie s or to require direct connectivity between carriers according to sprint restrictions on traffic aggregation would undermine scale economies and raise costs imposing inefficiency and unnecessary investment burdens on many companies all the phantom trafficspecific propos als are intended to improve the quality of call detail information available to terminating carriers but they could have several drawbacks httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs24 placing responsibility nd liability on in termediate carriers might not be appropriate when it is the originating companies that have failed to provide the call data needed for billing given the differences in network architectures the fcc would face difficult task in determining what call detail information is needed and which set of carriers would ve the obligation to update their signaling and call detail database capabilities for example the traditional wireline companies billing databases typically rely on the locationspecific information provided by 10digit telephone numbers to determine termination rates but the wireless and voip providers offer services that are not geographically fixed and often do not include jurisdictional information parameters in their databases the fcc would have to determine the extent to which the burden of making their syst ems compatible should fall on the wireline carriers or the wireless and voip carriers this would be less difficult and contentious regulatory task if comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform significantly reduced the amount of call detail data needed for billing more generally focusing solely on the quality of call detail information available to terminating carriers would not reduce the need for all voice providers to deve lop and maintain highly complex signaling and call detail systems narrowly focused solutions that do not address the large differentials in termination rates would not eliminate the incentives of originating and transiting carriers to mask the source or type of traffic if that would allow them to pay lower termination charges though they would make it more difficu lt to perform arbitrage comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform is most likely to be achieved if all of the interested parties have something to gain as well as something to sacrifice from compromise package since phantom traffic represents the one aspect of intercarrier compensation of most concern to the rural telephone companies if their most important need was met by piecemeal solution they might longer have the incentive to support comprehensive reform thus undermining that effort one legislative proposal s 2919 although to date the public policy debate on how to re solve phantom traffic has primarily occurred at the fcc state regu latory commissions and industry forums it is now reaching congress as some parties are seeking federal legislative solution one piece of legislation has been introdu ced s 2919 the signaling modernization act of 2008 introduced on april 24 2008 by senator stevens focuses relatively narrowly on improving the quality of call detail information available to terminating carriers but explicitly takes into account the technical limitations of the signaling equipment currently used in the industry it applies to voice communications servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs25 47 ipenabled voice service is defined in the bill as the provision of realtime twoway voice communications offered to the public or such classes of users to be effectively available to the public transmitted through customer premises equipment using internet protocol or successor protocol with twowa transmission capability such that the service can originate traffic to and terminate traffi c from the public switched telephone networkproviders where voice communi cations service means telecommunications service or ipenabled voice service47 section 2 of the bill would amend title vii of the communications act by adding new section 715 network traffi c identification accountability standards that delineates duties of voice communications service providers section 3 of the bill would require the fcc to establish rules and enforcement provisions to implement the requirements of section 715 within 12 months of enactment there are three key provisions in these sections voice communications service provi der shall ensure that all voice communications service traffic that originates on its network contains the signaling information reasonably needed to facilitate intercarrier billing in accordance with industry standards as determined by the commission further except as otherwise permitted by the commission provider that transports or transits traffic between voice communications service providers sh all forward without altering the signaling information it receives from another provider that is reasonably needed to facilitate intercarrier billing in accordance with industry standards in determining the signaling information that is reasonably needed to facilitate intercarrier billing the commission shall consider at minimum 1 industry standards regarding the transmission of call detail information 2 the technical limitations of signaling equipment used in the industry and 3 the costs and resources required to modify equipment or procedures to accommodate any changes from industry standards the incorporation of the phrase signa ling information reasonably needed to facilitate intercarrier billing in all thr ee provisions provides the fcc with guidance but also with great latitude the additional instruction for the fcc to consider industry standards the technical limitations of existing signaling equipment and the costs of modifying equipment and procedur also provides guidance without taking away fcc discretion since it does not tell the fcc how to weigh these factors consider for example how the legisla tive language might be applied to two different situations that exist today i ndustry standards have l ong incorporated the ss7 signaling system and almost all carrier s have deployed that system it would appear that the fcc could use the lang uage in s 2919 to require those few companies that have not yet deployed ss7 to do so on the other hand althoughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34550crs26 48 see susana schwartz

2008most companies encode jurisdictional information parameters into their routing and billing databases current pr actice varies widely across technologies what is standard practice in one industry segment may not be standard practice in another segment wireline carriers incorporate certain jip locational data that many wireless and voip providers do not and many wirelin carriers do not encode

generally alt hough the industry standards bodies are open to all companies in the industry new entr ants particularly those deploying new technologies are likely to be underrepres ented initially the fcc therefore might have to determine how closely to abide by industry standards that new entrants do not consider appropriate to thei r network architectures or business plans this will require the expert agency to exercise its judgment one notable aspect of s 2919 is that it attempts to minimize its intrusion into companies network architecture and inve stment decisions notably it would not restrict companies from exploiting economies of scale by prohibiting the aggregation of different sources or types of calls on particular trunks s 2919 has some aspects common to proposals that focus narrowly on the availability of call tail data needed for accurate b illing it does not address the multiplicity of termination charges currently in effect and therefore would not remove the incentive of originating and transiting companies to mask the source or type of traffic they originate in order to try to avoid termination costs nor does it reduce the need for companies to invest in very complex signaling and call data information systems some observers may argue that its enactment might erode support by rural telephone companies for comprehensiv intercarrier compensation reform
