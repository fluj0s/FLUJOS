6212c11 shspec223 phantom rock slam the phantom rock slam is special manifestation of r212 this is not rare manifestation and it causes trouble there is rule about this you mustnt grab rock slams from ruds get them from r212 or case records eg old sec checks list ones the phantom slam will attach itself to various terminals and anything and everything in rudiments you can wind up with this peculiar phenomenon opposing something that isnt rockslamming item when this happens in r212 you may get rock slam in the oppose list but it will be cyclic proposition the rock slam becomes dirty needle becomes clean needle every two or three pages this cycle never ends the list is unnullable this phenomenon is peculiar to the opposition list you could make this happen by taking list of unreading items and insisting that the pc oppose one of them the pc will go ahead and do it but the list is unnullable in r212 it is an enemy that is helping the pc ie scientology an auditor etc anything from list one that the pc rock slams on therefore the pc cant accept the help the enemy is right here and now in this session list one is also right here and now it is what is being used on the pc auditors emeters sessions etc if list one isnt used these things are never located the most crude manifestation of failure to locate rockslamming items to oppose is the phantom slam which comes and goes you will only get dead horses doing lists from other sources if the pc is on record as having slammed on list one but you cant turn on the rock slam now tiger drill three or four main points of the list until one ticks then go ahead and oppose it it will turn on continuing rock slam and get you reliable item the case that slams on this and that is the puzzler it confuses the auditor you eventually realize that the rock slam has nothing to do with what you are listing or nulling it turns on incidentally it will turn on more powerfully on heavily charged list that has some rock slams on it anyhow the phantom rock slam is generated by some tiny withhold and not by some item on the list the test of the phantom rock slam is do you get one rock slam in nulling that stays in or does the pc rockslam on ruds or midruds especially since big midruds the latter is more powerful rudiments action than is in regular model session if you see rock slam turn on during ruds action with timelimiter like since your last session you have phantom rock slam sometimes the pc graduates upstairs to having phantom rock slam as his case unburdens the rock slam can be absent at first then it develops first into tame rock slam then gets frantic then cools off again as the case unburdens then when you hit the item it is there again in force and blows the rock slam tends to stay the same size but it changes speed phantom rock slam is any slam that turns on in ruds or general ow it is caused by any withhold the pc has from you or the remainder of the dynamics every now and then you will be fixing up someones line plot done in coaudit or something and out of twentyfour packages only one will rock slam you may think well the charge is blown it was phantom slam all the way fortunately there is solution phantom rock slam is turned on by something in the immediate instant pt of the session it is turned on by something immediately in or in the vicinity of the session something right here it is not fight with the d of p because he is down the hall the way you smoke one out is to get every possible element of which the session consists with the pcs help you make special list which must include every part of the pc his name myself badges symbols tables etc cf the expanded dianetics present time environment list with this list you will get the ptp that is right present in the session the phantom slam will show up on the list the pc wont help much because since he slams on the item he cant see it he has overts on what it will be so he cant perceive it so you may have to suggest some items the majority of items will probably be first dynamic items the item could be but it could translate as my mind or some such thing but as you continued to get more and more packages the item would gradually change in character eg to include more dynamics the rock slam gets gradiently more sudden and more constant finally the pc could just blurt out the item the only test of whether you have found the source of the rock slam is that the rock slam doesnt recur so you cant tell for several sessions whether you have got it so the phantom rock slam item is an even more immediate version of the list one items it is something so much in pt and so disturbing to the pc that it is total ptp very screaming one because it is so close to the session this ptp blocks him from getting gains it was in 1956 or so when lrh isolated the ptp as that which prevents case gain the gpm was discovered via the ptp the closer to auditing and pt the ptp is the less gains are obtained from auditing that is why list one is cure note that we include other dynamics besides the first dynamic in list one there are other dynamics in pt you can point at the pc and say or point at yourself and say we to get the point across ordinarily careful attention to list one will get the phantom slam and clean it up so the proper procedure is 1 complete running list one 2 make session list one if you run into phantom rock slam after completing list one and cleared up all the slams on it what you should do is to go over with the pc all the parts of the session so you can locate the insession rockslamming item keep your eye on the meter so that you can steer him and pick up something he thinks of that turns on slam 3 just go on finding reliable items do this to the best of your ability dont buy anything that doesnt stay in pretty well and make lists long enough to be complete get your packages difficult though this may be you will see the slam turn on more frequently and get progressively less frantic until one day the pc volunteers the item which slams beautifully and can be opposed 4 pick up all past incomplete or dead horse lists go back to all those lists that appeared to give lots of bonus packages and ris now you will be able to find some ris r212 should have positive result everything shouldnt just go up in smoke here is another point you can represent massless things ideas conditions etc and you will get nice massy rockslamming items but if you oppose significances you can get in trouble if significance rockslams you do oppose it but you are actually opposing nothing an idea so get the item the identity that opposes the significance eg mouse could oppose attack then oppose the item you got eg mouse right back to get second solid item eg cat with which to make up package otherwise you dont have two terminals this is the original 3dxx list long enough on the oppose list to the significance to get the item you can have package consisting of significance opposing significance but it is not much of gpm package significances easily go blank so the rock slam can wash out doing the oppose list the rock slam isnt really gone it is just submerged complete the list with mass when you have the item opposing the significance see if it has pain or sensation connected with it so you know which way to oppose it then oppose it and get the other mass rule if the list is nullable and rockslamming you can find juicy item on it list can be nullable and still incomplete dont use invalidated items for anything if the pc is invalidating the items that he is giving you yes thats valid test but dont use the invalidate button for other purposes than to clean off real inval dont use it to keep from having to complete the list pcs may try to get out of completing lists by invalidating items just go on and get the item after you have finished nulling the list or checking midruds sometimes pc cant give you more items until you have finished nulling the list the basics of auditing cover most of the difficulty person will have the danger of r212 is that the auditor can get result that he and the pc are happy with without doing it right and getting all the available gain the residual gain is 1000 worth
