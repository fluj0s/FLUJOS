education officials criticized the program many argued that authorizing the secretary to determine what was deemed rigorous significantly expanded the federal role in high school curriculum and policymaking in addition to this issue many supporters of alterna tive education programs such as vocational education programs and hom eschooling were opposed to any program eligibility criteria that would disqualify these students simply because the secretary did not recognize the program as being rigorous the following section presents brief analysis of each of these issues expanding the federal role there has been considerable concern expressed regarding the possible expansi on of the federal role in high schoolhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33457crs5 13 see anne k walters and stephen burd

full text of the letter see httpwwwifapedgovdpclettersattachments gen0608attachpdfcurriculum and policymaking13 specifically many policymakers and education officials have expressed concern about the secretarys authority to recognize rigorous secondary school curriculum many po licy groups contend that allowing the secretary to determine what constitutes rigor is essentially granting the federal government the authority to evaluate the curricular decisions of state and local officials14 several governors reportedly responded by writing letter to the secretary expressing their support for th new program however they cautioned the secretary against overextending the federal role governors will be concerned if any regulations or attempts are made to federalize hi ghschool curricula including the creation of federal definition of rigor15 in response to concerns about the program representative bo ehner and senator enzi wrote letter to secretary spellings stating some concern has arisen that this in itiative will allow the secretary to become involved in establishing high school curriculum we want to be very clear this was neither the intention nor the effect of the language in this bill the secretarys only role in this process is to recognize that states or local educational agencies or other schools including private charter and home schools have in fact established what th ey consider to be rigorous coursework requirement not only does the language in this bill not give the secretary any authority to establish curriculum we ssert that federal law prohibits this16 section 103 of the department of ducation organization act specifically prohibits the secretary from exercising direction superv ision or control over the curriculum of any educational institution school or school system as previously discussed in the dear colleague lette r dated may 2 2006 the secretary issued guidance stating that she has intention of determining what constitutes rigorous high school program in recognizing thes programs i will respect the authority of each individual state to set graduation re quirements and i will follow the laws directive prohibiting the department from mandating directing or controlling state or local curricula programs of instru ction academic achievement standards or assessments i will conduct thorough and transparent revi ew and will be consulting with external stakeholders to aid in this process17 alternative education programs many supporters of alternative education programs such as vocational education concurrent enrollment and home schooling are apprehensive about the po licy guidance being developed for the ac grant program most of the concern stem s from these programs being viewed as non rigorous because they are alternatives to traditional high school curriculumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33457crs6 18 concurrent enrollment programs are also fre quently referred to as dual enrollment andor dual credit programs 19 for additional information about concurrent enrollment programs see crs report rs21898 concurrent enrollment programs by charmaine mercer 20 the full text of the letter is available at

program guidance does not appear to disqualify students who pursue either vocational education or those who are hom eschooled from being eligible for an ac grant as long as they complete the cour work for an advanced or honors diploma or pursue one of the options previously di scussed students who live in state that does not offer an advanced or honors di ploma program and doe s not participate in the ssi program or who do not complete ither ap or ib cour ses and the respective exam could demonstrate th eir completion of rigorous secondary school program by completing set of courses that are comparable to the ssi program to become eligible to receive the ac grant concurrent enrollment programs concurrent enrollment programs are programs that enable high schoolaged st udents who have not received high school diploma to take collegelevel courses and receive college credit18 in many of these programs the students are also enrolled in high school and seeking high school diploma thus the phrase concurrent enrollment19 the eligibility criteria for the ac grant program do not permit students who have previously enrolled in an undergraduate program to receive grant thus under the guidance issued students who are concurrently enrolled in both hi gh school and college program may not be eligible for an ac grant however s upporters of these programs including the national governors asso ciation nga disagree with th is interpretation of the act they maintain that the purpose of the ac grant program is to encourage students to pursue rigorous courses that prepare them for college which is the same purpose of concurrent enrollment programs in letter to the secretary the nga wrote governors are deeply concerned that th us department of education has indicated that for legal reasons dual rollees or dual credit students will not be eligible for ac grants this interpretation is contradictory and inconsistent with the basic intent of the program dual enrollees are public private or home school high school students who are pursuing rigorous secondary program of study while obtaining collegelevel cred it that also counts towards high school graduation dual enrollment programs offer students an opportunity to pursue challenging courses that may not be ava ilable at their high school or for those without access to advanced placement or international baccalaureate courses lastly many dual enrollees do not pay tuition to the institution of higher education nor are these students enrolled in program of undergraduate education or degree granting

rigorous secondary program that will prepare them for college in addition it should also contain evidence that state uni versity in the states system will consider students collegeready if they complete the prog ram finally the program must be reviewed by the governor state educational agency nd other higher education officials states desiring to submit plans for the 20072008 award year should submit plans to the secretary later than nov 1 2006eligible for an ac grant21 because concurrent enrollme nt programs are diverse in their makeup it appears as though concurrent enrollment programs that do not require students to be admitted into postsec ondary academic program could be recognized as rigorous programs the guid ance issued by the secretary indicated that if state wanted to establish an alternative rigorous program to be recognized by the secretary the program needed to be submitted by june 1 2006 for the 2006 2007 award year22
