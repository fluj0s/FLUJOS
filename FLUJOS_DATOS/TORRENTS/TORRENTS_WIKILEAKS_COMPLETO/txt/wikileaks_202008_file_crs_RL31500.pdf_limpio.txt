labor relations adverse ac tions and appeals chapters of title 5 united states code will remain covered by those provisions unless and until dhs and opm jointly exercise their authority to waive those title 5 provisions and establish alternative rules the jo int dhsopm authority to establish new systems for dhs generally does not reach to provisions of law outside title 5 in some cases however laws

quick implementation creating new culture and adjusting over time are critical areas to be considered in implementing mergers in the public sector with regard to changing an organizations culture he writes that breaking free from existing routines traditions and customs does not mean obliterating everything and starting anew instead it requires the selective adoption of those cultural artifacts
