issues april 29 2005 jon d klaus national defense fellow foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress strategic mobility innovation options and oversight issues summary since the george w bush administration announced its proposal to reduce the us military overseas basing posture strategic mobility has been the topic of many policy discussions the administrations identification of transformation as major goal for the department of defense dod technological advances the quadrennial defense review qdr deployment goals and antiaccess issues also have relevance with regard to the topic of strategic mobility the issue for the 109th congress is to determine which investments should be pursued today to develop strategic mobility platforms to meet tomorrows national security strategy requirements several studies pertain to strategic mobility innovation these studies include the dods mobility requirements study for 2005 the department of armys advanced mobility concepts study amcs the institute of defense analyses assessment of the amcs defense science board dsb mobility study and the dods transformation planning guidance these studies along with current us strategic mobility inventories and strategic mobility funding trends all pertain to the discussion they examine issues such as dods milliontonmile per day requirement future mobility concepts and feasibilities the importance of decreasing the services deployment footprint transformation roadmaps the dods current strategic mobility inventories and airliftsealift future funding trends research identifies at least 11 potential strategic mobility platforms which include four sealift vehicles and seven airlift vehicles the four sealift vehicles assessed in this report are the shallowdraft high speed sealift the fast sealift monohull the navy vision trimaran high speed sealift and the navy vision surface effect ship high speed sealift the seven airlift vehicles assessed are the global range transport the supershort takeoff and landing aircraft spiral development of the c17 payloadrange expansion program the ultralarge airlifter unmanned aerial vehicles the winginground effect aircraft and seaplanes strategic mobility innovation raises potential oversight questions for congress in the following areas 1 does congress have sufficient information about the dods plans for lift and potential lift platforms to adequately assess investment options 2 to what degree if any should government funding be used to develop new lift platforms 3 what mix of lift platforms might be appropriate to both meet future us commercial lift needs and potentially assist in meeting future military strategic lift requirements 4 should any of these lift platforms be developed and procured in part to support the defense industrial base 5 should procurement of airliftsealift be expanded beyond current dod plans and if so by how much and with what platforms contents introduction 1 issue for congress 1 factors affecting strategic mobility innovation 1 organization of the report 3 studies and background literature 3 mobility requirements

12 table 2 summary of potential strategic mobility platforms 33 strategic mobility innovation options and oversight issues introduction issue for congress with the george w bush administration proposing reduction in the us military overseas basing posture and also identifying transformation as major goal for the department of defense dod the need to rapidly transport us military forces from one location to another has appeared to increase in importance consequently congress may opt to consider what the future holds in the area of strategic mobility innovation central issue for the 109th congress is the determination of which investments should be pursued today to develop strategic mobility platforms to meet tomorrows national security strategy requirements congressional decisions concerning this issue could have significant implications for future us military capabilities dod funding requirements the defense industrial base and future congressional oversight of dod activities this report will examine strategic mobility innovation in airlift and sealift used to transport cargo and personnel between theaters of operation intertheater factors affecting strategic mobility innovation one factor affecting strategic mobility innovation is the august 16 2004 proposal by the bush administration to significantly alter the us military overseas basing posture the proposal if implemented would establish new overseas operating sites and transfer up to 70000 us troops plus 100000 family members and civilians from europe and asia back to the united states the administration believes that the current basing arrangements are not optimal for responding to future military challenges1 many analysts believe that this change in global posture may increase the need for additional strategic airlift and highspeed sealift on september 23 2004 the us european command chief marine corps general james jones testified to congress that building larger array of airlift and sealift platforms is an essential component of the sweeping overhaul that would if approved 1 see also crs report rs21975 us military overseas basing background and oversight issues for congress by jon d klaus crs2 position us forces at number of small dispersed bases across the european region2 second factor affecting strategic mobility innovation is defense transformation soon after taking office the george w bush administration identified transformation as major goal for the department of defense dod since then the dod the office of force transformation oft and the services have addressed the transformation process some observers have emphasized that improving the strategic transportation of us troops and cargo is an integral part of this transformation process part of the navy and marines transformation plans include new shipdeployment approaches called sea swap and sea basing these concepts call for longduration forward deployments with crew rotations3 some analysts have noted that these crew rotations will rely on strategic mobility for their success part of the armys transformation revolves around lighter and leaner force4 it would appear that an integral part of this transformation will be the ability to rapidly transport their new combat vehicles such as the stryker and the future combat system fcs the stryker and the fcs combat vehicles were originally designed so that they could be transported on the air forces c130 the fcs for example is being designed with 195ton limit which is the maximum weight limit for transportation on the c130 some critics of this idea say that past procurement practices have shown that typical weapon system will increase in weight by 20 during development making transportation on the c130 impossible to date current designs have the vehicle fully combat capable at delivery weighing between 22 and 24 tons5 even if it can be transported on c130 some analysts predict that it will need an additional two c130s to transport the equipment and personnel to support its operation as the air force transforms it will need to determine the right mix of strategic assets to support both its own operations and those of the other services to achieve this the air force is exploiting new technologies and operational concepts to improve its ability to rapidly deploy and sustain forces6 third factor is technological advances the main idea behind innovation is to exploit advances in technology to create new platform designs new lighter weight stronger composite materials new advanced engines or propulsion systems new aerodynamic designs and new advances in computer technology may allow innovative designs in strategic mobility assets 2 john t bennett increased lift assets seen as key to eucom transformation plans inside the pentagon sept 30 2004 general jones gave this testimony to the senate armed services committee on sept 23 2004 3 see crs report rs20851 naval transformation background and issues for

transformation by christopher bolkcom for more information on air force transformation crs3 fourth factor affecting strategic mobility innovation is the 2001 quadrennial defense reviews qdr deployment goals the current qdr calls for deployment goals of the socalled 1421 and 103030 strategies the 1421 strategy is structured to simultaneously defend the single homeland conduct deterrence in four regions of the globe execute two major campaigns in swift fashion winning one of them by taking over the enemys capital the other strategy calls for delivering needed forces to theater within 10 days of deployment order swiftly defeating an enemy there within 30 days and resetting the force 30 days after that victory7 the next qdr is due out this fall 2005 its conclusions may have significant impact on projected strategic lift requirements fifth factor is the issue of antiaccess or area denial analysts have argued that other countries could become increasingly unwilling to permit us forces to operate out of their country to carry out combined operations additionally some analysts have suggested that future adversaries may not freely allow us forces to buildup their forces at nearby air and sea ports as in recent wars eg desert storm and operation iraqi freedom these access issues could affect our strategic mobility and require the united states to start thinking about not having access to convenient ports and airports this concern could drive the design of highspeed shallow draft ships aircraft that can go from forttofight globalrange transports supershort takeoff and landing aircraft in addition to planning for decreased local infrastructure organization of the report this report first examines few mobility studies conducted by the dod and some relevant background literature secondly the report examines innovative designs and platforms that may meet the requirement for nextgeneration strategic airlift or sealift finally this report examines the potential congressional oversight issues which could affect future us military capabilities dod funding requirements and the us defense industrial base studies and background literature mobility requirements study for 2005 in 1998 the deputy secretary of defense chartered the mobility requirements study for 2005 mrs05 mrs05 examined the number and mix of mobility systems needed to support two nearly simultaneous major theater wars mtws in the year 2005 mrs05 investigated mobility requirements in the continental united states as well as between theaters strategic or intertheater mobility and within individual theaters tactical or intratheater mobility it was conducted over two years and was then dods most comprehensive mobility study mrs05 was 7 crs analyst says qdr should include plan for size structure of navy inside the pentagon dec 9 2004 p 13 crs4 completed in 2000 at that time of the studys release the dods airlift capability was estimated to be approximately 44 milliontonmiles per day8 the mrs05 study gave the following overall assessment9 an airlift fleet of 497 milliontonmiles per day mtmd the level established after the 1995 mobility requirements study bottomup review update mrsburu is not adequate to meet the full range of requirements to support the warfighting demands of two nearly simultaneous mtws the study identified need for minimum of 511 mtmd of airlift capability this number included the airlift demands associated with deployments to the two theaters as well as support for highpriority movements within those theaters the study observed that there are likely to be other demands on the airlift system during the peak periods of operations early in major theater campaigns three of these additional demands or missions were judged to be highpriority missions in excess of the 511 mtmd capability needed for fighting two mtws the three missions conducting special operations deploying missile defense systems to friendly nations and supporting other theater commanders not directly engaged in the theater campaigns would yield total airlift requirement of 545 mtmd upon examining all the possible missions and variations in assumptions the study generated range of demands up to 67 mtmd the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the service chiefs and the cincs reviewed the study and supported the requirement of 545 mtmd of airlift capability as the minimum moderaterisk capability to support the national military strategy the sealift investments made in response to dods 1995 mrs buru were reported to be sufficient mrs05 found that the dods overall mobility capability could be further augmented through aggressive use of commercial sealift enabled by selective containerization of unit equipment however the study noted that the cargo delivery requirements for two mtws increased by one million tons relative to the 1995 mrsburu projected amounts the study also made intertheater airlift and sealift recommendations for airlift it was recommended that the dod should develop program to provide between 511 mtmd and 545 8 million tonmiles per day mtmd is commonly accepted measure of performance across the transportation industry it reflects how much cargo can be delivered over given distance in given period of time 9 us department of defense mobility requirements study for 2005 jan 2001 pp 45 crs5 mtmd of airlift capability for sealift it said that the programmed organic dry cargo fleet was adequate to meet projected requirements since the september 11 2001 attacks and the administrations global war on terrorism the dod mobility requirements are being constantly reviewed some analysts have estimated that during military operations in iraq the airlift gap between actual and required capability was at least 10 mtmd today air mobility command amc leaders say this gap is wider at least 15 mtmd perhaps 22 mtmd10 in 2004 congress asked amc to take quick look comparison of the mrs05 projection with the actual experience in afghanistan and iraq david merrell chief of amcs studies and analysis division estimated that the current requirement is fast approaching 60 mtmd11 if the new mobility capability study mcs due out in april 2005 corroborates the 60 mtmd figure then there would appear to be an additional projected gap of at least 55 mtmd above the 545 mtmd figure estimates as of march 7 2005 have dods actual mtmd capability at approximately 45 resulting in projected airlift capability gap of between 95 mtmd and 15 mtmd according to the mrs05 amc should be able to reach 545 mtmd with 176 c17s c5 mission capable mc rate of 65 and civil reserve air fleet craf contribution of 205 mtmd currently amc has 119 c17s not including the 11 c17s in air education and training command and the c5 has mc rate of approximately 68 according to the air force mtmday figure was not an original goal of the new mcs study but it appears that this issue is now being readdressed within the dod the methodology used for the new study is called deterministic modeling the study examines several different scenarios which all have baseline requirement and then models the options by adding additional airlift and sealift capabilities thus far preliminary data would appear to show that additional airlift capacity in the early stages of conflict will allow the us earlier delivery of cargopersonnel also it would appear that additional sealift capacity later in conflict eg sustainment phase will help to avoid possible delivery shortfalls12 advanced mobility concepts study amcs the defense planning guidance dpg 200409 called for the advanced mobility concepts study amcs to ensure that dods transformed forces would continue to enjoy strategic and operational mobility advantage over future adversaries by accelerating the transformation of their mobility concepts and capabilities the secretary of army in collaboration with the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff cjcs the other military department secretaries and the combatant 10 john tirpak the airlift gap air force magazine oct 2004 p 34 11 ibid p 36 12 this information was provided during inperson consultations with the air force studies and analysis agency on feb 9 2005 crs6 commanders led this comprehensive study to describe the future mobility concepts and capabilities required for the 2015 2020 timeframe13 the study considered several future mobility concepts and capabilities with reference to quadrennial defense review qdr 2001 transformational goals in particular future mobility concepts were assessed against the qdr transformational goal of projecting and sustaining us forces in distant antiaccess or areadenial environments and defeating antiaccess and areadenial threats14 the study was conducted in two phases the first phase focused on future mobility platform performance cost and risk the second phase concentrated on performance only from an initial set of servicenominated future mobility platforms the amcs chose the most promising systems for evaluation these strategic airlift and sealift platforms included global range transport grt

was released on august 31 199618 the task force did broad review of strategic mobility including range of scenarios they considered major regional contingencies lesser regional contingencies and operations other than war though the final report was completed almost nine years ago there are several findings that some observers have noted may still be pertinent today19 the task force concluded that mobility efforts should be focused on five major areas20 shaping the force for rapid response minimize the deployed footprint ashore improving the deployment architecture planning infrastructure and flow improving the information system support for deployment planning and execution improving the protection of the forces entering the theater improving lift and prepositioning capabilities for improving lift and prepositioning capabilities the dsb mentioned the importance of the strategic mobility lift triad which consists of airlift sealift and prepositioned forces it stressed that the needed lift and prepositioning programs will face multiple budget exercises congresses and administrations and will need 16 james fein et op cit p 9 17 breadboard is an experimental arrangement of electricalmechanical components that are mounted on board to test feasibility 18 defense science board report of the defense science board task force on strategic mobility office of the under secretary of defense for acquisition and technology washington aug 1996 19 as time reference this report was completed after desert shieldstorm and the 1995 mrsburu but before the 2003 iraq war 20 defense science board op cit pp 1214 crs8 robust continuing support the report also mentions 1 the need to replace the fast sealift ships fss starting around 2010 2 that worthy goal would be to replace these fss with capability to deliver forces in one half the currently planned time eg commercial initiatives for ships with 50 knot performance and 3 the need to track commercial development of very large lighterthanair craft eg 500 ton capability21 the dsb report maintains one central theme throughout the importance of minimizing the us footprint at the air and seaports of debarkation this idea really serves two purposes 1 avoidance of backlogs at the ports of debarkation pods and 2 security of us forces and material first the report mentions that more emphasis needs to be put on minimizing the pileup of forces and material at vulnerable nodes those nodes are represented by the pods from strategic mobility viewpoint the most critical need is to reduce the day to day footprint at the pods22 second the report states that sea and air pods are attractive targets since there are likely to be bottlenecks where people and material pileup in the gulf war 96 of all sealift cargo went through two sea ports for air cargo 78 went through five airfields many of these pods will be within range of enemy weapon systems which can disrupt operations in operation desert shieldstorm there was attack on the us forces during the insertion and buildup of forces in theater future adversaries may not be as accommodating specifically the handoff of personnel equipment and material from ustranscom united states transportation command to the cinc commanderinchief at the ports of debarkation appears to be the critical seam where disruption of the deployment flow is most likely to occur23 the task force emphasized the need to minimize the bottleneck of exposed forces and material at vulnerable ports when looking at typical ground force deployment it is broken up into three phases forttoport porttoport and porttofoxhole the problems mentioned above are occurring in the porttofoxhole phase many analysts believe that is where our future strategic mobility platforms need to concentrate the future of strategic mobility could be to transport directly from forttofoxhole or to at least plan for port denial and to develop platforms that do not need to operate in these environments another dsb mobility study is currently being conducted and is due to be released in spring 2005 strategic mobility inventories united states transportation command ustranscom manages all

force transformation oft was created and transformation planning guidance tpg was published in april 2003 this guidance defines the primary senior leaders roles and responsibilities for implementing the transformation strategy it states the secretaries of the military departments and the service chiefs of staff are responsible for developing specific concepts for supporting operations and core competencies they will oversee service experimentation modify supporting concepts accordingly and build transformation roadmaps to achieve transformational capabilities to enable those concepts36 the services and joint forces command submit to oft their transformational roadmaps for approval later than november 1 of each year the 2004 roadmaps were submitted to oft in the late summer of 2004 however ofts review of these roadmaps has not been completed to date the tpg also directs that an annual strategic appraisal will be written by the director of oft and submitted to the secretary of defense later than january 30 each year the strategic transformation appraisal evaluates and interprets the progress of the transformation strategy recommending modifications and revisions where necessary the 2004 strategic transformation appraisal included several issues of regret which outline key technologies that if not explored could be in the future viewed as significant lost

would appear to be relatively flat some observers have questioned this flat trend partly due to the administrations goal to transform the dod of which strategic lift could be considered an integral part potential strategic mobility platforms sealift there are three hull designs and two surface effect ship designs under active consideration for new sealift capability the potential platform designs are the monohull one hull catamaran two hull trimaran three hull cavity catamaran surface effect ship and air cushion surface effect ship in particular these designs were incorporated into the following potential strategic sealift platforms the shallowdraft high speed sealift the fast sealiftmonohull the navy vision trimaran high speed sealift and the navy vision surface effect ship high speed sealift this section will also briefly examine two intratheater hull designs that may be examined in the future crs13 figure 2 sdhss source institute of defense analyses shallow draft high speed sealift sdhss the sdhss is intended to be strategic theater cargo vessel capable of 75 knots with an intended range of 4500 nautical miles it would have draft shallow enough to access ports not accessible to current sealift39 it would carry 86489 square feet of cargo or 4400 short tons and 1000 passengers simultaneously40 the sdhss is cavity catamaran with rigid catamaranlike sidehulls and about the last half of the ship having carved out cavity this cavitation reduces the wetted surface of the hull and consequently lowers the hydrodynamic resistance the sdhss would also use selfgenerated air cushion to reduce hydrodynamic drag41 potential advantages of the sdhss include42 with speed of 75 knots the sdhss would be nearly three times faster than the current large medium speed rollonrolloff sealift vessel with shallow draft the sdhss could deliver cargo and personnel without having to rely on deepwater port this could help minimize the footprint at deepwater port thereby increasing the number of possible entry points into theater of operation 39 draft is the depth of water ship draws especially when loaded 40 us department of army advanced mobility concepts

from entering many coastal andor riverine ports as well as the panama canal its performance may be limited in poor weather and high sea states some of the current issues with the sdhss are as follows44 speed of 75 knots may not be practical there may be detrimental effect on passengers in the open ocean further open ocean study is needed some sealift experts and engineers do not think it is feasible to produce ship with this design experts believe that the speed payload and range of this vessel would be difficult to achieve technological feasibility has not been proven more aggressive high speed sealift research and development program would be required to produce sdhss that can meet these design parameters the high speed sealift innovation cell joint effort funded by the navy and osd published technical development plan that identified 12 billion in rd efforts for the sdhss with the preponderance of the effort going to gas turbine research 700 million as mentioned earlier in the report the institute of defense analyses ida completed feasibility analysis of the strategic airlift and sealift platforms examined in the amcs phase ii the analysis of the sdhss highlighted couple of issues nearterm performance above 40 knots is feasible the issues of drag propulsive power and dynamic stability in waves are unknowns today45 in the far term feasibility is possible with

disadvantage at lower speeds the cost of the cushion lift far outweighs any reduced drag the speed of the ses should only be considered at speeds of 55 knots or higher in the far term this design is possible with significant investment in critical technologies the issues of installing sufficient power designing an integrated propulsion system reducing drag and controlling dangerous motions and accelerations must still be addressed for the nvseshss ida categorized it as marginally feasible in the far term fy2016 but with oriented technology investments64 intratheater designs with potential strategic applications there are two additional ship designs that could possibly be used for strategic lift they are the high speed catamaran and hybrid lifting body ship that combines the high speed capabilities of hydrofoil and the rough water stability of small waterplane area twin hull swath currently these designs pertain to intratheater vessels but future technologies may allow this design to be applied to intertheater vessels high speed catamarans are already commercially available but are primarily used for the intratheater role the australian navys hmas jervis bay is an example of this type of technology it can transport up to 500 troops with their vehicles and equipment up to range of 1000 nautical miles at speeds of more than 40 knots the us navy and army are currently

intra theater deployment and logistics support for its units worldwide67 international catamaran has conducted studies on catamarans with design goals of 3000 tons of cargo 50 knots of speed and range of 3000 nautical miles in the future vessel with 5000 10000 tons of cargo capability at 40 knots with range of 35000 nautical miles may be feasible68 the navy believes that another future technology could be the hybrid lifting body ship the hybrid lifting body ship is catamaranlike ship with midhull foil and an aft foil with twin propellers as the ship picks up speed the hull comes completely out of the water carried by the winglike foils this reduces drag and wave action thus giving it smoother ride at faster speeds in rougher seas currently navatek ships hawaiibased firm is testing this technology on the sea flyer sea flyer is 160foot 340ton craft designed in the 1980s as an experimental patrol and support ship it was mothballed until the navy donated it to navatek in april 2001 navatek was awarded 63 million navy contract to demonstrate and evaluate lifting body technology for future hull designs after modifications the sea flyer can travel at maximum speed of 30 knots with draft of 185 feet steven loui navateks president said the goal has been to get the technology that gives us the speed and efficiency of the hydrofoil with the comfort of swath ship69 he went on to say that navatek would like to extend this technology to war ships but also noted that there is lot skepticism that this technology can be scaled to the 2000 to 5000ton ship range airlift number of

the ability to move large amounts of cargopassengers over long distances the grt could transport 25 times more cargo than the c 5 but would be approximately the same size as the c5 this would make for

the current issues with the grt are as follows73 there is limited commercial interest in this concept almost all funding for the grt would have to be by the government since industry does not appear to be heading in this direction the government could seek agreement to recoup the rdte cost if there is an industry demand there is technological challenge for bwb due to manufacturing techniques this challenge could possibly be mitigated by leveraging the existing work on the b2 stealth bomber when ida examined the grt it documented several issueschallenges one area of concern was the key technologies needed to make this design feasible ida mentions weight propulsion and the liftdrag ld ratio another area of concern is aerodynamics in particular the pitching moment74 bwbs have tail to

eliminating enroute stops and allowing direct delivery of forces thereby reducing deployment times82 potential disadvantages of the c17 prep include83 it may not be possible to take advantage of prep on all missions the aircraft could run out of floor space before it actually exceeds aircraft weight limits when the c17 lands on soft fields it may not be able to take advantage of the increased gross weight capacity the ida study states that three modifications would be needed to achieve the desired range and cargo capacity increases first the fuselage would need to be strengthened and extended to allow more payload troops and fuel to be carried second the c17 would need more efficient wing so as to be able to handle the increased weight third the c17 would need engines with lower

variant86 both are commonly characterized as lighterthanair aircraft the vtol crane variant is based on conventional ellipsoidal airship that uses crane to lowerraise the payload bay it is nominally

aerostats by christopher bolkcom for more information on lighterthanair lta platforms crs25 the ctol variant also called hybrid lifting body airship combines static lift buoyancy with aerodynamic lift the aerodynamic lift is intended to allow ship of the same size as an ellipsoidal airship to have greater lift and thus carry more cargo the hybrid shape should also allow for higher cruising speed for the same power the hybrid airship may require takeoff run that will exceed 10000 feet in some cases an unimproved field or water may be used for the takeoff run but it must be relatively flat the field must also be clear of trees power lines and other obstacles the ctol variant had design goal of 500 short tons source httpwwwglobalsecurityorgmilitary figure 9 ctol variant

advantages for the ula included89 could bypass the traditional ports apods and spods to mitigate an enemys access denial strategies designed to offload cargo in flat open areas thus possibly delivering cargo direct to the battlespace hybrid advocates have proposed that the ctol variant could land on and operate from bodies of water rivers or bays proposed cargo capacity could be approximately three to eight times the tonnage capacity of c5 c5 planning factor is 613 short tons testing by the manufacturer on lighterthanair vehicles showed limited radar signature and significant survivability to direct fire potential disadvantages of the ula include90 at 76 knots it is roughly 15 the speed of c5c17 though it can maintain this speed for 24 hours per day for multiple days91 87

altitude will limit access and transition in higher mountain areas of the world the blended variant carried 76 passengers to simulate support personnel for carried equipment more passengers could be carried at the expense of cargo if passengers are carried life support and safety requirements would need to be further examined as well as human factors for long duration flights if airports are used ula arrivals and departures could limit or shutdown aircraft operations effect airflow and decrease throughput amcs analysts have stated the following as issues for the ula92 ballast both variants of the airships need ballast to keep themselves within weight limits as cargo is offloaded either ballast must be added or helium must be vented into the air the most common type of ballast is water in an austere environment it may be difficult to find water or other material that can be used as ballast offload for the prototype variant of the ula the offload and expedited offload times of 6 and 5 hours respectively may be somewhat optimistic landing zones the ctol variant of the ula requires large landing zone due to this fact the number of ulas in one area may be limited it is estimated that the largest potential landing zone would be the equivalent of 109 football fields the vtol variant would require significantly less space approximately three football fields one of the strengths of the ula is its advertised capability to operate from unimproved landing sites critics of the ulas ctol variant often mention the landing zone or footprint requirement needed for it to operate as minimum it would appear that at least 3500 feet would be required for the ctol variant to land in an 80000 square mile survey across the planet boeing analysis found that on average only 1 of this area allowed feasible landing zone of approximately 3500 feet or longer on the other hand it was found that almost 50 of this area allowed feasible landing zone of 1000 feet this data would appear to give more credence to the vtol crane variant which proponents have said would require landing zone of approximately 1000 feet 91 continued washington feb15 2005 92 advanced mobility concepts study department of defense dec 2003 pp 410 crs27 the ida study only examined the ctol variant but some of its conclusions and technical issues may pertain to both variants the study mentioned the following ula issues93 the airships size will be limited by the strength of the available fabrics joining methods and facilities research needs to be done in fibers yarns weaves and bonding technology94 even if seaming for large airships is feasible faster seaming machines will need to be developed that can seam thick fabrics for final vehicle assembly and envelope fabrication covered expanse similar in size to football stadium will be needed further study of the aerodynamics of the lifting body is required near the ground and in free air further study of ballast is required to offset fuel expenditure and discharge of cargo ida recommended that the design be done in steps first design 30ton introductory version then move to larger capacity craft as the design matures95 the ida study stated that the ula was infeasible in the near term fy2006 marginally feasible in the far term fy2016 and feasible in the far term fy2016 with oriented technology investment96 advocates for the ula feel that the vtol crane variant with approximately 200 short tons of capacity is feasible today with current technology97 unmanned aerial vehicles uavs in 2001 northrop grummans global hawk flew 7500 nautical miles

computercontrolled automatic flight the uav took off performed tight spiral climb to the cruise altitude of 65000 feet traveled enroute at more than 350 knots performed steep spiral descent and then executed fully automatic landing to full stop some proponents of the uav maintain that this mission proves that the technology exists to manufacture uav cargoonly transport though the technology may exist there currently does not appear to be any immediate plans to develop such uav upon reviewing the dods roadmap for developing and employing uavs through the year 2027 it does not show any introduction of uav cargo transport until the 2025 2030 timeframe98 the dod roadmap does state that there are many advantages offered by uavs to military commanders most notably in the mission areas categorized as the dull the dirty and the dangerous for now this seems to be the dods focus for example it mentions that one uav with multiple sensors could survey the same area as ten or more human sentries the dull uavs could survey areas contaminated with chemical biological or radiological agents without risk to human life the dirty also uavs could perform the duty of suppression of enemy air defenses sead that f16s and ea6s currently perform the dangerous with less need for supporting aircraft99 the next dod roadmap is due for release in spring 2005 if 2025 is indeed target for uav cargo transport then this timeframe is only 20 years away if the development spans for current weapon systems are any indicator eg the fa22 started development in 1986 then some observers have noted that now may be the time to examine the uav cargo transport the first hurdle commonly mentioned is access to the national airspace system nas in particular if uav cargo transport is to fly it would most likely need access to the 18000 feet to 40000 feet flight levels to operate freely in the nas uavs are going to be expected to operate identically to manned aircraft an air traffic controller should not even know whether or not an aircraft is manned thorough uav assessment was undertaken by combined joint aviation authorityeurocontrol uav task force over 18month period during 2003 2004 the critical yardstick that the task force used in assessing uav operations was whether they met an equivalent level of safety compared with conventionally manned aircraft in discussing airworthiness therefore the report stated that civil certificate of airworthiness or its military equivalent would be mandatory to enter civil controlled airspace100 this would mean that uav cargo transports intended to be operated in the nas would have to be built in certified aircraft manufacturing plants that they would have to use approved aeronautical standards and materials be subject to all aviation 98 us department of defense uav roadmap 2002 p 58 99 us department of defense uav roadmap 2002 p iv 100 william reynish uavs entering the nas aviation today feb10 2005 crs29 inspection processes and procedures and pass rigorous flight test certification the uavs would be also subject to an approved maintenance program which would have to be performed by licensed personnel in airframe engines electronics etc for transport uav to fly in the nas it would be expected to file and fly instrument flight rule ifr flight plans just like manned flights the airlift uav will most likely need to rely on variety of communication navigation and surveillance cns technologies to safely and efficiently operate in civil airspace some analysts have noted that current manned cargo transports already rely heavily on automation in all areas of flight to include takeoff cruise and landing as long as the uav cargo transport is equipped with the normal avionics associated with manned flight then the navigation and surveillance technologies would not appear to present any significant challenges equipment such as an onboard traffic alert collision avoidance system tcas inertial navigation and global positioning systems ins and gps realtime weather avoidance radars automated dependent surveillance broadcast adsb traffic information service tis flight control guidance system an enhanced ground proximity warning system egpws and noncooperative sensors are some of the systems that may be required these are essential for the safe secure and reliable integration of the uav into the nas uav cns issues were recently examined at the 2004 nasa integrated cns conference and workshop held from april 26 30 2004101 the one area this conference highlighted throughout was the area of communication there are two communication links required for remotely piloted uav operations 1 the interface between the uav pilot and air traffic control 2 the interface between the uav pilot and the aerial vehicle both of these have need for line of sight and beyond capability the specific challenges for this type of communication are latency how much of delay is acceptable security prevention of unauthorized seizure of uav and to ensure protection from jammingspoofingsabotage availabilityreliability lost link problem link quality the need to provide sufficient voice quality and limited data degradation sufficient bandwidth potential for saturation of available bandwidth in given geographical area these issues will need to be addressed if the future uav cargo transport is remotely piloted but what if the uav is not remotely piloted the other alternative may be totally computercontrolled automatic flight such as the global hawk102 to develop this type of uav observers commonly mention couple of options one the dod could develop brand new uav cargo transport at minimum the 101 john s walker enabling americas next generation of aviation vehicles briefing given at 2004 nasa icns conference workshop april 2630 2004 httpspacecomgrcnasagovicnsconf2004agendashtml 102 see crs report rl31872 unmanned aerial vehicles background and issues for congress by christopher bolkcom for more information on uavs crs30 typical development span is about 12 years another idea that some analysts have mentioned is to modify existing aircraft though uav cargo transports are currently being developed by the dod there does appear to be commercial interest in the idea don barber senior vice president at fedex told atca air traffic controllers association attendees he believes that though unmanned air freighters may not be ubiquitous soon uav cargo transport will be demonstrated reality in the near future103 for the air freight industry two of the biggest expenses are fuel and pilot salaries if the pilot could be removed significant savings may be achieved though this type of technology could possibly be utilized in the airline industry many analysts have stated that it will be some time before passengers will permit the removal of the pilot from the cockpit winginground effect aircraft the wingin ground effect wig aircraft is designed as longrange

the aircraft would be at risk from rogue waves105 the vast size of the aircraft would mean tremendous investment to develop an operational product since it is very large the wig would require more power for takeoff than for cruise this would increase the mass of the engines thus reducing payload and aircraft efficiency106 seaplanes the office of naval research tasked the center for innovation in ship design cisd to conduct study on the utility of seaplanes in supporting the navys offshore sea base concept it is thought that seaplanes with heavy lift capability may be simpler to integrate with the sea base concept than conventional aircraft one of the potential missions would be bringing troops intertheater to meet up with their predeployed equipment production of seaplanes has been very limited since the 1960s examples of some modern era seaplanes are the canadair cl214 waterbomber the japanese shin meiwa us1a search and rescue aircraft and the russian large multipurpose seaplanes the be200 and a40 some of the issues addressed in the cisd final report titled use of seaplanes integration within sea base are rough water operations it is pointed out that rough water operations are crucial during takeoff landing taxiing cargo transfer and aircraft survival based on open ocean wave data the report states that desirable goal for sea based seaplane will be to have full operational capability in sea state 4 below 8 feet in significant wave height with limited operation in sea state 5 below 13 feet in significant wave height rapid takeoff and landing the report suggests that rapid takeoff and landing are important for high sea state performance to allow seaplane to rapidly leave or enter the water while avoiding adverse motions and high fuselage loads 105

docking ideally most seaplanes are designed to be physically lifted from the water when not in use this is done to protect the aircraft and reduce maintenance as aircraft size increases this becomes progressively more difficult the alternative is to have the seaplane live in the water even then mooring and docking capabilities will be needed ability to transfer seaplanes payload to ship in various sea states cisd innovation cell recommended new method of transferring payload using the intermediate transfer station its concept this concept utilizes large platform deck area for cargo transfer there is high side and low side to this deck the deck would become floating seaplane ramp which would allow seaplanes to come onboard from the low side in recent massachusetts institute of technology project team designed heavy lift amphibious seaplane that was specifically designed to meet the requirements for the sea basing concept107 their final design allowed payload of 40000 pounds and cruise range of 3000 nautical miles the seaplane is amphibious so it could transport cargo from remote land bases and land in the water to deliver its payload one of the unique design features of this seaplane was the way it would deliver its payload the seaplane was designed to deliver its payload through well deck on existing amphibious warfare ships the seaplane would land taxi to the ship insert its nose into cushioned opening called the auxiliary delivery system on the well deck the cargo would then be extracted through its clam shell doors in the nose of the seaplane the report states that there are currently 54 naval vessels over 7 ship classes that use well decks the seaplane could also dock with floating platform and deliver cargo on beaches that are suitable for seaplane delivery it had one other unique feature the ability to deploy its landing gear in water this feature could possibly allow the seaplane to do coastal delivery by driving up water ramp another design that some analysts feel may have merit is lockheed martins surface effect aircraft sea it is primarily seaplane but uses two technologies to enhance its capabilities the concept uses winginground effect technology as well as surface effect ship principles the wig technology would assist in increasing its range capability by approximately 25 if utilized the surface effect ship technology would assist in getting the vehicle out of the water faster thus shortening the takeoff distance and lessening propulsion figure 11 sea requirements source lockheed martin 107 omar bashir jeanmarc freuler david smith matt theis josh walton brady young heavylift amphibious seaplane for enhancement of seabasing massachusetts institute of technology dec 14 2004 crs33 another innovation for the sea is modular concept the designers believe that different modules could be used depending on the type of mission the two different examples used were conventional airlaunched cruise missileunmanned aerial vehicle launcher module and cargo module the sea is designed to carry the same payload as c5 about 270000 pounds with range of 7500 to 10000 nautical miles depending on whether it is operating in or out of surface effect it has an operational goal of 300 400 knots at less than 200 feet but can also fly at normal deployment altitudes lockheed martin also believes that the design may have potential for signature reduction or stealth critics of the seaplane have said that they require more propulsion than similarly sized conventional aircraft to takeoff there was also concern in the takeoff and landing phase due to floating debris108 summary of potential strategic mobility platforms the table below table 2 summarizes the main characteristics of each of the potential strategic mobility

have sufficient information about the dods plans for lift and potential lift platforms to adequately assess investment options to what degree if any should government funding be used to develop new lift platforms what mix of lift platforms might be appropriate to both meet future us commercial lift needs and potentially assist in meeting future military strategic lift requirements should any of these lift platforms be developed and procured in part to support the defense industrial base should procurement of airlift be expanded beyond current dod plans and if so by how much and with what platforms further study of investment options does congress have sufficient information about the dods plans for lift and potential lift platforms to adequately assess investment options some analysts have noted that the following areas may require further study to adequately assess investment options high speed ships some analysts have stated that speeds in excess of 50 knots may be detrimental to passengers on the open ocean further open ocean study may be needed to examine the effects on passengers in various sea states fast sealift monohull further study may be required on med mooring to determine how many ports this type of ship can access medmooring is where the ship is perpendicular to the shore or pier without dedicated terminal facilities what ports would the monohull be able to access worldwide double stacking aircraft cargo may be one way to increase dod airlift capability for many of the dods current strategic assets analysts have found that platforms run out of floor space before actually exceeding aircraft weight limits to increase the current airlift capacity further study may be needed in bilevel cargo loadingdouble stacking cargo there currently are two air expeditionary force battlelab initiatives addressing this idea the bilevel aircraft loading system bals and the tactical integrated crs36 packaging system tips are being examined as ways to increase airlift capacity109 ultralarge airlifters ulas further ula studies may be required in three areas 1 the foot print required to support operations for the ctol and vtol crane variants analysts have estimated that it may take up to the equivalent of 109 football fields for the landing zone of the ctol ula and the equivalent of 3 football fields for the vtol crane this could be significant issue if the desire is to land these ulas in unimproved fields 2 the ballast required to offset fuel expenditure and cargo discharge currently the primary way of offsetting fuel expenditure and cargo discharge is with water other ways may include the venting of lifting gas vectored thrust and onboard buoyancy control 3 the fabrics yarns weaves and bonding technology for the ula the size of the ula is limited by the strength of the fabric bigger envelopes require more plies of fabric faster seaming machines are needed to bond with heat the thick fabrics seaplanes and intermediate transfer station its concept if the navy continues to pursue the sea base concept then some analysts have remarked that seaplanes or even the winginground effect aircraft as well as the intermediate transfer station its concept may need further study the feasibility of seaplanes that will be designed to have heavy lift capability and operate in sea states 4 and 5 may require further study the its concept represents one way of getting the seaplanes out of the water and being able to offload cargopersonnel is the its concept feasible other forms of mooring and docking may also require further study future government funding some of these future concepts appear to have little or current commercial attraction and consequently are likely to require substantial government funding unless ways are found to encourage commercial involvement potential oversight question for congress is as follows to what degree if any should government funding be used to develop new lift platforms some analysts have highlighted these platforms or areas as possibly requiring future government funding ship research and development rd at this time ida analysts have noted that commercial or other rd efforts are 109 for more on these initiatives see httpwwwmountainhomeafmilawb crs37 expected in the next 10 years for highspeed sealift issues110 without targeted investment in high speed ship technology the feasibilities of the proposed future sealift platforms may not improve significantly ida believed that further rd was needed in three areas 1 installed propulsion systems 2 impact of drag at high speeds spray drag appendage drag and interference drag 3 challenges of operating ships over 50 knots eg controlling dangerous rolling motions and accelerations shallow draft high speed sealift sdhss many sources have noted the desirability of shallow draft high speed ship proponents of this ship have said that the high speed and shallow draft are requirements for future wartime engagements in order to provide options when confronted with antiaccess or area denial scenarios on the other hand critics of the ship have stated that the cavity catamaran technology has never been proven on large scale to date the floridabased ship designer howard harley has only manufactured vessels with this design on much smaller scale the high speed sealift innovation cell joint effort funded by the navy and osd published technical development plan that identified 12 billion in potential rd efforts with the preponderance going to gas turbine research 700 million global range transport grt there is limited commercial interest in this blended wing body concept if this concept is to become reality then the majority of the funding for the grt would need to come from the government the technology from the b2 stealth bomber program could be leveraged to possibly decrease costs also if there is an industry demand the government could seek agreement to recoup rdte costs supershort takeoff and landing sstol aircraft there is again limited commercial application for this concept if this concept is to become reality then future government funding would most likely be required the technology from the v22 osprey could be leveraged to reduce rdte costs for this system to become achievable analysts maintain that research would be required in highlift technology flight control integration propulsion and composite structures ultralarge airlifter ula in april 2004 the defense advanced research projects agency initiated program to develop 500ton ula that can fly 6000 miles in four days phase i which included system studies and development of notional concept of the objective vehicle has been completed and phase ii which will cost 50 million will produce 30ton advanced technology demonstrator by 2007 which the us military will use to evaluate the concept if 110 james fein et op cit p 7 crs38 all goes well fullscale phase iii vehicle could then be developed and evaluated for potential production congress appropriated 10 million dollars to the walrus program in the fy2005 budget its program element pe number is pe 0603285e r1 32 the walrus program falls under the advanced aerospace systems project111 seaplanes the seabased aircraft program may require extensive technology maturation significant seaplane technology advances have really occurred since the 1960s commercial applicability some of these future lift platforms may have direct commercial applicability the potential oversight question for congress is as follows what mix of lift platforms might be appropriate to both meet future us commercial lift needs and potentially assist in meeting future military strategic lift requirements some analysts have noted that the following platforms may have some future commercial applicability mobilus initiative the center for army analysis caa is studying ways to develop commercial ultra large airlifter ula capacity which then could be accessed for military andor government use similar to the civil reserve air fleet the mobilus initiative112 seeks to use balanced cost sharing publicprivate partnership the idea is to create broad and deep mobility capability in the private sector that would be available for military use the mobilus initiative will determine what would be required to bolster the lighterthanair industry which will be

have expressed interest in purchasing blendedwingbody bwb aircraft if they are developed some of the concerns that the bwb aircraft will have to overcome are passenger acceptance of cabins with few or windows how to handle emergency evacuation of the large passenger cabins how to incorporate such large aircraft into the existing airport environment117 industrial base the potential oversight question for congress is as follows should any of these lift platforms be developed and procured in part to support the defense industrial base the following points address the defense industrial base question the navys fy2006 fy2011 shipprocurement plan would procure 49 ships over these six years the littoral combat ship lcs accounts for 21 of these 49 ships the lcs will be built by yards other than the six ship yards that have built the navys major war 114 william reynish uavs entering the nas aviation today feb 10 2005 115 for more information on access 5 see httpwwwaccess5aero 116 for

transportation system in peril national academies press washington 2003 p 33 crs40 ships in recent years118 that means that the big six ship yards will have to compete for the remaining 28 ships over those six years which accounts for an average procurement rate of 47 ships per year for these six ship yards this average procurement rate could result in relatively low work loads revenues and employment levels119 the high speed ships examined in this report if procured may be helpful in maintaining the us industrial capabilities needed for development and production of advanced sealift all of the strategic mobility concepts examined in this report represent future innovation some observers have noted that if the us is to maintain competitive lead in the development and production of airlift and sealift while also possibly creating new industries eg an ultra large airlifter industry new jobs and new marketable skills eg in the blended wing body technology then future investments in these types of platforms may be required future procurement the potential oversight question for congress is as follows should procurement of airliftsealift be expanded beyond current dod plans and if so by how much and with what platforms some of the areas that may affect this question are as follows milliontonmile per day mtmd airlift gap in the mobility requirements study 2005 mrs05 it stated that 483 millionton mile per day mtmd capability should exist with 120 c17s c5 mission capable mc rate of 65 for all 106 c5s and civil reserve air fleet contribution of 205 mtmd air mobility command currently has 119 c17s and the c5 mc rate seems to be hovering around 68 for fy2005 but the dods current airlift capability is estimated to be approximately 45 mtmd leaving an estimated gap of 33 mtmd from the projected capability if the current projected requirement is approaching 60 mtmd as some analysts have estimated then there is indeed an even larger gap in the us military airlift capability mrs05 stated that 176 c17s were required with c5 mission capable rate of 65 to achieve mtmd capability of 545 thus even when the air force gets ownership of all 180 c17s on contract there could be projected 118 these six yards include bath iron works of bath the electric boat division of groton ct and quonset point ri national steel and shipbuilding company of san diego ca avondale shipyards

for congress by ronald orourke for more information on industrial base implications crs41 gap of at least 55 mtmd the c17 production line is currently planned to close in 2008 if this airlift gap is to be filled then some observers have noted that it can either be filled by procuring more c 17s or by procuring some mix of future strategic airlift platforms120 potential platforms in the office of force transformations 2004 strategic transformation appraisal it listed three pertinent issues of regret which are key technologies that if not explored could be in the future viewed as significant lost opportunities 1 super short takeoff and vertical landing platform 2 heavylift vertical takeoff and landing aircraft 3 shallow draft highspeed vessel with strategic reach121 in the executive summary of the advanced mobility concepts study amcs the executive committee recommended that osd include appropriate direction in pom strategic planning guidance to initiate rdte on the following strategic platforms shallow draft high speed vessels super short takeoff and landing aircraft and the global range transport it also recommended that the ula continue as platform for further related studies122 future requirements matter what future platforms are selected the amcs identified the following requirements for future mobility assets 1 reduced dependency on fixed infrastructure 2 the ability to enter through multiple unimproved entry points 3 the ability to swiftly move forces in combatready configurations 4 the ability to conduct vertical maneuver 5 the ability to close the gap between deployment and employment momentum123 120 it is estimated that for every 10 additional c17s that air mobility command procures that they would get roughly one mtmd more of capability the 42 c17s that the air force is currently requesting would provide an estimated 42 mtmd of capability 121 amy butler pentagon transformation analysis outlines military capability gaps defense daily nov 19
