boosting the countrys modera growth rates gdp growth was 29 in 2007 and reducing poverty according to the world bank although overall poverty has declined in nicaragua since the countrys return to democracy from 503 in 1993 to roughly 46 today more than twothirds of the rural population is impoverished while nicaragua made some progre ss towards development in the 1990s much of those gains were reversed by the devastation wrought by hurricane mitch in 1998 as result of sluggish growth rates some social indicators for nicaragua have shown little or improvement since 1993 nicaragua is hi ghly dependent on foreign aid which contributed 26 of its budget in 2006 it is also dependent on remittances sent from nicaraguans living abroad which totale d some 656 million in 2006 and accounted for 17 of the countrys gdp the official unemployment rate is about 5 but underemployment is major problem and some 60 of workers are employed in the informal sector which doesnt provide social security and other benefits6 the ortega government has adopted poverty reduction strategy and 2008 budget in line with international monetary fund imf recommendations as result the imf and the world bank have
