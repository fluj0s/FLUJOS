mfa das gellet ref paris 3645 notal classified by classified by political ministercounselor josiah rosen blatt for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary the gof took hard line during an august 23 trip to tehran by french presidency strategic affairs adviser richier and french mfa dasequivalent gellet that iranian leader khamaneis foreign policy adviser velayati hoped would open new channel to paris gellet explained august 31 that velayati was apparently operating from flawed premise that nicolas sarkozy would free france from its dependence on the usg velayati further believed france could be broken away from the p5 over further sanctions against iran gellet said richier previewed for velayati the line sarkozy would use in subsequent speech to french ambassadors that the world faced catastrophic choice between iran with bomb or bombing iran although velayatis hopes were shattered iran is still interested in the channel gellet said that richier has the lead in deciding what the gof will do next gellet expressed strong french desire to remain informed on us plans regarding iran particularly should we decide to take military action against iran end summary 2 c french mfa dasequivalent for iran iraq and the gulf franck gellet on august 31 provided readout on his august 23 visit to tehran accompanying the french presidencys strategic affairs adviser francois richier the visit followed an invitation from ali akbar velayati former iranian foreign minister and current foreign affairs adviser to supreme leader khamanei gellet confirmed information that the french embassy in washington communicated to the department that velayati wanted to establish new direct channel to paris gellet elaborated that velayatis apparently convoluted thinking had been expressed in an article he had written that took the view that the election of nicolas sarkozy gave france chance to break free of its dependence on the us in terms of its foreign policy velayati according to gellet believed that chirac had been entirely beholden to the us during his presidency sarkozys election therefore offered iran chance to appeal to france in way that would allow france to follow its independent line gaulle and thus pry france loose from the coalition that now sought to impose tougher sanctions on iran over its nuclear program 3 c despite this clearly flawed analysis of frances position and political dynamics the gof decided this opening was important enough to explore gellet recounted how he and richier met velayati heard him out and proceeded to burst his bubble richier according to gellet told velayati that sarkozy was firm on the nuclear issue and previewed for him the line that sarkozy would use in his august 29 speech to french ambassadors that under current circumstances the world faced the stark alternative that iran would obtain the bomb or be bombed velayati was not happy to hear this but did not close the door to further discussion gellet surmised that velayati believes the french are still susceptible to iranian blandishments and wants to keep some sort of alternative line open to the elysee 4 c gellet stressed that velayatis initiative was not taken without reference to others in the iranian government iranian deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs abbas araghchi sat in on the velayati meeting just as velayati attended meeting gellet and richier had with araghchi gellet did not indicate what other subjects came up but velayatis pitch was the main one when asked whether france felt the visit had been worthwhile and what sort of followup there might be gellet was vague he said that richier in his elyse capacity would decide what to do including whether to keep this dialogue going gellet surmised that richier would be willing to discuss this further with usg officials like pm as rood in future meetings to discuss next steps in the nuclear fuel dispute 5 c gellet found the visit bit surreal but quite indicative of the bizarre way iran functions he noted the diffusion of power among different entities and the uncertainty that pervades iranian decision making velayati clearly sought to minimize or counterbalance president ahmadinejads hard line but without actually taking softer line himself irans core position therefore did not seem to be shifting or subject to any flexibility when asked how france understood sarkozys eitheror statement on iran had played in that country gellet replied that iranian authorities seem to have largely kept it out of the national media the implication that france sees iran facing serious risk of military retaliation over its stance was thus largely unreported gellet argued that this suits velayatis calculations because the impression remains that iran can paris 00003668 002 of 002 somehow turn to france to blunt american pressure to impose more sanctions and escalate the situation 6 c on the issue of escalation gellet asked that the usg keep france informed of its thinking as regards possible military action against iran he claimed that the elysee worries about being blindsided if or when the time comes for strike the timing and magnitude of such action ie surgical strike or more generalized campaign could have enormous stakes in terms of french interests gellet noted in this vein french concerns about iranian retaliation against the gulf states and their capacity to respond he surmised that usfrance dialogue if it were to develop might occur at much higher level than his his hope which was personal as much as he said it reflected official thinking was that we would keep the french in the loop as we moved into the next phase of hightension diplomacy focused on further unsc sanctions 7 c comment it appears that this latest iranian initiative to open new channel to paris is unlikely to change the dynamics of tehrans ongoing confrontation with the world the french seem keen to reassure us that they are not wavering president sarkozys tough words to the french ambassadors conference following the meetings in tehran made that point loud and clear on whether to engage more intensively with the french about the various contingencies related to iran we believe we should continue to test sarkozys apparent desire to deal with us differently than his predecessors did as an indication of different french thinking the newspaper monde reported active discussion in the elysee of sanctions targeting iran outside the unsc that france could impose alone or potentially with others in the eu the article made clear that as fissures seem to be appearing among the p5 over iran france seems to be toughening its position we will follow up with richier for his take on this visit please visit paris classified website
