preemptive military force preemptive military attacks under customary international law until recent decades customary international law deemed the right to use force and even to go to war to be an essential attribute of every state as one scholar summarized it always lies within the power of state to endeavor to obtain redress for wrongs or to gain political or other advantages over another not merely by the employment of force but also by di rect recourse to war1 within that framework customary international law also consistently recognized self defense as legitimate basis for the use of force an act of selfdefense is that form of selfprotection which is directed against an aggressor or contemplated aggressor act can be so described which is nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21314crs2 2 id

the law of nations and are justified on principle even though they may conflict with the rights of other states2 moreover the recognized right of state to use force for purposes of selfdefense traditionally included the preemptive use of force ie the use of force in anticipation of an attack hugo grotius the father of international law stated in the seventeenth century that it be lawful to kill him who is preparing to kill3 emmerich vattel century later similarly asserted the safest plan is to prevent evil where that is possible nation has the right to resist the injury another seeks to inf lict upon it and to use force against the aggressor it may even anticipate the ot hers design being careful however not to act upon vague and doubtful suspicions lest it should run the risk of becoming itself the aggressor4 the classic formulation of the right of preemptive attack was given by secretary of state daniel webster in c onnection with the famous caroline incident in 1837 british troops under the cover of night attack ed and sank an american ship the caroline in us waters because the ship was being used to provide supplies to insurrectionists against british rule in canada headqua rtered on an island on the canadian side of the niagara river the us immediately protested this extraordinary outrage and demanded an apology and reparations the dispute dragged on for several years before the british conceded that they ought to have immediately offered some explanation and apology but in the course of the diplomatic exch anges secretary of state daniel webster articulated the two conditions essential to the legitimacy of the preemptive use of force under customary international law in one note he asserted that an intrusion into the territory of another state can be justified as an act of selfdefense only in those cases in which the necessity of that selfdefense is instant overwhelming and leaving choice of means and moment for deliberation5 in another note he asserted that the force used in such circumstances has to be proportional to the threat it will be for her majestys government to show also that the local authorities of canada even supposing the necessity of th moment authorized them to enter the territories of the united states at all di d nothing unreasonable or excessive since the act justified by the necessity of selfdefence must be limited by that necessity and kept clearly within it6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21314crs3 7 in its advisory opinion on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons the international court of justice stated that the submission of the exercise of the right of self defence to the conditions of necessity and propor tionality is rule of customary international law 1996 icj reports 41 8 united

v united states of america 1986 icj reports p 14 the gravamen of the courts ruling was that in customary international law as well as article 51 the use of force in selfdefense is justified only in response to an armed attack for one state to use force against anot her is regarded as lawful by way of exception only when the wrongful act prov oking the response was an armed attack in the view of the court under international law in force today whether customary international law or that of th united nations system states do not have right of collective armed response to acts which do not constitute an armed continuedboth elements necessity and proportionality have been deemed essential to legitimate the preemptive use of force in customary international law7 effect of the united nations charter however with the founding of the united nations the right of individual states to use force was purportedly curbed the charter of the states in its preamble that the was established to save succeeding gene rations from the scourge of war and its substantive provisions obligate member states of the to settle their international disputes by peaceful means article 23 and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the rritorial integrity or political independence of any state or in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations article 24 in place of the traditional right of stat to use force the charter creates system of collective security in which the security council is authorized to determine the existence of any threat to the peace breach of the peace or act of aggression and to decide what measures shall be taken to maintain international peace and security article 39 although nominally outlawing most uses of force in international relations by individual states the charter does recognize right of nations to use force for the purpose of selfdefense artic 51 of the charter provides nothing in the present charter shall impa ir the inherent right of individual or collective selfdefence if an armed attack occurs against member of the united nations until the security council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security8 the exact scope of this right of selfdefen however has been the subject of ongoing debate read literally article 51s articulation of the right seems to preclude the preemptive use of force by i ndividual states or groupings of states and to reserve such uses of force exclusively to the security council measures in selfdefense in this understanding are legitimate only after an armed attack has already occurred9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21314crs4 9 continued attack id 211 10 statement by sir humphrey waldock quoted in roberts guy the

11 id 12 simma bruno ed the charter of the united nations commentary 1994 at 51 this contention finds some support in the advisory opi nion of the international court of justice in legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons 1996 icj reports 9697 in passing on the question of whether it might ever be lega l for nation to use nuclear weapons the court refused to construe article 51 or customary inte rnational law to preclude the use of nuclear weapons by state in an extreme circumstance of selfdefence in which its very survival would be at stake the courts decision did not specifically deal with the question of preemptive attack but it seems to give support to an expa nsive understanding of what might be permissible in instances of extreme necessity 13 proclamation 3504 27 fed reg 10401 october 25 1962others contend that article 51 should not be construed so narrowly and that it would be travesty of the purposes of the charter to compel defending state to allow its assailant to deliver the firs t and perhaps fatal blow 10 to read article 51 literally it is said is to protect the aggressors right to the first strike11 consequently to avoid this result some assert that article 51 recognizes the inherent right of individual or collective selfdefence as it developed in cu stomary international law prior to adoption of the charter and preserves it intact the re ference to that right not being impaired if an armed attack occurs against member of the united nations it is said merely emphasizes one important situation where that right may be exercised but does not exclude or exhaust other possibilities12 in further support of this view it is argued that the literal cons truction of article 51 simply ignores the reality that the cold war and other political considerations have often paralyzed the security council and that in pr actice states have continued to use force preemptively at times in the era and the international community has continued to evaluate the legitimacy of those uses under article 51 by the trad itional constraints of necessity and proportionality the following ex amples illustrate several aspects of these contentions in 1962 president kennedy in response to photographic evidence that the soviet union was installing medium range missiles in cuba capable of hitting the united state imposed naval quarantine on cuba in order to interdict the delivery of offensive weapons and associated material13 although president kennedy said that the purpose of the quarantine was to defend the security of the united states the us did not rely on the legal concept of selfdefense either as articulated in article 51 or otherwise as justification for its actions abram chayes the legal adviser to the state department at that time later explained the decision not to rely on that justification as followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21314crs5 14 see chayes the cuban missile crisis 1974 at 6364 quoted in carter barry and trimble phillip international law 1999 at 124142 15 the security council instead adopted resoluti on 242 calling on israel to withdraw from the territories and for the termination of all claims or states of belligerency and the acknowledgment of the territorial integrity and the right of every state in the region to live in peace 16 20 ilm 996 july 1981 excerpts from security council debate 17 id at 993 sres487 adopted on june 19 1981in retrospect i think the central difficulty with the article 51 argument was that it seemed to trivialize the whole effort at legal justification doubt the phrase armed attack must be construed broadly enough to permit some anticipatory response but it is very different matter to expand it to include threatening deploy ments or demonstrations that do not have imminent attack as their purpos or probable outcome to accept that reading is to make the occasion for fo rceful response essentially question for unilateral national decision that would not only be formally unreviewable but not subject to intelligent criticism either whenever nation believed that interests which in the heat and pressure of crisis it is prepared to characterize as vital were threatened its use of force in response would become permissible in this sense i believe that an article 51 defence would have signalle d that the united states did not take the legal issues involved very seriously that in its view the situation was to be governed by national discretion not international law14 in 1967 israel launched preemptiv attack on egypt and other arab states after president nasser had moved his army across the sinai toward israel forced the to withdraw its peacekeeping force from the sinai border and closed the port of aqaba to israeli shipping and after syria iraq jordan and saudi ar abia all began moving troops to the borders of israel in six days it routed egypt and its arab allies and had occupied the sinai peninsula the west bank nd the gaza strip israel claimed its attack was defensive in nature and necessary to forestall an arab invasion both the security council and the general assembly rejected proposals to condemn israel for its aggressive actions15 on june 7 1981 israel bombed and destroyed nuclear reactor under construction in iraq asserting that iraq considered itself to be in state of war with israel that it had participated in the three wars with israel in 1948 1967 and 1973 that it continued to ny that israel has right to exist and that its nuclear progra m was for the purpose of developing weapons capable of destroying israel israel claimed that in removing this terrible nuclear threat to its existence israel was only exercising its legitimate right of selfdefense within the meaning of this term in international law and as preser ved also under the united nations charter16 nonetheless the security council unanimously condemned the military attack by is rael in clear violation of the charter of the united nations and the norms of inte rnational conduct and urged the payment of appropriate redress17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21314crs6 18 the bush administration contends that we must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of rogue states and terrorists see white house the national security strategy of the united states of america sept 2002 at 15current situation thus in both theory and practice the preemp tive use of force appears to have home in current international law its clearest legal foundation is in chapter vii of the charter under article 39 the security council has the authority to determine the existence not only of breaches of the peace or acts of aggression that have already occurred but also of threats to the peace and under article 42 it has the authority to take such action by air sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security these authorities clearly seem to encompass the possibility of the preemptive use of force less clear is whether international law currently allows the preemptive use of fo rce by nation or group of nations without security council authorization that would s eem to be permissibl only if article 51 is read not literally but as preserving the use of force in selfdefense as traditionally allowed in customary international law as noted the construction of article 51 remains matter of debate but so construe d article 51 would not preclude the preemptive use of force by the us against iraq or other sovereign nations to be lawful however such uses of force would need to meet the traditional requirements of necess ity and proportionality as the examples listed above illustrate th requirement of necessity is most easily met when an armed attack is clearly imminent as in the case of the arabisraeli war of 1967 bu t beyond such obvious situations as abram chayes argued the judgment of necessity becomes increasingly subjective and there is at present consensus either in theory or practice about whether the posse ssion or development of weapons of mass destruction wmd by rogue state justifies the preemptive use of force most analysts recognize that if overwhelmingly lethal wea ponry is possessed by nation willing to use that weaponry directly or through surrogates s uch as terrorists some kind of anticipatory selfdefense may be matter of national survival and many including the bush administration contend that international law ought to allow if it does not already do so for the preemptive use of force in that situation18 but many states and analysts are decidedly reluctant to legitimate the preemptive use of force against threats that are only potential and not actual on the grounds the jus tification can easily be abused moreover it remains fact that the international community judged israels destruction of iraqs nuclear reactor site in 1981 to be an aggressive act rather than an act of selfdefense iraq has become an occasion to revisit the issue iraq had not attacked the us nor did it appear to pose an imminent threat of attack in traditional military terms as consequence it seems doubtful that the use of force against iraq coul d be deemed to meet the traditional legal tests justifying preemptive attack but iraq may have possessed wmd and it may have d ties to terrorist groups that s eek to use such weapons against the us if evidence is forthcoming on both of those issues then the situation necessarily raises the question that the bush administration articulated in its national security strategy ie whether the traditional law of preemption ought to be recast in light of the realities of wmd rogue states and terrorism iraq likely will not resolve that question but it is an occasion to crystallize the debate
