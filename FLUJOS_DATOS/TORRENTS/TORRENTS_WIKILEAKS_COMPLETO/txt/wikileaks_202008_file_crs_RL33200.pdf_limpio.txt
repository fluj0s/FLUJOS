of trafficking in persons have been defined in us law as sex trafficking in which commercial sex act is induced by force fraud or coercion or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age or the recruitment harboring transportation provision or obtaining of person for labor or services through the use of force fraud or coercion for the purpose of subjection to

ime_cicp_conventionhtmltrafficking and migration incidences of human trafficking are often affected by migration flows particularly when those flows are illegal and unregulated in recent years several fact ors have influenced emigration flows from latin america and the caribbean whereas large percentage of emigrants from latin america during the 1980s were refugees fleeing from the conflicts in central america majority of the regions mo re recent emigrants have been economic migrants in search of better payi ng jobs in developed countries3 primary destination countries for latin american immigrants ve included spain italy canada the netherlands britain and the united states these countries many with low birth rates and aging populations have come to rely on migrant laborers from latin america to fill lowpaying jobs in ag riculture constructi on manufacturing and domestic service at the sa time concerns about secur ity and other issues related to absorbing large numbers of foreign born populations have led many developed countries to tighten their immigration policies these factors have led to global rise in illegal immigration in the western hemisphere increasing illegal migration has been most evident in mexico particularly along its 1951mile northern bor der with the united states and its southern border with guatemala 596 miles and belize 155 miles in 2007 mexican authorities reporte d 115601 deportation events significant decline from the 182705 reported in 20064 the deportees though primarily from central america also included i ndividuals from south ameri can countries between 2002 and 2005 the number of nonmexican undoc umented migrants apprehended along the usmexico border more than tr ipled in 2005 nonmexicans 90 of whom were latin american accounted for 60 of the 134185 undocumented migrants apprehended in the rio grande s ection of the us mexico border5 the apprehension of nonmexicans along the border has decreased significantly since 2006 however some initially attributed th at decline to the national guard troop presence and new detention f acilities along the border more recently others have credited the department of homeland securitys increasing arrests of illegal migrants with discouraging wouldbe migrants from emigrating6 the current decline in the us economy is likely to be another contributing factor trafficking and alien smuggling in 2000 the united nations drafted two protocols known as the palermo protoc ols to deal with trafficking in persons and human smuggling7 trafficking in persons is of ten confused with alien or human smuggling alien smuggling involves the provision of service generally procurement or transport to people who know ingly consent to that service in

ends with the arrival of the migrant at their destination the trafficking pr otocol considers people who have been trafficked who are assumed to be primarily women and children as victims who are entitled to protection and broad range of social services from governments in contrast the smuggling protocol consid ers people who have been smuggled as willing participants in criminal activity who should be given humane treatment and full protection of their rights while be ing returned to their country of origin8 some observers contend that smuggling is crime against the state and that smuggled migrants should be immediately deported while trafficking is crime against person whose victims deserve to be given government assistance and protection9 the department of justice asserts that the existence of force fraud or coercion is what distinguishes trafficking from human smuggling10 under us immigration law trafficked alien is victim while an alien who consents to be smuggled may be subject to criminal pr osecution and deportati on others maintain that there are few clearcut distinctions between trafficking and smuggling cases and that many people who are considered smuggled should actually be viewed as trafficking victims they argue that as immigration and border restrictions have tightened smuggling costs have increased and migration routes have become more dangerous some smugglers have sold undocumented migrants into situations of forced labor or prostitution in order to recover their costs11 global figures on trafficking trafficking in persons for sexual exploitation or forced labor both within country and across in ternational borders is one of the most lucrative and fastest growing types of organized crime due to the clandestine nature of this type of crime it is difficult to gather reliable data on its prevalence in particular countries and regions of the world researchers have generally had to rely on estimates comp iled by nongovernme ntal organizations ngos in order to assess the scope of the global trafficking industry ngo reports on trafficking tend to contain more anecdotal evidence than concrete statistics in addition to the difficulty of gathering good statistics on clandestine activity countries may be reluctant to publish data for fear of being cited by the us government as having major traffickin g

caribbean plant and harvest produce in the united states w wages harsh working conditions and lack of legal protection combined with an ever increasing demand for cheap labor have resulted in growing

latin america and the ca ribbean individual risk factors include poverty unemployment illiteracy history of physical or sexual abuse homelessness drug use and gang membership the iom in colombia has identified some personal characteristics common among trafficking victims these include tendency to take risks in order to fulfill ones goals focus on shortterm rewards that may result from shortterm risks and lack of familia l support andor strong social networks33 these risk factors that may push an individual towards accepting risky job proposition in another country have been compounded by pull factors including the hope of finding economic opportunity abro ad which is fueled by television and internet images of wealth in the united states and europe outside factors contributing to human trafficking include the following 1 the high global demand for domestic servants agricultural laborers sex workers and factory labor 2 political social or econo mic crises as well as natural disasters occurring in particular countries 3 lingering machismo chauvinistic attitudes and practices that tends to lead to discrimination against women and girls 4 existence of established

their networks and operations others contend that trafficking is type of disorganized crime in which traffickers are generally individuals or small groups that collaborate on an adhoc basis rather than big business controlled by organized crime trafficking and hivaids one of the serious public health effects of human trafficking is the risk of victims cont racting and transmitting hivaids and

interim report for by february 2007 in advance of the next tip report tier 3 are the countries whose governments are deemed as not fully complying with the minimum standards and not making significant efforts to do so42 latin america and the tip rankings the 2008 tip report presents evidence that there has been some improvement on the part of governments in latin america in addressing the issue of human trafficking in 2008 cuba is the only latin american country identified as er 3 and made subject to possible us traffickingrelated sanctions43 however seven other countries including argentina costa rica dominican republic guatemala guyana panama and venezuela are on the tier 2 watch list in the 2008 report and could fall into the tier 3 category by 2009 according to the 2008 tip report while some countries made substantial progress in combating human trafficking others lagged behind mexico country that spent four years on the tier 2 watch li st earned tier 2 ranking in this years

tier 2 watchlist in recent tip reports whereas regional programs in latin am erica supported initiatives necessary to address the crosscutting nature of human trafficking bilateral programs aimed to help governments solve specific challeng they have had in addressing human trafficking for example antitrafficking programs in the dominican republic were targeted at combating child labor and identifying possible trafficking of victims from haiti programs in mexico imed to support the passage of trafficking legislation at the federal and state level and to train security and law enforcement officials on how to identify and treat tip victims program in guyana aimed to increase the capacity of the countrys judicial system to investigate and prosecute tip cases in addition to

funded by iom in central america colombia mexico and peru as of april 2008 those hotlines have received more than 50000 calls and led to the initiation of at least 60 police investigations45 country efforts progress and remaining challenges over the last few years most latin american countries perhaps motivated by international pressure or the threat of us sanctions have taken steps to address the growing problem of human trafficking as evidenced in table 1 majority of countries in the region have signed and ratified several intern ational protocols in which they have pledged to combat various aspects of the trafficking problem those agreements include the protocol to pr event suppress and punish trafficking in persons ilo conventions on abolishing forced labor and the worst forms of child labor the optional protocol to th convention on the rights of the child crc on the sale of children child prostitution and pornography and the optional protocol to the crc on the involvement of children in armed conflict number of countries including seven countries in 2007 also passed new or amended antitrafficking legislation and several created nati onal tip coordinators or task forces to coordinate antitip programs and initiatives most governments in the region that have received tier 3 designation though initially dismayed have worked with us officials to address the problem of trafficking in persons during the 90day grace period before the presidential determination the general problem with the new international commitments legal reforms and human trafficking initiatives

politics us trafficking report includes cuba and venezuela global information network june 10 2005implement their antitrafficking programs adequately sometimes country efforts are for example thwarted by larger problems such as political instability many countries have fe w if any shelters for trafficking victims and as in the case of paraguay followup plans to help victims after they return from overseas or to their residences in smaller towns acro ss the country some countries including guyana and belize have appeared to model their national tip laws so closely to tvpa that they do not have the resour ces or the manpower to implement the complicated legislation public corruption is also major obstacle to effective anti trafficking programming as there is often complicity between traffickers and corrupt border officials customs agents law enforcement personnel and politicians issues for policy consideration there are number of issues and foreign policy considerations affecting the implementation of antitrafficking in persons legislation that make us efforts on this front appear inconsistent at times indeed the state department has acknowledged that the united states has deep involved relationship with number of the countries in the tip report but that trafficking is an important moral issue that were not going to hesita to bring up with those countries46 as is the case with many human rights issues ethical concerns about human trafficking must be balanced against broader us geopolitical goals and interests in each country striking balance between these competing concerns is exacerbated by the difficulty of gauging the effectiveness of existing implementation efforts issues that may be considered when evaluating the implementation of us antitrafficking policies are discussed below balancing multiple us interests us interests in latin america are mu ltiple and at times conflicting these interests include strengthening democracy promoting economic growth through free trade stemming the flow of illegal na rcotics and undocumen ted migrants and cooperating on border security and antiterrorism measures these broad interests either directly or indirectly affect all us policy in the region and may at times conflict with specific human rights goals such as fighting human trafficking there are several ways in which broader us foreign policy goals may influence the tip report and sanctions process some observers maintain that there are certain us allies in the region that could never be sanctioned for political reasons others contend that the repeated inclusion of cuba and venezuela on the tier 3 list has constituted selective indignation on the part of the us government47 us embassy officials in the region have noted that it is sometimes difficult to produce an unbiased account of government efforts against trafficking without being swayed by underlying foreign policy concerns othe rs say that it is difficult to deal with trafficking in persons when country is undergoing extreme political instability andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33200crs16 48 interviews with state depart ment officials september

2003 governments in latin amer ica except cuba and venezuela have been subject to partial or full sanctions for failing to meet the minimum standards of tvpa ecuador appeared on the tier 3 list in both 2004 and 2005 but did not face sanctions some argue that sanctions will probably only be applied to c ountries already subject to sanctions such as burma cuba or north korea and that threatening other countries with sanctions may actually encourage them to become less open to working with the united states others argue that this may be the case with china or saudi arabia but most latin american countries depend on good political and ec onomic relations with the united states and fear the public humiliation that comes with tier 3 designation as much as actual sanctions for example some believe tier 3 designa tion motivated the government of belize to take several positive steps ag ainst trafficking in the summer of 2006 in this view the government of belize may have been mo tivated by the sanctions threat but it was also concerned with mainta ining its international image as good destination for foreign tourists measurements of success it is often difficult to measure success in the fight against human trafficking the state department has identified the passage of new tip legislation or the amendment of existing tip legislation to increase prosecutions of traffickers as evidence of some success since many c ountries in latin america have passed or amended their existing tip laws in recent years it follows that an increasing number of prosecutions and convictions under that legislation should be further indicator of success in combating tip in 2007 there were 426 prosecutions of suspected traffickers but only 113 convictions in latin america these figures pale in comparison to east asia and the p acific with 1074 prosecutions and 651 convictions and europe with 2820 pr osecutions and 1941 convictions in 2007 they also pale in comparison to the number of reported victims both in latin america and globally some have asserted that the low conviction rates in latin america may be due to the fact that it is easier to prosecute traffickers for other offenses such as money laundering than for trafficking in persons others have noted that even in the united states there were only 89 defendants charged with trafficking and 103 individuals

be addressed some have noted that countries instead of being enc ouraged to pass laws modeled after otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33200crs17 countries such as the tvpa need to be given time to develop trafficking laws that respond to their particular tip problem s and law enforcement capacities once legislation is in place more attention and resources may be needed to help countries implement that legislation nd that assistance may need to go beyond training for law enforcement and legal prof essionals third attention may be needed to address the issue of police corruption that has longplagued
