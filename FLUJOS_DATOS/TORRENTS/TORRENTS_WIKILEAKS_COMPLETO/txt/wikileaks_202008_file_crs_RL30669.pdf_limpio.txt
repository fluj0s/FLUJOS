first amendment activity and the supreme court has granted it great deference and protection however according to the court in its landmark 1976 decision buckley v valeo an absolutely free political marketplace is not required by the first amendmentnor is it desirablebecause without reasonable regulation corruption will result most notably the buckley court ruled that the spending of money in campaigns whether as contribution or an expenditure is form of speech protected by the first amendment the court upheld some infringements on free speech however in order to further the governmental interests of protecting the electoral process from corruption or the appearance of corruption in buckley the supreme court considered the constitutionality of the federal election campaign act of 1971 feca requiring political committees to disclose campaign contributions and expenditures and limiting to various degrees the ability of persons and organizations to make contributions and expenditures while first amendment freedoms and campaign finance regulation present conflicting means of attempting to preserve the integrity of the political process the court resolved this conflict in fa vor of the first amendment interests and subjected any regulation burdening free speech and free association to exacting scrutiny under this standard of review court will evaluate whether the governments interests in regulating are compelling examine whether the regulation burdens and outweighs first amendment liberties and inquire as to whether the regulation is narrowly tailored to serve the

regulation invokes two conflic ting values implicit in the application of the first amendments guarantee of free political speech and association on the one hand political expression constitutes core first amendment activity which the supreme court grants the greatest deference and protection in order to assure the unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people1 on the other hand according to the court in its landmark 1976 decision buckley v valeo2 an absolutely free political marketplace is neither mandated by the first amendment nor is it desirable because when left uninhibited by reasonable regulation corruptive pressures undermine the integrity of political institutions and undercut public confidence in republican governance in other words although the court reveres the freedoms of speech and association it has upheld infringements on these freedoms in order to further the government interests of protecting the electoral process from corruption or the appearance of corruption case law subsequent to buckley further illustrates that neither the freedom of speech and association nor the governments regulatory pow ers are absolute accordingly supreme court campaign finance holdings embody the doctrinal tension between striking reasonable balance between protecting the liberty interests in free speech and association on the one hand and upholding campaign finance regulation enacted with the intent to encourage political debate while protecting the election process from corruption on the other the court appears to uphold first amendment infringements by campaign finance regulation only insofar as the regulation is deemed necessary to preserve the very system of representative democracy that unregulated first amendment freedoms purport to insure 3 in buckley the court reviewed the constitutionality of the federal election campaign act of 1971 feca4 requiring political committees to disclose political contributions and expenditures and limited to various degrees the ability of natural persons and organizations to make political contributions and expenditures while first amendment freedoms and campaign finance regulation present conflicting means of preserving the integrity of the democratic political process the court resolved this conflict in fa vor of first amendment interests and subjected any regulation burdening free speech and free association activities to exacting scrutiny under this standard of review the court evaluates whether the states interests in regulation are compelling examines whether the regulation burdens and outweighs first amendment liberties and inquires whether the regulation is narrowly tailored to further its interest if regulation meets all three criteria the court will uphold it 1 roth v united states 354 us 476 484 1957 2 424 us 1 1976 3 for example in line of cases involving the regulation of corporations the court endeavored to resolve whether the first amendments value for open debate by diverse par ticipants permits the govern ment to impose regulations designed to promote fairness and prevent corporate monopolization of the political marketpl ace and whether the first amendments value for liberty proscribes the government fr om regulating the political speech and association rights of corporations compare buckley v valeo 424 us 1 4849 1976 the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the first amendment with buckley 424 us at 49 the first amendment was designed to secure the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources quoting new york times v

enunciated by the buckley court and then examines the courts extension of buckley in subsequent cases buckley s extensions are evaluated in various regulatory contexts contribution limits expenditure limits disclosure requirements and political party spending and electioneering communication restrictions when discussing the courts rationale in each case facts relevant to regulator are highlighted the object of regulation eg corporation labor union or natural person the asserted liberty interest eg freedom of speech or association the asserted regulatory interest eg deterring corruption the triggers of the regulatory interests eg political advantages gained by assuming the corporate form the means by which the regulator obtained those interests eg limiting campaign contributions the extent to which the regulation burdened first amendment liberties eg completely prohibiting expenditures above certain dollar amount and the scope of regulation eg whether the regulation was narrowly tailored to serve the compelling governmental interests g4g158g140g148g149g142g162g561g159g495g561g24g138g149g142g152g561 in buckley v valeo the supreme court considered the constitutionality of the federal election campaign act of 1971 feca as amended in 19745 and the presidential election campaign fund act6 the court upheld the constitutionality of certain statutory provisions including 1 contribution limitations to candidates for federal office7 2 disclosure and recordkeeping provisions8 and 3 the system of public financing of presidential elections9 the court found other provisions unconstitutional including 1 expenditures limitations on candidates and their political committees10 2 the 1000 limitation on independent expenditures11 3 expenditure limitations by candidates from their personal funds12 and 4 the method of appointing members to the federal election commission13 in general the court struck down expenditure limitations 5 in summary the feca provisions at issue contained spending limitations consisting of 1 1000 contribution cap to any candidate by any individual 2 25000 limit on an individuals annual aggregate contributions 3 1000 cap on persons or groups independent expenditures relative to clearly identified candidate 4 spending limits on various candidates for various federal offices and 5 spending limits on political parties national conventions b reporting and disclosure requirements on contributions and expenditures above certain thresholds and provision establishing the federal election commission to administer and enforce the statute the court evaluated spending and disclosure regulation under separate though interrelated lines of judicial principles evaluating facial challenge to spending limitations the court construed the regulation as burdening two sorts of speech acts 1 contributions which express the level of person or groups support of candidate and 2 independent expenditures which express the level of person or gro ups independent political point of view in addition to evaluating speech activity the court analyzed contributions and independent expenditures in c onnection with their associational value 6 26

requirements14 and voluntary spending limits linked with public financing provisions in considering the constitutionality of these statutes the buckley court applied the standard of review known as exacting scrutiny standa rd applied by court when presented with regulations that burden core first amendment activity exacting scrutiny requires regulation to be struck down unless it is narrowly tailored to serve compelling governmental interest g5g152g151g157g155g146g139g158g157g146g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g7g161g153g142g151g141g146g157g158g155g142g561g14g146g150g146g157g156g561 when analyzing first amendment claims court will generally first determine whether the challenged government action implicates speech or associational activity guaranteed by the first amendment most notably the buckley court held that the spending of money whether in the form of contributions or expenditures is form of speech protected by the first amendment number of principles contributed to the courts analogy between money and speech first the court found that candidates need to amass sufficient wealth to amplify and effectively disseminate their message to the electorate 15 second restricting political contributions and expenditures the court held necessarily re duces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed the depth of the exploration and the size of the audience reached this is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in todays mass society requires the expenditure of money 16 the court then observed that major purpose of the first amendment was to increase the quantity of public expression of political ideas as free and open debate is integral to the operation of the system of government established by our constitution17 from these general principles the court concluded that contributions and expenditures facilitated this interchange of ideas and could not be regulated as mere conduct unrelated to the underlying communicative act of making contribution or expenditure 18 however according to the court contributions and expenditures invoke different degrees of first amendment protection19 recognizing contribution limitations as one of fecas primary weapons against the reality or appearance of improper influence on candidates by contributors the court found that these limits serve the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process20 thus the court concluded that the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large financial contributions was sufficient compelling interest to warrant infringements on first amendment liberties to the extent that large contributions are given to secure quid pro quo from candidate 21 short of showing of actual corruption the 14 there are two exceptions to this general rule 1 disclosure requirements will pr obably not be upheld if disclosure of contributor places him or her at risk for ec onomic reprisal or physical threats for being publicly associated with the political group see naacp v alabama 357 us 449 1958 discussed infra and brown v socialist workers 459 us 87 1982 discussed infra and 2 disclosure requirements will probably not be upheld if they abridge the right of an individual to publish and distribute leaflets anonymously ex pressing political point of view in referenda or other issuebased election see mcintyre v ohio elections commission 514 us 334 1995 discussed infra 15 see buckley 424 us at 21 16 id at 19 17 id at 15 18 id at 17 19 see id at 24 20 id at 59 21 id at

contributions also justified these limitations22 reasonable contribution limits the court noted leave people free to engage in independent political expression to associate by volunteering their services and to assist candidates by making limited but nonetheless substantial contributions23 further reasonable contribution limitation does not undermine to any material degree the potential for robust and effective discussion of candidates and campaign issues by individual citizens associations the institutional press candidates and political parties 24 finally the court found that the contribution limits of feca were narrowly tailored insofar as the act focuses precisely on the problem of large campaign contributions25 on the other hand the court determined that fecas expenditure limits on individuals political action committees pacs and candidates imposed direct and substantial restraints on the quantity of political speech and were not justified by an overriding governmental interest26 the court rejected the governments asserted interest in equalizing the relative resources of candidates and in reducing the overall costs of campaigns restrictions on expenditures the court held constitute substantial restraint on the enjoyment of first amendment freedoms as opposed to reasonable limits on contributions which merely limit the expression of persons support of candidate the primary effect of limitations on expenditures is to restrict the quantity of campaign speech by individuals groups and candidates 27 restriction on the amount of money person or group can spend on political communication during campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed the depth of their exploration and the size of the audience reached the court noted28 the court also found that the governments interests in stemming corruption by limiting expenditures were not compelling enough to override the first amendments protection of free and open debate because unlike contributions the risk of quid pro quo corruption was not present as the flow of money does not directly benefit candidates campaign fund29 upon similar premise the court rejected the governments inte rest in limiting wealthy candidates ability to draw upon personal wealth to finance his or her campaign and struck down the personal expenditure limitation 30

association and belief issues the court held that these interests were adequately balanced by the states regulatory interests the state asserted three compelling interests in disclosure 1 providing the electorate with information regarding the distribution of capital between candidates and issues in campaign thereby providing voters with additional evidence upon which to base their vote 2 deterring actual and perceived corruption by exposing the source of large expenditures and 3 providing regulatory agencies with information essential to the election law enforcement however when disclosure requirements expose members or supporters of historically suspect political organizations to physical or economic reprisal 31 then disclosure may fail constitutional scrutiny as applied to

through voluntary income tax checkoff33 the court found first amendment violation in disallowing taxpayers to earmark their 100 checkoff for candidate or party of the taxpayers choice as the checkoff constituted an appropriation by congress it did not require outright taxpayer approval as every appropriation made by congress uses public money in manner to which some taxpayers object 34 the court also rejected number of fifth amendment due process challenges including challenge contending that the public financing provisions discriminated against minor and new party candidates by favoring major parties through the full public funding of their conventions and general election campaigns and by discriminating against minor and new parties who received only partial public funding under the act35 the court held that any risk of harm to minority interests cannot overcome the force of the governmental interests against the use of public money to foster frivolous candidacies create system

provided the genesis for the concept of issue and express advocacy communications in order to pass constitutional muster and not be struck down as unconstitutionally vague the court ruled that feca can only apply to noncandidate expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate for federal office ie expenditures for express advocacy communications37 in footnote to the buckley opinion the court further defines express words of advocacy of election or defeat as vote for lect support cast your ballot for smith for congress vote against defeat and reject38 communications not meeting the express advocacy definition are commonly referred to as issue advocacy communications in its rationale for establishing such bright line distinction between issue and express advocacy the court noted that the discussion of issues and candidates as well as the advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application that is candidatesespecially incumbentsare intimately tied to public issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions according to the court 39

as well this case involved 2 usc 441aa1 of feca which limits individual contributions to pacs to 5000 per year44 an unincorporated association of medical professionals the doctors and the associations affiliated political action committee the pac challenged fecas contribution limits alleging inter alia violation of their free speech and association rights the doctors argued that 441aa1 was unconstitutional because it inhibited their use of the pac as proxy for their political expression 45 moreover the doctors contended that the contribution limit did not serve compelling state interest because the risk of corruption is not present where money does not flow directly into candidates coffers46 unpersuaded the supreme court upheld fecas contribution limits in evaluating the doctors free speech interest the court held that the doctors speech by proxy theory was not entitled to full first amendment protection because buckley reserved this protection for independent and direct political speech 47 the court found that the pac was not simply the doctors political mouthpiece but was separate legal entity that received funding from multiple sources and engaged in its own independent political advocacy48 in rejecting the doctors speech by proxy theory the court construed the doctors relationship with the pac as providing support through campaign contributions which does not warrant the same level of first amendment protection as independent political speech49 in evaluating the states interests the cma court rejected the pac and the doctors argument that the risk of corruption is not present when contributions are made to pac the court interpreted this argument as implying that congress cannot limit individuals and unincorporated associations from making contributions to multicandidate political committees this rationale the court held undercuts fecas statutory scheme by allowing individuals to circumvent fecas limits on individual contributions 50 and aggregate contributions51 by making contributions to pac hence the doctors rationale would erode congress legitimate interest in protecting the integrity of the political process52 under buckley the court held that the states regulatory interests outweighed the doctors relatively weak free speech interest 44 see id at 184 related provision 2 usc 441af makes it unlawful for political committee

berkeley 53 the supreme court addressed whether city ordinance imposing 250 limit on contributions made to committees formed to support or oppose ballot measures violated pacs liberty interest in free speech and free association under the fourteenth amendment54 citizens against rent control the group an unincorporated association formed to oppose berkeley ballot initiative imposing rent control on various properties challenged the ordinances constitutionality the court found for the group on freedom of association and freedom of speech grounds the court held that while the limit placed restraint on an individual acting alone it clearly restrained the right of association as the ordinance burdened individuals who wished to band together to voice their collective viewpoint on ballot measures 55 the court applied exacting scrutiny to the ordinance weighing the citys regulatory interests against the groups associational rights56 while the court noted that buckley permitted contribution limits to candidates in order to prevent corruption contributions tied to ballot measures pose risk of corruption57 moreover as the ordinance required contributors to disclose their identity the regulation posed risk that voters would be confused by who supported the speech of the association58 under exacting scrutiny therefore the 250 contribution limitation was held unconstitutional extending its holding the court found that the contribution limitations unduly burdened the free speech rights of the group and of individuals who wish to express themselves through the group59 applying exacting scrutiny the court found si gnificant public interest in restricting debate and discussion of ballot measures and held that the ordinances disclosure requirement

ac61 the supreme court considered among other things whether buckley s approved limitations on campaign contributions established minimum for state contribution limits today with or without adjustment for inflation asserting free speech and association rights political action committee and candidate challenged the facial validity of missouri regulation limiting contributions to amounts ranging from 275 to 1075 62 missouri asserted interests similar to those articulated in buckley namely that contribution limits serve the governmental interest in avoiding the real and perceived corruption of the electoral process63 the eighth circuit found these interests unpersuasive and required missouri to show that there were genuine problems that resulted from the contributions in amounts greater than the limits in place 64 the court granted certiorari to review the agreement between the eighth circuits evidentiary requirement and buckley 65 reversing the court found missouris regulatory interests compelling and negated the proposition that the 1000 limit upheld by buckley is constitutional floor to state contribution limitations66 though the court reviewed the case under an exacting scrutiny standard67 it upheld the regulation since it was closely drawn to match sufficiently important interest68 notwithstanding the narrow tailoring requirement the court held that the limitations dollar amount need not be fine tuned 69 as the risk of corruption is greater when money flows directly into campaigns coffers the court found that contribution limits are more likely to withstand constitutional scrutiny in these cases contributors free speech interest is less compelling since contributions merely index for candidate support not the contributors independent political point of view70 addressing the lower courts evidentiary requirement the court noted that the quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justifications raised71 however it found that missouri cleared the standard implied by buckley and its progeny72 given the relative weakness of the asserted free speech and associational interests as compared to the states weighty regulatory interest the court upheld the missouri state campaign contribution limits 61 528 us 377 2000 62 id at 901

attempted to extend the mcfl exception to contributions by taxexempt corporations finding that limits on contributions are more clearly justified under the first amendment than limits on expenditures the court reaffirmed the prohibition on all corporations making direct treasury contributions in connection with federal elections and upheld the ban on corporate contributions as applied to ncrl according to the court quoting from some of its earlier decisions it has upheld the well established constitutional validity of regulating corporate contributions including contributions by membersh ip corporations that might not exhibit all the evil that contributions by traditional economically organized corporations exhibit 75 stating its refusal to secondguess legislative determination as to the need for prophylactic measures where corruption is the evil feared the court rejected the argument that deference to congressional judgments is determined by whether the corporations affected by regulation are forprofit or nonprofit76 beaumont also clarified the standard for review applicable to campaign finance regulation under the first amendment in the view of the court determining the appropriate standard of review depends on the nature of the activity being regulated commencing with its 1976 ruling in buckley the court said that it has treated the regulation of contributions as only marginal speech restriction subject to relatively complaisant review under the first amendment since contributions are less direct form of speech than expenditures 77 hence the court concluded that instead of requiring contribution regulation to pass strict scrutiny by meeting the requirement that it be narrowly tailored to serve compelling governmental interest contribution regulation involving significant interference with associational rights passes constitutional muster by merely satisfying the lesser requirement of being closely drawn to 73 539 us 146 2003 74 479 us 238 1986

section 441b prohibition passed this lower level of scrutiny because it does not render complete ban on corporate contributions ie corporations are still permitted to use treasury funds to establish solicit funds for and pay the administrative expenses of political action committee or pac which can then in turn make contributions79 invoking its unanimous holding in fec v national right to work the court rejected the argument that the regulatory burdens on pacs including restrictions on their ability to solicit funds renders pac unconstitutional as the only way that corporation can make political contributions 80 in summary the supreme court in fec v beaumont upheld the ban on corporate contributions as applied to ncrl because corporate campaign contributionsincluding contributions by tax exempt advocacy corporationspose risk of harm to the political system consequently the court found courts owe deference to legislative judgments on how best to address their risk of harm in addition the court announced that limits on contributions are merely marginal speech restrictions subject to relatively complaisant or lesser review under the first amendment than the strict scrutiny

of boston v bellotti the supreme court held that the fact that the corporation is the speaker does not limit the scope of its interests in free expression as the scope of first amendment protection turns on the nature of the speech not the identity of the speaker however as demonstrated in fec v massachusetts citizens for life inc mcfl and austin v michigan chamber of commerce the fact that the speaker is corporation may elevate the states interests in regulating corporations expressive activity on equitable grounds mcfl and austin appear to expand the courts governmental interest jurisprudence from the interest identified in buckley ie avoiding candidate corruption to broader interest of avoiding corruption in the entire electoral process although the court emphasized that equalizing the relative voices of persons and entities in the political process is not valid regulatory end mcfl and austin appear to hold that the government has equitable interests in ensuring fair and open debate in the political marketplace by preventing corporate monopolization however in both cases the court stressed that corporate wealth in itself is not valid object of speech suppression in first national bank of boston v bellotti 88 the supreme court evaluated the constitutional basis of massachusetts criminal statute which in pertinent part prohibited corporate expenditures made to influence the outcome of referendum the statute did not completely ban corporate expenditures it permitted expenditures when referendums outcome could materially affect corporations business property or assets89 bellotti arose in connection with proposed state constitutional amendment permitting the state to impose graduated tax on an individuals income90 when the proposal was presented to the voters group of corporations wanted to expend money to publicize their point of view91 however their desire was burdened by the statutory provision stating that issues concerning the taxation of individuals do not materially affect corporate interest92 the corporations sought to prevent enforcement of the statute 86 470 us 1 1985 87 548 us 230 2006 88 435 us 765 1978 89 id at 768 90 id at 769

fourteenth amendments93 in agreement with the corporations the suprem court struck down the statute first the bellotti court considered whether speakers corporate identity substantively affects the extension of first amendment liberties on the states contention that the scope of the first amendment narrows when the speaker is corporation the court found constitutional support94 this conclusion followed from the courts framing of the issues the court did not address the question of whether corporate interests in free speech are coextensive with those of natural persons finding the issue peripheral to the cases efficient resolution95 instead the threshold issue was whether the statute proscribed speech that the first amendment was meant to protect96 in other words the court focused on the nature of the speech not the identity of the speaker as the massachusetts statute burdened expressive activity addressing proposed amendment to the state constitution the nature of the speech fell squarely within the historic and doctrinal mandate of the first amendmentprotecting the free discussion of governmental affairs 97 as the corporations asserted core first am endment interests the statute was subject to exacting scrutiny triggering the remaining issues where the court considered whether the governments regulatory interests were compelling and obtained by narrowly tailored means98 massachusetts advanced two rationales for the prohibition of corporate speech 1 elevating and sustaining the individuals role in electoral politics and 2 ensuring that corporate political expenditures are funded by shareholders who agree with their corporations political views 99 in the context of candidate elections the court found these rationales weighty but in direct democracy context they were simply not advanced in material way100 while ensuring that individuals sustain confidence in government and maintain an active role in elections is of the highest importance101 the bellotti court did not find that regulating corporate speech would necessarily enhance the role of the individual in this context the court reasoned that the inclusion of corporate political perspectives does not demonstrate that they will unduly influence the outcome of referendum vote102 and stressed that restricting the speech of some to amplify the voice of others is not valid object suppression103 as such the court held that permitting corporate speech in referendum does not exert coercive pressures real or perceived on the direct democracy process 104 93 id at 769 94 see id at

interest in protecting minority shareholders who object to their corporations majority political philosophy with respect to this interest the court found the statute was both over and underinclusive the statute was over inclusive insofar as it proscribed corporate speech where the corporate political policy and speech enjoyed unanimous assent by its members105 the court emphasized that corporate democracy informs the decision to engage in public debate that shareholders are presumed to protect their own interests and that they are t compelled to contribute additional funds to their corporations political activities 106 the statute was underinclusive insofar as corporations may exert political influence by lobbying for the passage and defeat of legislation and may express its political views on an issue when it does arise in connection to ballot measure107 as result the court held that the statute unduly infringed on the corporations protected free speech interest in expressing its political point of view108 the supreme court in federal election commission fec v massachusetts citizens for life mcfl109 evaluated the constitutional application of 2 usc 441b of the federal election campaign act feca prescribing separate segregated fund or pac for corporate political expenditures in this case the requirement was applied to nonprofit corporation founded for purely political purposes the founding charter of mcfl was to foster respect for life purpose motivating various educational and public policy activities110 drawing from its general treasury the corporation funded preelection publication entitled everything you need to know to v ote prolife which triggered litigation under 441b111 as the publication was tantamount to an explicit directive to vote for named candidates mcfls speech constituted express advocacy of the election of particular candidates subjecting the expenditure to regulation112 under the express advocacy standard first articulated by the court in buckley 113 however as applied to mcfl 441b was held unconstitutional because it infringed on protected speech without compelling justification114 noting that 441b burdened expressive activity115 the court examined the governments regulatory interests in alleviating corruptive influences in elections by requiring the use of corporate pacs and the court held that concentration of wealth in itself is not valid object of regulation 116 the court noted that corporations ability to amass large treasuries confers upon it an unfair advantage in the political marketplace as general

the corporations politics117 by requiring the use of pac 441b ensures that corporations independent expenditure fund indexes for the popular support of its political ideas118 the court held that by prohibiting general treasury fund expenditures to advance political point of view the regulation ensured that competition among actors in the political arena is truly competition among ideas119 while the court found these interests compelling as applied to most corporations it held the restriction unconstitutional as applied to mcfl specifically the mcfl court found the following characteristics exempt corporation fr om the regulation 1 its organizational purpose is purely political 2 its shareholders have economic incentive in the organizations political activities and 3 it was not founded by nor accepts contributions from business organizations or labor unions120 carving out an exception for corporations with these characteristics the court raised equitable grounds for the regulation stressing that regulation of corporate political activity has reflected concern not about the use of the corporate form per but about the potential for the unfair deployment of general treasury funds for political purposes121 the court held that mcfls general treasury is not function of its economic success but is an index for membership support of its political ideas122 thus according to the court purely political organizations such as mcfl cannot constitutionally be regulated by 441b because their treasuries already embody what the regulation purports to achieve an index of the corporations political support in other words mcfl is an example of corporation that is not at risk for gaining an unfair advantage in the electoral process 123 in austin v michigan state chamber of commerce124 the supreme court affirmed and clarified its mcfl holding when it considered whether nonprofit corporations free speech rights were unconstitutionally burdened by state prohibition on using general treasury funds to finance corporations independent expenditures in state elections while prohibiting expenditures from general treasury funds125 the statute permitted independent contributions as long as they were made from separate segregated fund or pac126 plaintiffcorporation nonprofit founded for political and nonpolitical purposes asserted that the regulation burdened its

further the plaintiff contended that the regulation was not narrowly tailored to obtain the states interests in avoiding the appearance of corruption by limiting corporate entitys inherent ability to concentrate economic resources128 although economic power in itself does not necessarily index the persuasive value of corporations political ideas the state argued corporations structural ability to amass wealth makes it formidable political presencea presence which triggers its regulatory interest129 unpersuaded by the corporations assertion of right the court upheld the regulation under buckley130 and mcfl131 the court addressed whether the plaintiffs free speech interests were burdened by the regulation evaluated the states regulatory interests and asked whether the regulation was narrowly tailored to achieve those interests132 the court found that the plaintiffs freedom of expression was burdened by the regulation but held that the state achieved its compelling interests by narrowly tailored means by limiting the source of corporations independ ent expenditures to special segregated fund or pac the austin court held that the regulation burdened the plaintiffs freedom of expression 133 the regulation placed various organizational and financial burdens on corporations management of its pac134 limited pac solicitations to corporate members only135 and prohibited independent expenditures from corporate treasury funds136 similar to its finding in mcfl the court found that the statutes requirements burdened but did not stifle the corporations exercise of free expression to point sufficient to raise genuine first amendment claim137 thus to overcome the claim the regulation had to be motivated by compelling governmental interests and be narrowly tailored to serve those interests first the austin court evaluated the states regulatory interests the state argued that corporations unique legal and economic characteristics138 renders it formidable political presence in the market place of ideas which necessitates regulation of its political expenditures to avoid corruption or the appearance of corruption139 the court stressed that the regulations 127 see

corporate and noncorporate speakers but to ensure that expenditures reflect actual public support for political ideas espoused by corporations140 moreover the court was careful to emphasize that the mere fact that corporations can amass large treasuries was not its justification for upholding the statute rather the court identified the compelling state interest as the unique stateconferred corporate structure which facilitates the amassing of large amounts of wealth141 on these grounds the court appeared to recognize valid regulatory interest in assuring that the conversion of economic capital to political capital is done in an equitable way in other words the court held that corruption of the electoral process itself rather than just the corruption of candidates is compelling regulatory interest after finding compelling state interest the austin court determined that the regulation was neither overinclusive nor under inclusive with respect to its burden on expressive activity responding to the plaintiffs argument that the regulation was overinclusive insofar as it included closely held corporations which do not enjoy the same capital resources as larger or publiclyheld corporations the court ruled that the special benefits conferred to corporations and their potential for amassing large treasuries justified the restriction142 plaintiffs under inclusiveness argument alleging that the regulatory scheme failed to include unincorporated labor unions with large capital assets fared better the court distinguished labor unions from corporations on the ground that unions amass large treasuries without the significant state conferred advantages of the corporate structure 143 here again the court remarked that the corporate structure not corporate wealth triggers the states interest in regulating corporations independent expenditures144 hence despite the burden on political speech the court upheld the regulation because it was narrowly tailored to reach the states compelling interests145 in sum the austin court clarified mcfl and upheld the threepart test for when corporation is exempt from the states general interest in requiring corporation to use separate segregated fund or pac for its independent expenditures146 under austin corporation is exempt from the pac requirement when 1 the organizat ion was formed for the

committee nrwc151 the supreme court evaluated 2 usc 441bb4 of feca which requires labor unions to solicit only members when amassing funds for its separate segregated fund or pac in particular the court considered inter alia whether the federal election commissions fec interpretation of member abridged nrwcs associational rights and held that it did not the nrwc nonprofit corporation essentially considered anyone who gave contribution member152 on the other hand the fec advanced narrower definition of member under which participant would have to display various levels of involvement with the soliciting organization beyond providing contribution153 or the participant would have to enjoy responsibilities rather than mere privileges in connection to the soliciting organization154 persuaded by the fecs interpretation the court held that nrwcs asserted associational liberties were burdened by the fecs definition but were overborne by the states regulatory interests155 while associational rights are basic constitutional freedoms deserving of the closest scrutiny they are not absolute156 while 441b restricts the solicitations of corporations and labor unions thereby restricting their freedom of association the state had an interest in hedging corporations and labor organizations particular legal and economic attributes since they 148 id at 663

paying nonunion member employees for activities unrelated to collective bargaining contract administration and grievance adjustment the plain language of the act permits an employer and an exclusive bargaining representative to enter into an agreement requiring all employees in the bargaining unit to pay periodic union dues and initiation fees as condition of continued employment whether or not the employees otherwise wish to be member of the union see beck 487 us at 736 the court found that congress intended to correct abuses associated with closed shop agreements by limiting compulsory unionism to regimes that require nonmember contributions only insofar as they are necessary to defray the costs of collectivebargaining efforts made on behalf of union and nonunion employees see id at

crp on portion of its as applied challenge the courts ruling turned on whether crps ad purchase was an independent expenditure campaign contribution or coordinated expenditure169 independent expenditures the court noted do not raise heightened governmental interests in regulation because the money is deployed to advance political point of view independent of candidates viewpoint170 indeed the court found that when independent expenditures display little coordination and prearrangement between the payor and candidate they alleviate the expenditures corruptive influence on the polity171 moreover the court stressed that restrictions on independent expenditures represent substantial restraints on the quantity and diversity of political speech172 and constrict core first amendment activity173 however restrictions on contributions which only marginally impair contributors ability to engage in free communication174 do not burden free speech interests to the same degree and decrease the risk that corruptive influences will taint the political process175 similarly coordinated expenditures are not as inviolable as independent expenditures because they are the functional equivalent of contribution and accordingly they trigger regulatory interests in staving off real and perceived corruption176 given the heightened first amendment protection of independent expenditures the court did not see how provision that limits political partys independent expenditures could withstand constitutional scrutiny 177 the court held that the crps ad purchase was an independent expenditure deserving constitutional protection in categorizing the expend iture the court emphasized that at the time of the purchase the republicans had not nominated candidate and that the crps chairman independently developed the script offering it for review only to the partys staff and the partys executive director 178 moreover the court held that the crp asserted significant free speech interests because independent expression of political partys philosophy is core first amendment activity179 according to the court the crps first amendm ent interests were not counterbalanced by the states interest in protecting the sanctity of the political process as restraints on party expenditures neither eliminate nor alleviate corruptive pressures on the candidate through an expectation of quid pro quo 180 the greatest risk for corruption the court recognized resided in the ability of an individual to circumvent the 1000 restraint on individual contributions by 168 see id at 613 169 see

will benefit particular candidate however the court did not believe that the risk of corruption here could justify the markedly greater burden on basic freedoms caused by limitations on expenditures181 if anything the court remarked an independent expenditure originating from 20000 donation that is controlled by political party rather than an individual donor would seem less likely to corrupt than similar independent expenditure made directly by donor182 additionally the court held that the statute was not overly broad and was narrowly tailored to obtain its compelling interests in fec v colorado republican federal campaign committee colorado ii 183 the supreme court ruled 5 to 4 that political partys coordinated expenditures unlike genuine independent expenditures may be limited in order to minimize circumvention of feca contribution limits while the courts opinion in colorado i was limited to the constitutionality of the application of fecas party expenditure provision 184 to an independent expenditure by the colorado republican party crp in colorado ii the court considered facial challenge to the constitutionality of the limit on coordinated party spending persuaded by evidence supporting the fecs argument the court found that coordinated party expenditures are indeed the functional equivalent of contributions185 therefore in its evaluation the court applied the same scrutiny to the coordinated party expenditure provision that it has applied to other contribution limits ie whether the restriction is closely drawn to the sufficiently important governmental interest of stemming political corruption 186 the court further determined that circumvention of the law through prearranged or coordinated expenditures amounting to disguised contributions is valid theory of corruption187 in upholding the limit the court noted that substantial evidence demonstrates how candidates donors and parties test the limits of the current law which the court concluded shows beyond serious doubt how contribution limits would be eroded if inducement to circumvent them were enhanced by declaring parties coordinated spending wide open 188 although federal election commission fec v demo cratic senatorial campaign committee dscc189 dealt primarily with issues of statutory construction and application the supreme courts rationale is relevant to the extension of buckley and the first amendment generally specifically the court addressed whether 2 usc 441ad of feca which prohibits party committees from making expenditures on behalf of

interpretation of 441ad permitting the nrsc to make such expenditures191 the court affirmed the fecs interpretation under buckley the court held inter alia the fecs interpretation was not inconsistent with the purpose of feca192 agency agreements do not raise the risk of corruption nor the appearance of corruption spawned by the real or perceived coercive effect of large candidate contributions so long as the candidate is not party to the agency relationship193 under an agency agreement contribution limits to candidates apply with equal force when committee transfers its spending authority to one of its affiliate committeesthe agreement does not increase the expenditure of single additional dollar under feca194 thus the court held noncandidate agency agreements are consistent with buckley

protected as independent expenditures197 ncpac intended to raise and expend money for the purposes of running radio and television ads to encourage voters to elect reagan holding 9012f unconstitutional the court found that the expenditure limitation burdened ncpacs core first amendment speech that it was supported by comparatively weak state interest and that it was fatally overinclusive the court noted that in buckley it had upheld expenditure restrictions on individual and political advocacy associations however in this case the fact that ncpacs expenditures were not made in coordination with the candidate supplied the distinguishing key opening the door to first amendment protection in sum regulation may not burden noncandidates first amendment rights based on whether candidate accepts or does not accept public funds the court first determined whether ncpac was entitled to first amendment protection after interpreting the statute as proscribing ncpacs expenditures the court concluded that the proscription burdened speech of the most fundamental first amendment activities as the 190 see id at 29 30 191 see id at 31 192 see id at 41 193 see id 194

candidates is integral to democratic form of governance198 while the statute did not exact prior restraint on ncpacs political speech the court held that limiting their expenditures to more than 1000 in todays sophisticated and expensive media market was akin to allowing speaker in public hall to express his views while denying him the use of an amplifying system199 the court then rejected the argument that ncpacs organizational structure eroded its first amendment liberty interests associational values and class consciousness pervaded the courts reasoning for example the court stressed that political committees are mechanisms by which large numbers of individuals of modest means can join together in organizations which serve to amplify the voice of the committees adherents200 moreover the court did not find that individuals were speaking through political committee constitutionally significant to say that collective action in pooling resources to amplify political perspective is not entitled to full first amendment would unduly di sadvantage those of modest means 201 the court distinguished its holding in national right to work committee202 which upheld feca regulation of corporations and unions by virtue of their unique organizational structure and noted that organizational structure is irrelevant to its facial analysis of 9012f because the statute equally burdens informal groups who raise and expend money in support of federally funded presidential candidates203 after concluding that ncpacs first amendment liberties were burdened by 9012f the court evaluated the states regulatory interests and asked whether the section was narrowly tailored to reach those interests the states interests in alleviating the specter of corruption through regulation which proscribes uncoordinated independent expenditures by informal and formal organizations were not compelling to the court as independent expenditures may well provide little assistance to the candidates campaign and indeed may prove counter productive as such the court held that low probability of truly independent expenditures materializing into political debt owed by the candidate to an independent speaker significantly undermined the states asserted interest in deterring actual and perceived corruption entertaining the states contention that the ability of political committees to amass large pools of funds increase the risk of corruption tainting the political process the court held that 9012f was fatally overinclusive as it included within its scope informal groups that barely clear the 1000 limitation 204 g14g146g150g146g157g146g151g144g561g7g161g153g142g151g141g146g157g158g155g142g156g561g139g162g561g5g138g151g141g146g141g138g157g142g156g561g507

expenditure limits the state of vermont proffered that they were justified by the state interest in reducing the amount of time that candidates spend raising money that is according to brief filed by vermont attorney general sorrell absent expenditure limits increased campaign costscoupled with the fear of running against an opponent having more fundsmeans that candidates need to spend more time fundraising instead of engaging in public debate and meeting with voters supporters of the law further argued that in buckley the court did not consider this timesaving rationale and had it done so it would have upheld fecas expenditure limitations back in 1976 207 while unable to reach consensus on single opinion six justices of the supreme court agreed that first amendment free speech guarantees were violated by the vermont expenditure limits announcing the courts judgment and delivering an opinion which was joined by chief justice roberts and justice alito justice breyer found that there was not significant basis upon which to distinguish the expenditure limits struck down in buckley from the expenditure limits at issue in randall according to justice breyer it was highly unlikely that fuller consideration of the time protection rationale would have changed buckley s result208 in buckley the court recognized the link between expenditure limits and reduction in the time needed by candidate for fundraising but nonetheless struck down spending limits as unconstitutional209 therefore justice breyers opinion concluded given buckley s continued authority the court must likewise strike down vermonts expenditure limits as violating the first amendment210 g6g146g156g140g149g152g156g158g155g142g561g20g142g154g158g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g156g561 this section analyzes supreme

in candidate elections is not as great in ballot initiatives because there is corrupting object present especially at the time of petition 227 ergo the court held that while compelling state interests

against enforcement of the requirement and challenged the constitutionality of the statute as applied to its fundraising and expenditure activities231 agreeing with the plaintiff the court upheld the constitutional challenge this was fact intensive holding the brown court affirmed buckley s prohibition on compelled disclosures where contributors would be subject to reasonable probability of

of the first amendment in particular which protects unpopular individuals from retaliation and their ideas from suppression at the hand of an intolerant society245 the court recalled for example that the federalist papers were published under fictitious names246 balanced against the parents interests in anonymous publishing the court acknowledged ohios interest in preventing the dissemination of

prevent fraud and libel and because persons name has little significance to evaluating the normative weight of speakers message247 thus the court held that the statute was not narrowly tailored to serve its regulatory interests and therefore struck it down the mcintyre court specifically found that neither bellotti nor buckley were controlling in the mcintyre case bellotti concerned the scope of first amendment protection afforded to corporations and the relevant portion of the buckley opinion concerned mandatory disclosure of campaign expenditures248 neither case involved prohibition of anonymous campaign literature in buckley the court noted it had stressed the importance of providing the electorate with information regarding the origin of campaign funds and how candidates spend those funds but that such information had relevance to the kind of independent activity in the case of mcintyre required disclosures about the level of financial support candidate has received from various sources are supported by an interest in avoiding the appearance of corruption that has application in this case the court stated 249 moreover the court found that independent expenditure disclosure above certain threshold which the court upheld in buckley250 although clearly impeding first amendment activity is far cry from compelled selfidentification on all electionrelated writings an election related document particularly leaflet is often personally crafted statement of political viewpoint and as such compelled identification is particularly intrusive according to the court in contrast the court found expenditure disclosure reveals far less information that is even though money may talk its speech is less specific less personal and less provocative than handbilland as result when money supports an unpopular viewpoint it is less likely to precipitate retaliation 251 further distinguishing buckley the mcintyre court found that not only is prohibition on anonymous campaign literature more intrusive than the disclosure requirements upheld in buckley but it rests on different and less powerful state interests252 the federal election campaign act feca at issue in

finance ruling since buckley v valeo the supreme court in its 2003 decision mcconnell v fec255 upheld against facial constitutional challenges key portions of the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 bcra256 also known as the mccain feingold or shaysmeehan campaign finance reform law in mcconnell 5to4 majority of the court upheld restrictions on the raising and spending of previously unregulated political party soft money and prohibition on corporations nd labor unions using treasury funds to finance electioneering communications requiring that such ads may only be paid for with corporate and labor union political action committee pac funds the court invalidated bcras requirement that parties choose between making independent expenditures or coordinated expenditures on behalf of candidate and its prohibition on minors age 17 and under making campaign contributions by 5to4 vote the mcconnell court upheld two critical bcra provisions titles i and ii against facial constitutional challenges in the majority opinion coauthored by justices stevens and oconnor and joined by justices souter ginsburg and breyer the court upheld the limits on raising and spending previously unregulated political party soft money title i and the prohibition on corporations and labor unions using treasury fundswhich is unregulated soft moneyto finance directly electioneering communications title ii in upholding bcras two principal complementary features the court readily acknowledged that it is under illusion that bcra will be the last congressional statement on the matter of money in politics the court observed money like water will always find an outlet hence campaign finance issues that will inevitably arise and the corresponding legislative responses from congress are concerns for another day 257 g20g142g156g157g155g146g140g157g146g151g144g561g18g152g149g146g157g146g140g138g149g561g18g138g155g157g162g561g21g152g143g157g561g15g152g151g142g162g561 title

their ability to do so in connection with state and local elections and prevents circumvention of the restrictions on national state and local party committees by prohibiting state and local candidates from raising and spending soft money to fund advertisements and other public communications that promote or attack federal candidates260 plaintiffs challenged title i based on the first amendment as well as art i 4 of the us constitution principles of fede ralism and the equal protection component of the due process clause of the 14th amendment the court upheld the constitutionality of all provisions in title i finding that its provisions satisfy the first amendment test applicable to limits on campaign contributions they are closely drawn to effect the sufficiently important interest of preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption rejecting plaintiffs contention that the bcra restrictions on campaign contributions must be subject to strict scrutiny in evaluating the consti tutionality of title i the court applied the less rigorous standard of reviewclosely drawn scrutiny citing its landmark 1976 decision buckley v valeo and its progeny the court noted that it has long subjected restrictions on campaign expenditures to closer scrutiny than limits on contributions in view of the comparatively marginal restriction upon the contributors ability to engage in free communication that contribution limits entail261 the court observed that its treatment of contribution limits is also warranted by the important interests that underlie such restrictions ie preventing both actual corruption threatened by larg dollar contributions as well as the erosion of public confidence in the electoral process resulting from the appearance of corruption262 the court determined that the lesser standard shows proper deference to congress ability to weigh competing constitutional interests in an area in which it enjoys particular expertise263 finally the court recognized that during its lengthy consideration of bcra congress properly relied on its authority to regulate in this area and hence considerations of stare decisis as well as respect for the legislative branch of government provided additional powerful reasons for adhering to the treatment of contribution limits that th court has consistently followed since 1976 264 responding to plaintiffs argument that many of the provisions in title i restrict not only contributions but also the spending and solicitati on of funds that were raised outside of fecas contribution limits the court determined that it is irrelevant that congress chose to regulate contributions on the demand rather than the supply side indeed the relevant inquiry is whether its mechanism to implement contribution limit or to prevent circumvention of that limit burdens speech in way that direct restriction on contribution would not the court concluded that title i only burdens speech to the extent of contribution limit it merely limits the source and individual amount of donations simply because title i accomplishes its goals by prohibiting the spending of soft money does not render it tantamount to an expenditure limitation 265 in his dissent justice kennedy criticized the majority opinion for ignoring established constitutional bounds and upholding campaign finance statute that does not regulate actual or 260 2 usc 441ib 441id 441ie 441if 261 mcconnell 124 s ct at 647 quoting fec v beaumont 123 s ct 2200 2003 262 id at 656 quoting fec v national right to work 459 us 197 208

kennedy buckley clearly established that campaign finance regulation that restricts speech without requiring proof of specific corrupt activity can only withstand constitutional challenge if it regulates conduct that presents demonstrable quid pro quo danger the mcconnell court however interpreted the anti corruption rationale to allow regulation of not only actual or apparent quid pro quo arrangements but also of any conduct that wins goodwill from or influences member of congress justice kennedy further maintained that the standard established in buckley defined undue influence to include the existence of quid pro quo involving an officeholder while the mcconnell court in contrast extended the buckley standard of undue influence to encompass mere access to an officeholder justice kennedy maintained that the court by legally equating mere access to officeholders to actual or apparent corruption of officeholders sweeps away all protections for speech that lie in its path 267 unpersuaded by justice kennedys dissenting position that congresss regulatory interest is limited to the prevention of actual or apparent quid pro quo corruption inherent in contributions made to candidate the court found that such crabbed view of corruption and specifically the appearance of corruption ignores precedent common sense and the realities of political fundraising exposed by the record in this litigation268 according to the court equally problematic as classic quid pro quo corruption is the danger that officeholders running for re election will make legislative decisions in accordance with the wishes of large financial contributors instead of deciding issues based on the merits or constituent interests since such corruption is neither easily detected nor practical to criminalize the court reasoned title i offers the best means of prevention ie identifying and eliminating the temptation269

candidate272 after buckley many lower courts had interpreted the decision to stand for the proposition that communications must contain express terms of advocacy such as vote for or vote against in order for regulation of such communications to pass constitutional muster under the first amendment absent express advocacy lower courts had held communication is considered issue advocacy which is protected by the first amendment and therefore may not be regulated effectively overturning such lower court rulings the supreme court in mcconnell held that neither the first amendment nor buckley prohibits bcras regulation of electioneering communications even though electioneering communications by definition do not necessarily contain express advocacy the court determined that when the buckley court distinguished between express and issue advocacy it did so as matter of statutory interpretation not constitutional command moreover the court announced that by narrowly reading feca provisions in buckley to avoid problems of vagueness and overbreadth it did not suggest that statute that was neither vague nor overbroad would be required to toe the same express advocacy line 273 the presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech from true issue ad the court observed274 in response to plaintiffs maintaining that the justifications supporting the regulation of express advocacy do not apply to communications covered by the definition of electioneering communication the court found that the argument failed to the extent that issue ads broadcast during the 30 and 60day periods prior to primary and general elections are the functional equivalent of express advocacy 275 the court reasoned that the justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads broadcast during those periods if the ads have the intent and effect of influencing elections based on the evidentiary record the court determined that the vast majority of such ads clearly had such purpose 276 while title ii prohibits corporations and labor unions from using their general treasury funds for electioneering communications the court observed that they are still free to use separate segregated funds pacs to run such ads therefor the court concluded that it is erroneous to view this provision of bcra as complete ban on expression rather than simply regulation277 further the court found that the regulation is not overbroad because the vast majority of ads that are broadcast within the electioneering communication time period 60 days before general election and 30 days before primary have an electioneering purpose278 the court also rejected plaintiffs assertion that the segregated fund requirement for electioneering communications is underinclusive because it only applies to broadcast advertisements and not print or internet communications congress is permitted the court determined to take one step at time to address the problems it identifies as acute with title ii of bcra the court observed 272 buckley 424 us at 80 273 mcconnell 124 s ct at 688 274 id at 689 275 id at 696 276 id citing 251 f supp 2d 176

intrusion on speech by upholding the prohibition on corporations and unions using general treasury funds to finance electioneering communications finding that this bcra provision silences political speech central to the civic discourse that sustains and informs our democratic processes the dissent further noted that unions and corporations now face severe criminal penalties for broadcasting advocacy messages that refer to clearly identified candidate in an election season 280 in upholding bcras extension of the prohibition on using treasury funds for financing electioneering communications to nonprofit corporations the mcconnell court found that even though the statute does not expressly exempt organizations meeting the criteria established in its 1986 decision in fec v massachusetts citizens for life mcfl281 it is an insufficient reason to invalidate the entire section since mcfl had been established supreme court precedent for many years prior to enactment of bcra

bcras requirement that political parties choose between coordinated and independent expenditures after nominating candidate285 finding that it burdens the right of parties to make unlimited independent expenditures286 specifically section 213 of bcra287 provides that after party nominates candidate for federal office it must choose between two spending options under the firs t option party that makes any independent expenditure is prohibited from making any coordinated expenditure under this section of law under the second option party that makes any coordinated expenditure under this section of lawone that exceeds the ordinary 5000 limitcannot make any independent expenditure with respect to the candidate feca as amended by bcra defines independent expenditure to mean an expenditure by person expressly advocating the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate and that is not made in cooperation with such candidate 288 according to the mcconnell court the regulation presented by section 213 of bcra is much more limited than it initially appears party that wants to spend more than 5000 in coordination with its nominee is limited to making only independent expenditures that contain the magic words of express advocacy although the court acknowledges that while the category of burdened speech is relatively small it is nonetheless entitled to protection under the first amendment furthermore the court determined that under section 213 partys exercise of its constitutionally protected right to engage in free speech results in the loss of longstanding valuable statutory benefit hence to pass muster under the first amendment the provision must be supported by meaningful governmental interest and the court announced the interest in requiring parties to avoid the use of magic words does not suffice 289

by unanimous vote the court invalidated section 318 of bcra which prohibited individuals age 17 or younger from making contributions to candidates and political parties290 determining that minors enjoy first amendment protection and that contribution limits impinge on such rights the court determined that the prohibition is not closely drawn to serve sufficiently important interest291 in response to the governments assertion that the prohibition protects against corruption by conduitthat is parents donating through their minor children to circumvent contribution limitsthe court found scant evidence to support the existence of this type of evasion furthermore the court postulated that such circumvention of contribution limits may be deterred by the feca provision prohibiting contributions in the name of another person and the knowing 285 2 usc 315d4 286 mcconnell 124 s ct at 703 287 2 usc 315d4 288 2 usc 30117 289 mcconnell 124 s ct at 702 290 2 usc 441k 291 mcconnell 124

even assuming arguendo that sufficiently important interest could be provided in support of the prohibition the court determined that it is overinclusive according to the court various states have

prohibiting contributions by very young children the court however expressly declined to decide whether any alternatives would pass muster 293

it ruled that advertisements that may reasonably be interpreted as something other than as an appeal to vote for or against specific candidate are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy and therefore cannot be regulated section 203 of the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 bcra299 prohibits corporate or labor union treasury funds from being spent for electioneering communications bcra defines electioneering communication as any broadcast cable or satellite transmission made within 30 days of primary or 60 days of general election sometimes referred to as the blackout periods that refers to candidate for federal office and is targeted to the relevant electorate 300 in mcconnell v federal election commission fec301 the supreme court had upheld section 203 of bcra against first amendment facial challenge even though the provision regulates not only campaign speech or express advocacy speech that expressly advocates the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate but also issue advocacy speech that discusses public policy issues while also mentioning candidate specifically the court determined that the speech regulated by section 203 was the functional equivalent of express advocacy 302 in july 2004 wisconsin right to life wrtl corporation that accepts contributions from other corporations began broadcasting advertisements exhorting viewers to contact senators feingold and kohl to urge them to oppose senate filibuster to delay and block consideration of federal judicial nominations wrtl planned to run the ads throughout august 2004 and to finance them with its general treasury funds thereby running afoul of section 203 as such ads would have been broadcast within the 30 day period prior to the september 14 2004 primary anticipating that the ads would be illegal electioneering communications but believing that they nevertheless had first amendment right to broadcast them wrtl filed suit against the fec seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and alleging that section 203s prohibition was unconstitutional as applied to the ads and any future ads that they might plan to run just prior to the bcra 30day blackout period th reejudge district court denied preliminary injunction finding that mcconnell v fec left room for such an asapplied challenge accordingly wrtl did not broadcast its ads during the blackout period and the district court subsequently dismissed the complaint in an unpublished opinion on appeal in wisconsin right to life inc v fec wrtl i 303 the supreme court vacated the lower court judgment finding that by upholding section 203 against facial challenge in mcconnell we did not purport to resolve future asapplied challenges304 on remand after permitting four members of congress to intervene as defendants the threejudge district court granted wrtl summary judgment determining that section 203 was unconstitutional as applied to wrtls ads 305 it concluded that the ads were genuine issue ads not express advocacy or its functional equivalent under mcconnell and held that compelling interest justified their regulation306 the fec appealed 299 pl 107155 this law is also known as

fec wrtl ii307 determined that section 203 of bcra was unconstitutional as applied to the wrtl ads and that they should have been permissible to broadcast in plurality opinion written by chief justice roberts joined by justice alitojustice scalia wrote separate concurrence joined by justices kennedy and thomas 308the court announced that because wrtls ads may reasonably be interpreted as something other than as an appeal to vote for or against specific candidate we hold they are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy and therefore fall outside the scope of mcconnell s holding309 in determining the threshold question as the court found was required by mcconnell of whether the ads were the functional equivalent of speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidate for federal office or genuine issue advocacy the court observed that it had long recognized that the practical distinction between campaign advocacy and issue advocacy can often dissolve because candidates particularly incumbents are intimately tied to public issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions310 nonetheless the court stated its jurisprudence in this area requires it to make such distinction and in drawing that line the first amendment requires erring on the side of protecting political speech rather than suppressing it311 the fec argued that in view of the fact that mcconnell had already held that section 203 was facially valid wrtland not the governmentshould bear the burden of demonstrating that bcra is unconstitutional as applied to its ads312 rejecting the fecs contention the court pointed out that section 203 burdens political speech and is therefore subject to strict scrutiny313 under strict scrutiny the court determined th at the fecnot the regulated communityhad the burden of proving that the application of section 203 to wrtls ads furthered compelling interest and was narrowly tailored to achieve that interest314 as it had already ruled in mcconnell that section 203 survives strict scrutiny to the extent it regulates express advocacy or its functional equivalent the court found that in order to prevail the fec needed to show that the wrtl ads it sought to regulate fell within that category315 on the other hand if the speech that the fec sought to regulate is not express advocacy or its functional equivalent the court cautioned that the fecs task is more formidable because it must demonstrate that banning 307 127 sct 2652 2007 308 in concurrence justice scalia found that the attempt in the court s ruling to distinguish mcconnell is unpersuasive enough and the change in the law it works is substantial enough that seven justices having widely divergent views concerning the constitutionality of the restric

serve compelling governmental interest conclusion that precedent has reached316 in response to the fecs and the dissents317 argument that mcconnell had established test for determining whether an ad is the functional equiva lent of express advocacy that is whether the ad is intended to influence elections or has that effect the court disagreed finding that it had not adopted any type of test as the standard for future asapplied challenges318 instead the court found that its analysis in mcconnell was grounded in the evidentiary record particularly studies showing that the bcra definition of electioneering communications accurately captures ads having the purpose or effect of supporting candidates for election to office319 hence when the mcconnell court made its assessment that the plaintiffs in that case had not sufficiently proven that section 203 was overbroad and could not be enforced in any circumstance it did not adopt particular test for determining what constituted the functional equivalent of express advocacy indeed the court held the fact that in mcconnell it looked to such intent and effect neither compels nor warrants accepting that same standard as the constitutional test for separating in an asapplied challenge political speech protected under the first amendment from that which may be banned 320 accordingly the court turned to establishing th proper standard for an asapplied challenge to section 203 of bcra finding that such standard must be objective focusing on the substance of the communication rather than amorphous considerations of intent and effect involving minimal if any discovery so that parties can resolve disputes quickly without chilling speech through the threat of burdensome litigation and eschewing the openended roughandtumble of factors which invites complex argument in trial court and virtually inevitable appeal 321 in summation the court announced that the standard must give the benefit of any doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech322 taking such considerations into account the court held that court should find that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against specific candidate under this test wrtls three ads are plainly not the functional equivalent of express advocacy first their content is consistent with that of genuine issue ad the ads focus on legislative issue take position on the issue exhort the public to 316 id 317 the dissenting opinion maintained that the principal opinion establishes new test to identify severely limited class of ads that may constitutionally be regulated as electioneering communications test that is flatly contrary to and simply inverts the courts holding in mcconnell id at 2669 souter j dissenting quoting mcconnell v fec 540 us at 206207 n 88 while the court in mcconnell had left open the possibility of genuine or pure issue ad that might not be open to regulation under 203 the dissent argued that the court meant that an issue ad that did not contain campaign advocacy could escape the regulation not that if an ad is

officials with respect to the matter second their content lacks indicia of express advocacy the ads do not mention an election candidacy political party or challenger and they do not take position on candidates character qualifications or fitness for office323 moreover the court cautioned contextual factors should seldom play significant role in the inquiry although courts are not required to ignore basic background information that provides relevant contextual information about an advertisementsuch as whether the ad describes legislative issue that is under legislative considerationthe court found that such background information should not become an excuse for discovery324 in applying the standard it developed for asappl ied challenges to the ads that wrtl sought to broadcast the court determined that the fec had failed to demonstrate that such ads constituted the functional equivalent of express advocacy because they could reasonably be interpreted as something other than vote for or against candidate the courts established jurisprudence has recognized the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption in elections which has been invoked in order to justify contribution limits and in certain circumstances spending limits on electioneering expenditures that pose the risk of quid pro quo corruption in mcconnell the court noted it had applied this interest in justifying the regulation of express advocacy and its functional equivalent but in order to justify regulating wrtls ads this interest must be stretched yet another step to ads that are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy 325 in strongly worded opposition to extending the application of this governmental interested yet again the court announced enough is enough the wrtl ads are not equivalent to contributionsthey are political speechand the governmental interest in avoiding quid pro quo corruption cannot be used to justify their regulation326 the court also announced that the discussion of issues cannot be suppressed simply because the issues may also be relevant to an election where the first amendment is implicated the tie goes to the speaker not the censor 327 while the ultimate impact and aftermath of the supreme courts decision in wrtl ii remains to be seen application of the federal law prohibiting corporate and labor union treasury funds from being spent on ads that are broadcast 30 days before primary and 60 days before general election has been limited as result of this ruling only ads that are susceptible of reasonable interpretation other than an exhortation to vote for or against candidate can be regulated while the courts ruling was careful not to overrule explicitly its earlier upholding of this
