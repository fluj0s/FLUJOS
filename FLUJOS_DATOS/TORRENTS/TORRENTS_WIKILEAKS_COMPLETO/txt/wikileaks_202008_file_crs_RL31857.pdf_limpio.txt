subs equent biological weapon incidents1 and occasional warnings of potential terrorist incursions policymakers have given re newed attention to conti nuity of operations coop issues broadly federal g overnment contingency planni ng grows out of two major streams one stream identified as continuity of government cog typically focuses on preserving governme nt leadership and officials2 the preservation of staff facilities technology systems and data comprise s the second stream and is usually the focus of coop planning depending on the scope of an operational interruption coop and cog plans could be initiated independen tly or in concert with one another due to security cerns current government contingency plans are not public information this secrecy c oupled with the wide variety of potential operational interruptions make firm delineation between coop and cog activities that could be generalized across all circumstance are all but impossible to specify the history of contingency planning ggests however that it is reasonable to assume that contingency planning for g overnment leaders their staffs and the facilities that support governme nt operations are closely interrelated taken together coop and cog are designed to ensure survival of constitutional form of government and the continuity of essential fe deral functions coop planning refers to th internal effort of an or ganization such as branch of government department agency or office to assure that the capability exists to continue essential operations in response to comprehensive array of potential operational interruptions while much of the renewed impetus for coop planning focuses on responding to potential attac k operational interruptions that could necessitate the activation of coop might also include routine building renovation or maintenance mechanical failure of heating or other building systems fire and inclement weather or other acts of natu re other events which may interrupt government activity incl ude failure of information technology it and telecommunications installations due to malfunction or cyber attack3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31857crs2 3 continued

issues that congress might consider during the 109th congress continuedgovernmentwide coop planning is cr itical because much of the response to an incident might include the maintenance of civil authority and infrastructure repair among other recovery activities such res ponse presumes the existence of an ongoing functional government to fund support and oversee recovery efforts in the executive branch coop planning can be viewed as continuation of basic emergency preparedness planning including evacuation planning4 and serves as bridge between that planning and efforts to maintain continuity of government in the event of significant disruption to government activity or institutions5 i n t h aftermath of an incident initial efforts ty pically focus on safeguarding personnel and securing the incident scene subsequently attention focuses on reestablishing critical agency operations according to coop plan because the number and types of potential interruptions are unknown effec

emergency catastrophe or other operational interruption are specified in law executive order and agency pl ans these sources identify number of matters that agency coop planners must incorporate into their planning in practice the specialized nature of the various ag encies of the executive branch results in coop planning that is highly decentraliz ed with each agency developing specific plans6

of efforts established during the cold war to preserve the continuity of g overnment in the event of nuclear attack on the united states at the time executive branch cog planning focused on preserving the line of presidential successi on by safeguarding officials who would succeed the president also cog plans reportedly included locating and evacuating the officials in the line of succession8 along with the other senior leaders of cabinet departments and leaders of the independent agencies such as the federal reserve in the event of an imminent nuclear attack the plans called for the relocation of these individuals to secure alternative operational facilities outside of the district of columbia9 as cog plans evolved it was recognized by emergency planners that it would be necessary to support the countrys seni or leadership and to carry out critical functions in the aftermath of an attack regardless of the need to evacuate and relocate government officials consequently coop planning became unifying element that integrated support functions in situations where the lack of such basic support elements as personnel lternative operational fac ilities or records posed serious disruption to agency operations and the ability of the government to carry out its constitutional and statutory duties in the period following the end of the cold war attention to contingency planning reportedly decreased in response to the perception of diminished risk of widespread interruption to g overnment operations as re sult of an intercontinental nuclear attack in the aftermath of the

essential functions might be performed by one or mo re department or agency and are not new authorities requirements or functions but those that are routinely carried out during normal operating conditions the homela nd security council identifies eight national essential functions that must be supported throug hout an operational interruption26 these include the capacity to preserve the constitutional form of government department and agency functions should include activities that respect and implement checks and balances among the three branches of the federal government an example is the preservation of essential communications between the executive legislative and judicial branches of government during an incident provide leadership visible to the nation and the world and to maintain the trust and confidence of the american people executive branch departments and agencies are expected to demonstrate that the federal govern ment is viable functioning and effectively addressing the emerge ncy activities in support of this function could include communica ting with the american people and providing information to st ate and local governments or communicating with foreign leaders defend the country against all enem ies foreign or domestic and to prevent or interdict future attacks in addition to the protection and defense of the worldwide intere sts of the united states against foreign or domestic enemies depa rtments and agencies are to honor security agreements and treaties with allies nd maintain military readiness and preparedness in furt herance of national interests and objectives maintain and foster effective relationships with foreign nations departments and agencies are res ponsible for ensuring the ability of the federal government to

examines the status of coop planning within the executive branch and the implications of that planning for overall agency emergency preparedness some of the issues regarding coop planning include executive branch authority to carry out coop activities budgeting the extent of coop preparedness congressional committee jurisdiction and the perceived immediacy of contingency planning coop planning authority the authorities governing executive coop planning raise several issues that might be examined by congress these include the capacity of existing executive authorities to effectively govern coop planning and the implementation of such plans authorities governing coop activitie s eo 12656 pdd 67 and eo 13286 have been issued by three different pr esidential administrations some observers suggested that each policy directive was issued at different times in response to disparate threat conditions for example eo 12656 is continuation of cold war era contingency policies that assume nuclear confrontation with single state the former soviet union continuity planni ng assumption from this era is the potential for decapitating strike on the national leadership including the president cabinet and congressional leaders by contrast observers note that when pdd 67 and eo 13286 were issued the threat environment was evolving from si ngle state model to one characterized by the advent of threat from hostile states and loose organizations of nonstate actors with the capacity to launch small scale attacks using nontraditional weapons such attacks may not disrupt senior leadership in its entirety but have the potential to impair the operations of key government functions and programs the pdd 67 fact sheet as well as guidance issued by fema in federal preparedness

potential threat environment and that legally compels executive agencies to prepare plans to withstand such incursions however is not evident moreover it is not clear from publicly available documents what legal authority exists to implement coop plans eo 13286 is silent on the matter section 102 b of eo 12656 notes explicitly that the or der does not authorize the implementation of coop plans and

alerting or activ ation of governmentwide coop and cog plans and capabilities the fact sheet does not however identify the legal authority under which such process could be initiated or by which coop plans could be activated observers of presidential powers and authorities suggest that such an authorization could be f ound in broad national emerge ncy powers that have been exercised by the president in times of crisis typically national emergency powers have been invoked in response to threats of the loss of life property or public order40 following the attacks on washington and new york on september 11 2001 federal government cog and coop plans were reportedly activated41 it does not appear however that declarations of emergency pursuant to the national emergencies act42 would necessarily actuate st atutory provisions granting the president the authority to activate coop plan s in response to threats or attack against government or detailing the ability of the executive branch to carry out its statutory missions and programs43 finally experts in public administration and management might suggest that the attenuated stream of authorities governing executive branch coop planning could lead to confusion regarding which agenci of the executive branch oversee planning activities eo 13286 requires that the director of fema and the heads of departments and agencies must ensure that their preparedness plans and activities are consistent with current presidential guid elines and policies under eo 12656 the nsc was responsible for establishing guide lines and

demand for variety of homeland security protective measures including executiv branch coop planning homeland security council and fema staff have suggested that as consequence of the multidisciplinary nature of coop planning executive branch agency expenditures for coop activities are sometimes spread across veral departmental or agen cy accounts and data are not readily available to demonstr ate agency coop funding levels on august 6 2004 omb issued budget data request46 that requires executive branch departments and agencies to submit summary table for coop programs that includes the

training to support the development of clearly defined and mutually understood essential functions for all agencies55 until those actions are completed and systematic oversight of coop activities is established however gaos conclusion that ag encies are likely to continue to base their coop planning on illdefined assumptions that could limit the effectiveness of resulting plans might still be salient congressional committee jurisdiction government operations in the executive branch are generally overseen by the house committee on government reform and the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs in the 109th congress the house committee has jurisdiction over government management measures including the management of government operations and activities56 which would appear to give it role in coop oversight across the executive branch at the start of the 109th congress the house converted the select committee on homeland security into standing committee and transferred some but not all related legislative jurisdiction to it from other standing committees the house committee on homeland security has both oversight and legislative responsibility regarding the depar tment of homeland security including domestic preparedness for and collec tive response to terrorism as well as broad oversight authority over governmentwide homeland security matters57 in the senate the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs has jurisdiction over matters relating to the department of homeland security with certain limitations58 as well as organization and reorganization of the executive branch of the government59 this would appear to give both panels some governmentwide role in overseeing the guidance and implementation of coop planning related to potential interrupti ons due to attack or other incursion different approaches to homeland secu rity in the house and senate have resulted in different committees having different jurisdictions and internal structures the senate pursuant to sres 445 of the 108th congress directed its appropriations committee to reorganize its subcommittees to accommodate the creation of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31857crs23 department of homeland security what action the senate panel will take and whether the house committee on appropriations takes similar action is not yet clear ongoing bicameral coordination of cong ressional legislative oversight and investigative roles over homeland security might affect congressional attention to coop activities in the 109th congress also the potential publication of coop expenditures by omb in annual budget proposals might encourage authorizing committees and appropriations subcommittees to provide more oversight of coop activities in the departments and agencies they oversee issue immediacy as the memory of dramatic disruptions such as the september 11 2001 attacks and biological agent incidents fade atte ntion to administrative operations like coop planning may receive lower priority attention from agency planners emergency preparedness observers note that the succe ss of contingency pl anning is dependent on current planning and regular drills simulations or other testing prior to the attacks executive branch coop manageme nt by the national security council and fema and guidance for other executive branch agencies were all in place and that guidance included requirements for agency wide staff education as well as the testing and drilling of coop plans nevertheless on september 11 2001 some federal employees reportedly were unaware of these plan s and some agencies found they had way of accounting for or communicating with evacuated staff the apparent disparity between the level of planning by senior officials and the level of readiness and awareness by line managers and agency lead some observers to maintain that continual drills and educational awaren ess efforts will be necessary to achieve and maintain an appropriate degree of coop capability the current relatively low state of alert could offer an opportunity to test readiness during non crisis situation congress might elect to prevent miscommunications that occurred in september 2001 in future events by conducting oversight nd exploring potential legislative options to
