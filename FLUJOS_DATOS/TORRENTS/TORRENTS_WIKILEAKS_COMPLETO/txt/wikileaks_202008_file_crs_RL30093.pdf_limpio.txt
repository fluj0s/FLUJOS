gulf region contains both challenges and opportunities for th united states in 1999 since october 1997 the ited states and its partners on the united nations secur ity council have faced repeated crises with iraq over its failure to coopera with unmandated disarmament efforts as 1998 ended weapons inspectors from the special commission on ir aq unscom reported that they were unable to perform their disarmament mission they left iraq jus t prior to 70 hour usbritish bombing campaign against iraqi sites that could b used to reconstitute weapons of mass destruction wmd the united states termed the bombing campaign operation desert fox successful in s etting back iraqs missile program and its ability to threaten its neighbors but this action left the security council divided over how to encourage iraq to allow unscom back into th country although hampered in its mission unscom was viewed by most experts as the most effective means of determining whether or not iraq is reconstitutin g banned wmd programs the prospects for iran and the united states to end twenty years of hostilit have improved since the unexpected election in may 1997 of relative moderate mohammad khatemi as president however khatemi faces opposition internall from those who subscribe to the radical principles of the islamic revolution in part because of that in ternal opposition rapid and significant improvement in usiran relations has proven elusi ve khatemi has refused longstanding us offer to begin politica l dialogue but he has approved increased peopletopeople contacts as means of rebuilding trust between the two countries irans government did not take up june 1998 offer by secretary of state madeleine albright to engage in mutual confiden cebuilding measures with iran that could provide roadmap to norma l relations the clinton administration apparently is waiting for the infighting i n tehran to subs ide before renewing its overtures although it did in december 1998 remove iran from the list of major drug producing countries this move wa s interpreted by some in congress as concession to iran us efforts to contain the potential threats from iran and iraq continue t depend on close alliances with the persian gulf monarchy states and on continuin g political stability there facing internal sympathy for the plight of the iraqi people some of the gulf states have begun to grow more cautious in their support of us efforts to compel iraq to comply with all applicable resolutions saudi arabia refused to allow us combat aircraft to fly from saudi bases to strike iraq i n operation desert fox the gulf states faced with low oil prices since 1997 also are worried about potential political unrest that might result from cutting back th generous social benefits they offer their citizens to compensate for falling prices saudi arabia kuwait and qatar are opening their ener gy sectors to increased foreign investm ent all the gulf states are curbing their appetite for new arms purchases although not under significant pressure to do so some of the gulf states continued gradual moves to open their political system in part to spread the burden of

and european countries difficulties in the discovery and transportation of oil and gas from th central asiancaspian countries ensure that the gulf will be major source of energy well into the 21 century st the region is home to both iran and iraq countries that have threatened us interests direc tly and indirectly iran and iraq fought each other during 19801988 but both have also fought the united state s iran and the united states fought minor naval skirmishes during 198788 the height of the iraniraq war war in which the united states tacitly backed iraq during one such skirmish operation praying mantis april 18 1988 the united states fought day long n aval battle with iran that destroyed almost half the iranian fleet the united states fought iraq in the 199 1 gulf war to liberate kuwait which iraq had invaded and occupied in august 1990 that war cost the united stat armed forces 148 killed in action and 138 nonbattle deaths along with 458 wounded in action the 1991 gulf war cut iraqs conventional military capabilities approximately in half but iraq is still superior to iran and the gulf states in gr ound forces iraq fielded the sixth largest air force prior to the gulf war but now has only about 170 operational combat aircraft mostly older russian made mig23s and mig 25s and frenchmade mirages according to th international institute of strategic studies both iran and iraq have developed weapons of mass destruction wmd programs iraqs missile chemical nuclear and biological programs begun during the iraniraq war were among the most sophisticated in the third world at the time of iraqs invasion f kuwait during the 1991 gulf war iraq fired 39 scud missileshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30093crs2 the ssiles were supplied by russia but iraq enhanced their range to be able to reac h1 tehran which is about 350 miles from the iraq border the normal range of the scud i s about 200 miles in order to accommodate the grea ter range however iraq had to reduce the warhead payload by half from 2200 pounds to 1100 pounds at israel us ally and about 50 missiles on targets in saudi arabia one iraq i missile fired on coalition forces on february 25 1991 during desert storm hit us barracks near dhahran saudi arabia killing 28 mili tary personnel and wounding 97 during the iraniraq war iraq fired enhanced scud siles at iranian cities and1 it used chemical w eapons against iranian troops and kurdish guerrillas and civilians irans wmd programs which are not under international restrictions like those n iraq have made significant strides during the 1990s with subs tantial help from russia china north korea and other countries in july 1998 iran tested its shaha b meteor 3 ballistic missile 800900 mile range which could enable iran to threaten israel turkey and parts of central and south asia both iran and iraq are on the us list of state sponsors of terrorism although iran has bee n considered more substantial terrorist threat than iraq the islami c regime in iran which came to power in february 1979 held american diplomat s hostage during november 1979january 1981 and the proiranian lebanese shi muslim organization hizballah held ame ricans hostage in lebanon during the 1980s since then iran has supported groups hizballah and the palestinian groups hamas and palestinian isla mic jihad opposed to israel and the ussponsored arabisraeli peace process iran also has supported radical shia muslim fundamentalist movements in th gulf which have posed threat s to political stability in saudi arabia and bahrain over the past four years press reports suggest saudi investigators hold iran at leas t indirectl responsible for the june 1996 bombing of the khobar towers housin g complex for us military officers in which 19 us airmen were killed the gulf states face internal threat s not attributable to iran or iraq all six gulf states saudi arabia kuwait bahrain the uni ted arab emirates oman and qatar are hereditary monarchies with few if any formal institutions for popula r participation in national decisionmaking some of them including saudi arabia and the united arab emirates are undergoing leadership transitions and bahrain s leadership passed to new generation in march 1999 when the long serving ami r died suddenly since t he early 1970s the gulf states have channeled their oil wealth into infrastructure development and generous social benefits such as free highe r education and subsidized housing the decline in oil prices since early 1998 has left the gulf states with the difficult choices of cutting benefits and risking unrest r trimming other programs such as defense acquisitions that are vital to their security to help deflect the burden of choosing among unpalatable alternatives some of the gulf states have begun to gradually op up the political process although not to the point where gulf state citizens can peacefully change their leadership httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30093crs3 iraq us efforts to contain and end the threat iraq is openly challenging us and efforts to obtain full iraqi compliance with postwar resolutions the united states and iraq began state of almost constant confron tation in october 1997 when iraq out of frustration at its failure to achieve any easing of seven years of comprehensive sanctions began openl defying the efforts of weapons inspectors unscom to clear up remainin g questions about iraqs prohibited wmd programs in response to iraqs refusal t fully coope rate with unscom in february 1998 and again in november 1998 the united states built up forces in the gulf and went to the brink of military actio n against iraq in both of those cases airstrikes were averted in the first cas through mediation efforts by secretarygeneral kofi annan and in the latter case through iraqs acceptance of us ultimatum iraqs continued obstructions of unscom finally provoked us airstrikes despite opposition by france russia and china to the use of force after month of testing iraqs november 14 1998 pledge of full cooperation unscom executive chairman richard butler told the security council that iraq continued t obstruct to its work on december 16 butler withdrew all unscom staff fro m iraq and that evening the united states and britain began 70hour bombin g campaign operation desert fox dece mber 1619 against military installations and industrial facilities that can be used to restart wmd programs the united state s and britain claimed that 85 of the approximately 100 sites targeted suffere d damage some of them were destroyed completely on january 8 1999 the leader of the operation commander of us centr command centcom gen anthony zinni said desert fox had set back iraqs missile programs by two years some believe that operation desert fox might ultimately prov counterpro ductive to us efforts to maintain containment of iraq iraq refuses t allow unscom back into iraq to resume its work leaving open the possibility that iraq might begin rebuilding its wmd programs see appendix on unscom s record and disarmament issues still outstanding the u nited states says it will strike iraq if iraq rebuilds prohibited weapons programs but most outside experts believe that unscom s ability to detect iraqi wmd violations is greater than that of th united states whi ch lacks ontheground personnel in iraq and must rely on remote intelligence collection methods immediat ely after the operation france and russia advanced proposals t restructure unscoms mission andor composition to encoura ge iraq to accept some level of weapons control the united states opposes the french and russian efforts preferring instead to insist on returning to unscom its original mission in iraq s ecurity council permanent member is satisfied with total absence f internati onal monitoring of iraqi wmd capabilities and the council will likel continue to debate the issue until it achieves consensus on how to restart wmd control program the council took one step toward that goal in late january 1999 by authorizing the convening of disarmament pane l composed mostly of unscom and international atomic energy agency nuclear issues experts to review l aspects of iraqi disarmament and report back to the council by april 15 1999 the panel might make visits to iraq if iraq agrees to cooperate with its work two otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30093crs4 panels one on the humanitarian s ituation in iraq and one on kuwaiti missing persons and property also were formed the u nited states also is attempting to stave off french and other calls for th lifting of sanctions on iraq france asserts that lifting s anctions will provide iraq with enough incentive to agree to allow wmd monitoring program to resume th united states opposes that position on the grounds that lifting sanctions will enable iraq to generate and control enough revenue to reconstitute its armed forces and its wmd programs even if the international ban on arms exports to iraq remains i n place as response to the french proposal the united states has proposed that the oilforfood prog ram monitored sales of 526 billion in iraqi oil every six months in exchange for humanitarian purchases be expanded doing so would ensure that iraqs oil revenues continue to be controlled by escrow account and cannot therefore be used for illicit weapons or other purposes as part of broad pattern of postdesert fox defiance iraq declared in lat december 1998 that it would challenge us and british enforcement of nofl zones in northe rn and southern iraq iraq has never accepted the legitimacy of the fly zones because they were not specifically authorized by any resolutions but it has only challenged enforcement during periods of crisis with the unite d nations or united state s the united states asserts that fly zone enforcement is legitimate operation to monitor iraqs compliance with resolution 688 april 5 1991 which demands that iraq cease repressing its population the kurds in th north and shia muslims in the south in over 100 incidents since desert fox the united states has stru ck iraqi air defense sites and related equipment in the northern and southern fly zones see map appendix for depiction of the fly zones i n response t iraqi attempts to target us and british aircraft patrolling the zones or in response to iraqi air incursions into the zones in early march 1999 the united states claimed to have destroyed about 20 of iraqs air defense network sinc desert fox eroding regional containment even though iraq is defying securit council resolutions some of iraqs neighbors believe that it has been disarmed to the point at which it longer poses major threat the neighboring states hav expressed concern about the plight of th iraqi people under more than eight years of compreh ensive international sanctions import and export embargo with selecte d exceptio ns as well as ban on flights to or from iraq even saudi arabia whic h was directly threatened by iraqs invasion of kuwait in 1990 is now asking tha t restrictions on the oil for food program be eased among other motivations some of iraqs neighbo rs seek an easing of sanctions to provide them with additional trade outlets while others want to rehabilitat iraq as counterweight to iran andor israel whateve r the motivations the following improvements in iraqs relations wit h regional states have caused some to question wheth er us efforts to contain iraq will succeed over the long term in february 1998 at the height of one crisis with iraq over unsco m inspection privileges the foreign minister of qatar visited baghdad in n attempt to mediate an end to the crisis this represented the first visit by gulf state foreign minister to iraq since the gulf war httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30093crs5 in april 1998 iraq and iran completed their largest prisoner exchange sinc the end of the iraniraq war in august 1988 5600 iraqi prisoners wer exchanged for 380 iranian prisoners this exchange helped clear majo r hurdle to further improvement in their relations during 1998 iran r factions within iran also continued to help iraq smuggle at least 10 million per month worth of petroleum products out of the gulf in august 1998 iranian visitors began vis iting shiite muslim holy sites in southern iraq for the first time since the february 1979 iranian revolution iran publicly opposed desert fox in july 1998 longtime adversaries syria and iraq agreed to reopen the iraqi oil pipeline that crosses syria and lets out at sy rias mediterranean port of banias iraq said in february 1999 that iraqs portion of the lin is nearly repaired the pipeline has been closed since 1982 when syria forged an alliance with iran against iraq during the irani raq war syria also participated in the coalition that expelled iraq from kuwait in 1991 in 1997 the two reopened thei r common border and syria began exporting goods to iraq under the sponsored oilforfood program the reopening of the pipeline migh t require an amendment to security council resolution 986 april 1995 and the may 1996 unira q memorandum of understanding that govern the oilforfood program these documents mandate tha t more than half of iraqi oil exports run through an iraqturkey pipeline and that all oil export routes be monitored by contract personnel whethe r these understandings will be amended to permit exports through syria remains to be seen in september 1998 turkey upgraded its relations with i raq to the ambassador level and turkey did not allow its incirlik air base from which us an d british aircraft patrol the northern nofly zone over iraq to be used fo r operation desert fox airstrike s iraq received further boost from turkey in midfebr uary 1999 when the government of prime minister bulent ecevi t received iraqs deputy prime minister tariq aziz iraq is pushing to persuade turkey to end its hosting of usbritish enforcement of the northern fl zone from incirlik aziz did not accomplish that objective but few day s before azizs visit turkeys defense minister did call for new rules f engagement for northern fly zone enforcement the defense ministr position suggested that turkey is uneasy with the us british strikes on iraqs air defense batteries in the northern fly zone since desert fox also in september 1998 iraq and saudi arabia signed their first trade dea l since the gulf war under which saudi arabia would supply goods to ira q under theoilforfood program saudi arabia publicly refused to allo w desert fox strikes from its bases although it joined other gulf and arab states in blaming iraq for the noncooperation that brought on desert fox onl kuwait an d oman allowed usbritish strikes from their territory during the operation in october 1998 leba non restored diplomatic relations with iraq after four year break that break ccurred when lebanon alleged that iraqi intelligence had assassinated iraqi dissidents in beirut httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30093crs6 on seven occasions during 199193 th security council declared iraq in material breach2 of the ceasefire in principle opening iraq to allied military action military action was not used on all of those occasions however the last council finding of material breach was on june 17 1993 but council members have since been reluctant to agree on such findin g because of recent russian chinese and french opposition to military action against iraq in november 1998 the unite d arab emirates uae

council resolution 670 congressional views congress has generally supported the administration throughout the various confrontations with iraq although it has often urged eve n stronger action against iraq than the administration appeared ready to take i n particular congress has insisted that an element be added to us containment policy the overthrow of saddam husayn during the october november 1997 phase of the crisis the senate did not act on resolution sconres 71 supportin g military action because many senators believ ed that military action would not end the threat from saddam husayn many senators wanted the administration to adop t policies that would lead to the overthrow of saddam husayn on july 31 and august 3 1998 respectively the senate and house passed resolutio n sjres 54 that said iraq is in material breach violation of the postgulf war ceasefire and the president should act accord ingly the president signed the bill pl 105235 on august 14 1998 although the admin istration did not at that point take military action against iraq it did not push to persuade the security council to declare iraq in materia l breach because of anticipated opposition from france china and russia2 congressional sentiment for strategy of overthrow of saddam husay n culminated in the iraq liberation act which passed the house on october 5 36038 and the senate on october 7 unanimous consent the act gives the president the discretion to provide up to 97 million in defense articles and services to iraq i opposition organizations designated by the adm inistration the president signed the bill into law pl 105338 on october 31 1998 the same day iraq cut off l cooperation with unscom including long term monitoring op erations for further informati on on us support for the opposition see crs report 98179 f iraq s opposition movements on november 14 1998 president clinton appeared to take up congressional recommendations by saying publicly that us pol icy would work to achieve change in regime and that he would implement the iraq liberation act this marked the first time since the gulf war that the clared policy of the united states has been to seek saddam husayns overthrow although th united states has worked with opposition groups since 1991 however administration officials maintain that they do not want this objective which is neither sanctioned nor suggested by any security council resolutions to interfere with us attempts to maintain consensus in the counci l to contain iraq some other security council members maintain that any attempts to interfere in iraqs internal affairs are unjustified and contrary to international lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30093crs7 for analysis of us sanctions on iran see crs report 97231 f iran us policy and3 options both the administration and congress have highlighted iraqs human right s record as an additional justification for removing saddam husayn from power of all the state s bordering the persian gulf iraq is widely regarded as having the worst human righ ts record it is termed extremely poor in the state departments human rights report for 1998 released in march 1999 senior state department official s have said since 1994 that iraq might qualify for prosecution in the international court of justice under the 1948 genocide convention because of its abuses against iraqs kurds during mass kurdish relocation in february 1988 anfal campaign as well as continuing efforts to deprive shiite muslims in the southe rn marshes marsh arabs of their way of life in april 1997 the administration announced its support fo r indict an effort by iraqi oppositionists and human rights activists to documen t iraqi war crimes i n november 1997 the house passed hconres 137 calling for the president to push for war crimes tribunal for saddam and his associates the senate passed similar resolution sconres 78 in march 1998 under stat dept plan submitted pursuant to pl 105174 an fy1998 supplementa l appropriation 217 million is to be spent to analyze translate and publicize th several million documents of iraqi war crimes now on 176 cdrom diskettes provided by the kurds or held by the government of kuwait on the oth er hand many experts believe that war crimes tribunal will b difficult if sadd am is not in custody some security council members believe that pushing for such tribunal would provide disincentive for iraq to resum cooperation with wmd monitoring effort some might argue that iraq s repression of its people also complicates efforts by the iraqi opposition to organize resistance to saddam husayns government iran us outreach amid continued concerns the year 1998 began amid expectations that t he united states and iran might be able to end twenty years of mutual hostility but those expectations proved difficult to realize foreign policy experts had been arguing for some time that improve d relations with iran could help the united states contain sa ddam

region and possibly dissuade iran of the need to acquire weapons of mas s destruction us business i nterests meanwhile argued that improved usiranian relations could help open up new energy routes for caspiancentral asian energ resources might benefit us exporters and coul d end trade disputes with us allies precipitated by us secondary sanctions legislat ion others maintain that the united3 states could not and should not isolate country of over 65 million people with location and resources as strategic as those of iran others including many members of congress believe that iran has t addressed us concerns about its international behavior easing us sanctions according to this view would provide iran the opportunity to earn increased har dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30093crs8 currency that could be channeled into terrorism conventional weapons or wm d technol ogy some who subscribe to this view believe that khatemi despite hi s professed moderation on some issues is as committed as were his predecessors t making iran great power in the gulf and expelling us influence from the region in may 1997 the administration took the opportunity presented by the upset presidenti election victory of mohammad khatemi relatively moderate cleric to shift policy on iran us hopes f or improved relations had intensified when khatemi agreed to special cable new s network interview on january 7 1998 portrayed by iran and cnn as an address to the american people however constrained b revolutiona ry purists who still hold many of the reins of power in iran khatem i offered only people topeople contacts with the united states and rejected the us offer of formal governmenttogovernment ties the united states accepted khatemis call for informal contacts but th administration apparently later concluded that this route would not lead to an early breakthrough in relations on june 17 1998 in speech to the asia society secretary of state albright proposed that the two countries undertake mutua l confidencebuilding measures that could form road map to eventually normalizing relations on september 28 1998 iranian foreign mini ster kamal kharrazi formally responded to the albright proposal also in speech to the asia society kharrazi continued to rule out direct dialogue and restated irans litany of grievances against the united sta tes including economic sanctions the holding of iranian assets and history of attempt ing to manipulate iranian politics however he indicated that the united states and iran could find areas of cooperation including counternarcotics counterterrorism control ling regional wmd and promoting political settlement in afghanistan the administration also attempted to signal willingness to improve relations with iran in several sanctionsrelated actions

petronas of malaysia that had agreed in september 1997 to develop irans south pars gas field the administration maintained that the waiver was not concession to iran but rather an exchange for european and russian pledges f cooperation to combat iranian terrorism and to prevent iran from acquiring wm d technology members on congress opposed to the move said the waiver would open iran to further energy investments which would have the net effect of improving irans financial resourc and reducing its isolation on the other hand some us energy firms opposed the simultaneous administrati on statements that similar waivers would not likely be granted for energy pipeline or other projects that transit iran s inconsistent with the waiver decision itself on december 7 1998 president clinton removed iran from the list of majo r drug producing countries on the grounds that us assess ments indicated that the area under cultivation in iran had decreased to the point at which it longer met th threshold for inclusion som in congress criticized the administration action as an attempt to improve relations with iran rather than judgement based on objectiv criteria although the

to that amendment the administration sanctioned seven russian entitie s allegedl assisting irans shahab program on january 12 1999 the presiden t sanctioned three additional russian entities bel ieved

dramatic iranian missile breakthroughs such as successful test of the 1250 mil range shahab4 irans missile progress and especially north koreas august 1998 test of its taepodong missile has led to an

analysts expect that iraq wil l continue to attempt to break out of its isola tion probably with mixed success by attempting to portray the united states as an aggressor whose actions against iraq are unjustified iraq is likely t persist in its efforts to bring about unscoms demise altogether although it might in an effort to appear cooperative work with unsponsored disarmament expert s operating under less intrusive guidelines it is conceivable although not likely tha t us efforts to support iraqs opposition will lead to coup detat or uprising against saddam husayn or that even without us help iraq s continued repression of its shia muslim community will provoke popular unrest that engulfs the regime iraq might respond by lashing out at its neighbors or the united states through terrorist act s against gulf military facilities or us embassies in the region in iran observers do not anticipate that during 1999 president mohamma d khatemi will overcome internal opposition to beginning political dialogue with the united states or accepting the secretary of states proposed roadmap to norma l relations kh atemis supporters were victorious in february 1999 local elections but more important opportunity to best his political opponents comes in early 2000 when parliamentary ele ctions will be held should prokhatemi candidates achieve decisive parliamentary majority in those elections khatemi might have the strength to name reformist cabinet that i s safe from parliamentary impeachment this outcome might allow him to push forward on some controversial foreign policy initiatives possibly including outreach to the uni ted states whether khatemi is politically weak or strong iran will probably push forward with its wmd programs especially it s ballistic missiles there is consensus among all iranian factions that the strategi c threats facing iran from iraq the united sta tes afghanistan or other quarters justify developing wmd unexpected developments in iran in the remainder of 1999 cannot be completely ruled out including the political demise of khatemi or his key allies such as the foreign minister at the hands of determined political opponents such an outcome could produce stepped up iranian efforts to undermine the arabisraeli peace process and increase the potential for antius or antiisrael terrorism worldwide the gulf states face major economic difficulties and potential political unrest in 1999 very f ew if any analysts envision jump in oil prices sufficient to cove r relatively large gulf b udget deficits resulting cutbacks in social spending could lead to unrest in some gulf countries in 1999 saudi arabia might see the completion of leadership transition from king fahd to crown prince abdullah who is now king in all but formal title the uae is in transition from shaykh zayid who forged the formation of the uae in 1971 to his crown prince abdullah bin zayid nuhayyhan potential new flareup in unrest in bahrain remains key concern unrest that might be touche d off by the ongoing trial of shia muslim opposition cleric shaykh jamri politics could be especially volatile in bahrain following the sudde n death of shaykh isa and the accession of his hamad as the new amir however some analysts believe that falling oil prices are forcing the gulf states to undertak major structural reforms and to welcome foreign investment
