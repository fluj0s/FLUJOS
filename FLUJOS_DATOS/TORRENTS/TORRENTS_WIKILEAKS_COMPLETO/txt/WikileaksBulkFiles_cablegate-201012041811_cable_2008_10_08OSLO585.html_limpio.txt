general roger brady eo 12958 decl 10292018 tags marr mass mcap prel pgov classified by deputy chief of mission kevin m johnson for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary following months of ambiguity and several conflicting indicators and after strong engagement by senior dod and dos officials norwegian selection of the f35 lightning ii joint strike fighter appears significantly more likely recent comments by the ministers of foreign affairs and defense indicate that the process is onschedule and will be decided on the stated criteria which play to the f35s strengths media reporting has also shifted noticeably and appears more balanced this positive shift is result of the strong usg push and is important for the protection of natos northern flank the bilateral relationship and the jsf program internationally end summary the campaign 2 c in reftel post outlined the negative media coverage and mixed comments from insiders that seemed to put norways selection of the jsf in jeopardy norways selection is important to the us because we want strong defense of natos northern flank secured by the superior capabilities of f35s in norway we want to ensure the close usnorwegian military ties continue and participation in jsf will naturally support this we want high levels of interoperability in nato norway will be the first jsf partner to make choice on the plane and thus will disproportionally affect other partners choices 3 c post thus requested dedicated usg effort to ensure norway understands the importance of their choice and the virtues of the jsf as result the deputy secretary of defense in meetings and phone calls states assistant secretary kimmitt and usafe commander general brady in visits to oslo and posts outreach campaign delivered strong coordinated usg message which publicly professed the unequalled capabilities of the aircraft and the value we place on the relationship and privately pressed for the selection of the f35 apparent results 4 c as result of this committed effort we now believe the tide has turned in norway the media have recently run number of articles from active duty and retired officers extolling the strengths of the f35 commentators who have previously said the gripen is the best plane have been attacked by leading parliamentarians for being illinformed while articles in favor of the gripen still appear there is now balance and more accurate reporting of facts which is working in our favor 5 c more importantly in an october 24 ambassadors meeting the foreign minister who we judge to be instrumental in the decision said we should trust the process which will be on time and based on quality price and industrial participation there is integrity to the process and if we sit still in the boat all should work out he stressed the need for political credibility in the competition and that the process can withstand uninformed media attacks he ended saying we should have faith the minister of defense was more circumspect but also said the process is set and only mod knows the full data on the planes she urged the ambassador to be reassured about the process these comments align with more forward leaning ones expressed by deputy minister of defense bartheide who has privately given every signal that the f35 will be selected in fact in candid conversation with usafe commander general brady on 23 october barth eide said if you believe you have the best aircraft trust the process do not overplay your hand what now 6 c despite these reassurances the selection of the f35 is still sure thing and much can happen before the final decision we expect mod to deliver its recommendation to the gon any day the gon in turn will make recommendation to the parliament on december 19 of this year given the gons political majority position it can force its recommendation on the aircraft for good or ill through the parliament however based on the strong recent indicators we believe we need to maintain steady course by continuing to discreetly demonstrate usg focus on the issue and our commitment to the relationship while being cautious not to overassert our position and thereby potentially affront norwegian sensitivities on their selection prerogatives correcting major factual errors in the media where necessary continue to engage in any conferences debates or other public forums on the program being offered by the jsf partnership when and where requested so as not to appear overly confident we must continue to act as an honorable ad gracious competitor 7 c in short we beieve we are close to success and now simply needcareful shepherding to bring it home we thank ashington eucm and usafe for the strong engagemet that has turned the tide for us and we look foward to our continued team efforts to keep norwa in the program we hope the norwegin experience proves useful in other countries facing similar competition whitney
