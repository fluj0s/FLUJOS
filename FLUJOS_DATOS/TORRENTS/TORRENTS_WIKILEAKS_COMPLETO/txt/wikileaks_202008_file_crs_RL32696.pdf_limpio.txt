noted this allegedly unfair distribution of funds35 variation in the distribution of funds under the fy2005 state homeland security grant program was seen for example in comparison of wyoming and new

priority defending the united states from domestic terrorist attack this changed with the creation of dhs in 200238 according to the report challenge was more difficult for federal government decision makers than to set priorities making hard choices in allocating limited resources39 the 911 commission recommended that state and local homeland security assistance should be allocated strictly on risk and vulnerability assessments in 2004 new york city and washington dc would lik ely be at or near the top of any threat assessment list the commission indicated th at it understands the argument for state and local baseline security it stated unequivocally however that federal homeland security assistance should not remain pr ogram for general revenue sharing it suggested that federal

example of this would be the decision by dhs to raise the homeland security advisory system hsas threat level from elevatedyellow to h ighorange on august 1 2004 this action based in part on terrorist threat intelligence that was reportedly preseptember 11 2001 led to the following comment by nior law enforcement official there is nothing right now that were hearing that is new why did we go to this level i still dont know that41 another example would be attorney general john ashcrofts june 14 2004 announcement that secret cell of qaeda had plotted to attack an undisclosed columbus ohio shopping mall42 some arguing against the proposed risk and vulnerability criteria pointed out that when security increases in one loca tion there was possibility that terrorists search for other softer targets43 additionally in letter to former dhs secretary ridge the democrats on the house select committee on homeland security now the house committee on homeland security expressed concern that inconsistent methodology for extracting data about key critical infrastructur assets around the nation resulted in incomplete and inadequate vulnerability assessments44 those responding to such critics noted that risk and vulnerability assessments based on credible and corrobor ated intelligence were arguably the logical method of allocating limited homeland security ssistance funding the recommendation however was based on the 911 commission s recognition of the reality of limited funding for protecting the nation and that risk and vulnerability assessments based on available intelligence were two main criteria in determining the appropriate level of homeland security it may be argued however that th 911 commissions recommendation did not provide sufficient guidance for distributin g homeland security assistance based on risk and vulnerability assessments the recommendation however identified the political issues associated with homeland security funding distribution additionally the recommendation proposed such crite ria as population population density vulnerability and the presence of critical infrastructure the 911 commission did not define risk and vulnerability factors nor did it define critical infrastructure in the absence of definitions for these criteria each state could have theoretically argued for significant portion of homela nd security funding based on its own definition of risk vulnerability and critical infrastructure if congress legislates the 911 co mmission recommendation to distribute homeland security assistance

statutory or conference report language to authorize states and localities to use shsgp funding for overtime costs during this threat level if congress chose not to authorize the use of shsgp funding fo r overtime costs it could direct odp to increase the per centage of letpp and uasi funding it authorizes states and localities to use for overtime costs some could argue that the federal government specifically dhs determines when there is need to raise the hsas threat level thus the federal gove rnment should assist states and localities when they raise their homeland security due to this threat level this option however could be compared to the fundi ng of homeland security personnel issue and the discussion of the fede ral governments non role in funding personnel at the state and
