the president has approved secretary gates and the joint chiefs of staffs unanimous recommendation for improved missile defenses in europe against the threat from iran to our forces and families deployed to the region and to our allies iran already has hundreds of ballistic missiles that can threaten its neighbors in the middle east turkey and the caucasus and it is actively developing and testing ballistic missiles that can reach more and more of europe our concern regarding iranian missile capabilities is further increased by the fact that our intelligence community continues to assess that iran at minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons the new phased adaptive approach recommended by secretary gates updates and revises the previous program for missile defense in europe based on two key findings of the dod review first the threat from irans regional ballistic missiles has developed more rapidly than previously expected at the same time the threat from potential iranian intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms has been slower to develop than we state 00096550 002 of 006 previously expected second our missile defense capabilities and technologies have advanced significantly improved interceptor capabilities such as the currently deployed standard missile3 sm3 interceptor and advanced variants that are already in development permit more flexible and capable architecture therefore the president has approved phased adaptive approach that is responsive to the current threat but also can incorporate new technologies quickly and costeffectively to adapt as the threat and our technologies continue to change it will unfold in phases the first phase will speed protection of us deployed forces civilians and families and our allies in europe against the current threat from iran by deploying proven systems by 2011 about six or seven years earlier than the previous program subsequent phases will add advanced variant sea and landbased versions of the sm3 and cover additional territory in europe should the iranian threat expand in the fourth and final phase we will anticipate augmenting our existing capabilities to defend the united states against potential advances in irans icbm capability with advanced versions of the sm3 this would be similar capability to that provided in the program of record this improved approach removes the need for ground based interceptor field in poland and features distributed interceptor and sensor architecture that does not require the single large fixed radar originally planned to be located in the czech republic under the new approach land and seabased missile defense interceptors and sensors offer some flexibility to be redeployed as the regional ballistic missile threat dictates this distributed network approach also will increase the survivability of the system and provide more opportunities for collaboration with allies and partners we are beginning consultations with poland the czech republic and other allies on the new approach and will work with our nato allies on determining locations for the sensors and interceptors and on integrating the phased adaptive approach with their missile defense capabilities and with the emerging nato command and control network strong missile defenses will strengthen our efforts to find solution that brings iran into compliance with its international obligations the more we can diminish the coercive value of irans missiles the less iran stands to gain by continuing to develop these destabilizing capabilities this set of recommendations comes from an ongoing congressionallymandated review that is taking comprehensive examination of our global approach to missile defense and is consistent with the defense departments budget choices for fiscal year 2010 for example we added additional funding to field more systems such as aegis bmd ships and sm3 interceptors end text of talking points 5 srel nato begin text of talking points for usnato and embassies in nato capitals talking points below should be used for all nato capitals except for poland and the czech republic warsaw and prague will receive separate tailored talking points to be delivered on september 17 by the flournoytauscher delegation general nato leaders have all agreed that ballistic missile proliferation poses an increasing threat to allies forces territory and populations as result nato has noted the significant contribution to alliance security by those allies who possess or are state 00096550 003 of 006 acquiring missile defense capabilities at the 2008 summit nato leaders agreed to consider options for nato missile defense system that would cover all remaining areas of allied populations and territory to date those efforts have focused on missile defense systems to protect deployed forces from shorterrange ballistic missile threats at the 2009 nato summit heads of state and government tasked experts to examine the potential expansion of the altbmd program which is designed to be the command and control backbone for theater missile defense for deployed forces the united states now proposes phased adaptive approach which will reinforce and strengthen ongoing nato efforts specifically we believe that the phased adaptive approach is fully supportive of the decision to pursue options for complementary natowide multilayered bmd architecture which currently is envisioned to use natos command and control backbone architecture this is flexible and costeffective approach that leverages proven technologies against known threat most importantly the phased adaptive approach is designed to work in concert with allied efforts to provide protection against ballistic missile attack for all nato allies reflecting the alliance principle of indivisibility of security the phased adaptive approach will provide our most proven and operational missile defense capabilities in the nearterm defending allied territory sooner against the current iranian threat us missile defense efforts will of course be fully interoperable with those of nato we propose that subsequent to alliance discussions and followon briefings in greater detail the alliance examine how we can integrate the us phased adaptive approach with nato missile defense this can be discussed further at the upcoming defense ministerial in bratislava the phased adaptive approach would serve to greatly strengthen natos missile defense capabilities in the face of growing threat to alliance security we look forward to engaging the alliance in political and technical discussions in the weeks ahead financing if raised we will work closely with allies to examine broader resourcing requirements for defense of allied forces territories and populations including the integration of our phased adaptive approach role for nato members we have already consulted with the two allies that had agreed to host missile defense assets under the previous plan i want to reiterate that we are deeply appreciative of their readiness to take difficult political decisions to respond to the need to better protect allied territories and populations against the threat of ballistic missiles we intend to engage in active consultations at nato on the best way forward the phased adaptive approach is flexible and could be integrated into nato territorial missile defense system there will be requirement for allies to host the sensors and interceptors to be included in the phased adaptive approach there are many possibilities and we look forward to continuing our nato consultations if pressed at this time i would prefer not to get into state 00096550 004 of 006 specific issues related to potential host nations we have many options in this flexible architecture sea and landbased northern and southern europe we intend to engage soon at nato with allies on those questions we expect that allied national systems or current nato systems will be able to integrate well with the overall phased approach allied contributions can be interoperable with the phased approach missile defense architecture to ensure they form costeffective and comprehensive architecture ground based interceptors if needed the us will continue to develop the gbi technology for conus defense because domestically it remains costeffective option however we have plans to pursue gbis in europe given the promise and track record of sm3 technology end text of talking points for nato 6 crel russia begin text of talking points for russia the presidents missile defense in europe decision will publicly be announced at 1000 am washington dc time the national security advisor general jones will be delivering similar message to ambassador kislyak before the announcement the decision is the result of long review process new information on the iranian ballistic missile program drove the decision iran has made more progress on shortrange and mediumrange ballistic missiles and less progress on icbms than anticipated now the threat is greater to the middle east and to europe with less immediate threat to the united states we do not plan to deploy gbis in poland and we will not base the european midcourse radar in the czech republic instead there will be an adaptive phased approach we believe that iran plans to deploy hundreds of these shortrange and mediumrange ballistic missiles our old plan was designed to intercept only small numbers of icbms there is doubt that iran is developing these missiles to arm them with nuclear warhead there is other reason to spend so much time and effort into developing these missiles they are not useful weapons if only armed with conventional warhead the new plan for european missile defense is better designed to protect europe from this iranian threat that is emerging we intend to deploy the sm3 interceptor which is what we are deploying in the middle east as well sm3s do not have the capability to threaten russian icbms in the first stages of deployment we also are seeking to place these interceptors closer to iran from what i understand this is exactly the idea that president putin proposed to president bush during their july 2007 meeting at kennebunkport maine the new plan calls for radars and detection systems to be deployed closer to iran these radars will not have the capacity to track russian icbms with this decision behind us we now want to move aggressively to launch serious cooperation on missile defense with russia as the president said during his meeting with president medvedev in april we want to begin by standing up the joint data exchange center jdec the hope is to share data from our respective earlywarning systems state 00096550 005 of 006 end text of talking points for russia 7 crel japan begin text of talking points for japan the us greatly appreciates japans partnership in bmd we remain deeply committed to strengthening regional bmd capabilities including operational cooperation joint research and codevelopment recent north korean provocations serve as reminder of the importance of our cooperative missile defense efforts which help underpin strong usjapan alliance and contribute to regional stability we remain committed to an effective defense of the us and our allies against rogue ballistic missile threats including north korea and if it continues down its current path iran as you are aware the bmd review has undertaken comprehensive examination of our approach to missile defenses including an indepth look at our approach to european missile defense and in other regions around the world usg discussions with the mod and mofa over the last several months made clear that you have particular interest in the european missile defense analysis we understand these strategic decisions have an impact in the asiapacific region and want to make sure you are fully informed of our results throughout the review process the us recognized and factored in japanese concernsequities especially those related to our ongoing discussions with the russian federation although the bmd review report is not due to congress until this january we have already reached some important conclusions we have decided to move forward with discussing results now so we do not delay deploying improved defenses for ourselves or our allies other consultations we would like to explain the presidents decision to you before our public announcement and before we speak with russia we are discussing this new european approach with poland the czech republic and nato as we speak as close and trusted ally we consider it important to share this information with you however in light of past problems with information security we must insist that you take every precaution to ensure that this information will not be leaked any leaks would have significant implications for our european missile defense approach and would be damaging to our bilateral relationship should there be security breach elsewhere it is important that our governments not officially confirm leaked information if it appears in the media before official release by the us government the phased adaptive approach as you have seen the new plan for european missile defense will use the sm3 interceptor both land and seabased rather than gbis included in the previous program in many ways your leadership and partnership in the development of the sm3 and in operational coordination have been critical to our development of this new approach to europe just as we have cooperatively deployed proven and transportable missile defenses to help defend against ballistic missile threats in the asiapacific region we will deploy those same technologies and capabilities in europe at this time the new european approach is based on usowned sm3s however we will want to look at future missile defense opportunities with nato and our european state 00096550 006 of 006 allies that could include potential sales of number of missile defense capabilities we would very much like to work with japan to make strategic decisions about whether and how our jointly developed missile ie the sm3 block iia could be part of that future and perhaps part of future networked global system of regional missile defense architectures we look forward to continuing our strong partnership on missile defense and growing our cooperative activities bmd for japan and east asia as mentioned previously the phased approach in europe is in many ways similar to the approach we have taken with you we believe that our current approach in the asia pacific region is sound and forms model that we can draw upon elsewhere naturally we will reengage with you soon on the full findings of our bmd review if asked about burden sharing at nato as you well know this type of approach creates opportunities for participation for example in command and control sensors and interceptors and enhanced cooperation similar to the type that we already enjoy we look forward to engaging with nato soon about how our new approach contributes to common defenses and how we can share responsibilities in that effort end text of talking points for japan 8 u begin text of talking points for gulf cooperation council states bahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia united arab emirates the usg has adopted phased adaptive approach for the ballistic missile defense bmd of europe the approach in europe complements the emerging bmd architecture in the gulf which is currently defending against potential iranian air and missile threats to our partners and us forces in the gulf region we are working to optimize limited assets to ensure that programs in europe will not be executed at the expense of our friends and commitment to the defense of the gulf cooperation council bmd programs in europe will not require diversion of us assets from the gulf the united states has deployed bmd systems to the middle east to protect against the iranian missile threat including aegis bmd presence in the persian gulf and two patriot batteries each in bahrain kuwait qatar and the uae these us systems complement the indigenous bmd systems in the region including pacii capability in saudi arabia and kuwait and shared early warning capability with the uae the usg is exploring the possibility of providing additional bmd coverage to gulf cooperation council nations if the circumstances warrant the usg will continue to work with its gulf partners to develop regional integrated air and missile defense systems end text of talking points for gcc states clinton
