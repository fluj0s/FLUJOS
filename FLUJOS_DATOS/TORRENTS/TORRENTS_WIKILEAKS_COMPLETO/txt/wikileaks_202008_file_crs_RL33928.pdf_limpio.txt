related to expanded production introduction high petroleum and gasoline prices concerns over global climate change and the desire to promote domestic rural economies have raised interest in biofuels as an alternative to petroleum in the us tran sportation sector biofuels most notably cornbased ethanol have grown significan tly in the past few years as component of us motor fuels for example nearly half of all us gasoline contains some ethanol mostly blended at the 10 level or lower however current supply represents only about 36 of annual ga soline demand on volume basis and only about 24 on an energy basis in 2006 the united states consumed roughly 5 billion gallons of biofuels mostly ethanol this 5 billion gallons was blended into roughly 65 billion gallons of gasoline to tal annual gasoline consumption is roughly 140 billion gallons recent proposals including president bu shs goal in his 2007 state of the union address aim to significantly ex pand biofuel supply in the coming decades the presidents goal would be to expand consumption from 5 billion gallons in 2007 to 35 billion gallons in 2017 while this proposal included not just biofuels but alternative fuels including fuels from coal or natural gas it would likely mean significant growth in biofuels production ove r the next 10 years other legislative proposals would require significant expans ion of biofuels production in the coming decades some proposals would require 30 b illion gallons of biofuels alone by 2030 or 60 billion gallons by 2050 current us biofuel suppl relies almost exclusively on ethanol produced from midwest corn other fuels that play smaller role include ethanol from brazilian sugar biodiesel from us soybeans and ethanol from us sorghum significant increase in us biofuels would likely re quire movement away from food and grain crops for example us ethanol produc tion in 2006 consumed roughly 17 of the us corn crop if only corn is use d expanding ethanol production to 35 billion gallons would require more corn than th united states currently produces which would be infeasible corn and other grains have myriad other uses and such shift would have drastic consequences for most agricultural markets including grains since corn would compete with other grai ns for land livestock since the cost of animal feed would likely increase and land since total harvested acreage would likely increase in addition to agricultura l effects such an increase in cornbased ethanol would likely affect fuel costs ce biofuels tend to be more expensive than petroleum

policy issues by brent d yacobuccithe environment since the expansion of cornbased ethanol production raises many environmental questions these constraints are discussed below due to the concerns with significant expansion in cornbased ethanol supply interest has grown in expanding the market for biodiesel di esel substitute produced from vegetable and animal oils and spurring the development of motor fuels produced from cellulosic materials including grasses trees and agricultural and municipal wastes however all of th technologies are currently even more expensive than cornbased ethanol in addition to expanding domestic producti on of biofuels ther is some interest in expanding imports of sugarbased ethanol from brazil and other countries however ethanol from brazil is currently subject to 54 centpergallon tariff that in most years is significant barrier to direct brazilian imports some brazilian ethanol can be brought into the unite d states duty free if it is dehydrated reprocessed

about 2 of the total us market any fuel produced from biological ma terials eg food crops agricultural residues municipal waste is generally referred to as b iofuel more specifically the term generally refers to liquid transportation fuels the most significant biofuel in the united states is ethanol produced from us corn1 approximately 49 billion gallons of ethanol were produced in th united states in 2006 mostly from corn other domestic feedstocks for ethanol in clude grain sorghum and sweet sorghum imported ethanol 600 million gallons in 2006 is usually produced from sugar cane in brazil ethanol is generally blended into gasoline at the 10 level or lower e10 ethanol can be used in purer forms such as e85 85 ethanol and 15 gasoline in vehicles specially designed for its use

4 billion bushels in 2008 the ethanoldriven surge in corn demand s fueled sharp rise in corn prices for example the futures contract fo r march 2007 corn on the chicago board of trade rose from 250 per bushel in septem ber 2006 to contract high of over 416 per bushel in january 2007 rise of 66 this sharp rise in corn prices owes its origins largely to increasing corn demand spurred by the rapid expansion of corn based ethanol production capacity in the united states since mid2006 the rapid growth in ethanol capacity has been fueled by both strong energy prices and variety of government incentives regulations and programs major federal incentives include tax credit of 051 to fuel blenders for every gallon of ethanol blended with gasoline renewable fuel standard rfs that mandates rene

year5 market participants econo mists and biofuels skeptic s have begun to question the need for continued large federal in centives in support of ethanol production particularly when the sector would have been profitable during much of 2006 without such subsidies6 their concerns focus on the pot ential for widespread unintended consequences that might result from excessive federal incentives adding to the rapid expansion of ethanol production capacity nd the demand for corn to feed future ethanol production these questions extend to issues concerning the ability of the gasolinemarketing

further corn production is among the most energyintensive of the major field crops an expansion of corn area would likely have important and unwanted environmental consequences due to the resulting increase in fertilizer and ch emical use and soil erosion the national corn growers association estimates that us cornb ased ethanol production could expand to between 128 and 178 billion gallons by 2015 without significantly affecting agricultural markets7 however as noted above ot her evidence suggests effects are already being felt in the current runup in production feed markets prolonged higher corn prices could have significant consequences for traditional feed markets and the livestock industries that depend on those feed markets corn has trad itionally represented about 57 of feed concentrates and processed feedstuffs fed to animals in the united states8 as corn based ethanol production increases so do total corn demand and corn prices dedicating an increasing share of the us corn harvest to ethanol production will likely lead to higher prices for all grains and oilseeds that compete for the same land resulting in higher feed costs for cattle hog and poultry producers in addition supply distortions are likely to develop in proteinmeal markets related to expanding production of the ethanol processing by product distillers dried grains ddg which averages about 30 protein content nd can substitute in certain feed and meal markets9 while ddg use would substitute for some of the lost feed value of corn used in ethanol processing about 66 of th original weight of corn is consumed in producing ethanol and is long er available for feed fu rthermore not all livestock species are well adapted to dramatically increased consumption of ddg in their rations dairy cattle appear to be best suited to expanding ddgs share in feed rations poultry and pork are much less able to adapt also ddg must be dried before it can be transported long distances adding to feed costs there may be some potential for largescale livestock producer s to relocate near new feed sources but such relocation would likely have important regional economic effects exports the united states is the worlds leading producer and exporter of corn increased use of corn for ethanol production could diminish us capacity for exports since 1980 us corn production has accounted for over 40 of world production while us corn exports have re presented nearly 66 share of world corn trade during the past decade in the 2006 2007 marketing year the united states is expected to export about 21 of its corn production10 higher corn prices would likely result in lost export sales it is unclear what type of market adjustments would occur in global feed markets since veral different grains and feedstuffs arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33928crs6 relatively close substitutes pricesensitive corn importers may quickly switch to alternative cheaper sources of feed depe nding on the availability of supplies and the adaptability of animal rations in contrast less pricesensitive corn importers such as japan and taiwan may choos to pay higher price in an attempt to bid the corn away from ethanol plants there could be significant economic effects to us grain companies and to the us agricultural sector if ethanolinduced higher corn prices caused sustained reshaping of international grain trade food vs fuel sustained rise in grain pri ces driven by ethanol feedstock demand could lead to higher us and world food prices most corn grown in the united states is used for animal feed higher feed costs ultimately lead to higher meat prices the feed price effect will first translate into higher prices for poultry and hogs which are less able to use alternate feedstuffs dairy and beef cattle are more versatile in their ability to shift to alternate feed sources but eventually sustained rise in corn prices will push their feed costs upward as well the price of corn is also linked to the price of othe r grains including those destined for food markets through competition in the feed marketplace and in the producers planting choices for limited acreage the price runup in the us corn market has already spilled over into price increases in the markets for soybeans and soybean oil since food costs represent relatively sm all share of consumer spending for most us households the price runup is re latively easily absorbed in the short run however the situation is very different for lowerincome households as well as in many foreign markets where food expenses can represent larger portion of the household budget due to trade linkages the increase in us corn prices has become concern for international markets as well in january mexico experienced riots following nearly 30 price increase for tortillas the countrys dietary staple in china where corn is also an important food source the government has recently put halt to its planned ethanol plant expansion due to the threat it poses to the countrys food security similarly humanitarian groups have expressed concern for the potential difficulties that higher grain prices imply for developing countries that are net food importers energy supply issues ethanol is not primary energy source energy stored in biological material through photosynthesis must be converted into more useful portable fuel this conversion requires energy the amount nd types of energy used to produce ethanol and the feedstocks for ethanol production are of key concern because of the input energy requirements the energy and environmental bene fits of corn ethanol may be limited energy balance frequent argument for the use of ethanol as motor fuel is that it reduces us reliance on oil impor ts making the us less vulnerable to fuel embargo of the sort th at occurred in the 1970s howe ver while corn ethanol use displaces petroleum its overall effect on total energy consumption is less clear to analyze the net energy consumption of ethanol the entire fuel cycle must be considered the fuel cycle consists of all inputs and proce sses involved in the development delivery and final use of the fuel for cornbased ethanol these inputs include the

combustion review of research studies on ethanols energy balance and greenhouse gas missions found that most studies give cornbased ethanol slight positive energy balance of about 1211 natural gas demand as ethanol production in creases the energy needed to process the corn into ethanol which is derived primarily from natural gas in the united states can be expected to increas for example if the entire 49 billion gallons of ethanol produced in 2006 used na tural gas as processing fuel it would have required an estimated 240 to 290 billion cubic feet cu ft of natural gas12 if the entire 2006 corn crop of 105 billion bushels were converted into ethanol the energy requirements would be equivalent to approximately 14 to 17 trillion cu ft of natural gas this would have represented about 6 to 8 of total us natural gas consumption which was an est imated 222 trillion cu ft in 200513 the united states has been net importer of natural gas since the early 1980s because natural gas is used extensively in electricity pr oduction in the united states significant increase in its use as processing fuel in the production of ethanol would likely increase prices and imports of natural gas energy security despite the fact that ethanol displaces gasoline the benefits to energy security from cornbased ethanol are not certain as was stated above while roughly 20 of the us corn crop is used for ethanol ethanol only accounts for approximately 24 of gasoline consumption on an energy equivalent basis14 the import share of us petroleum cons umption was estimated at 54 in 2004 and is expected to grow to 70 by 202515 further as long as ethanol remains dependent on the us corn supply any threats to this supply such as drought or increases in corn prices would negatively affect the suppl andor cost of ethanol in fact that happened when high corn prices caused by strong export demand in 1995 contributed to an 18 decline in etha nol production between 1995 and

potential as petroleum import substitute appears to be limited by crop area constraints among other factors18 infrastructure and distribution issues in addition to the above concerns about raw material supply for ethanol production both corn and energy there are additional issues involving ethanol distribution and infrastructure expa nding ethanol production will likely strain existing supply infrastructure further expansion of ethanol use beyond certain levels will require i nvestment in entirely new infrast ructure that would be necessary to handle higher and higher per centage of ethanol in gasoline distribution issues ethanolblended gasoline tends to separate in pipelines further ethanol is corrosive and may dama ge existing pipelines therefore unlike petroleum products ethanol and ethanol blended gasoline cannot be shipped by pipeline in the united states another issue with pipeline transportation is that corn ethanol must be moved from rural areas in the midwest to more populated areas which are often located along the coasts this shipment is in the opposite direction of existing pipeline transportation which moves gasoline from refiners along the coast to other coastal cities and into the in terior of the country while some studies have concluded that shippi ng ethanol or ethanolblende d gasoline via pipeline could be feasible major us pipeline has made the investments to allow such shipments19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33928crs9 20 ilan brat and daniel machalaba can ethanol get ticket to ride the wall street journal feb 1 2007 p b1 21 national ethanol vehicle coalition frequently asked questions accessed february 3 2006 http wwwe85fuelco me85101faqphp 22 federal highway administration highway statistics 2003 november 2004 washingtonthus the current distribution system for ethanol is dependent on rail cars tanker trucks and barges these deliver ethanol to fuel terminals where it is blended with gasoline before shipment via tanker truck to gasoline retailers however these transport modes lead to higher prices than pipeline transport and the supply of current shipping options especially rail cars is limited for example according to industry estimates the number of ethanol carloads has tripled between 2001 and 2006 nd the number is expected to increase by another 30 in 200720 significant increase in corn based ethanol production would further strain this tight transport situation because of these distribution issues some pipeline operators are seeking ways to make their systems compatible with et hanol or ethanolblended gasoline these modifications could include coating the in terior of pipelines with epoxy or some other corrosionresistant material another potential strategy could be to replace all susceptible pipeline components with newe r hardier components however even if such modifications are technically possible they will likely be expensive and could further increase etha nol transportation costs higherlevel et hanol blends one key benefit of gasolineethanol blends up to 10 ethanol is that they are compatible with existing vehicles and infrastructure eg fuel tanks retail pumps etc all

necessary for terminal tanks ta nker trucks retail tanks pumps etc there is also interest in expanding th use of e85 85 ethanol 15 gasoline current e85 consumption represents only pproximately 1 of ethanol consumption in the united states key reason for th relatively low consumption of e85 is that relatively few vehicles operate on e85 the national ethanol vehicle coalition estimates that there are approximately six million e85capable vehicles on us roads21 as compared to approximately 230 million gasoline and dieselfueled vehicles22 most e85capable vehicles are fle xible fuel vehicles or ffvs an ffv can operate on any mixture of gasoline and between 0 and 85 ethanol however owners of large majority of the ffvs on u s roads choose to fuel them exclusivelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33928crs10 23 ethanol has lower energy content than gasoline per gallon therefore ffvs tend to have lower fuel economy when operating on e85 for the use of e85 to be economical the pump price for e85 must be low enough to make up for the decreased fuel economy relative to gasoline generally to have equivalent permile costs e85 must cost 20 to 30 less per gallon at the pump than gasoline 24 david sedgwick automotive news january 29 2007 p 112 25 usda the economic feasibility of ethanol produc tion from sugar in the united states july 2006 washington 26 for more information see crs report rs21930 ethanol imports and the caribbean basin initiative by brent d yacobucciwith gasoline largely due to higher permile fuel cost23 and lower availability of e85 however e85 capacity is expanding rapi dly with the number of e85 stations roughly doubling between february 2006 and february 2007 but those stations still represent less than 1 of us gasoline retailers further expansion will require significant investments especially at the retail level if new e85 pump and underground tank are necessary they can cost as much as 100000 to 200000 to install24 however if existing equipment can be used with little modification the cost could be less than 10000 sugar ethanol excluding feedstock costs producing et hanol from sugar cane can be less costly than producing it from corn this is because the starch in corn must first be broken down into sugar before it can be fermented adding costly processing further sugar cane waste bagasse can be burned to provi process energy for the ethanol plant reducing associated energy costs and improving sugar ethanols energy balance relative to corn ethanol using sugar can brazil produces nearly as much ethanol as the united states but its passenger vehi cle fuel demand is roughly 90 lower brazils success at integrating sugar etha nol into the fuel supply has stimulated interest in adopting brazilian practices in the united states however differences in market prices for sugar in the two countries cause the economics of sugarbased ethanol to differ significantly usda c oncluded that producing sugar cane ethanol in the united states would be more than tw ice as costly as us corn ethanol and nearly three times as costly as brazilian sugar ethanol25 feedstock costs accounted for most of this price differential therefore the usda study shows that while sugar ethanol may be positive energy strategy in other countries it may not be economical in the united states because of the above cost advantage it is expected that an sugar ethanol used in the united states will continue to be brazilian ethanol reprocessed in caribbean basin initiative cbi c ountries or imported directly

400 million tons of biomass from agricultural residues to economically supply those residues to biofuel producers farm equipment manufacturers would likely need to develop one pass harvesters that could collect and separate crops and crop residues at the same timethere is only one demonstra tionscale plant in canada30 major barrier to cellulosic fuel production is that production costs still re main significantly higher than for corn ethanol or other alternative fuels cu rrently various produ ction processes are prohibitively expensive including physical chemical enzymatic and microbial treatment and conversion of thes feedstocks into motor fuel key potential benefit of energy crops g prairie grasses fastgrowing trees is that they can be grown without the n eed for chemicals reducing or eliminating the need for chemical fertiliz ers would address one of th largest energy inputs for cornbased ethanol production using biom ass to power biofuel production plant could further reduce fossil fuel inputs im proving the net energy balance of ethanol would also reduce net fuel cy cle greenhouse gas emissions however increases in peracre yields would be required to make energy crops for fuel production economically competitive questions remain whether high yields can be achieved without the use of fertiliz ers and pesticides another question is whether there is sufficient feedstock supply available usda estimates that by 2030 13 billion tons of biomass could be ava ilable for bioenergy production i ncluding electricity from biomass and fuels from corn and cellulose31 from that enough biofuels could be produced to replace roug hly 70 billion gallons of gasoline per year however this projection assumes significant increases in peracre yields and according to usda should be seen as an upper bound on what is possible further new harvesting machinery would need to be developed to guarantee an economic supply of cellulosic feedstocks32 in addition to the above concerns ot her potential environmental drawbacks associated with cellulosic fuels must be addressed such as the potential for soil erosion runoff and the spr ead of invasive species conclusion there is continuing interest in expanding the us biofuel industry as strategy for promoting energy security and environmental goals however there are limits to the amount of biofuels that can be produced and questions about the net energy and environmental bene fits they would provide furthe r rapid expansion of biofuel production may have many unintended and unde sirable consequences for
