decisionmaking procedure background congress is now considering enlargement of nato an issue addressed at the allied summit in prague in november 2002 during the last round of enlargement the senate voted 8019 on april 30 1998 in fa vor of admitting poland the czech republic and hungary to nato twothirds senate majority is necessary to admit new states because enlargement is considered an amendm ent to the original north atlantic treaty other members of the allian ce followed suit and the thr ee countries became members in march 1999 it was the fourth time that nato had admitted new states with membership increasing from the original 12 to 19 today at the previous nato summit in april 1999 the allies underscored that they were open to further enlargement they created membership action plan map outlining structured goals for candidates such as endi ng the danger of ethni c conflict developing democratic society with transparent political and ec onomic processes and civilian control of the military and pledging co mmitment to defense budgets to build military forces able to contribute to missions from collective defense to peacekeeping1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21055crs2 2 nato

values washington post march 4 2002 p a19at prague on november 21 2002 the current members heads of state designated the three baltic states latvia lithuania and estonia slovenia slovakia bulgaria and romania as prospective members the current debate in 1998 the congressional deba over nato enlargement covered such issues as costs mission and qualifications of the candidates the issu of costs has now seemingly been put to rest because entry of po land the czech republic and hungary does not appear to have required extra us funds mo st observers believe that the three countries have contributed to stability in europe and have made significant political contributions to the alliance in such matters as enhanc ing natos understanding of central and eastern europe russia and the balkans given the hi story of the new memb ers involvement with these regions militarily their contribution is less apparent each of the three contributes forces to the natoled peace operations in the balkans and is building forces to defend its borders pentagon officials believe that poland has made the greatest strides in restructuring and modernizing its military nd that the czech republic and hungary have made considerab ly less progress2 it should be noted that period of years is normally necessary to rebuild military that has had an authoritarian traditi on and convert it to one having civilian control purge it of oldguard elements reform its training and purchase equipment compatible with new set of allies there has been some sentiment that nat should delay invitations to candidate states until democratic processes are fir mly entrenched for example the recent hungarian government of victor orban was criticized for an ethnic status law that some interpreted as cloaking hung arian aspirations for territory from neighboring states having hungarian minorities3 others reject such sentiments noting that orban was freely elected and dismissing the status law as nothing more than passing example of nationalist politics before close election n onetheless it is possible that the period between naming candidate states for accession negotiations at prague in november 2002 and the moment when current nato member governments decide whether to admit those candidates such as the vote in the us senate could see debates over whether each candidate continues to meet criteria for democracy particularly if there is an election bringing in government that member states view as extremist the north atlantic treaty does not contain provision for expelling or disciplining member state another factor for considera tion could prove to be pr ospective members efforts to persuade its people that nato membership is desirable sl ovenia held referendum on march 23 2003 66 of those voting 66 supported nato membership despite popular opposition to the war in iraq that pproaches 80 other candidate state intends to hold referendum on nato membership the essence of the current enlargement debate is over qualifications with apparent consensus of an original ne candidates two candidates albania andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21055crs3 4 for review of developments in 9 states

sess 107th congress jan 18 2001macedonia did not receive invitations at prague4 each of these countries is small with comparably small militaries potentially capable of specialized functions such as transport or medical care for example but only minimally capable of building forces able to contribute to highintensity conflict in the vi ew of some observers to adhere to the letter of the military qualifications outlined in the 1999 summit communiqué requiring new members to contribute to missions from peacekeeping to collective defense would be tantamount to excluding their entry many participants in the debate favor diffe rent standards that in their view reflect the current political situation in europe where russia is longer military threat but ethnic conflict nationalism nd terrorism are danger in such circumstances they contend political stability and modernized milita ry at least able to contribute to border defense and to peace operations are an appropr iate standard secretary of state powell seemed to suggest such standard in his confirmation hearing wh he stressed need for candidates to modernize their militaries and to strengthen their democratic structures5 an opposing view is that nato should first cl early define its mission above all with an agreement on what types of outofarea threats such as terrorism proliferation or disruption of the flow of oil should be met with possible military response at that point enlargement should be considered with determination about which prospective members might contribute to the mission some observers also hesitant about enlargement note that the united states flew over 60 percent of combat missions in the kosovo conflict they prefer prospective mbers that could relie ve the us burden yet another view is that there is cl ear dichotomy between collective defense highintensity conflict undertaken in response for example to the attacks of september 11 2001 and collective security peace operati ons and humanitarian assistance in this view countries contributing to peace operations assist in building stable societies and preventing black holes such as bosnia or afghanistan where terrorism may take root countries involved in peace operations the n are contributing to the prevention of terrorism and thereby to collective defense the terrorist attacks against the united states on september 11 2001 are affecting the enlargement debate likely part of the enlargement debate will be how prospective members might contribute to the conflict against terrorism or act to stem the flow of weapons of mass destruction nato seemed pa rtially to settle one aspect of the debate over its mission shortly after the attacks wh member states invoked article v the alliances collective defense clause to come to the aid of the united states in the conflict against terrorism previously the european allies had resisted any statement that article v should be invoked in an outofarea action against terrorism at nato ministerial meeting in reykjavik in may 2002 the allies agreed that they must be able to carry outhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21055crs4 6 communiqué nato ministerial may 14 2002 7 lock horns

are needed sustain operations over distance and time and achieve their objectives6 however not all member states have sufficiently mobile or appropriately trained forces for the current tasks in afghanistan and iraq for example few allies besides the united states have special forces or mobile largeformation combat forces with the potential to contribute meaningfully to such conflicts at the same time number of allies have an intelligence capability transport medical units and political influence that might assist in such conflicts as the terrorism conflict unfolds current members may examine how prospective members might be able to contribute contributions might include political influence and support for example in the united nations or with russia or muslim states and not necessarily military potential they might also examine the level of internal security in the candidate countries and ability to control borders disrupt terrorist fina ncial networks or apprehend terrorist suspects on their soil elements of the map that emphasize an end to corruption may be increasingly undersco red given the postse ptember 11 importance of preventing moneylaundering and combating black economy the alliance experienced sharp divisions over whether to use military force against iraq in january 2003 bush administration fficials applauded the decision of the 7 candidate states and others to sign letter that in genera l endorsed the us position on iraq some candidates state representatives complained that they had been bullied by the administration into signing the letter six of the seven candidate states joined the coalition slovenia was the exception but allowe d overflight by us and uk forces the failure to achieve consensus in the north atlantic council over how and whether to aid turkey in the event of an attack by iraq exposed serious divisions in the alliance7 the fractious debate in the nac led some administration officials and members of congress to raise the issue of changing nato decisionmaking procedures8 views of the allies the debate over enlargement is quite di fferent in 2001 than it was in 1998 in 1998 several european allies str ongly supported enlargement today most member states couch discussion of enlarg ement in careful terms most member states agree that slovenia is politically qualified for membership in addition hungary urges slove nias membership once nato criteria for entry are met for strategic reasons hungary is not contig uous with any other nato state slovenias entry into the alliance would provide hung ary with land bridge to italy clear advantage given neutral austrias refu sal during the kosovo war to permit nato overflights to hungary slovakia is cred ible candidate in some nato capitals given the return in september 2002 elections of ke elements of its reform government some northern european allies such as poland strongly support membership for the baltichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21055crs5 states they contend that the baltic states have met osce and eu political guidelines for democracy and cite the three countries wo rk to build stability in the region and to establish better relations with russia us officials state that the baltic states have made the most progress in meeting map requirements although th ere is some criticism of how latvia has handled sensitive documents italy greece and turkey are strong suppor ters of bulgarias and romanias entry they contend that these two countries can contribute to stability in the balkans where europes greatest security needs lie critics counter that romania and bulgaria continue to suffer from corruption in their governing structures and that each must make stronger efforts to modernize its military bulgaria s also had succession of governments that have followed an uncerta in course towards politi cal and economic reform the views of the russian government play role in the debate putins softer rhetoric against nato enlargement since the september 11 terrorist attacks has allayed concerns that his government would strongly oppose enlargement it is possible that putin now views unified front agai nst terrorism in part due to moscows ongoing conflict in chechnya as more important than potential divisions with the allies over enlargement the duma and much of russias military and intelligence bureaucracy remain adamantly opposed to enlargement which they view as usled effort to move military alliance closer to their territory officials from allie d states often counter such an argument by underscoring that enlargements purpose in large part is to ensure stability in europe and that the addition of new member states provides stability and therefore security to russias west putin may also view the entry of estonia and latvia into nato and the eu in 2004 as means to protect russian minorities in those countries given nato and eu strictures over the treatment of ethnic minorities congressional views in the spring of 2003 both the senate foreign relations co mmittee and the senate armed services committee began hearings on enlargement some individual members have expressed their views and relevant legislation has been introduced the senate foreign relations committee produced repor t on enlargement together with the resolution of ratification xecutive report 1086 the inst rument on which the senate will vote to give its advice and consent to revision of the north atlantic treaty in the 107th congress rep shimkus and othe rs introduced hconres 116 which calls for nato invitations to the

the committees report accompanying the resolution reviews the st rengths and weaknesse s of the candidate states assessing their political economic and military policies it also reviews natos mission and capabilities relations with russia role in the balkan wars and the prague nato summit secretary of defense rumsfeld has stirred nato waters by suggesting the presence of an old and new europe the former consisting of such countries as france and germany the latter consisting of recent new members and candidate states secretary rumsfeld has suggested that the alliances future belongs to the united states and the new europe with the old europe increasingly marginalized european critics some of them in the candidate states oppose such categorization noting that germany has the largest economy in europe and that only fran ce with britain has military able to move its forces considerable distances for engagement in combat these critics express concern that divided nato will not be effective in confronting threats that face each member state9 next steps accession negotiations between nato and th candidate states were completed on march 26 2003 and the candidate st ate governments signed prot ocols that have been sent to the 19 member states each of which will follow its constitutional procedures to amend the north atlantic treaty to admit new memb ers all 19
