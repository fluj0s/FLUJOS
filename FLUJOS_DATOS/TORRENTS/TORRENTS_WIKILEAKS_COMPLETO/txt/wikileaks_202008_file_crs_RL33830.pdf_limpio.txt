representation c ontend that the districts unique governmental status resulted in its citizens equally unique and arguably undemocratic political status citizens residi ng in the district have vote in their national legislature although they pay fe deral taxes and may vote in presidential elections opponents often note that th constitution grants only states voting representation in congress they argue th at given the district s unique status and strict reading of the constitution avenue exists to provide district residents voting rights in the national legislature other than constitutional amendment or the statehood process which coul d be achieve by statute issues central to the district of columbia voting representation debate arguably revolve around two principles of our republican

house and senate statehood for the district of columbia and other statutory means such as virt ualstatehood ie designating the district state for the pur pose of voting representation in the recent

prohibiting or restricting the districts ability to advocate for congressional representation3 summary history of legislative options during the 10year period between 1790 to 1800 virginia and maryland residents that ceded land that would become the permanent seat of the government of the united states were subject to the laws for the state including the right to continue to vote in local state and national elections in their respective states until the national government began operations in december 1800 one year after establishing the district of columbia as the national capital district residents began seeking representation in the national legisl ature as early as 1801 citizens of what was then called the territory of colu mbia voiced concern about their political disenfranchisement pa mphlet published by augustus woodward reportedly protégé of thomas jeffers on captured their concern this body of people is as much entitled to the enjoyment of the rights of citizenship as any other part of the peopl of the united states there can exist necessity for their disenfranchisement necessity for them to repose on the mere generosity of their countrymen to be

rights has taken the form of constitutional amendment since the 1888 and 1889 resolutions more than 150 proposals have been introduced that woul d have used constitutional amendment to settle the question of voting re presentation for citizens of the district the proposals can be grouped into six general categories measures directing congress to provide for the election of two senators and the number of repres entatives the district would be entitled to if it were statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33830crs4 7 woodward quoted in noyes passim 8 woodward quoted in noyes p 195measures directing

specifying the number of representatives or senators and measures directing congress to pr ovide for voting representation in congress for the district appor tioned as if it were state initial efforts the idea of constitutional amendment was first suggested in 1801 by augustus brevoort woodward in pamphlet entitled considerations on the government of the territory of columbia7 although not member of congress mr woodward landowner in th city of washington served as member of the city council of washington his proposal to amend the constitution would have entitled the district to one senator and to number of members in the house of representative propor tionate to the citys popul ation the proposal which was never formally intr oduced may be found in appendix woodwards pamphlets which we re published between 1801 and 1803 provided rationale for his proposal arguing that the people of the territory of columbia do not cease to be part of the people of the united states and as such are titled to the enjoyment of the same rights with the rest of the people of the united st ates it is contrary to the genius of our constitution it is violating an original principal of republicanism to deny that all who are governed by laws ought to participation in the formulation of them8 woodward noted that the senate represente d the interest of sovereign states and that state was disadvantaged due to its population because the constitution granted each state an equal number of senate votes he acknowledged the distinction between the territory of columbia and states and argued that the territory whose residents were citizens of the united states s hould be considered half state and thus entitled to one vote in the senate with respect to the house of representatives woodward simply contended that house members were repres entatives of the people and that the citizens of the territory of columbia were therefore entitled to representation in the house equivalent to their population and consistent with the democratic principal of c onsent of the governed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33830crs5 9 senator henry blair remarks in the senate congressional record vol xix april 3

constitutional amendment providing for voting represen tation in congress for the district of columbia was formally introduced by senator henry blair of new hampshire during the 50th congress on april

which was printed in the congressional record 9 on april 5 1888 the senate judiciary committee was discharged from consider ing the resolution senator blair reintroduced modified version of the proposed amendment sjres 82 on may 15 1888 during the 51st congress senator blair reintr oduced both proposals as sjres 11 and sjres 18 the senate committee on privilege s and elections responded to both bills adversely on septembe r 17 1890 senator blair addressed the senate on the subject of the district of columbia representation in congress his statement referred to many of the arguments in s upport of voting representation in congress it admonished the senate for what the senator characterized as the hasty disposition of the amendments he introduced noting that this the lack of voting representation in congress for citizens of the district is trifling matter and i verily believe that it constitutes drop of poison in the heart of the republic which if left without its antidote will spread virus through that circulation which is the life of our liberties10 in the years between 1902 and 1917 veral bills proposed constitutional amendments entitling the district to two senators and representation in the house in accordance with its population although the senate district committee held hearing on s j res 32 in 1916 the sena took further action on the resolution on january 27 1917 senator chamberlain introduced sjres 196 in the 64th congress the bill empowered congress to recognize the citizens of the district as citizens of state for the purpose of c ongressional representation the resolution gave congress the power to determine th structure and qualifications of the districts delegation essentia lly allowing congress to act as state legislature in conformance with article i sec 4 clause 1 of the constitution congress would have been empowered to provide the district with one or two votes in the senate and such votes in the house that it woul d be entitled based on its population the resolution was noteworthy because it was the first resolution to be introduced that would have permitted rather than mandated that congress grant district residents voting representation in congress be tween 1917 and 1931 at least 15 resolutions of this type were introduced11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33830crs6 12 the sevenyear period does not appear in the constitution

retrocession as remedy for achievi ng voting representation for district residents was debated by congress during the first years following the establishment of the federal capital re trocession proposals typically would relinquish all but portion of the city of washington to ma ryland providing voting representation for the city residents located outside the design ated federal enclave retrocession could increase marylands congressiona l delegation by at least one additional seat in the house of representatives and provide distri ct residents in the newly retroceded area with voting representation in the senate according to proponents retrocession and the concurrent creation of federal enclave may address the constitutional provision regarding congresss authority to exercise exclusive legislative control over the federal district if past history is gu ide retrocession would probably be contingent upon acceptance by the state of maryland although parts of the district was retroceded to virginia in 1846 modern re trocession is judicially and politically untested proposition see discussion of virgin ia retrocession late r in this report opponents of retrocession note that the doption of such measure could force congress to consider the repeal of the 23rd amendment to the constitution which grants district residents representation in the electoral college equivalent to the number of senators and representatives in congress it would be entitled to if it were state if the amendment were not repealed the net effect would be to grant disproportionately large role in presiden tial elections to re lative small population residing in the federal enclave early debates on february 8 1803 representative john bacon of massachusetts introduced motion seeking to retrocede that part of the territory of columbia that was ceded by the states of maryland and virginia the motion made retrocession contingent on the state legislatures agreeing to the retrocession13 during the debate on the motion supporters of retrocession asserted that exclusive jurisdiction over the dist rict was not necessary or useful to the national government exclusive control of the district deprived the citizens of the districtof their political rights too much of congresss time would be consumed in legislating forthe district and that governing th district was too expensive congress lacked the competency to legislate for the district because it lacked sensitivity to local concerns and the district was not represen tative form of government as structured and thus denies citizens of the nations capital the right of suffrage on the other hand opponents of bacon s retrocession proposal argued that the national government needed place unencumbered by state lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33830crs8 14 us congress journal of the house of representative 41st cong 2nd sess washington continueddistrict residents had not complained or petitioned the congress on the question of retrocession and that congress could not retrocede the land without the consent of the citizens the district might be granted representation in congress when itachieved sufficient population the expense of administering the district would decrease over time retroceding the land removed th national government of any obligation to remain in place and the cession of land and congress s acceptance constituted contract that could only be dissolved by all parties involved including the states of maryland and virginia congress and the people of the district the bacon motion was defeated by vote of 66 to 26 year later on march 17 1804 repr esentative john dawson introduced similar provision that would have retroceded all of the virginia portion of the territory of

motion seeking retrocession of the district of columbia to virginia and maryland the house elected to postpone consideration of the resolution until ja nuary 7 1805 during three days from january 7 to 10 the house debated the merits of retroceding the district of columbia to virginia and maryland excluding the city of washington during the debate concerns about the disenfra nchisement of district re sidents and the democratic principle of taxation without represen tation clashed with efforts to create an independent and freestanding fe deral territory as the seat of the national government the house again rejected resolution allowing for the retroceding of maryland and virginia lands virginia retrocession in 1840 and 1841 the citizens of alexandria sought congressional action that would retrocede the area to virginia five years later on july 9 1846 the district territory that lay west of the potomac river was retroceded to virginia by an act of congress the retroceded area repres ented about twofifths of the area originally designated as the district largely because virginia agreed to the retrocession there was immediate constitutional challenge to the change du ring the debate on retrocession issues of the constitutionality of the vi rginia retrocession act were raised opponents argued that the retrocession required the approva l of constitutional amendment in 1869

gain control of the retroceded area if territory was again ceded by virginia and accepted by congress17 on february 5 1902 joint resolution introduced in the house and senate sres 50 again raised the question of the constitutionality of the retrocession of land to virginia and directed the attorney general of the united states to seek legal action to determine the constitutionality of the

legislative authority and control by congress over th national capital service area federal enclave in the district of columbia like their earlier counterparts hearings or votes were held on these bills retrocession as strategy for achieving voting representation in congress for district residents arguably should addre ss both political and constitutional issues and obstacles the process would require not only the approval of congress and the president but also the approval of the st ate of maryland and perhaps the voters of the retroceded area although the s upreme court reviewed the question of retrocession in phillips v payne22 in 1875 it did not rule on its constitutionality semiretrocession district residents voting in maryland short of retroceding all or portion of the district to maryland second option would allow district residents to be treated as citizens of maryland for the purpose of voting in federal elections such an arrangement would allo w district residents to vote as residents of maryland in electi ons for the house of representatives and to have their vote counted in the electi on of the two senators from maryland this semiretrocession

rights restoration act of 1990 the bill would have given district residents the right to cast ballots in congressional elections as if they were residents of maryland it so would have maintained the

by delegate walter fauntroy of the district of columbia23 district officials and some members of the house most notably representatives constance morella and steny hoyer who represented the two maryland congressional districts adjacent to the district of columbia opposed the bill opponents of hr 4193 argued that it was not practical means of addressing the districts lack of voting representati on in congress and that it could further cloud the districts status both bills were re ferred to the house district of columbia committee but received further action in defending the proposal representative parris noted his opposition to statehood for the district and offered this explanation of his proposal in letter published in the washington post on march 18 1990 this approach would allow the government of the district to remain autonomous from the maryland state government dc residents would continue to vote for mayor and city council and would not participate in maryland elections for state positions such as delegate state senator and governor the reason for this is the constitutional mandate that the na tions capital remain under the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of congress there is an important distinction be tween this action and the voting rights constitutional amendment proposed in 1978 that action rejected by the states called for the election of members of c ongress from the district it did not as my proposal does elect those members as part of the maryland delegation there is also distinction between this and proposals simply to turn the district over to maryland retrocession with my proposal there is need to delineate the federal enclave and there would not be requirement to obtain the approval of the maryland legislature i

constitutional amendmen t retrocession semi retrocession and statehood the bills w ould have provided di strict citizens with voting rights in congress by designating the district as state virtual statehood or by designating the district as congressional district virtual statehood much of the latest thinking on securing voting rights for citizens of the district centers on the premise that congress has the power to define the district as st ate for the purpose of granting voting representation proponents of virtual statehood note that the district is routinely id entified as state for the purpose of intergovernmental grant transfers that congresss authority to define the district as stat under other provisions of the constitution has withstood court challenges27 and that congress has passed legislation allowing citizens of the united states residing outside the c ountry to vote in congressional ections in their last state of residence28 they also note that the constitution

1875any of the options outlined in this report must be able to withstand political and constitutional challenges some such as constitutional amendment or retrocession are more problematic than others others such as statehood which can be achieved by statute may trigger other constitutional issues all must overcome what some observers consider conflictin g provisions of the constitution namely art 1 sec 2 of the constitution which states that the house of representative shall be composed of members chosen every two years by the people of the several states and art 1 sec 8 clause 17 which conveys ex clusive legislative authority in all cases whatsoever over the affairs of the district of columbia it can be argued that given the districts unique status as the seat of the national government and strict reading of the constitution the only failsafe avenues that exist to provide district residents voting rights in the national legislature are constitutional amendment or statehood which could be ach ieved by statute the former constitutional amendment offers degree of finality and permanence in settling the question of district voting representation in the national legislature but the process of winning approval of such an amendment is by means easy to be successful proponents of c onstitutional amendment in support of district voting rights must win the support of twothirds majority in both hous of congress the amendment must then be ratified by threefourths of the states 38 states in state convention or by vote of the state legislatures or twothirds of the state legislat ures may call for constitutional convention for the consideration of one or more amendments to the constitution if approved the am endments must be ratified by threefourths of the states 38 stat in state convention or by vote of the state legislatures the amendment process could take year s and prove unsuccessful as was the case with the dc voting rights ame ndment of 1978 which was ratified by 16 states but expired in 1985 without winning the support of the requisite 38 states retrocession the ceding of part of the district back to maryland has not been fully tested in the courts retrocession as strategy for achieving voting representation in congress for district residents arguably should address both political and constitutional issues and obstacles given the virginia experience the process would require not onl the approval of congress nd the president but also the approval of the state of maryland and perhaps the voters of the retroceded area although the supreme court reviewed the question of retrocession in phillips v payne36 in 1876 it did not rule on its cons titutionality moreove r retrocession would require some portion of the district to

ordering maryland state officials the governor and the secretary of state to declare the primary and any future elections voided because district residents did not vote the court held that district
