economy as well as the breakup of the soviet empi re and birth of fragile new democracies vulnerable to criminal exploitation russian criminal groups have become increasingly active in europe and north america sometimes working with foreign crime groups they have engaged in mone laundering and trafficking in arms illegal goods and people growing share of organized crime in the united states has foreign roots including russian ones besides its direct costs to the united states russian crime threatens larger us interests first among these is the successful democratic and market transformation of russia and ea stern europe crime and corruption have undermined public support for democracy nd the market economy and played role in the current russian political and ec onomic crisis russian criminals may be fueling regional tensions nd strengthening rogue re gimes with arms and other sanction breaking trade there is concer n that they could seriously endanger international nonprolifera tion efforts if they ge t access to weapons of mass destruction for sale abroad governments and internati onal bodies are struggling to keep pace with what is now recognized as global security threat the state department and fbi have been given the lead us role abroad in the fight against international crime the united states now has permanent crime fightin g presence in some 34 countries including russia for purposes of investigation trai ning and other coop eration the united states has worked closely with russia and international organizations to curb russian international criminal activities in may 1998 the president announced new internationa l crime control strategy experts agree that further steps may be needed to fight transnational crime including better intelligence and law forcement cooperation some experts advocate more crime fighting assistance and training to russia multinational task forces to fight crime across borders nd more offensive and even preemptive approach to fighting transn ational crime effective coope ration is hampered by the fact that most countries and jurisdicti ons are still reluctant to cede authority to outside or multinational organizations the us congress has demonstrated cern over trends in russian and other international crime nd supported assistance to russia the former soviet union and eastern europe in

organized crimes role and us interests scope of the problem transnational crime has grown in recent years as threat to international security russian criminal organizations have emerged as significant and dangerous actors in the equation several developments have contributed to the rising international crime trends and threats the world is witnessing the emerge nce of truly global economy built on unprecedented movement of people nd goods across national boundaries and revolution in informatio n and communications technology transnational criminal organizations have been major beneficiaries of globalization criminal groups have lear ned to take advantage of the new porousness of borders and to cooperate with each other on an opportunistic basis in the process the lines have blurred among traditional crime organizations drug cartels and terrorist groups with the end of the cold war and fall of communism in russia and eastern europe the former rigid authoritarian government and police controls have been removed but they have not yet been replaced by an effective rule of law system in many of the new democracies given the weakness and uncertainty of governments the transition to market economies has been chaotic and vulne rable to criminal exploitation russian crime is just one piece of worldwide problem russian crime organizations are neither the biggest nor necessarily the most costly to international society to date the italian mafia latin american drug cartels and asian crime organizations have had subs tantially greater impact internationally and inside the united states furthermore russian organize d crime is just part of larger cis and east european crime problem this report is focused specifically on crime emanating from within the current borders of russia whether by ethnic russi ans or other groups recognizing that the picture is similar in other fo rmer soviet republics many observers would argue that russian organized crime deserves special ttention russian crime groups are rapidly expanding their international activities more than criminal elements of other countries russian criminal organizations could become serious threat to international stability and u s interests due to russias geopolitical weight and substantial military asse ts coupled with the unsettled conditions that exist within the country httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98907crs2 1us

part of this trend russian criminal organizations have made their harmful presence felt in the united states russian organized crime is of particular concern to the united states because of its possible impact in four areas russian crime and corruption are undermining and eroding public support for the democratic and market transformation of russia particularly because of its links to official co rruption and the still potent invisible networks of former communist bureaucrat s secret police and disgruntled military officers russias current financial and political turmoil may be seen in part as result of the crime and corruption as result the russian populace could opt for law and or der even if it meant return to more authoritarian rule and tight er central control of the economy2 crime and corruption from russia are being exported to neighboring countries and complicating the trans ition in other emerging democracies securing stable democracy throughout this region remains high priority for us policy russian criminal organizations w ith their possible access to large quantities of arms may be in position to fuel regional tensions and conflicts in hot spots such as the balkans and middle east by breaking embargoes smuggling weapons to comb atants rogue states as well as to terrorist and foreign criminal organizations weapons from russias large increas ingly vulnerable nuclear chemical and biological stockpiles which some fear are inadequately protected could be sold by corrupt officials and di sgruntled soldiers in concert with criminal organizations

of linkage tolerance or lack thereof to the state in the pres oviet period russia was plagued with small scale crime like most european countries russian criminal gangs were not linked to the state and government during the soviet period the police and authorities dealt hars hly with traditional criminals and did not tolera independent criminal or ganizations although crime was probably bigger problem than official statistics admitted however from the earliest days of the revolution the comm unist party leaders did enlist and use criminal groups and their tactics when it suited their purposes but those carrying out largescale illicit activities had to operate within the tolerated boundaries of the soviet system and with tacit approval of those in power3 after the collapse of the soviet ion and communism new opportunities for organized criminal activity were provided by the weakening of the state and its police institutions as well as the freewheeling and unregulated nature of the economic transition the new reformoriented russian leaders recognized the vulnerability of the economy to criminalization and sought to combat the rise in crime both domestically and in cooperati on with other countries this effort has had mixed results to date russia does not have centralized criminal umbrella organization such as the italian mafia instead organized criminal activity follows more decentralized and fragmented model where powerful gangs of varying sizes operate and have loose links with one another russian organized crime today includes 1 soviet era criminal gangs in many cases tolerated and used by the previous kgb and police in other cases toughene d by the previous dangers of operating in an authoritarian state these incl ude ethnic and regionallybased gangs 2 new groups made up of disenfranc hised and disgruntled former kgb police military and party officials who st their power and livelihood with the transition members of these groups have particular commitment to the success of russias transition they s till have contacts and leverage in russia and abroad through their previous netw orks the existence of these networks and clandestine patterns of

intertwined with those of legitimate businessmen at time when there was private capital in russia they gained wealth from hasty and sometimes rigged privatiz ation allowing stripping of ssets and resources at the onset of privatizati on sales and purchases were paper transactions apparently only the communist party the kgb government institutions and criminal gangs had assets they competed among themselves in scramble for export industries and resources corrupt officials and criminals were able to pour their assets into newly transformed enterprises nd big banks which they or their partners already controlled corrupt officials have been accused of funneling government tax revenues into special banks under criminal c ontrol these officials may also have given these banks favored treatment with export licen ses when necessary criminal groups have been able to bribe many officials from top leaders down to local officials and police on the beat with what to them amounted to huge payoffs given their meager salaries the russian government response russian leaders understand the severity of the crime probl em and want to bring it under control but they are also overwhelmed by it as they try to cope with range of critical problems with russias economy in severe crisis it may be even harder than before to muster the official atte ntion and resources needed to fight crime effectively president yeltsin has called crime and corruption the greatest threat to the future of russian democracy at the same time he and other russian officials are sensitive to overly alarmist foreign assessments of the problem believing it undermines public confidence hurts investment and is exaggerated the russian president and his govern ment hold ultimate responsibility for controlling crime the 1993 russian constitu tion gives disproportionately large share of power to the president leaving weak judicial and legislative branches thus far russian anticrime effo rts have had mixed results for the first nine months of 1997 russian statistics indicated nine percent drop in overall crime yeltsin praised the mvd for the success however this downward trend is not expected to continue in the immediate future former interior minister kulikov cautioned that crime was likely to go up again in 1998 due to lack of resources10 the 1997 decline may also not represent much of dent

intelligence review november 1997 p527the government has taken number of recent actions to combat crime in 1997 the interior ministry targeted 100 crimin groups and investigated over 1000 people in november 1997 the russian gove rnment announced program to improve coordination among law enforcement agenci in russia which had been purposely fragmented to break up the former police power of the kgb in december 1997 the russian government approved draft federal program to intensify the fight against crime for the years 19982000 the program wa s to put law enforcement activity on new legal footing and improve the organization of law enforcement agencies11 it still did not provide for centralized c oordinating mechanism key component of the program is to substantially increase f unding for law enforcement it is not clear that russia can come up with the money in its worsening financial situation critics of the governments response to crime have charged that rather than producing more effective judicial syst em and enhancing law and order many of yeltsins actions have made scape goats of and replaced individual officials they argue that many of the governments an ticorruption moves look suspiciously like political steps to redirect blame and remove potential rivals from power alexander lebed while in the central government was viewed by many in russia as the cleanest politician with the will to root out crime and corruption he pushed measures that many thought gave teeth to the governments anticrime and corruption efforts he was dismissed by president yeltsin many believe due to political rivalry rather than the alleged shortco mings of his performance some western reports have accused the russian government of turning blind eye to links between government agencies and criminal organizations as individual security and other agencies face desperat shortages of funding they have been encouraged by russian leaders to seek alte rnate funds this has been interpreted at least by some security officials as green light to work with the the mafias for profit12 the transnational role of russian organized crime russian criminal organizations have steadily expanded their activities abroad beginning with other countries of the fo rmer soviet union and eastern europe alone or in cooperation with local gang s russian crime groups have gained foothold in other countries of the former soviet union they were able to use old links and their familiarity w ith the terrain when soviet troops were withdrawn from eastern europe some russian soldiers deserted remained behind and became involved in crime this is not to blam crime in neighboring countries mainly on russians or to suggest that indigenous crime is not major problem there crime is serious homegrown problem in most of these countries exacerbated by conditions similar to those in russia however the impact of imported russian crime is significant and in some countries russian criminal

goods and resources that have strong illicit markets abroad including arms precursor materials needed for the manufacture of weapons of mass destruc tion and strategic minerals like italian chinese and other cr iminal organizations russian groups use their own national emigre communities abroad to hide and base operations thus they are active in former soviet countries with large russian minorities and other countries with significant russian emigre communities including the united states israel canada australia and germany ethnic communities are also the principal victims of russian crime and extortion in those countries according to russian mvd estimates russian criminal incidents abroad have grown 5 fold since 1991 within the comm onwealth of independent states cis crime

crime compared to many countries in which internati onal crime groups are active the united states has strong legislation relatively little offi cial corruption and the will to fight crime on the

portion of this money represents criminal profits for the most part untaxed as consequence of russian capital flight which is not likely to subside in view of the countrys financial crisis there is

european crime and corruption have the potential to distort and even derail the transition to democracy in russia and cause national disillusionment in the process already substantial minority of russians believe that russia is ruled by organized cr ime many more see criminals as reaping most of the benefits of capitalism while the rest of the population pays the price increasing numbe rs of russians believe that crime is one of the leading threats to russia forty pe rcent of russians polled at the end of 1997 felt personally threatened by crime and some thirtyfour percent by corrupt officials30 this sentiment has probably increased significantly with the collapse of the ruble and economic turmoil that hit russia in the summer of 1998 the costs to russia of organized crime are in the billions of dollars just in lost tax revenues sharply limiting what the government can do to help its citizens through the rough transition period on the ot her hand criminal organizations are

russia is likely to become criminal syndicalist state one which is governed by corrupt officials working with criminal s and unscrupulous businessmen the study concludes that in many respects russia has already reached this state31 while the russian government is not ru led by corruption in the view of most experts the impact of russian crime is definitely magnified by its strong links to official corruption not only do corrupt officials countenance crime but criminal organizations encourage and feed public corruption in many cases high level officials charged with fighting crime are working with the criminals the lines are not always clearly drawn between legitimate and unethical activity by officials number of observers have pointed out that russians do not yet have strong

officialdom and enterprises there are still few checks and balances to correct misdeeds in the young russian democracy the legislature and judiciary are very weak under the 1993 russian constitution32 crime is becoming central issue in the eyes of the general russian public sizeable proportion of russians saw law and order as the ma in issue in russia prior to the economic and political crisis that erupted in mid1998 they are likely to blame the president for the crime situati on since he holds most of the power in russia today coming elections may well favor those who are perceived as incorruptible and tough on cr ime several expert s have pointed to alexander lebed as potential beneficiary of such sentiment33 the broader implications of this sentiment are unclear the main concern

worsening financial crisis fueling regional tensions tensions and conflicts in europe the middle east and other parts of the world may provi opportunities for in ternational criminal exploitation criminal organizations have history of involvement in breaking embargoes smuggling arms petroleum nd other needed goods to warring parties and governments facing international sanctions russian criminals may have comparative advantage in the arms trade area with the help of corrupt officials and members of the military they are likely to have relatively easy access to large qua ntities of arms fuel and other supplies they could use local criminal organizations as intermediaries to find buyers and make deliveries the concern about potential criminal invol vement in smuggling goods to warring parties in defiance of embargoes is especia lly strong in volatile places such as the former yugoslavia or along the russian pe riphery in the caucasus and central asia some analysts are concerned that russian criminals might become involved in selling weapons or components to rogue regimes such as iran libya iraq syria and north korea and even to terrorist groups russian officials downplay this problem and maintain that some of the transactions attributed to criminals in fact have been what they consider legitimate sales by the russian government and enterprises they accuse the united states as major exporter of arms and technology of hypocrisy holding other countries to different standard than our own potential access to weapons of mass destruction one of the greatest concerns is that russian criminal organizations could get their hands on and attempt to sell weapons of mass dest ruction threatening to undermine global efforts to curb the spread of nuclear chemical

intelligence review november 1997 p527the threat of nuclear weapons smuggling by criminal organizations is still more theoretical than real criminal organizations have shown little interest so far probably because of the physical dangers involved in the handling storage and transport of such materials and the diffi culty of finding genuine buyers as opposed to undercover police stings given the diffi culties and dangers i nvolved in arranging and carrying out nuclear weapons sale criminal groups may be inclined to find more lucrative and less risky activities in other areas to date there have been few incidents of trafficking in nuclear material and those have been rather amat eurish not showing the finger prints of more sophisticated criminal organizations nuclear materials apprehended have been either far below weaponsgrade or very sma ll in quantity most have been smuggled via europe though nuclear materials have also been apprehended in the ca ucasus with ultimate intended destination unknown th have posed at most low grade environmental hazard but even low grade nuclear materi als could pose serious public danger for instance in the hands of terrorists british intelligence reportedly has been investigating the possibility that the provisional ira may have tried to buy fissile materials from russia35 more immediate threat has been the involvement of criminal groups in the sale of dualuse goods nonfi ssile materials used both in building nuclear weapons and in civilian manufacturing markets are larger and easier to find still the potential danger exists that russian criminals could turn their attention to the smuggling of nuclear biological and chemical weapons as trafficking networks expand and potential payoffs gr ow russian criminal groups are more likely to be able to get access to nuclear materials especially with the collusion of military and government officials than cr iminal organizations of other countries both governments and terrorist groups aspi ring to nuclear biol ogical and chemical weapons status may be prepared to pay large sums for key components us and international response to the threat until recently the united states and other countries viewed international crime solely as law enforcement problem to be handled by nati onal and local police agencies now there is growing awareness that it is security and

experts is that countries still act individually continuedoptions for more effective response as the dimensions of the internati onal organized crime problem grow an understanding is emerging that the threat n eeds to be looked at and attacked in new ways despite recent us administrati on g7 and other initiatives number of critics argue that the inte rnational response has not kept pace with the spread of transnational crime suggested options for more effectively fighting transnational crime include better information sharing not only among intelligence and law enforcement organizations but also with the privat sector and nongovernment organizations especially human rights organizations expanded bilateral and multilateral cooperation and coordina tion expanded programs of w enforcement assistance for russia and eastern europe and designing more proactive and even preemptive approaches to fighting inte rnational organized crime specific options include 1 information sharing in order to gain better intelligence and predictive capacity governments and international organizations could significantly increase their information sharing some have also said that the us nd other governments need to work more closely with the private sector exchanging information and sharing intelligence in the fight against crime this involves helping businesses to better know what they are getting into and how to avoid becoming organized crime targets some have suggested that this may require creating unclassified public data bases on criminal organizations so that companies can verify with whom they are doing business the other side of the coin is that governments could more systematically seek information from the private sector on its exposure to and experiences with organized crime some have suggested that activities of criminal organizations should also be treated as human rights problem nd given publicity as such at present only governments are monitored in offi cial and nongovernment organization ngo human rights reports it is argu ed that criminal organizations should be publicly monitored and reported on too 2 law enforcement cooperation law enforcement cooperation could be ex panded within the us with russia and multilaterally to match the globalization of cr ime groups just as borders are coming down for criminals some experts believe they must come down for crime fighting53 where appropriate effort s could be made to bringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98907crs22 53continued rarely bilaterally and even more seldom multilaterally most of the cooperation that does occur is still limited to information exchanges on casebycase basis confirmation of the problem was provided by the then head of the russian security service nikolai kovalev at meeting of ci s security services heads on october 8 1997 he stressed that criminal groups of th cis states were integrating much more rapidly and effectively than the agencies tasked to combat them another good example of the problem is provided by the schengen convention of 1990 among eu countries this agreement opened the bor ders between eu member countries to people business and in the process to criminals but it did not open borders for national law enforcement agencies to act against criminals across borders 54the united states and italy have had significant success with these in fighting

against international crime and should be expande d in addition some expe rts assert that further assistance could also be provided to ag encies of the russian government and other institutions responsible for re gulating the private sector and its professional standards and business practices to strengthen the ability of legitimate russian business to stay clear of russian crime57 5 taking the offensive against international crime number of experts have suggested th at governments move from reactive to more offensive and even preemptiv approach to fighting transnationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98907crs23 58it is illustrative that when russian interior minister kulikov unveiled the governments new crime fighting program in the fall of 1997 he devoted as much time to reassuring his different agencies that they would not lose power as to explaining the elements of the program see moscow interfax october 28 1997 crime along the lines of recent initiatives in the fights against terrorism and drugs to an extent far greater than against terrorists governments can take better advantage of the inherent weaknesses and vulnerabilities of criminal organizations and attack them it is argued their networks are fragile vulnerable and penetrable coordinated internationa l responses could include freezing of criminal assets cross border arrests and denial of safe havens for criminals and their money the ability to sow discord and distrust is great if governments work together experts believe that criminal organizations can be penetrated fragmen ted and isolated pursuit of new options is hampered by tw sets of problems first all countries are reluctant to compromise sovereignty or cede jurisdiction this is true not only between countries but even among comp eting law enforcement agencies within countries58 second any suggestion of combin ing the efforts of law enforcement defense and intelligence agencies to help to stem crime raises fears and warning flags such moves have troublesome impli cations for democracy and civil liberties even in established democracies but especially in the transition states
