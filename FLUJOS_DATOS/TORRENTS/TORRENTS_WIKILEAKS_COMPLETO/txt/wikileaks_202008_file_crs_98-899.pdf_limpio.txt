united states shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors usconst art ii 4 charles black impeachment handbook 3940 1974 omitting qualifications and recognizing that the definition is only an approximation i think we can say that high crimes and misdemeanors in the constitutional sense ought to be held to be those offenses which are rather obviously wrong whether or not criminal and which so seriously threaten the order of political society as to make petulant and dangerous the continuance in power of their perpetrator the fact that such an act is so criminal helps even if it is not essential because general societal view of wrongness nd sometimes of seriousness is in such case publicly and authoritatively recorded the phrase high crimes and misdemeanor s carries anothe r connotationthat of distinctness of offense it seems that charge of hi gh crime or high misdemeanor ought to be charge of definite act or acts each of which in itself satisfies the above requirements general lowne ss and shabbiness ought not to be enough the people takehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98899crs2 some chances

office on impeachment for and c onvictions of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors was an english term of art that denoted political crimes against the state and the choice of this phrase was deliberate and considered action by in cluding that english phrase our founding fathers intended to expand the scope of impeachable offenses beyond the scope of criminally indictable offenses this language incorporates political offenses against the state that injure the structure of government and tarnish the integrity of the political office as alexander hamilton observed these political offenses include breaches of the public trust that president assumes once he has taken office hamilton made this point in the federalist describing imp eachable crimes as t hose offences which proceed from the misconduct of public men or in other words from the abuses or violations of some public trust they are of nature whic h may with peculiar propriety be denominated political as they relate chiefly to inju ries done immediately to the society itself barr high crimes and misdemeanors 2 t exas review of law and policy 1 910 1997 john labovitz the concept of an impeachable offens guts an impeachment case of the very factors repetition pattern c oherence that tend to blish the requisite degree of seriousness warranting the removal of president from office the most pertinent precedent in this nations history for framing case for the removal of chief executive may well be the earliest the declaration of independence in expressing reasons for throwing off the government of george iii the continental congress did not claim that there had been si ngle offense justifying revolution instead it pointed to course of c onduct it pursued invariably the same object and evinced common design it all had in direct object the establishment of absolute tyranny over these states it was this pattern of wrongdoing taken together not each specification considered alone that showed the unfitness of george iii to be the ruler of the american people the unfitness of president to tinue in office is to be judged in much the same way with reference to totality of his c onduct and the common patterns that emerge not in terms of whether this or that act of wrongdoing viewed in isolation is an impeachable offense l abovitz presidential impeachment 12931 1978 paul fenton it can therefore be concluded that impeachme nt is not political tool for arbitrary removal of officials that th standard for what constitute s an impeachable offense is not based on an inflexible historical precedent or on the judicial tenure clause that impeachment is not limited to crimes whether indictable or otherwise and that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98899crs3 sanction of impeachment does not extend to noncriminal misconduc t unless it involves violation of statutory law th conduct of the respondents fficial duties or an abuse of his official position within these limitations it is extremely difficult to define the proper standard for an impeachable offense in affirmative terms the only generalization which can safely be made is that an impeachable offense must be serious in nature while there are clear rules as to what constitutes serious offense there are number of factors which are relevant thus an offense is more serious if it is criminal violation or if it involves moral turp itude in the words of one court it may be safely asserted that where the act of official delinquency consists in the violation of some provision of the constitution or statute which is denounced as crime or misdemeanor or where it is mere ne glect of duty willfully done with corrupt intention or where the negligence is so gross and disregard of duty so flagrant as to warrant the inference that it was willful and corrupt it is within the definition of misdemeanor in office but where it consists of mere error of judgment or omission of duty without the element of fraud and wher the negligence is attributable to misconception of duty rather than willful disregard thereof it is not impeachable although it may be highly prejudicial to the interests of the state fenton the scope of the impeachment power 65 n orthwestern university law review 719 7457 1970 laurence tribe despite thencongressman gerald fo rds wellknown assertion that an impeachable offence is whatever majority of the house of representatives considers it to be there is now wide agreement that the phrase high crimes and misdemeanor was intended by the framers to connote relativ ely limited category closely analogous to the great offences impeachable in common law gland in addition to treason and bribery the great offences included misapplication of funds abuse of official power neglect of duty encroachment on or contempt of legislative prerogatives and corruption there have been only two serious attempts to impeach american presidents in both instances the offenses charged reflected the impact of the common law tradition discussed here offenses have been regarded as impeachable if and only if they involve serious abuse of official power t ribe american constitutional law 217 1978 theodore dwight i have dwelt the longer on this point because many seem to think that public officer can be impeached for mere act of i ndecorum on the contrary he must have committed true crime not against the law of england but against the law of the united states as impeachment is nothing but m ode of trial the constitution only adopts it as mode of procedure leaving the crimes to which it is to be applied to be settled by the general rules of criminal law as there are under the laws of the united states common law crimes but only those which are contrary to some positive statutory rule there can be impeachment except for violation of law of congress or for the commission of crimehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98899crs4 named in

attempts have been made to define this power quite commonly by those who were trying to make the definition fit the facts to particular case rather than to have it accord with the constitutional provisions only notable exception to this however is what was said by manager afterwards pr esident buchanan in the peck impeachment what is misbehavior in office in answ er to this question and without pretending to furnish definition i freely admit that we are bound to prove that the respondent has violated the constitution or some known law of the land this i think is the principle fairly to be deduced from all the arguments on the trial of judge chase and from the votes of the senate on the articles of impeachment against him in opposition to the principle for which his counsel in the first instance st renuously contended that in order to render an offence impeachable it must be indictable but this violation of law may consist in the abuse as well as in the usurpation of aut hority the abuse of power which has been given may be criminal as the usurpation of power that has not been granted perhaps that statement should be broadene d to include offences of so weighty character and so injurious to the office that every official is bound to know that they are of the same general character as crimes and might well be made criminal by statute but the terra incognita beyond one can properly be as ked to explore under the existing constitutional provisions if for other reas on than because it is fixed and salutary principle that penal provisions shall be so construed that th persons to be affected by them may certainly know what things they are forbidden to do simpson federal impeachments 64 u niversity of pennsylvania law review 651 881 1916 michael gerhardt attempts to limit the scope of impeachable offenses have rarely proposed limiting impeachable offenses only to indictable offe nses rather the major disagreement among commentators has been over the range of noni ndictable offenses for which someone may be impeached the problem is how to identify t hose nonindictable offenses for which certain highlevel government officials may be impeached given that certain federal officials may be impeached and removed for committing rious abuses agains t the state and that these abuses are not confined to indictable offenses the challenge is to find contemporary analogues to the abuses against the state that authorities such as hamilton and justices wilson and story viewed as suitable grounds for impeachment on the one hand these abuses may be reflected in certain statutory crimes violations of federal criminal statues such as the bribery statute represent abuses against the state sufficient to subject the perpetrator to impeachment and removal because bribery demonstrates serious lack of judgment and respect for the law and because bribery lowers respect for the office in other words there are certain statutory crimes that if committed by public officials reflect such lapses of judgment such disregard for the welfare of the state and such lackhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98899crs5 of respect for the law and the office held that the occupant may be impeached and removed for lacking the minimum level of integrity and judgment sufficient to discharge the responsibilities of the office on the ot her hand congress needs to be prepared as thencongressman ford pointed out to ex plain what nonindictab offenses may be impeachable offenses by defining contemporary political crimes the boundaries of congressional power to define such political crimes defy sp ecification because they rest both on the circumstances underlying particul ar offense including the actor the forum and the political crime and on the collective political judgement of congress gerhardt the constitutional limits of impeachment 68 t exas law review 1 83 1989 ronald rotunda moreover leaving asid historical precedent to limit impeachment to the commission of crimes is bad policy such limitation is both too broad and too narrow it is too broad because some crimes have functional relation to the problem of malfeasance or abuse of office for example if an official in the executive branch judge or legislator had been arrested once for driving while intoxicated that crime should not merit the drastic re medy of removal from office the proposed limitation is also too narrow for the civil officer might engage in many activities which amount to abuse of ffice and yet not commit any crimes for example if the president abused his pa rdon power by unconstitu tionally pardoning judge who had been impeached or summoned the senators from only few states to ratify treaty the president may have violated criminal law but he or she has abused the office rotunda an essay on the constitutional parameters of federal impeachment 76 k entucky law journal 707 72526 1988
