6106c22 shspec18 running cchs the way the cchs are run is 1 2 3 4 over and over and over it is breach of the auditors code clause 13 to run process beyond the point where it is producing change or to stop running one which is producing change the words in the process have very little to do with the process theyre run with meat and motion they are all done by compulsion if necessary the pc never has an opportunity not to execute the command the consequences of letting pc out of doing the command are grave the cchs run out surgery shock etc as the pc dramatizes you should run the process flat which means the pc has the same aspect for twenty minutes matter what the aspect is and matter how nutty or unconscious as long as the pc is doing the command change means such things as somatics etc it may be necessary to run cchs for few hours before they bite you dont pay attention to what the pc says its what he does though if he communicates to you that something is happening thats change running cchs permissively will also screw up the pc you must apply control to get communication and communication to get control irresponsibility denies havingness so sec checks also raise havingness all ow running since it raises responsibility results in havingness prehav really means prevent havingness scale it consists of those things that prevent havingness this is gotten off in routine 2 see p 34 or hcob 5jun61 the fixed reactive buttons that prevent the pc from having things are gotten out of the road on routine 3 the pc gets out of the road all those unrealized goals each of which has been defeat hence denial of havingness so havingness is the end product of all this ow raises havingness because the individual individuates from things because he cant have them so he develops overts only on those things he cant have so when you get the overts off he can have if you could have the whole universe it gives you trouble its only the things you cant have that you have trouble with next time you have ptp see whats in it and what prevents you from having them individuation from the thing the dynamic the universe is what brings trouble because you get into an obsessive games condition which adds up to you cant have it and it cant have anything to do with you the cchs knock out individuation from the physical beingness which has been caused from the pc to his body and apparently his body to him thats why they run out electric shocks etc and you have to let him take more responsibility or he wont improve his havingness you have to maintain control or youll show him the body cant be controlled so it can continue to overwhelm the pc also the pc will become practically unauditable misguided kindness is all that could let you allow the pc to control the session its actually vicious thing to do even if the pc is right in his advice dont follow it hell gain more from being run wrong but under your control than right under his own if youre going to err err on the side of control and toughness not sweetness and light its better to end the process wrongly on the auditors determinism than to end it rightly on the pcs if you let the pc take control youre very liable to get an arc break half hour later you may not notice that its because you lost control because of the lag but the way to handle it is to spot the point where you lost control and reassert it if the auditor is in control of the session auditing takes place if the auditor is not in control of the session reactivity takes place if you flinch from auditing its from those times when you didnt control the session and came under attack as result
