including timetable for congressional action on budget legislation see table 1 the process is centered around the adoption of an annual concurrent resolution on the budget the budget resolution sets forth aggregate spending and revenue levels and spending levels by major functional area for at least five fiscal years because the budget resolution is concurrent resolution it is not presented to the president for his signature and thus does not become law instead it is an agreement between the house and senate on congressional budget plan providing framework for subsequent legislative action

resolution one or more reconciliation bills see table 2 congress enforces budget resolution policies through points of order on the floor of each chamber and the reconciliation process for example any legislation that would cause the aggregate levels to be violated is prohibited from being considered further the total budget authority and outlays set forth in the budget resolution are allocated among the house and senate committees having jurisdiction over specific spending legislation any legislation or amendment that would cause these committee allocations to be exceeded is prohibited finally the house and senate appropriations committees subdivide their allocations among their respective 13 subcommittees point of order may be raised against any appropriations act or amendment that would cause one of these subdivisions to be exceeded7 the budget resolution also contains spending levels by functional categories eg national defense but these are not enforceable congress also may use reconciliation legislation discussed further below to enforce the direct spending revenue and debtlimit provisions of budget resolution in addition the senate is constrained by discretionary spending limits and payasyougo paygo requirement which are enforced through points of order while legislation is being considered on the senate floor explained further below the house does not provide for similar points of order for fy1991 through fy2002 congress and the president also were constrained by statutory limits on discretionary spending and paygo requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation8 unlike the enforcement procedures associated with the budget resolution which are employed while legislation is considered on the floor of each chamber the discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement were enforced by sequestration process generally after legislative action for session of congress ended these budget enforcement mechanisms however expired at the end of fy2002 ie september 30 2002 7 for more detailed information on these points of order and their application see crs report 97865 points of order in the congressional budget process by james v saturno 8 these constraints were first established by the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 title xiii of pl 101508 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 104 stat 1388 5731388630 which amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 99 stat 10381101 crs5 during 2004 president bush among others proposed setting new discretionary spending limits and restoring modified version of the paygo requirement9 for this reason the last section of this report provides an overview of how those procedures operated before they expired in 2002 9 in his fy2005 budget

budget resolution second the legislative language recommended by these committees is packaged without any substantive revision into one or more reconciliation bills as set forth in the budget resolution by the house and senate budget committees in some instances committee may be required to report its legislative recommendations directly to its chamber once reconciliation legislation is reported it is considered under special procedures these special rules serve to limit what may be included in reconciliation legislation to prohibit certain amendments and to encourage its completion in timely fashion in the house as with the budget resolution reconciliation legislation usually is considered under special rule establishing the time allotted for debate and what amendments will be in order in the senate debate on budget reconciliation bill and on all amendments debatable motions and appeals is limited to not more than 20 hours after the 20 hours of debate has been reached consideration of amendments motions and appeals may continue but without debate in both chambers the cba requires that amendments to reconciliation legislation be deficit neutral and germane also the cba prohibits the consideration 27 for the consideration of hres 685 see congressional record daily edition vol 150 june 24 2004 pp h4908h4922 28 the section also repealed the fy2005 discretionary spending limit contained in the fy2004 budget resolution section 504 of hconres 95 crs13 of reconciliation legislation or any amendment to reconciliation bill recommending changes to the social security program finally in the senate section 313 of the cba commonly referred to as the byrd rule prohibits extraneous matter in reconciliation bill29 both the senate and house versions of the fy2005 budget resolution provided for reconciliation legislation covering the period fy2005fy2009 the senate passed version agreed to on march 12 2004 provided for two reconciliation measures one to cut taxes by about 826 billion and the other to increase the statutory debt limit by 644 billion the housepassed version agreed to on march 25 also provided for two reconciliation measures one to cut taxes by about 1379 billion and the other to cut mandatory spending by about 132 billion the conference report to the fy2005 budget resolution sconres 95 hrept 108498 which was filed on may 19

september 10 2004 legislation to increase the statutory debt limit by 689946 billion as noted above however while the house agreed to the conference report to the fy2005 budget resolution on may 19 the senate did not act on it reconciliation legislation can be triggered only by the adoption of the conference report by both chambers therefore reconciliation legislation was considered in 2004

debtlimit legislation is under the jurisdiction of the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee article i section 7 of the us constitution requires that revenue legislation

corporate income taxes social insurance taxes excise taxes or tariffs and duties figure 1 actual fy2003 revenues by source revenue legislation is not considered automatically in the congressional budget process on an annual basis frequently however the president proposes and congress considers changes in the rates of taxation or the distribution of the tax burden an initial step in the congressional budget process is the publication of revenue estimates of the presidents budget by cbo on march 8 cbo released its report an analysis of the presidents budgetary proposals for fiscal year 2005 which contains estimates of the presidents proposals using cbos economic and technical assumptions and provides an analysis of the potential macroeconomic effects of the presidents budgetary

change in the inflation rate cost estimates of any congressional revenue proposals are prepared by cbo based on revenue estimates made by the joint committee on taxation jct and are published in committee reports or in the congressional record as well as available on jcts website33 the budget resolution includes baseline estimates of federal government revenues based on the continuation of existing laws and any proposed policy changes the revenue levels in the budget resolution provide the framework for any action on revenue measures during the session point of order may be raised against the consideration of legislation that causes revenues to fall below the agreed upon levels for the first fiscal year or the total for all fiscal years in the budget resolution this point of

debtlimit legislation the amount of money the federal government is allowed to borrow generally is subject to statutory limit 31 usc 3101 from time to time congress adopts legislation to raise this limit44 federal debt consists of debt held by the public plus debt held by government accounts the debt held by the public represents the total net amount borrowed from the public to cover all or most of the federal governments budget deficits by contrast the debt held by government accounts represents the total net amount of federal debt issued to specialized federal accounts primarily trust funds eg social security trust fund surpluses by law must be invested in special nonnegotiable federal government securities and thus are held in the form of federal debt the combination of both types of debt is subject to the statutory public debt limit therefore budget deficits or trust fund surpluses may contribute to the federal government reaching the existing debt limit the annual congressional budget resolution specifies the appropriate level of the public debt for each fiscal year covered by the resolution although the budget resolution does not become law itself the specified debt limits serve as guide for any necessary debtlimit legislation congress may develop debtlimit legislation in any of three ways 1 under regular legislative procedures 2 under house rule xxvii or 3 as part of reconciliation legislation as described above the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee have jurisdiction over debtlimit legislation 42 in the house the conference report was

for increases by philip d winters crs18 house rule xxvii commonly referred to as the gephardt rule after its author representative richard gephardt provides that joint resolution specifying the amount of the debt limit contained in the budget resolution automatically is engrossed and deemed to have passed the house by the same vote as the conference report on the budget resolution thereby avoiding separate vote on the debtlimit legislation the senate has comparable automatic engrossment procedure if it chooses to consider housepassed joint resolution it does so under the regular legislative process prior to 2004 the last increase in the public debt limit originated under the gephardt rule and subsequently was enacted as an independent measure hjres 51 pl 10824 in may 2003 in february 2004 the administration indicated that it expected the debt subject to the limit would reach the statutory ceiling before the end of fy2004 ie september 30 200445 on october 14 2004 treasury secretary john w snow informed congress that the treasury effectively had reached the debt ceiling stating given current projections it is imperative that the congress take action to increase the debtlimit by midnovember at which time all of our previously used prudent and legal actions to avoid breaching the statutory debt limit will be exhausted46 even though the house agreed to the conference report to the fy2005 budget resolution legislation increasing the debt limit was engrossed automatically pursuant to the gephardt rule because the senate did not agree to the conference report consequently on november 17 2004 the senate considered and adopted s 2986 increasing the statutory public debt limit by 800 billion to 8184 trillion by 5244 vote47 the following day the house considered and adopted s

discretionary spending is under the jurisdiction of the house and senate appropriations committees soon after the budget resolution is adopted by congress the house and senate appropriations committees subdivide their spending allocations among their subcommittees and formally report these suballocations to their respective chambers these suballocations referred to as 302b allocations after the applicable section of the congressional budget act represent the spending ceilings on the individual regular appropriations acts during the appropriations process these suballocations usually are revised several times until they were repealed upon the enactment of the defense appropriations act 2005 see section 14007 of pl 108287 discretionary spending limits for fy2004 and fy2005 also could have been enforced in the senate by point of order50 congress passes three main types of appropriations measures regular appropriations acts provide budget authority for the next fiscal year beginning on october 1 each of the 13 subcommittees of the appropriations committees of the house and senate is responsible for one of the 13 regular appropriations acts supplemental appropriations acts provide additional funding for unexpected needs while the fiscal year is in progress continuing appropriations acts commonly referred to as continuing resolutions provide stopgap funding for agencies that have not received regular appropriations by the start of the fiscal year the presidents budget includes recommendations for the agencies programs and activities funded in the annual appropriations measures account and program level detail about these recommendations is included in the appendix volume of the presidents budget documents in addition agencies submit justification materials to the house and senate appropriations committees the budget justifications provide more detailed information about an agencys program activities than is contained in the presidents budget documents and are used in support of agency testimony during appropriations subcommittee hearings on the presidents budget request the house and senate appropriations subcommittees begin holding extensive hearings on appropriations requests shortly after the presidents budget is submitted by custom appropriations measures originate in the house in recent years the senate appropriations committee has adopted and reported original senate appropriations measures allowing the senate to consider appropriations measures without having to wait for the house to adopt its version under this practice the senate version is considered and amended on the floor and then inserted into the houseadopted version when available as substitute amendment thereby retaining the housenumbered bill for final action 50 section 504 of the fy2004 budget resolution hconres 95 108th congress created discretionary spending limits for each fiscal year covering fy2003 through fy2005 these discretionary spending limits could have been adjusted for transportation spending under section 411 of the budget resolution and for spending designated as an emergency requirement under section 502 of the budget resolution see us congress committee on conference concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004 conference report to accompany hconres 95 108th cong 1st sess hrept 10871 washington gpo 2003 p 122 crs21 in addition to the 13 regular appropriations acts congress typically acts on at least one supplemental appropriations measure during session congress also often adopts one or more continuing resolutions each year because of recurring delays in the appropriations process for example congress passed five continuing resolutions before completing action on the fy2004 regular appropriations acts appropriations for fy2004 at the beginning of 2004 only six of the 13 fy2004 regular appropriations acts had been enacted for agencies and programs contained in the remaining seven regular appropriations acts continuing resolution hjres 79 pl 108135 had been enacted to provide temporary appropriations through january 31 2004 to prevent any funding gap four

conference report to the budget resolution sconres 95 hrept 108498 to have been agreed to by congress consequently the spending allocations 302as for the house appropriations committee are 8219

point of order under section 505 of the fy2004 budget resolution hconres 95 108th congress may be raised against any mandatory spending legislation not assumed in the most recently adopted budget resolution that would increase or cause an onbudget deficit for the first fiscal year the period of the first five fiscal years or the following five fiscal years covered by the most recently adopted budget resolution61 motion to waive the point of order requires threefifths vote ie 60 senators if there are vacancies on several occasions in the past congress has included reserve funds in the

allocations and other budget resolution levels if certain legislation is reported by the appropriate committee without such an adjustment mandatory spending legislation might be subject to points of order if it were not assumed in the budget resolution spending amounts one major mandatory spending bill considered during 2004 was the sixyear renewal of the highway and transit program62 on february

legislation in the 2nd session 108th congress by john continued crs25 legislation s 1072 to authorize funds for federal aid for highways highway safety programs and transit programs during consideration of the legislation the senate agreed to waive point of order under section 302f of the cba against senator james inhofes amendment in the nature of substitute samdt 2285 by vote of 7224 the point of order was raised because the legislation exceeded the spending amounts for transportation programs provided in the fy2004 budget resolution hconres 9563 the house passed its version of the highway and transit program reauthorization legislation hr 3550 on april 2 2004 prior to the consideration of the legislation house budget committee chairman jim nussle adjusted the house transportation and infrastructure committees spending allocation pursuant to the contingency procedure for this purpose set forth in the fy2004 budget resolution section 411 of hconres 9564 with the adjustment the legislation as considered by the house complied with the spending amounts for the surface transportation reauthorization legislation provided in the fy2004 budget resolution and therefore was not subject to points of order under the congressional budget act conference committee was convened to resolve the differences between the house and senate versions of the legislation hr 3550 however the conferees were unable to resolve those difference before congress adjourned sine die in anticipation of that possibility congress adopted and president bush signed legislation hr 5183

congressional record daily edition vol 150 apr 1 2004 p h2040 crs26 direct spending and revenue legislation65 initially applicable through fy1995 they were modified and extended in 1993 to apply through fy1997 and extended again in 1997 to apply through fy2002 in each case the budgetary controls were designed to enforce fiveyear budget agreements between congress and the president without any legislative action by congress and the president to extend the budget enforcement mechanisms further they expired at the end of fy2002 ie september 30 2002 during 2004 president bush among others proposed setting new discretionary spending limits and restoring modified version of the paygo requirement66 for this reason an overview of how those procedures operated before they expired in 2002 is provided below since 1990 the statutory limits had applied to different categories of discretionary spending during some periods discretionary spending was combined into single category at other times it was divided into two or more broad categories such as defense and nondefense spending currently adjustable discretionary spending limits still exist for highway and mass transit spending for fy2003 and conservation spending divided into six subcategories through fy2006 but the sequestration process to enforce them expired on september 30 2002 under the paygo requirement the net effect of new direct spending and revenue legislation enacted for fiscal year could not cause positive balance on multiyear paygo scorecard ie cause an increase in the onbudget deficit or reduction in the onbudget surplus for each fiscal year this scorecard maintained the balances of the accumulated budgetary effects of laws enacted during the current session and prior years the paygo requirement applied to legislation enacted through fy2002 but it covered the effects of such legislation through fy2006 the paygo requirement effectively was terminated at the end of fy2002 as well as discussed below the discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement were enforced primarily by sequestration which involved automatic largely acrosstheboard spending cuts in nonexempt programs sequestration was triggered if the omb director estimated in the final sequestration report at the end of session that one or more of the discretionary spending limits would be exceeded or the paygo 65 the discretionary spending limits and the paygo requirement were first established by the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 title xiii of pl 101508 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 104 stat 13885731388630 which amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 99 stat 1038 1101 the limits were extended in 1993 title xiv of pl 10366 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 107 stat 683685 and in 1997 budget enforcement act of 1997 title x of pl 10533 balanced budget act of 1997 111 stat 677712 66 as noted above on mar 19 2004 the house budget

to exceed the statutory limit for particular category as mentioned above the senate still enforces discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement similar to the expired statutory one through

and cbo were required to publish preview and update sequestration reports to provide congress and the president with advance notice regarding the possibility of sequester if one or both types of sequester ie discretionary spending limit sequester or paygo sequester were anticipated these reports could have afforded congress and the president enough warning to enact legislation to avert
