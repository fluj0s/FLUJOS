deterioration from 1989 to 1993 there has been some imp rovement since 1994 as cuba has implemented limited reforms since the early 1960s us policy towa rd cuba has consisted largely of isolating the island nation through comprehensive economic sanctions the bush administration has essentially continued this policy the principal tool of policy remains comprehensive sanc tions which were made st

of support measures for the cuban people including private humanitarian donations and ussponsored radio and televi sion broadcasting to cuba in may 2002 president bush announced new initiative that includes several measures designed to reach out to the cuban people there appears to be broad agreement on the overall objective of us policy toward cuba to help bring democracy and respect for human

power for years they point to cubas strong security apparatus and the extraordinary system of controls that prevents dissidents from gaining popular support mo reover observers maintain that cubas

administration reiterated its stance of maintaining the embargo as vital part of american foreign policy14 issues in uscuban relations overall direction of us policy over the years although us policymak ers have agreed on the overall objective of us policy toward cuba to help br ing democracy and respect for human rights to the island there have been several sc hools of thought about how to achieve that objective some advocate policy of keeping maximum pressure on the cuban government until reforms are enacted while continuing current us efforts to support the cuban people others argue for an approach sometimes referred to as constructive engagement that would lift some us sanctions that they believe are hurting the cuban people and move toward engaging cuba in dialogue still others call for swift normalization of uscuba n relations by lifting the us embargo in general those advocating loosenin g of the sanctionsbased policy toward cuba make several policy arguments they assert that if the united states moderated its policy toward cuba through increased travel trade and diplomatic dialogue that the seeds of reform would be planted in cuba which would stimulate and strengthen forces for peaceful change on the island they stress the importance to the united states of avoiding violent change in cuba with the prospect of mass exodus to the united states and the potential of involving the united states in civil war scenario they argue that since castros demise does not appear imminent the united states should pouse more realis tic approach in trying to induce change in cuba supporters of changing policy also point to broad international support for lifting the us embargo to the missed opportunities to us businesses because of the embargo and to the increased suffering of the cuban people because of the embargo proponents of change also argue that the united states should adhere to some consistency in its policies with the worlds few remaining communist governments and also maintain that moderating policy will help advance human rights in cuba on the other side opponents of changing us policy maintain that the current twotrack policy of isolating cuba but reaching out to the cuban people through measures of support is the best means fo r realizing political change in cuba they point out that the cuban liberty and demo cratic solidarity act of 1996 sets forth road map for what steps cuban needs to take in order for the united states tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30806crs13 normalize relations including lifting the embargo they argue that softening us policy at this time without concrete cuban reforms w ould boost the castro regime politically and economically enabling the survival of the communist regime opponents of softening us policy argue that the united states should stay the course in its commitment to democracy and human rights in cuba that sustained sanctions can work and that the sanctions against cuba have only come to full impact with the loss of large subsidies fro m the former soviet bloc opponents of loosening us sanctions further argue that cubas failed economic policies not the us embargo are the causes of
