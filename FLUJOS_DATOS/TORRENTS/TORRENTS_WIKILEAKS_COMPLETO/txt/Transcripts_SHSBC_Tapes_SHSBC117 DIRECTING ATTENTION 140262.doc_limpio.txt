directing attention lecture given on 14 february 1962 now what date do we have what date do you have audience fourteenth of february fourteenth of february valentines day will you be my valentine female voice yep i didnt hear any volunteers female voice yeah all right all right i didnt put the year on it ad 12 saint hill special briefing course we just had good example of distracting the pc out of session and collapsing the bank on the face did you notice that audience hmmm hmmm wasnt that an interesting example and do you notice that it dropped the havingness right out hm interesting isnt it the pcs attention flick bang of course the patchup is to get the arc break off fast if you cant get the arc break off run some havingness and get the arc break off got it if you cant easily release an arc break or easily get rudiment in its always safe to assume that havingness is out i dont know if you noticed that example just the flick of some paper and bang the pcs attention is out of session the gimmick you saw about illustration i should mention something about that itll probably be part of your flows you see your 3d criss cross how you get list and that sort of thing originally was designed before we had flows so itd be only special gimmick for flows but we could broaden it and say well you get the pc to define what youre going to get the list from so that the pc understands it and that way you wouldnt run into the trouble youve run into earlier on like and dislike lists so the pc you dont know whether the pc likes it or dislikes it or you know and the pc finally says well i dont dislike anything actually i hate everything you know and read right away you say well lets have hate list see but lets be sure that the pc understands what were going to list from as an additional step we would do prehav assessment or flows assessment or take an arbitrary item and in any event lets make sure that the pc understands thoroughly what we are listing from before we start to list okay another sign that is very interesting is if you have the right flow you will get some tone arm action and when you have ceased to get tone arm action on the list you dont have any more items if you leave the pc on the meter during listing if youre on the right track youve got some tone arm action itll be anywhere up to about the one tone arm division 30 to 40 25 to 35 or something like that itll be at least that youll have that area and the tone arm will wander around and as long as you have tone arm motion your list is incomplete i had to do some work on this just because we needed some additional indicators slight change leave the pc on while listing now if you leave the pc on while listing and leave the pc on while differentiation you will see the item itself discharge and you hit the hot item on list you may get discharge of two or three dial drops the item which you will eventually assess by the time you begin to null has already been discharged its quite interesting if the item is hot that you will get two or threedial drop itll just go zoooom zoooom zooom and you all of sudden the way youll probably notice it on differentiation is that your tone arm suddenly is way out your needle is hanging over here on the side of the meter you possibly wont see it go at all you see and you because you arent watching the meter very heavily and youll suddenly notice that after we read that item well have to move the tone arm down about division or two you decide that the one you just did must have been very very hot item indeed if you dont see the needle go you got the idea because nobody expects you to watch the needle you know like the cat to the mouse hole while youre doing listing and differentiation just keep it centered and try to keep your needle up to set keep very low sensitivity setting because it doesnt matter much see the lower the sensitivity setting the more your needle stays somewhere on the dial the less adjustment you have to make of the tone arm of course doing rudiments oh man that needle is just all over the place with rudiments all over the place get that thing set at sensitivity 16 you know and rrwow i dont care how corny you sound you notice that id rather you sound corny than and careless or something and be careful than to be imprecise dont ever neglect to say the rudiment twice see always be sure always be sure theres probably some characteristic in my auditing that youve been picking up because theres terrific amount of carefulness with regard to reads and that sort of thing if i dont get them the first time ill ask them the second time you never invite an arc break because youre interested in the pcs case of course and if you dont get them the second time youre still not sure why get it back there and of course at sensitivity 16 your needle is flying at such wild rate across the dial that it sometimes gets to the lefthand side of the meter you see before youve finished the question and youre left with the great embarrassment of having uttered your question and come to the end of it and your needle is sitting over there parked and unreadable dont worry about things like that happening dont strain at that sort of thing what i want you to strain at is being awful careful it looked like the thing did slight acceleration you know it looked like after right after you said there was slight acceleration but you couldnt quite tell you know it was so indefinable ask it again and see if there was something there then you look at it and the needle just is youre asking on fall or something like that work flying needle its perfectly all right but work it carefully one of the things is please as an auditor dont put looking good ever above being good auditor please you know you can make yourself look awful good sometimes you know pc is very happy because youve found an item and you havent found one dont tell him youve got an item unless youve got one you see dont give him any hope because there must be something wrong there must be something wrong there that needs patching up and your pc will just arc break on it thats all you say oh yes well were very happy i we got an item and so forth but be very careful and always put accuracy above looking good and if you fumble fumble for gods sakes i dont care how hard you fumble but just do good job do good thorough job on it dont try to look good because the only person who loses you see is the pc the pc really loses you can err in several ways in auditing all in the direction of reputation of looking good being kind that is the main thing there was lecture last summer about being kind which is as bitter as i think id care to state it you can kill people with kindness man you can kill them dead failure to direct the pcs attention letting pc run on and on and on being kind you know lets be careful that we dont have any arc break well ill tell you what causes an arc break its auditing thats what causes the arc break as long as youre interested as long as youre doing your job and as long as you keep clearing up the should have knowns youre not going to have any arc breaks with the pc but the way to have arc breaks with the pc is to be kind and then not do your job because you might upset the pc or something like that you havent seen this yet in my demonstrations but i have been known to tell pcs to shut up that is it oh you did see some you didnt see this because this was demonstration it wasnt on the air got fooled for second because i remember all the sets were on i turn all the sets on up there and get used to auditing under those circumstances its little bit rough because the meter is never in its not in the position i ordinarily use meter and so forth and im having to adjust myself to exactly that auditing circumstance and pc said you know this goes back to past life of and i know this has its foundation in past life and we were looking for withhold see in this lifetime and i said good you just leave that alone for the moment and well get around to that later come on now and so forth and the pc cheered right up and smiled pc knew when she was getting away with something and sure enough there was hot withhold right there bjoobjoobjoo we had it practically in the next twenty words but we were going to get all about this past life you know you look up sec checks and at the point where old sec check forms and at the point where the person just about connected but the auditor didnt make him connect it they immediately went into past life it is not dodge mechanism so much as of the fact that that withhold is connected but it is restimulating the past life so the closest thing available is the past life you dont want it all you want it to do is key it out and you look it over and its very very amusing you look it over and youll see the missed withhold the question which youre now hav going to have to clean up with the withhold system can be found on these old forms by just locating where the auditor noted down the pc dived into past life you take that question and you clean it for this life and youll have the hottest firecracker withhold you ever wanted to meet thats an interesting little trick of the trade now it is perfectly true that withholds in past lives are causing all the pcs real difficulties see so you dont want to invalidate this and come down on it with crash and say we dont care about past lives were not auditing past lives to hell with your past lives thatd be the wrong way to go about this you see the right way to go about it is to say to the pc all right that in its place and this in thar place and what im looking for right now is what you did to the cat now in this life well take the other up later in 3d criss cross but right now we want to know what you did to the cat in this life the cat named joe whatever it was all right now that is what were interested in now if you can keep the pc from diving you can control pcs attention if you can control pcs attention you can keep them from diving and if youre controlling pcs attention the pc is uhrrr crank crank hrrmmhrrmm and hes hes i dont want to look over there and the auditor says there it is there it is look and the pc says hhrn really its w and the auditor says mnnnnnnn and the pc says but thats much more attractive right now and the auditor says mmhm and the pc all of sudden blows 15 milli megatrons of charge on this thing see and the pc never forgives you if you let his attention go out of it its not kind its suicidal the pc never forgives you if you let him give up or let her give up i dont care what the pc says in the session i dont care what argument the pc advances it is read right at the bottom of your right hand column on the auditors report goals and gains and if you didnt direct the pcs attention youll see goals made gains every time youve got to get the pcs attention directed now if you let the pc wander into lot of overts this sounds like generalized lecture its not generalized lecture im telling you how to run pc on prepchecking how to handle the pcs attention in pulling overts and so forth whats expected of you you think that youre going to get an arc break you see if youre mean to the pc youve actually would believe this on first inspection that if youre mean to the pc youll get an arc break now listen it has nothing to do with being nice to or mean to the pc that does not have any monitor of the session that does not monitor the gains of the session or the attitude after the session of the pc toward you see that has nothing to do with it just discount niceness and kindness and being mean to the pc being kind to the pc your attitude toward the pc just pretty well cancel it out see you cant wipe it out entirely but you can whether youre mean or kind to the pc has nowhere near the bearing on the situation as whether or not youre effective with the pc you can have that pc screaming at high c in the middle of session apparently all arc broke chewing you out like mad and youre saying not oh well im sorry we got into it and you are saying all right now what withhold did i miss and the pc says well youre the lousiest auditor i ever had anything to do with you say come on now what withhold did i miss when and the pc says well thats something else you neednt be cross about it and so forth well you say well im not being cross about it i want to know what withhold did i miss oh well in the very beginning of the session of course you failed to find out that i have an engagement at 300 and its now 330 oh all right lets continue with the session and that pc will go out and hell just swear by you as an auditor oh man that thats my auditor you know terrific auditor oh terrific he wont let get away with thing hmhmhm but the auditor whos nice and doesnt direct the pcs attention and the pc goes out of the session and says natter natter natter natter natter natter natter natter natter natter natter natter well hes all right he tries youd be surprised you could be the most gentlemanly or ladylike auditor in the world you know and never have gain on the pc because that isnt what makes the gain its whether or not you control that pcs attention now youd just be amazed how far you would get now im not asking you to overwhelm the pc because you actually dont overwhelm the pc with mood what you overwhelm the pc with is evaluation and invalidation the fact of invalidation the fact of evaluation you say well i dont think thats the list i dont think that has anything to do with it that item doesnt belong on the list what your item is actually is spendthrift ive watched you for days and i know that and that overwhelms pc see and well you actually dont know what youre thinking about actually thats whats the trouble with the session if you just knew what you were thinking about you know invalidation of some kind or another thats what ruins pc mood doesnt ruin pc ive had pc fly out of an auditing chair and ive taken that pc and slammed that pc down into the auditing chair and say damn it sit there and get audited pc after the session wonderful session didnt even clean it up as an arc break see its very fascinating thats the one thing you should learn yeah be nice be your cheerful self and so forth but direct the pcs attention what im not im teaching you to be mean auditor im teaching you not to pay any attention to that factor if youre an effective auditor and you do what has to be done and you direct the pcs attention you will get further by directing it crudely and badly and misemotionally than by not directing it at all i assure you of this naturally after while you get to be an old smoothie you see that pc start out insession go somewhere or the other just go zing bang thud and you do the effective thing and so forth and there it is but even then now and then you will get caught out in storm you say where the hell did this come from you know and thats going to happen to you on withhold system prepchecking time and time again because every time the pc comes close to the key withhold the pc is apt to get cross with the auditor now thats the liability of prepchecking and this withhold system you start sailing down the line its an indicator its an indicator the pc right there at that crucial moment gets some kind of its the missed withhold mechanism but its little bit in reverse just little got little more curve on it and you say to the pc quite innocently you say well who didnt know about that who should have known about it anything youre saying for that third question you can you know you can say who didnt know about it just to salt the thing down you can say who did you make sure wouldnt find out about it that puts it in the future you see you can play it on the three tenses if you want to ill give you list of the permissibles you see down at that end you can ask any one of these the standard one is just should have known and failed to find out see but you can vary this song anything you want to in the same breath you know and youll just manage to pull it off but anyhow youll be sailing down along about the thing and youll be getting to the well is that all of it oh pitys sakes it certainly is all of it im matter of fact i am getting sick of it arent you man youre standing right on the threshold youre getting right there thats all that is doesnt mean arc break doesnt mean anything at all pc is going misemotional all right got the pc headed right down that alley and if you dont head the pc down that alley the pc will wind up saying youre the worst lousiest bummest auditor he ever heard of see well of course you didnt torture him to death by hes got to be made to face that withhold and thats your whole job now the pc is sitting there ill let tell you some of the primary and early withhold flubs the pc said well i dont think very much of joe joe joe will never never has anything much to do with and so forth and i really dont think very much of him matter of fact one day he dropped out of his car and so forth didnt even didnt even accompany to the door auditor what else did joe do to you well he was insulting often very insulting on and on see buy motivator buy motivator buy motivator and by the time that session ends your goals and gains my god the poor pc is just plowed into the ground what youve done is run up bunch of new overts and the session was used just to run up new overts so that is the broad classification of bad withholdpulling session its just permitting the pc to go on and run up brandnew overts on the thing in other words hes giving motivators hes making damaging statements or she is making damaging statements and that sort of thing hell run up at the other end you know well that was common common thing pulling other peoples withholds now thats the one you will face every time you try to train class ii auditor sooner or later as he starts into this thing you will find him sitting there pulling other peoples withholds off the pc because its so intriguing its so interesting its like reading scandal sheet you know and all so true and amongst those is running you down covertly you see by saying what they have heard about you what the pc has heard about you so thats other peoples withholds you see and the pc has heard from pete about how you so forth and thats withhold from you hehheh hehhehhehhehheh and thats withhold from you brother i just wouldnt spend three seconds worth of auditing time on it you know i just wouldnt spend any time on it at all because if you permit the auditor to go on and pull other peoples withholds including withholds he has heard about the auditor any brand of this you wind up with that righthand column right at the bottom goals none gains none every time its just wasted session you see its ineffective so that is one of the oldtime common errors and the other one theres another one on this now is the critical thought mechanism now that was too thoroughly banished because i will use critical thoughts hohoho in oldtimestyle sec checking you give string of critical thoughts and ill show you the prettiest array of overts you ever heard of its just an indicator so you say to somebody now have you had its trap you know its great big dirty trap that youve laid right in the middle of the boulevard and theyre going down this boulevard at 70 miles an hour and theyre going to go right on by and theyre not going to get any goals and gains by session end well theres one of the ways to stop this is to ask them leader such as have you ever had any critical thoughts about anyone and they merely tell you at once about all the critical thoughts they have had about angela and the only critical thought you listen to about angela is enough to let them groove get them grooved in on angela its something on the order of about id say fifteen to twenty seconds worth is adequate and you get let them get grooved in well on angela and then say calmly and coolly well what have you done to angela and youll find one every time youll find withhold every time youll find an overt that is being withheld from you now this is not trickery that were using particularly today but you should know that thats good little piece of stuff and it also should be known to you because in trying to train somebody on what is an overt and what is withhold theyre going to run into critical thoughts and theyre going to waste hours now listen i have seen five hours of auditing time pulling critical thoughts go up in smoke absolutely goal gain nothing gain at all just go up in smoke on pulling critical thoughts that in one minute five hours versus one minute see the auditor said what did you do to and here this critical thought channel just explodes at this point oh ive done nothing uhuuuuuuua horrors caught and they go right off the pavement into the trap oh there we are oh well we didnt even know there was anything there oh huhl they yeah well actually i didnt do anything to him didnt really do anything to him stole his car and wrecked it and never told him hahahahahahahahaha haha now with your present withhold system it would probably turn down that his wife was also in it at the time see i mean you this would unveil further you see itll go on and on and on and on and on with the withhold system but youre pulling on real overts now the reason that isnt as important today is youre every now and then going to get critical and weve already taken care of it in the mechanism of the withhold system so you know now that it will do good this is good indicator this is just piece of something you should know that it will do good to go on and pull all these critical thoughts but its perfectly all right to accept it for your number one what well youre pulling something or other halfrevealed withholds or something well i thought critical thought about the auditor and the auditor didnt pull it you say all right and you got what auditor it is and what about thinking critical thought about the auditor and not pulling it is your one question see now youre going to go to town with this because youre going to say when and then youre going to say is that all of it and of course that is the trap inside the trap on this highway because the well is that all of it of course im perfectly justified thinking critical thought of the auditor after all the auditor has done to and so forth well you should remember at this stage of the game that nobody has told you in the withhold system that you mustnt coax the pc to give all see you can do it by just sitting there and practically saying nothing to the pc but at what expenditure of time so all these little tricks fit into the system too you see you say well is that all of it did you do anything else to him see thats good one to slide in on the end of that thing did you do anything else to him hmmmmmm did you do anything else to him hm i mean you know the needle is falling off the pin with well wrecked his hehheh took his car without his permission and you say good all right you took his car without his per very good fine fine fine who didnt find out about it well he didnt find out about it of course hehhehhehheh all right very good and well why test it why test it youre going to town here and you just say well just forms sake you know well what about thinking that critical thought about the auditor and so forth well i and when was it and well it was not 1954 it was 1958 oh all right well is that all of it and so forth you said you did something to him again well yes theres something about well about the car i didnt tell you about the car but i wrecked it haha now if you want to keep your 234 going on some allied thing where you set it up with 1 with critical thought then that criticalthought thing is not really going to clear until youve got the other material from it do you see the difficulty which youve set up its an internal difficulty now having pulled the critical thought you get real withhold all right your 234 is actually working on the real withhold and your critical thought one is working on critical thought but actually your critical thought one will not totally clear until youve cleared the other one so you have to be smart enough to realize that you youre really not working on the critical thought one youre really not working on it its simply test item you really are never working too thoroughly on 1 one is your tester but other material will come up after 1 and if if 1 is of the variation or variety of critical thought you should know that theres real overt behind it and when you get to all of it throw the done on the end of it well thats the commonest waste of time but the failure to direct the pcs attention can come out along something like this the pc goes on and on and on and they tell you so i mean you go into stenographic audit totally stenographic audit if you dont direct the pcs attention during sec check at all he just winds up with goals and gains because hes talked all of his havingness down hes upset hes upset with you youve talked him into hole thats all and youve let the pc run up bunch of new overts of one kind or another the pc has actually probably damaged someone in the session you have to really sit there and control that pcs attention you have to control it hard now your withhold system does that to marked degree for you that controls the pcs attention by putting the pcs attention on what the pcs attention ought to be on now thats your 234 your pcs attention is on this withhold and it didnt clear it continues to fall therefore your 234 situation on the thing is the right order of questions see you dont have to go out into bunch of other random things but these questions still have to be asked intelligently you cant just say well stole joes car all right when was that all right is that all of it all right uhhh all right when didnt who didnt find out about that joe okay you stole joes car good when good is that all of it good who didnt find out about it joe good all right did you steal joes car you know it will almost work that way what is fascinating is it almost works that way see but youre working here where theres little more bonus to be gotten on the thing see now if youre paying not much attention to the emeter except to see out of the corner of your eye if it starts to surge like mad or something like this on your 234 well youre you know youre working something hot and your interest is on the pc and youre looking at the pc youre talking to the pc youre not squinted over meter you see youre asking the pc well please put little bit of invitation in it to give huh put little bit of little coax little assist and add to that little insistence that he look at it i have been known to say its perfectly all right to sit here the rest of the night because of course until we get this particular withhold were not going home but thats perfectly all right but i think it would be much faster if you simply looked and tried to see what it was the person says sitting here all night and they look at and they say by george he would be willing to sit there the blank he would be willing to sit there all night until i spilled this withhold well in desperation you know well lets get working on it lets get working on it all right ill look hey but you can let any session go to sleep see you can let any session go to sleep so that its just dawnadyyahngnyahnyah see everybody went to sleep in the session and i dont advocate this as good auditing what you want to do is youve got your what and youre trying to clear that what and when you come to 2 well when was it just about when was that well get interested when was it this is the difference you see if you want to know when it was thats what were asking you to do you see if you want to know when it was dont just ask it because of form besides you want to know when it was you know well lets find out when it was hasnt cleared up with two runs on 234 well there must be something wrong with the date there was something here unknown someplace and so forth well lets get awful interested by that time lets date it down to fraction of second on meter oh i havent showed you how to do that well just go ahead and learn it people have known how to do it for years dont expect to teach you everything its the overandunder system actually was it before 1936 or after 1936 all right it was after 1936 biggest needle reaction you know the tracedown pc all of sudden finds out that things which happened in 1936 he has thought happened in 1957 and they tend to get their track scrambled because withholds group the track so youre apt to get almost any date out of one but if this is also done in the spirit of helping the pc to look youll find that youll get lot further and your rancor ought to be only directed in the direction if you ever employ it at all of making the pc look dont ever direct with the idea of damn it you better tell or im going to be real upset with you the pc doesnt know you see what you want to know is you can say that perfectly well you say well damn it will you please look and find out see and you get away with that but the other one you see is untruthful theres lie connected with it frankly the meter is reacting but the pc doesnt know now you can bung the pc right out of session into games condition at heck of rate of speed by insisting he tell you something that he doesnt know and he winds up in apathy what you use the withhold system for is to get him to look and any spare chatter that you handle there should be in the direction of directing his attention so that he will find out more persuade his attention there direct it with an ax direct it with honey direct it with gypsy music but damn it direct it i dont care how you do it particularly some of you girls have enormous skill on the direction of attention terrific skill employ every bit of it well there might be some little salacious bit there that might be interesting to hear why dont you see if theres something little more interesting there pc says you know thats true there might be something interesting in this i dont care what trickery you use you can use any trickery that anybody has ever employed you can use any persuasion anybody ever employed but dont let catch you not directing pcs attention if i see reams of withholds written out not sequitur not one after the other that have to do with the same thing i know definitely the auditor is not directing the pcs attention you want to clean up what you want to clean up thats what you want to clean up and you better decide the thing is cleaned up or is not cleaned up and you better continue to direct the pcs attention until you decide the thing is clean keep directing his attention youre still getting reaction on the meter well i check every once in while to find out if theres an arc break thats about the only time i ever use an arc break or the phrase arc break anymore you know just ask the pc all right is repetition of this question causing an arc break i use that fairly often when i see an irregular bang on the needle and i cant get anyplace with it and ill ask the pc is this question causing an arc break in 3d criss cross use it the same way as this has this ive asked you for more items is that causing an arc break i dont get the same response then i dont get any response at all on the arc break question i must assume you see but the emeter can confuse those two things it can confuse data in the bank with an arc break and it does have confusion point so you must straighten out that confusion point you ask for more about the withhold and you actually can be so insistent on it get pc half out of session that an arc break is created and you get fall or rock slam or something starts up and you say oh well on this third question here he hasnt told all of it and yes he has thats just the trouble he has told you all of it and you havent bought it so you actually are building in missed knowingness you know so thats what you get as your arc break its just your missed knowingness so you say all right have i failed to find out something here and you get the same reaction that you were getting on is there any more to this withhold and the pc says oh well yes there is well when did i miss that well several minutes ago and so forth and you say thats fine all right do we have an arc break and now theres reaction on the thing and so on now you ask the same question you say you dont mind if i ask it again just to make sure if its clear is that all of it hmmm youre getting to theres reaction on it at all just be clean as wolfs tooth more people ran terminals and goals lists up to the hundreds and thousands mark because when by the time they ask is there another goal or is there another terminal dont you see the pc was so arc broke and so out of session on it that youd get needle reaction and so theyd say well of course theres more items we learned that one the hard way if you think there is any suspicion at all that your question itself its always repeated question by the way demand of more has created an arc break you always try to clear that up just drrrrrr just rapidly clear it up just to make sure that your reaction is not an arc break reaction and then you get true reaction the usual thing about it is that the arc break shows up blows off and then there is more of it now thats more to the point thats far far far more to the point in this withhold system pc has an arc break and more data too because theres where you get over this little hump the pc becomes misemotional when approaching real hot spot in the bank has nothing to do with the goodness of the auditing as matter of fact the better the auditing is the more certain it is that the pc is going to hit an arc break attitude not an arc break attitude its misemotional attitude he starts to get cross with the auditor because the auditor at that moment is substitute for all the people who should have known about it and didnt of course youre asking for should have known about it and youll see that rekindle and it wont be much itll just be little bit of myngmyngmymumummmoon and so on and so on and there it is everything is beautiful and shining you see itll be there somewhat even if terribly faintly and it can come up to roaring storm youve asked for the thing youve said all right what what dont i know or what havent i found out about you in this session you ask this perfectly innocently and the pc says rooooow roooooclack and you say now what dont i know about you what did i fail to find out about you what anything what went on here what part of the session and you just cut through somehow all of this chop and get that question answered and youll find out that that will become sign of routine action in doing the withhold system so you might as well learn to buck up to it and do it well dont ever back off from it pc is upset with you pull the withhold pull the missed withhold pull the should have known that would be ordinarily but in the withhold system just be sure that you just better go right on doing the withhold system because in the next question or two its going to drop out of the hamper and the pc well i dont see why youre asking that youve covered that youve covered it and gone over it and over it i cant think of any more of it theres nothing more to it i knew the guy so what i so what i knew the guy i told you several times i i knew him isnt that enough of course i omitted to tell you that also i lived with him for five years without marrying him you know i never realized that you watch you watch this and its youll find that its fairly patterned curve for the pc if it didnt happen at all id become worried about the pc you know say well were getting place with this pc couldnt possibly be getting anyplace with the pc why arent we getting anyplace with the pc well we couldnt possibly be getting anyplace with the pc because the pc has never gotten mad at us once during the entire session so we have never gotten anywhere near anything the pc never found out before we must be mining mine that was mined out several hundred auditing sessions ago and that mine must have been completely mined out to the bottom the pc will sit there they give you all the withholds they would let you publish them in the newspaper theyre perfectly all right withholds who cares about withholds whats this all right they give them to you they tell them all to you again pc never gets mad at you pc is perfectly happy with you pc doesnt change tone arm doesnt shift you could go on like that you see for hundreds of hours probably that means you must be mining mine which has been dug up there couldnt possibly be another speck of nothing in the bottom of it but that is not the state of pc that does have something at the bottom of the mine you know that pc is rrrrrrrr he feels uuuuhhhh and the pc is starting to get gray the pc is starting to get hollows under their eyes theyre starting to waste away in the auditing chair they look it over they finally come near it they finally look at you decide you must be the withhold or something or other and finally say well i was usual self and thats right i dont think theres nothing when i was there i i i i nothing right huuuuhhh ztzt damn and of course had five children by him never mentioned to anybody and by god i never thought of that either well that would be pretty obscured withhold but all of sudden they brighten up and hehheh what do you know you know hehheh hehhehheh well you know i never thought of that you know thats the most amazing thing known it all the time you know but i was sure i knew it but i i didnt know it well thats pretty clever of you haha haha thats pretty clever of you youre an awful clever auditor my god that was real smart of you to find that how did you find that ah pretty darn smart haha you look at him the hollows are gone the circles are missing their skin texture changes their eye color shifts the gauntness which they inherited all of sudden pads out very mysteriously you watch it and they suddenly get cognition you know say i wonder i wonder if losing all of my teeth which i had forgotten haha i wonder if knocking all of his teeth down his throat had anything to do with my dental trouble say do you know i think it does you know and they just start cogniting all over the place and of course you can milk these cognitions down just by running more withhold system on them you just run some more on the same thing and all of sudden theyll blow some more off because the their intense interest means that theres just little speck or two that will bleed off usually if they come up to that state in the next twentyfour hours theyll think of it as they go to bed that night or something of this sort but you can actually take it all off with this withhold system its quite amusing to watch but if you dont see that kind of cycle going on you know the withhold system isnt working or somethings going on pc is sitting there pc is bright colored everything is fine there isnt anything wrong you as the auditor are wonderful theyre answering the questions theyre very happy to do anything theres change of the tone arm they get to the end of the thing in the righthand column they write goals goals didnt make any of them hehheh hehhuh and their arc break comes after the session after youve said end of session they go out in the hall and they say well that was wasted mess it must be that the auditor never directed their attention during the entire session see you can actually have very happy pc who four hours after the session is liable to go get shotgun and shoot you you know pc was not disturbed by the session at all its just something about the mechanics of what youre doing you see now you should not expect in doing the withhold system you should not expect for moment that your pc goes on gradient scale of getting better your pc does not go on gradient scale of getting better your pc goes on gradient scale of getting worse they look worse they look grayer they are more worried things are grimmer life has suddenly started to loom as serious proposition not to be trifled with by amateurs life is grim and they may go into that curve and come out of it with fast cognition or they may go into it for three or four consecutive sessions they may go into it and out of it in twenty minutes they may go into it and out of it over this cycle of four sessions it all depends on what youre shooting for and if you do the withhold system using your zero question your zero question is well chosen and if that is very beefy question very ornery sort of question on the subject of youve all of sudden connected with something there that is very hot button of some kind or another and it fell off the pin and your zero question at as whole question has been very much avoided by the pc then its some one of these four session propositions in other words the hotter the question the longer the cycle of action of the run see the hotter the question the longer the cycle of action of the run thats of course theres that much more charge to be bled off the thing before they come to grips with it now the milder the charge the shorter the cycle of action now the cycle of action is not our cycle of action its different cycle of action for the withhold system and that is is alerted slowly perishes goes to the bottom for the third time and then on graph curve but total vertical see it comes down like this and down and down and then just total vertical and goes way up above it goes way higher than the beginning of the cycle its funny looking curve but that is the response of pc who is having his withholds properly pulled they dont get cheerfuller and cheerfuller and cheerfuller and better and better and better and if the pc is sitting there looking cheerfuller and cheerfuller and youre not getting any tone arm action or anything you know that at the end of the session itll be gains goals nothing haha thats it what lousy auditor you are and be the truth too once you got that low because the pcs attention has not been directed into anything the pcs attention should have been directed to now the entire force of an aberration is devoted to pulling the attention in while buffing it off you actually havent got to pull the pcs attention in to the middle of any aberration because its fixed there but every aberration has buffer and that is to say while the pc has his attention fixed on the last thing in the world hell admit to is having his attention on in other words hes looking both ways at once to look is to bounce you see the reason the tennis ball is on the ground is because its in the tree you know that sort of thing the reason the bomb is falling down is because it is rising see its fixed thing in other words he hasnt got an inflow or an outflow on this point its not clean outflow its not clean inflow but hell bounce off of this thing and you get into those things you get into the zone areas and the pc will go bouncy bouncy bouncy and if you dont keep him pushed on in to that youre not doing what the mind is doing which is concentrating on that hundred percent actually the mind is totally hundred percent concentrated on it the closer he gets to it the paler hes liable to look thats one of your maxims the more arc breaky hes liable to look i dont want your expectancy to measure up to you pull withholds and the person has little withhold pulled and they feel little better and they have another little withhold pulled and they feel little better and then they have big withhold pulled and they feel lot better and they have another withhold pulled and they feel lot better and it is not that cycle at all but you get hot question they instantly start to get sick and it just gets worse and worse and worse and then they really ive seen pc sit there in the most baffled stage on something i knew all about the pc you know but could this have been you know i mean but there couldnt have been anything about it see we lived at fordham and we all right when was it and so on it was at fordham and so on nothing happened at fordham just nothing i could have nothing could have happened at fordham i didnt know anybody at fordham in fact i dont remember anybody at fordham there wasnt anybody at fordham and this is all out of something the fellow says well i stole cricket bat once you know and well when was it well it was when we lived at fordham well is that all there is to it and youre liable to get some fantastic well look who could i i stole cricket bat but from whom fordham fordham fordham who it couldnt have been at fordham couldnt have been oh well it just doesnt amount to anything and you run into the notis you know it doesnt amount to any cricket bat is very cheap and so forth and its very ridiculous of to do so and i undoubtedly gave it back the next day dubin dubin dub in dubin thats not right either fordham it must have happened at fordham but nothing could have happened at fordham look i only lived at fordham between the ages of seven and eight and i couldnt possibly have see get an answer you got to get an answer to your auditing question thats one of your basic maxims of the auditor but your pc starts to go into these things oh well help him out all you can dont suggest things to him dont be that helpful but ask him pertinent questions about it well was it big bat or little bat you know what kind of cricket bat cricket cricket bat well well it was l just little cricket bat i mean it was just it was just toy cricket bat you know and youd say all right good well thats enough see dont beat him to death at that stage keep the withhold system rolling all right well who didnt find out about that well i i didnt i completely forgot it was little cricket bat it wasnt big cricket bat at all all right thats fine good enough good enough dont bother to do anything about it well how about stealing this what about stealing this cricket bat and so on you know i really cant tell you its its very funny its very hazy because it must have been at fordham fordham it couldnt have been at fordham it must have been at south chichester but at south chichester it couldnt have been at fordham and so forth well help him out and you say well when was it when was it when was it well it was in 1957 but it couldnt have been in 1957 because it must have been in 1932 i wasnt alive in 1932 it must have been 1941 well that would have been during the war and they limited the cricket bats and so forth and youd say well just give an approximation of when it was i c really cant tell all right well you just sit there for moment and well date this thing on the meter see if we can zero it in little closer and you get the idea help him out help him out help him out lead that withhold to its doom help it out of existence and then all right now is that all of it all of it i dont know anything about it at all weve now dated the thing as having happened in 1945 and i was in the armed services in 1945 oh my god oh yes hehheh and you hit something oh well and then youre liable to get resurge well when you start down that steep trail toward those last few fragments you really got to help the pc out because hes stonied he just cant force his own attention into it so letting the pcs attention ride all over the place you see is actually letting the pc be the effect of this withhold and this charge and he never forgives you see youve got to get the pcs attention and you got to hold it in there and you got to hold it in there harder but he says well cant we take up something else there are lot of nice juicy withholds ive got some on sexy ive got couple of sexy withholds here that are very good lets get over onto those i was mermaid once i could give you withhold from that you know anything you know anything oh this cricket bat you know oh he gets to the oh my god stage the closer he gets to the oh my god oh not that or thatd be terrible or what do you know you know i never remembered that any time that this the cognition stage is approached attention is harder to get in and he finally finds out that it was cricket bat that he carved personally for little italian boy in an italian village and then that was all that was left of the village was the cricket bat because he failed to order his platoon out of there and the germans shelled it to bits and killed every inhabitant in it and hed hold himself responsible for this and all ever since hes had this all figured out that it must have happened to him in his youth and the only tag hes got is cricket bat see you know theres this but cricket bat of course fits with when one was young so hes logicalized this he hasnt remembered any part of it hes got hes got beautiful script here it has nothing to do with reality and of course he just cant face that because he couldnt face it at the time so he just occluded it just like that and he said well thats it now he can live see hes been figuring ever since down someplace in his mind though if id just ordered the platoon out of the village that morning the germans came in the next morning they would never have bombarded and they would have left them alive as matter of fact i should have left the old area there earlier i shouldnt have dragged anybody into it because there was sense in it there was point in it the germans retreated the next day anyhow it was all in day and i couldnt possibly have pulled an overt like that it must have been due to the high command and it must have been due and it must have been cricket bat in childhood see he just backs out of all responsibility for it and of course there isnt anything left there he cant face having caused the death of 150 noncombatants and fzzz something he doesnt look into you see how it is so as his attention comes in his attention comes off and he part of that coming off is getting mad at the auditor looking arc breaky being upset and that sort of thing but you must differentiate between pc who is really arc broken because youve gone into games condition with him and pc who is simply introvertedly arc broke and is snapping at everything they look different by the way they look quite different one from the other direction of the pcs attention if you use this withhold system you direct his atten you help him to direct his attention if youre on hot subject why youll get yourself some fantastic resurgences nobody has ever put their fingers on buttons like this in this fellows mind nobody has ever freed up attention okay the way you have but reversely reversely if you dont direct his attention hes being put into misery because his whole bank is kicking him in the head because theres nobody there helping him hold it down dont you see well youve got to work hard on this particular basis and you actually dont have to slave over it or sweat over it what you have to keep your eye out for is the tendency of the pc to go general on the whole thing generalize things and never come up with anything specific and never give you any kind of data and just keep glossing over the top of everything and so forth after while why wake up and say well see here theres apparently something here we keep going over this ground lets look shall we hehheh lets look lets look now i said is that all of it now thats what i mean i mean i mean is there any more to this at all just look at it and see if there isnt the only thing weve missed here is bedford truck you know something of that size because as sure as he gets in toward one of these things he starts to go generalize sweep on the thing and you start crowding him to it he gets kind of hrrrr well i dont know if id like the look of this bedford truck arhrhrrrr that works out with any withhold well you neednt be so cross about it you neednt be so insistent about it ill look im perfectly cooperative pc hm hrpssssstssst theres nothing there but theres nothing there theres theres nothing more that is all there is to it that is all there is to it the needle falling off the pin that is all there is to it and you say good good what more is there to the all nothing here but the second army corps some little detail like this just slipped his mind you know you got to get him to look and the job of the auditor is not to get the pc to tell yes the pc will talk to you and the pc better be talking to you and dont misinterpret that to this effect that the auditor doesnt have to be told the withhold by the pc dont misinterpret that but just frankly and overtly and directly if the pc knows about it the pc will tell you and that is what you must realize and make up your mind to the reluctance of the pc to tell you all stems from his not knowing about it and your pc will have very easy time of it if you grasp this one point of the withhold system because after that you will assist him to find out and you will help him find out things if he says well i just dont know you say well lets find out see he says well i just dont know dont say well tell see thats the wrong response get your responses different he says i just dont know you say wrong response well tell about it see the right response is he says well i just dont know and there doesnt seem to be any more and so forth and you say well look lets look at it come on lets dig it up little bit more there must be some pieces showing someplace arent there an old pair of wingedfoot heels showing out of this rubble here someplace where where is this lets dig it up come on here dig it up and he says oh yeah theres couple of very nice people there i didnt realize that yeah well theres something well all right take that as an answer buy the pcs data and keep the system going see now the mistakes that you can make is thinking the pc isnt going to tell you the pc is going to tell you and the pc knows he will tell you and the other mistake you can make is thinking that the pc is really upset with you when he starts getting upset with the bank and start chopping the pc another mistake that you can make is failure to handle the pcs attention to cut off the pc the pc is going on and on and on and saying i had this dog and his na his name was rover and the dog used to run up and down the street all the time and he used to jump on and off the hedge and so forth and i used to teach him to jump on and off the hedge and he had big collar and he had wonderful collar and so forth then one day one of the boys stole the collar and i beat him up and i got the collar back and we put it back on this dog rover well as i was telling you this dog rover we used to keep him in the garage because hes such big dog we had big garage there so wed keep him in the big gabig dog in the big garage you see and we had this thing oh man if you want pc to get upset with you let him do that let him go on and on and on how do you shut pc off well if you cant think of anything else say shut up i mean that will upset him less see that will upset him less you learn that if you learn those little points and you put those points into practice your security checking will become song i guarantee it theres nothing much to this now were calling it security checking loosely its actually prepchecking now youre going to get the rest of your materials for this the little checks and so forth that you run for your zero questions right now as ive said before the most fruitful source is to find if you got any old form any old form anyplace the pc has been sec checked on youd find one of its items is loaded theres one question on there was loaded use that for your zero and just go over that and over it and over it and if youre if you havent got the form from the pc because youre auditing field pc and so forth and you havent got the records you can say what withhold did you keep telling an auditor what withhold have you continued to tell an auditor for long time and then try to find out what question got this withhold and try to rephrase that question and then youve got your zero and you can take off from there and of course youll just mine the mine because itll go from there on out and thats one when youre operating on hgc pcs that have been audited by field auditor and you dont know quite where to start on something like this you could start there very fruitfully if you didnt have standard check form but this person had received lot of auditing and was appeared to be very arc breaky and so forth well somebody has headed him into one of these things and they havent gotten him off of it so the most profit that you could make on the whole transaction would be to say well what withhold have you told several auditors or what withhold have you told auditors several times thats good one all right thats fine now what question would elicit this withhold what question had been asked that did it and try to put some kind of question together that would have gotten that withhold and then mine this question and boy oh boy youll see the bank roar because people have sec checked this person straight into the middle of of dead stop they got him right there theyve restimulated something and they havent pulled it and thats whats known as your recurrent withholds your recurring withhold and recurring withhold is very very very well plowed because its already as though somebody has just set up radar screen and couple of compasses and some geophysical markers and the american flag with the eagle on top of it ten feet tall see and saying under this is an item the pc does not know anything about and thats your recurring withhold as sign or symptom the other one is recurring complaint you know who have you complained about most what have you complained about most and you finally zero that in and youll find out theyve complained consistently and continually about their family well you could use it as withhold question but there is one little word of warning on that knowing 3d criss cross you will be very cautious about sailing in toward targets and you dont sail in toward targets that you dont know whether they are terminals oppterms or whether they are on the 3d package at all because you know that you can beef up the whole prehav scale by running wrong terminal so the one of the poor ways to go about it this girl has always had trouble with her husband so we immediately say well without any questioning at all she must have withholds from her husband so therefore bang lets just sail in on this and lets use the zero question what have you done to your husband or something stupid like this you see lets use this husband see husband oh oh oh wait minute shes always had trouble with the husband the husband is either in the bank or not in the bank or should be in the bank but theres something 3d criss cross wrong with this terminal husband so you of course dont follow that up at all your generalized questions your zero questions should be very general on the subject of doingness or knowingness but they shouldnt have too much to do with beingness they could have something to do with havingness but you leave beingness alone in those zero questions and youll be all right because this stuff is all being run usually being run prior to 3d criss cross and you wouldnt know anything about it by the way any 3d criss cross item this is not advised but any 3d criss cross item that proved out as the pcs terminal could probably be moved in as zero question of the withhold system now whether it would blow up part of the universe or part of the pcs head or not i dont guarantee because its not been tested its probably too much and its probably too unreal but just give you an idea that if you were going to do beingnesses those are the beingnesses that you would do on the withhold system and you leave other beingnesses alone you can take up the whole subject you could take up any subject you know but be careful with the beingness aspect of it see you could take up subject of marriage but god help us lets not take up the subject of husbands and wives you got the idea or families you see thats beingness we can take up the subject of being broke but we cant take up any other okay male voice yeah thank you male voice thank you
