particulate matter respiratory irritant and likely human carcinogen and 95 less nitrogen oxides group of gases that contribute to the formation of ozone because sulfur interferes with the operation of the emission control technologies to be used the regulation also requires reduction of 97 in the allowable concentration of sulfur in diesel fuel from 500 to 15 parts per million effective in june 2006 reactions to the new regulations are mixed state and local air pollution officials environmental groups the auto industry and diesel engine manufacturers appear largely satisfied with the rule although some want epa to modify its implementation schedule or require even greater reductions in fuel sulfur refiners service station owners the trucking industry and agricultural groups have largely opposed the rule arguing that it would be difficult and costly to meet could result in refinery closures and would cause shortages of diesel fuel with associated price spikes instead of 15 parts per million ppm the refining industry has backed 50 ppm sulfur standard epa the engine manufacturers and the manufacturers of emissions controls say that 50 ppm would not be sufficiently stringent to permit optimal operation of pollution controls while the refining industry has generally opposed the rule two refiners bp and tosco are supportive conversely while engine manufacturers have generally supported the rule cummins engine has expressed reservations about the availability of the technology and suggested that epa delay promulgation of the final rule pending further development and demonstration of the necessary pollution controls some reactions to the rule are influence d by the knowledge that in the absence of strong federal standards states including california have begun to adopt their own standards thus the california trucking association supports the epa proposal in hopes of leveling the playing field between them and outofstate trucking firms this report examines the rules potential impacts on fuel supply summarizes the issues related to pollution controls discusses potential impacts on the economy and discusses issues raised by the timing

introduction since the beginning of federal regulation of vehicle emissions in the late 1960s diesel vehicles and engines have faced less stringent emission standards than their gasoline counterparts the most significant reason is that passenger vehicles which generally have gasoline engines were seen as the greatest contributor to mobile source pollution and were targeted first as emissions from gasoline engines have improved and the share of emissions from diesel engines has increased more attention is now being paid to reducing the emissions from diesels1 on june 2 2000 under authority of the clean air act the environmental protection agency epa proposed tighter rules for emissions from heavyd uty trucks and buses starting in model year my 2007 these regulations were finalized december 21 20002 to ensure that the emission control technologies necessary to meet the tighter standards will operate effectively epa included in the rule requirements for reduction of 97 in the allowable sulfur in diesel fuel the new regulations are in addition to earlier regulations on light and heavyduty vehicles starting in my2004 the agencys move to regulate diesel engine and vehicle emissions more stringently responds to concerns over the health effects of certain components of diesel exhaust especially fine particulate matter and nitrogen oxides in addition to the standards for diesel trucks and highway fuel the agency has also promulgated standards to control emissions from diesel locomotives lightduty diesel vehicles and marine diesel engines3 additionally epa expects to propose standards for diesel engines and fuel used in offroad vehicles eg farm and construction equipment in 2001 the subcommittee on clean air wetlands private property and nuclear safety of the senate environment and public works committee held hearings june 15 and septembe r 21 2000 on the proposed rules given the broad nature of the rules potential impacts others in congress have expressed an

the final report in which the conclusions did not continuedinterest is considered likely to continue in the 107th congress anticipating continued interest this report provides an analysis of epas proposal why are diesel emissions concern the regulation of diesel fuel and engines presents growing environmental policy issue in the united states and other countries on one hand the better fuel economy of diesel engines leads to lower emissions of carbon dioxide4 furthermore since diesel fuel burns more completely diesel engines tend to have lower hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions5 on the other hand diesel fuel tends to lead to higher emissions of particulate matter pm and nitrogen oxides x particulate matter emissions from diesel vehicles are key concern because of the potential health effects including asthma and reduced lung function particulate matter is one of six socalled criteria air pollutants for which epa has set nation wide health standards national ambient air quality standards to be attained by states and local areas currently 76 metropolitan areas with combined population of 298 million have not attained the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for pm under stricter standards promulgated by the agency in 1997 but not yet implemented many additional areas would be added to the list diesel particulates are also increasingly considered to be toxic air pollutants because of the reported health effects of diesel pm the california air resources board in 1998 declared diesel pm toxic air contaminant6 in 1990 california had identified diesel exhaust as chemical known to the state to cause cancer7 study undertaken by californias south coast air quality management district in 1999 concluded that diesel emissions account for 71 of the estimated cancer incidence from urban air toxics an estimated 16250 cases of cancer in the angeles area alone8 epa is also currently investigating the health effects of diesel

organic compounds and carbon monoxide have decreased over the past ten years emissions of nox including those from onroad vehicles have increased10 new regulations epas new regulations on diesel fuel and vehicles cover lightduty vehicles heavyduty vehicles and sulfur in diesel fuel lightduty vehicles include all highway vehicles under 8600 pounds of gross vehicle weight and passenger vehicles below 10000 pounds gross vehicle weight11 heavyduty vehicles are highway vehicles above these weight ratings lightduty vehicles on february 10 2000 epa promulgated new rules regulating emissions from lightduty vehicles including both passenger cars and light trucks12 these standards will be phased in between model year 2004 and my2009 in addition to requiring substantial reductions in emissions these socalled tier 2 standards were notable for two features 1 for the first time the regulations required light trucks and passenger cars to meet identical standards trucks including vans and sport utility vehicles had previously been allowed greater emissions and 2 the regulations require vehicles to meet the same standards regardless of fuel type13 under previous regulations diesel vehicles have been allowed to emit higher levels of x than gasoline vehicles few lightduty vehicles are dieselfueled so the existing difference in standards has had little effect but epa was concerned that less stringent standardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30737crs4 14environmental protection agency tier 2gasoline sulfur final rulemaking regulatory impact analysis review draft december 22 1999 p v26

an increase in their use with negative effects on air quality the fuelneutral approach to regulation embodied in the tier 2 standards concerns some engine manufacturers who think that making diesel vehicles that meet the new standards will lead to higher consumer costs epa predicts that the new regulations will cost less than 100 per vehicle for most passenger cars less than 200 for most light trucks and less than 300 for the largest 8600 10000 pound passenger vehicles with increases in the cost of vehicle care and maintenance14 in the public comment period for the proposed rule critics argued that epa did not look at dieselfueled lightdu ty vehicles specifically and that per vehicle costs for diesels could be as high as 1000 in response epa contended that while diesel costs were not specifically addressed additional costs will be negligible compared to the costs for gasoline vehicles because increased costs will be spread over large production runs and across multiple

tighter emission standards for heavyduty vehicles that will take effect in my2004 in october 1999 epa reaffirmed the technological feasibility costeffectiveness and appropriateness of these standards these new standards will cut x emissions from heavyduty highway engines by approximately 50 from the my1998 standards16 responding to concerns that engine manufacturers were building engines that emitted higher amounts of pollution on the road than during testing on october 6 2000 epa promulgated more accurate emissions testing procedures and standards to guarantee that actual emissions are reduced to the levels that the new standards require as part of this rule all heavyduty vehicles under 14000 pounds gross vehicle weight will be required to have onboard diagnostic equipment to monitor the performance of emission control devices17 in addition to the my2004 standards on january 18 2001 epa promulgated further heavyduty engine standards that take effect in my2007 these proposed standards are the focus of this report these standards will reduce x emissions by approximately 90 below the my2004 levels and pm by 9018 the technology necessary to meet the pm standard has been demonstrated on the road and is available but the nox reduction technology has not been demonstrated outside the lab whether this technology will be available in time for engine manufacturers to meet the proposed standard is one of the major issues raised by the new rule the issue is discussed below on pp 1316 sulfur in diesel fuel meeting the proposed emission standards will require very low levels of sulfur in diesel fuel sulfur can corrupt emission control devices and the newest technologies for emissions control are especially sensitive to sulfur supporters of tightened standards argue that in addition to allowing the use of advanced technology in new vehicles lower sulfur levels will also lead to decreased emissions from existing vehicles19 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30737crs6

the principal consultant on study of the rules potential impact conducted for the american petroleum institutecurrently highway diesel fuel is regulated at maximum of 500 parts per million ppm sulfur and averages around 300 ppm epa has proposed reduction to 15 ppm to allow for the use of advanced emission controls agency officials argue that any higher level would jeopardize the efficiency and reliability of emission control systems and any lower level would produce little benefit compared to the added expense20 refiners have criticized this standard as too costly and likely to lead to supply disruptions and market instability21 the american petroleum institute the industrys trade association contends that standard of 50 ppm the same as that being adopted in 2005 by japan and the european union eu22 would achieve clean air goals without substantial disruption of supply or price this issue is further discussed below on pp 6 12 key issues the new diesel fuel and engine regulations will likely promote longterm improvements in air quality and public health however several issues have been raised by various stakeholders the four main issue areas are the cost of meeting the diesel fuel standards and the possibility of fuel supply disruptions the availability performance and cost of new emissions control technology the economic effects on users of diesel fuel and on consumers in general and the timing of the new standards these four areas will be addressed in turn cost and supply of lowsulfur diesel one of the key issues in the debate over the proposed rule is the potential cost to refiners and the ultimate cost to consumers of the new ultralow sulfur diesel fuel the refining industry argues that the cost will be high that some refiners will choose not to make the required investments and that as result there will be shortages of diesel fuel for as long as two years after the deadline for implementation september 1 200623 according to the refining industry these shortages combined with difficulties in distributing the new fuel will cause price spikes and supply disruptions with negative effects that will ripple through the economyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30737crs7 24 see 65 federal register pp 3548335486 june 2 2000 25 statement of j louis frank president of marathon ashland petroleum for the american petroleum institute before the senate committee on environment and public works clean air subcommittee june 15 2000technology concerns epa argues that there are many reasons to believe that scenarios in which refiners cannot produce the necessary fuel and distributors cannot distribute it are unlikely according to epa and most independent industry analysts there are significant technological barriers to reducing sulfur levels to 15 ppm24 sulfur is removed from diesel fuel in refinery units called hydrotreaters in hydrotreaters oil is heated and subjected to high pressure with hydrogen as an added input the oil reacts with the hydrogen in the presence of catalyst separating the sulfur from the fuel to remove additional amounts of sulfur in hydrotreater requires higher temperatures and pressures improved catalysts and increased hydrogen purity epa says that existing hydrotreaters and other equipment used to meet the 500 ppm standard can be expanded and additional systems can be added given the lead time of more than five years the agency expects that refiners will be able to plan the necessary expansions during scheduled down times also epa believes that some refiners will experience synergy in meeting both the diesel sulfur regulations and the related tier 2 gasoline sulfur regulations which begin to take effect in 2004 refiners claim that those promoting the diesel sulfur standard underestimate the barriers to the expansion of desulfurization technology refining industry representatives argue that while some existing equipment can be used significant additional desulfurization equipment will be necessary to meet the very low level of sulfur required furthermore they contend that because of the higher pressures called for in refinery units making the new fuel some existing equipment will need to be completely replaced refiners are also concerned that ultralow sulfur diesel will require additional capital investment without added profits small refiners especially have raised this as an issue they contend that less investment capital is available to them25 these smaller refiners believe that the new regulations could force them out of the diesel fuel market because of these concerns epa granted refiners additional flexibility in the final rule large refiners will be allowed to produce up to 20 of their total highway fuel at the old 500 ppm standard during transition period that stretches from 2006 until june 1 2010 during this period credit trading within five geographic areas will allow refiners who choose not to meet the 80 requirement to purchase credits from others who exceed the requirement small refiners will be entirely exempt from the standard until june 1 2010 provided that the refiners ensure the existence of sufficient volumes of 15 ppm fuel in the marketing area they serve small refiners who produce 15 ppm fuel prior to june 1 2010 will generate credits that may be sold to other refiners and used as method of compliance credits can also be generated by any refiner for early compliance after june 1 2005 there are also special provisions for refiners in 8 western states and general hardship

preamble to the final rule pp 146186 available at the same website 27these costs would be partially offset in epas analysis by engine maintenance savings averaging one cent per gallon for net increase in cost of 3 to 4 cents per gallon 28 the value from the mathpro study is actually an interpolation made by epa since mathpro looked at the refining costs for 2 ppm and 20 ppm sulfur diesel fuel as opposed to the 15 ppm required in the proposed rule see us epa office of air and radiation draft regulatory impact analysis for the proposed heavy duty engine and vehicle standards and highway diesel fuel sulfur control requirements rule p v89 29ensys energy systems inc for oak ridge national laboratory modeling impacts of reformulated diesel fuel interim report august 14 2000 p 16 the ornl study notes however that rather than domestic refiners investing to convert the most difficult domestic fuel streams to low sulfur diesel it might be cheaper to have refiners outside the united states process their easiest streams to less than 10 ppm at lower cost and export those to the united states thus lowering the total cost of compliance with the rule ibid p 12 30american petroleum institute api comments on the 2007 heavyduty enginediesel sulfur proposed rule p 74 api adds that incorporating additional distribution costs discussed below and losses in fuel economy brings the cost to manufacture and distribute the fuel to 110 per gallonany refiner may apply these provisions essentially give refiners who expect difficulty in meeting the new standard four extra years to achieve compliance26 cost whatever disagreements there may be concerning the capability of the refining industry to produce lower sulfur fuel all stakeholders agree that the new fuel will cost more to manufacture while many stakeholders including some major refiners are confident that 15 ppm sulfur fuel can be produced in the quantities necessary to meet demand estimates for the increase in production cost cover wide range epa predicts that the added production cost for ultralow sulfur diesel will be approximately 44gallon27 while study by mathpro inc for the engine manufacturers association estimates the cost at 46 to 62gallon28 in its comments on epas proposed rule the department of energys oak ridge national laboratory ornl predicted that it would cost approximately 43 to 59 per gallon to convert 50 of domestic highway diesel production capacity to ultralow sulfur diesel and approximately 75 to 99 per gallon to convert the last quartile of domestic capacity to produce the proposed fuel29 the american petroleum institute api estimated the cost at 89 per gallon30 most of these cost estimates assume that current technologies will be used to produce the ultralow sulfur fuel technology may improve however bringing lower costs for example on october 3 2000 phillips petroleum announced that it has developed new sulfur removal technology that uses significantly lower

capital costs and everyday operating expenses while achieving targeted product quality31 distribution issues stakeholders opposing the rule are also concerned that distributing the new fuel could be expensive segregating ultralow sulfur diesel from other distillates in pipeline transport may be difficult the specification ratio the ratio of given specification of two abutting streams in pipeline or at terminal in this case the ratio of the sulfur content of 15 ppm diesel fuel with other distillates such as offroad diesel fuel could be as much as 3001 the only comparable situation was the introduction of unleaded gasoline where the ratio was approximately 501 because of the difference in the two fuels more fuel is required as an interface between the abutting streams fuel contaminated in spacing batches of distillate would be downgraded to lower specification or returned to the refinery for reprocessing with the loss in value due to downgrading considered part of the added cost of distributing the lower sulfur fuel epa estimates that the added cost of distributing ultralow sulfur diesel fuel will be approximately 05gallon long term ie once the sulfur standard is fully effective in 2010 in the initial period between 2006 and 2010 when two grades of highway fuel would be available costs of distribution will be higher because of the need to provide additional tanks at refineries terminals and truck stops for an extra grade of fuel epa estimates the distribution costs during this initial period as 11gallon32 another study by turner mason company for the american petroleum institute estimates that the added long term cost could be as much as 09gallon33 this discrepancy arises from the fact that turner mason assumes higher percentage of each batch of diesel fuel will need to be downgraded than does epa turner mason company also identify another potential problem downgrading of large batches of fuel could lead to localized supply disruptions according to their study some terminals may not have enough demand for the other distillate fuels to which contaminated ultra low sulfur diesel would be downgraded and may not have the additional tankage necessary to store the downgraded fuel if this is the case some terminals may need to return fuel to the refinery for reprocessing or face situation where they have storage space available for new batch of uncontaminated ultralow sulfur diesel34 however if terminals are permitted to expand and if they have the available capital it appears that the fiveandahalf years of leadtime provided by the promulgated rule should allow for construction of more storage capacityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30737crs10 35the high aromatic content of lco makes it especially difficult to remove sulfur because the

summary june 20 2000 p 24 under the tier 2 rule low sulfur gasoline will be required beginning in 2004 other factors affecting supply few other supply concerns have also been presented key concern raised by fuel marketers is that the technology does not exist to produce low sulfur diesel from certain blendstocks specifically one blendstock light cycle oil lco has very high sulfur content in addition to high aromatic content35 fuel marketers argue that it would be economically infeasible to use it to produce lowsulfur diesel fuel therefore they argue the diesel supply could be limited from the start36 epa argues that due to the higher weight of lco it is relatively easy process to remove lco from the input blend then it is possible to use the remaining purer blendstock for lowsulfur diesel while using lco to produce other fuels such as heating oil or nonroad diesel37 another issue raised by diesel suppliers is that the united states would be unable to import diesel to meet domestic shortages because the proposed sulfur level is below that of most other countries unless foreign refiners upgrade their refineries to meet the new us standard their supplies would be unavailable to us markets38 effects of supply disruptions related concern is the question of supply disruptions with the introduction of the new fuel according to study by charles river associates for api some refiners will be unlikely to expand production of diesel fuel and may even reduce or eliminate diesel fuel production in light of the uncertainty brought on by the new sulfur requirements they predict that this could lead to price spikes of 15 to 50 per gallon until such time as production capacity can expand andor imports can increase39 in addition the national petroleum council npc which is composed largely of industry executives but acts in an advisory capacity to the secretary of energy states that there is significant risk of supply disruptions if ultralow sulfur diesel is required before 2007 since the introduction would overlap with the introduction of lowsulfur gasoline40 however according to the turner mason study as well as the epa rulemaking documents over the last 25 years the petroleum industry has faced many challenges with introducing new fuels and most changes were relatively benign in many cases including the introduction of the current low sulfur 500 ppm diesel in response to clean air act requirements in 1993 the refining industry converted more equipment than necessary to meet the new standards resulting in overproduction and leading

the 15ppm standard in 2007 and additional increments each year until 100 compliance would be reached in 2015 doe estimated the cost savings from such phased implementation at 1427 billion42 does position was opposed not only by epa but also by the petroleum industry spokesmen for the american petroleum institute and the national petrochemical and refiners association termed phasein expensive and awkward in addition to causing distributional difficultie s and requiring large investments to keep the two fuels separate during the phasein period the additional costs would be stranded when the market reverted to single fuel in 2015 according to the industry groups43 as noted the final rule will allow several exemptions from the 15 ppm standard during 4year transition period the exemptions are described above on page 7 these provisions are expected to allow up to 25 of highway diesel fuel to continue to be produced at the 500 ppm sulfur standard until 2010 this fuel will need to be separated from 15 ppm fuel in the distribution system however and may only be used in pre2007 model year engines petroleum industry alternative while two major refiners bp and tosco support ed epas 15

reduction in particulate matter and 75 reduction in nox emissions from new heavyduty diesel engines industrys plan is still expensive we estimate it will cost the industry roughly 4 billion to implement but unlike epas extreme and much more costly proposal the level of sulfur reduction proposed by industry is attainable and sustainable45 the petroleum industry plan like epas relies on the use of particle filters or traps to capture particulate matter but the additional sulfur in 50 ppm fuel would affect the performance of the filters require more frequent maintenance and shorten their expected life according to manufacturers of the equipment46 nox on the other hand would be removed by completely different technology in the oil industrys plan selective catalytic reduction scr rather than the x adsorbers that the engine manufacturers expect to use and on which epa based the rule47 scr is promising nox removal technology modeled on controls used by power plants and other stationary sources but it requires the use of urea compound of ammonia that is commonly used as fertilizer to react with the sulfur the urea would have to be supplied to the nations truck stops and diesel fueling stations through an entirely new distribution system this approach would put the burden on truckers to maintain urea levels in their emission control systems according to api urea would need to be replenished every 5000 10000 miles if the urea were not replenished the emission control system would not function48 for this and other reasons engine manufacturers the emission controls

on fails to meet commercialization goals or fails to provide the expected benefits epa would be unable to certify engines as meeting the proposed standard without certification engines cannot legally be offered for sale engine manufacturers in comments filed with epa the engine manufacturers association outlined number of concerns with the proposed rule arguing that the standards are not technologically feasible within the proposed time frame that the test methods specified by the agency cannot accurately measure compliance that the nox and pm standards need to be made less stringent and that in contrast to the views of the petroleum industry the sulfur content of diesel fuel should be capped at 5 ppm 10 ppm less than epa is requiring49 in its oral statement at epas public hearings the association appeared more supportive however its comments focused almost exclusively on the need to remove essentially all sulfur from diesel fuel otherwise the industrys spokesman sounded optimistic about the industrys ability to perform as we sit here today we are on the cusp the critical turning point of something spectacular we have within our grasp the potential to dramatically reduce the emissions of the most fuel efficient reliable and durable source of motive power available today there are issues which will require great deal of work by manufacturers and the

development required sulfur traps are being developed but are not developed yet the x adsorber is currently in the lab but is still years away from fieldtesting and finally the oxidation catalyst is in production but on limited applications we can neither evaluate the pieces individually nor as an integrated system with the potential to achieve the proposed reductions moreover we can only guess as to what impact the envisioned system of aftertreatment technologies will have on engine performance fuel economy and cost51 cummins has not publicly argued with the implementation date of 2007 however rather the company has asked that epa delay finalizing the rule until further research and development can be done we are urging epa to provide an additional 18 to 24 months so that stakeholders can assess these issues which are critical to the success of the ultimate rule epa can do this and still implement rule for 200752 manufacturers of emission controls in achieving the

rule see 65 federal register p 35479 june 2 2000the meca statement went on to address the question of whether the proposal offered sufficient time to develop and implement technology not yet demonstrated if the epa delays this important regulatory initiative the substantial commitment in financial and human resources that is being made by meca member companies and many others to develop andor optimize the necessary technology solutions likely will be scaled back further suggestions that epa should wait until the necessary technological solutions are commercially available is totally unrealistic virtually investment in technology development will occur based on the vague prospect that if technology is developed regulations may be adopted such logic flies in the face of the 30year success story of the clean air act54 whether the technology to meet the standards can be developed in time will need to be apparent several years in advance of the rules effective date manufacturers expect to design and test prototypes and make manufacturing decisions by late 200455 if the technology chosen by the manufacturers meets the emission standards for test engines and vehicles the rule as finalized would presumably go forward if the technology does not meet the standards epa would be faced with choice of altering the standard extending the deadline for compliance or allowing manufacturers to produce and sell noncomplying engines under limited circumstances in exchange for paying penalty to the government56 an historical anal ogy the situation in which epa and the engine manufacturers find themselves is not unlike that faced in the early 1970s by auto manufacturers and the agency the clean air amendments of 1970 signed by president nixon on december 31 of that year required reductions in auto emissions by model year 1975 that would necessitate the use of technology not yet demonstrated on any motor vehicle in production the manufacturers had less time than that offered by the diesel rule only little over three and half years between the enactment of the law and the effective date of its standards representatives of the automotive industry appear to have been unanimous in stating that it would not be possible to meet standards by 1975 and ultimately epa granted repeated suspensions of the standards while granting suspensions

relaxing the standards in 1977 it wasnt until 1980 and 1981 that the original standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide were met not until 1994 did the original x standard of 04 grams per mile go into effect while the standards themselves were implemented more slowly than envisioned the basic technologies on which epa and the manufacturers relied unleaded gasoline and catalytic converters were implemented in time for the 1975 model year the auto manufacturers and their suppliers gradually improved both engine and converter technologies after that date to achieve lower emissions unleaded fuel and catalytic converters still play key roles in auto emission control systems 25 years later technology review in order to guarantee the effectiveness of the proposed diesel rules epa considered conducting technology review in 2003 or 2004 this would allow the agency to revisit the standards before implementation and determine whether the necessary technology was likely or unlikely to be available by my2007 technology review was criticized by some as promoting inaction by the regulated entities notably the engine manufacturers association was among those opposed to technology review arguing that it would create additional uncertainty and effectively prevent engine manufacturers from fully developing and investing resources toward achieving the standards finally adopted58 the final rule did not incorporate technology review cost engine manufacturers and users of heavyduty vehicles are also concerned about the potential cost of the new technology epa predicts that new vehicle costs could increase by 1990 for lighter heavyduty truck to 3230 for the heaviest trucks in 2007 with 40 decrease to 1170 and 1870 respectively by 2012 the agency expects operating costs including increased fuel cost to increase by about 600 for light heavyduty truck to as much as 4030 for the heaviest trucks in the long term59 engine manufacturers argue that with so many uncertainties engine costs could be much higher and that in the short term costs will certainly be higher60httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30737crs17 61this section focuses on the impact of the proposed fuel standards as has most comment on the economic effects of the proposed rule the fuel standards have attracted more comment most likely because an increase in fuel costs or disruption in fuel supply would have immediate impacts across most sectors of the economy whereas an increase in the cost of new trucks or engines would initially affect smaller segment of the economy 62see crs report rl30634 august 15 2000 pp 1418 among the reasons cited in that report that recent oil price increases have had little impact are that the us economy uses less energy per capita and per unit of gross domestic product than it did during the oil shocks of the 1970s using just half the fuel per dollar of gross domestic product in 1999 that it did in 1973 63all data on trucking unless otherwise noted are from mcgrawhill companies us industry trade outlook 2000 trucking p 541economic effects of the new fuel and engine standards61 whether the new regulation s will have broad impacts on the us economy primarily depends on whether large fuel price increases or disruptions in the supply of diesel fuel occur as noted previously diesel fuel cost increases have been estimated by four different sources to range from 43 cents to 99 cents per gallon net costs could be lower if adjustments are made for maintenance cost savings or the likely introduction of lowercost sulfur removal technology supply disruptions could cause increased prices fuel shortages and other shortterm problems if introduction of the new fuel is not properly managed whether this occurs depends to large extent on whether distributors of diesel fuel and other distillates use the next fiveand ahalf years to prepare the distribution and fuel storage infrastructure to handle potential problems recent crs report addressed the potential for fuel price increases to affect broader economic variables in rising oil prices what dangers do they pose for the economy marc labonte noted that several recent studies had concluded that the effects of recent increases in the price of crude oil or even the effect of further 10 per barrel increase would be modest62 10perbarrel crude oil price increase would translate to 25centpergallon cost increase that could affect all liquid fuels gasoline diesel kerosene home heating oil etc the projected cost increase from the proposed regulations are substantially less than that 43 to 99 cents and affect only highway diesel fuel which accounts for roughly 10 of oil consumption thus the impact of diesel fuel price increases economywide would be substantially less than the impact of recent crude oil price increases nevertheless the price of diesel fuel is an important consideration in certain industries notably trucking transit and long distance bus motorcoaches farmers who use diesel fuel to power majority of the nations farm machinery have also expressed concerns potential effects on these sectors are addressed below trucking the trucking industry accounts for more

the us in 1997 and they consumed almost 203 billion gallons of primarily diesel fuel during the same year64 many of the small firms in this industry especially owneroperators are very sensitive to cost increases the average profit margin in the trucking industry is only 195 because of the large amount of competition in the industry it is difficult for individual firms to raise rates fuel costs average roughly 15 of the industrys total operating costs according to recent estimates65 the industry will therefore be especially concerned about cost increases associated with low sulfur fuels equipment and maintenance costs are also major concern there seems to be considerable doubt in the industry that epas truck cost estimates are accurate even if they are accurate the american trucking association argues the combined new purchase and life cycle cost estimates are 6230 per truck in the short term which is significant sum especially for small operators66 the trucking industry also believes that epas new diesel emission standards unfairly discriminate against it visavis its principal intermodal competitors railroads and barges the american trucking association ata has taken the position that there should be only one diesel standard for all freight transportation carriers epa has recently implemented new standards for locomotives which require emission reductions of about twothirds for x and about 50 percent for hydrocarbons and particulate matter these standards began taking effect this year67 barges powered by marine diesel engines must meet standards that take effect in 2004 and 2007 these standards will result in only 24 reduction in nox and 12 reduction in particulate matter when fully implemented however68 these standards are not as stringent as the promulgated standards for diesel trucks on the other hand some sectors of the trucking industry face standards at least as stringent as those proposed by epa as result of planned state or local

engines in its proposed state implementation plan sip for the houston galveston area for example texas proposed to require the use of 30 ppm ultralow sulfur diesel fuel for both onhighway and offhighway purposes in east and central texas beginning in may 2004 with further reduction to 15 ppm in may 200671 the final version of the sip dropped the 2004 requirement but includes limits on the aromatic content of diesel fuel and other requirements applicable to both on and off highway diesel fuels beginning in 200272 the state has also proposed restrictions on the use of heavy equipment to reduce emissions faced with what they consider inadequate federal standards for diesel emissions in the 20052006 period at least 17 states are adopting standards for diesel engine emissions that are stricter than the federal standards for those years73 had epa not acted this tendency toward fragmentation of the national market for fuels and engines might have continued the result of such fragmentation could have been increased costs in the affected areas beyond those projected for compliance with epas rule transit there were approximately 698000 buses in the united states in 199774 the majority of these were school buses school buses mostly use gasoline engines for propulsion and are not subject to the diesel standard there are however new standards for heavyduty gasoline

association apta 1999 transit fact book washington 1999 76the department of transportation does not have specific data on this industry segment this discussion relies on american bus association motorcoach industry facts wwwbusesorgindustryprofileindexcfm according to the american public transit association apta there were 72170 transit buses in service in 199775 of these just over 47000 used diesel as their primary fuel total diesel fuel consumption for these vehicles in 1997 exceeded 563 million gallons unlike the other industries discussed here the transit industry is not profitable one only 401 of transits operating costs are recovered directly from its principal customer base in the form of passenger fares the remainder of transit operating funding and much of its capital funding are provided by federal state and local governments experience has shown that it is difficult for the transit industry to pass all of its cost increases through to its passengers in the form of higher fares without losing ridership it is therefore likely that any cost increases imposed on the industry will affect both passengers and the budgets of various government subsidy providers an important concern to this industry is the life of its equipment transit buses are heavily used and have life span of over decade new buses cost on average over 250000 it is not uncommon for transit bus to be reengined several times during its useful life apta and transit operators have expressed concern that the use of ultralow sulfur fuel and associated engine technology could seriously reduce the expected service life of transit engines if this occurred it would result in costs significantly above those suggested by epa on the other hand transit systems throughout the country are under pressure from regulators and the public to reduce emissions from their existing bus fleets many including new york angeles and washington dc are purchasing buses powered by compressed natural gas cng because of public concerns about diesel emissions without marked improvement in diesel emissions more of this industry is likely to switch to cng or other alternative fuels with many of the same concerns regarding the cost and reliability of new technology motorcoach according to the american bus association there are approximately 44000 commercial motorcoaches in service in 2000 in the united states and canada76 the vast majority of which are based in the united states about 12 are used in regularly scheduled passenger service as opposed to providing charter service these account for roughly half of all of the mileage operated by the industry most of the 4000 firms in this industry are small businesses but the largest 50 firms in the industry account for 56 of all passengers in 1999 the motorcoach industry consumed approximatel 498 million gallons of fuel most of which was diesel the motorcoach industry has some of the same concerns as the transit industry this industrys largest concerns are likely to be the cost of low sulfur fuel and the cost of new equipment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30737crs21 77there is also counterargument raised by some petroleum cooperatives

of new technology engines paramoun t concern at the same time because of these long service lives the motorcoach industry may be able to spread out replacement of many engines until the technology has been more clearly demonstrated agriculture number of agricultural organizations have expressed concerns about the impact on farmers and their capacity to produce if fuel supply disruptions occur as result of the new rule it should be noted that offroad equipment and fuel including farm equipment are exempt from the rule which addresses highway fuel and trucks only but offroad use of diesel fuel is relatively small compared to highway use of total diesel fuel consumption about 15 is offroad vs 85 on so some have suggested that highway fuel may be used for offroad purposes in rural areas where it simplifies distribution of diesel fuel to do so77 agricultural organizations have raised two possibilities 1 that changes in the price of diesel fuel have the potential to affect farm production costs and 2 that potential disruptions in the distribution system serving farmers could have significant structural impact on petroleum cooperatives other offfarm impacts could affect agricultural production costs if fuel price increases cause changes in transportation costs energy costs in us agriculture represent higher proportion of total costs than in many other major sectors such as manufacturing78 according to the us departmen t of agriculture usda agricultural production in the united states relies heavily on technologies that require energy inputs in relatively expensive forms such as electricity and petroleumbased fuels in addition many experts believe that the impact of fuel price increases is potentially greater in agriculture than in other sectors given its limited capacity for switching to alternative energy sources in the short run79 recent estimates by usda showed that 43 of total farm expenditures came from energy consumption in 2000 up from 38 in 1999 us farmers energy costs were forecast by usda to be 77 billion in 2000 of which 36 28 billion will be for diesel fuel80 despite sizeable energy expenditures in the farm sector the usdas economic research

2000overall rate of inflation only slightly and usually mean very modest gains in food costs81 calculations by crs of the impact of increasing onfarm fuel costs ie diesel only on production costs support ers conclusion for instance using usda figures it appears that 3 5 increase in the price of diesel would increase agricultural fuel costs by 84 million nationwide and push the price of production up by about 005 similarly 9 15 increase in diesel price translates into an estimated nationwide fuel cost increase of 252 million and thus increases production costs by 01482 the other major concern raised by agricultural organizations is the potential effect of the diesel rule on farm cooperatives since the 1930s cooperatives have provided the fuel supplies needed by sizable proportion of us farmers in 1993 the last year when usda study collected these data cooperatives provided 37 of diesel fuel sold to farmers in the united states83 today the situation seems little changed according to cooperatives spokespersons cooperatives account for about 40 of all the onfarm fuel used in the united states even though they represent less than 2 of petroleum refining industry capacity similarly farmer cooperatives supply much of the highway diesel and home heating oil needs in rural america according to these sources according to industry sources cooperative diesel sales are strongest in the corn belt and the great lakes states 40 and weakest in the southeast and the delta region 1284 cooperatives maintain that epas new diesel sulfur requirements could 1 induce supply disruptions or price spikes by reducing diesel production capacity in established coop distribution channels 2 force cooperative and other small refiners to produce costly ultralow sulfur diesel fuel for farm and other offhighway uses which are not required to use it this assumes that rather than produce two grades of fuel the coops would produce fuel that meets the more stringent standard and

500 ppm and 15 ppm spokespersons for the petroleum coops state that the local coops and farmers fuel retail businesses cannot afford to add thousands of new tanks and pumps to accommodate two fuels temporarily in addition petroleum coops have an extensive network of pipelines and distribution terminals that would have to be renovated to accommodate two fuel grades as noted the final rule will allow two fuel grades in the 20062010 transition period but there is requirement that distributor terminal or retailer offer both grades that the date for petroleum coops and other small producers to achieve compliance with epa lowsulfur rules on diesel and gasoline be extended from 2006 to 2010 the final rule does provide that small refiner may continue to produce and sell diesel fuel meeting the current 500 ppm sulfur standard until june 1 2010 provided that it reasonably ensures the existence of sufficient volumes of 15 ppm fuel in the marketing areas that it serves87 coops state that this

sulfur diesel timing of the new standards as epa worked to finalize the new standards in the fall of 2000 several concerns were expressed regarding the timing of the new heavyduty engine and diesel sulfur standards some stakeholders believed that epa was in rush to finalize the rules before the end of 2000 they argued that the agency should take more time to further analyze the feasibility and cost of the proposed rules these concerns were magnified by the nature of the proposal both the degree of emission reduction and the role to be played by yettobedemonstrated technology are larger in this regulation than in many other epa rules whether the rule was rushed is difficult to judge on objective criteria while the specifics of the proposal were not finalized until early 2000 epa and the engine manufacturers have been engaged in discussions regarding the need for additional regulations since at least 199590 these discussions did not at first envision the level of emission reductions eventually proposed but the need to obtain greater emission reductions driven by air quality considerations and advances in available technology appear to have combined to produce stricter epa proposal than initially envisioned another factor in the discussion of the rules timing was that under the agencys schedule the decision was finalized in the last days of the clinton administration failure to promulgate the rule before new administration took office might have caused substantial delay resulting in less lead time for industry compliance or delay in the date of implementation on the other hand the bush administration did review the regulation even though it was already promulgated the review did not lead to changes however on february 28 2001 epa administrator whitman announced that the administration had determined that implementation would not be delayed91 as noted previously if the availability and ultimate cost of the technology are the main concerns one way of addressing them might have been through formal technology review at some point after promulgation but before major investment decisions must be made in its diesel proposal epa asked for comments on

that would have directed the national academy of sciences to study the feasibility and costeffectiveness of epas proposed diesel rule and issue final report by june 2001 the amendment would have required epa to take public comment on the nas study before finalizing or implementing rule the amendment was not adopted ultimately congress has the ability not only under appropriations measures but also under the congressional review act to disapprove epa regulatory measures if congressional dissatisfaction with the final rule were sufficiently strong there would be number of legislative options available for addressing those concerns that does not appear to be the case at present nevertheless there remains some uncertainty regarding the new regulations in part because the rule is now the subject of lawsuit filed by the national petrochemical refiners association february 2 200195 this uncertainty coupled with the wide range of potential impacts from the rule may fuel continued congressional interest in the 107th congress
