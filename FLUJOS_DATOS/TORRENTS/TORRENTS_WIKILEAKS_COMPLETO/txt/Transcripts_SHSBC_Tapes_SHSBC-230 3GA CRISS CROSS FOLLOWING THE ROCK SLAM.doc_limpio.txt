3ga criss cross following the rock slam lecture given on 23 october 1962 okay here we are this is the second lecture saint hill special briefing course 23 october ad 12 and continuing 3ga criss cross as she is cooked and the recipe and the subtitle of this lecture is following the rock slam the tips which were put out on rock slams earlier apply in 3ga criss cross and you will find that the preclear interest follows the rock slam if you can keep the rock slam you can keep the pcs interest when you lose the rock slam youve lost the pcs interest now the cognitions follow the rock slam weve often wondered back through the antediluvian periods of dianetics and scientology how come mr cognited and mr b didnt cognite and how come mr b sat there through 275 hours of auditing without single cognition well thats because you never came near any rock slams on him we used to try to get rid of rock slams now we try to preserve them in photography if you will look at the modern manuals of photography put out as the great pictures of the year you know like the german annuals and all that sort of thing you will see in it that all of the bad features of the photography of ten years ago and the things that were condemned in the best photographic salons have now becomebecome the artistic thing to do today in other words they used to think grain was terrible and now grain is wonderful and they used to think that outoffocusness was awful and now they think it is just the cake now that is process of being overwhelmed by that which you cant whip now you might say its almost the same thing today with rock slams just year ago occasionally you would hear halfangry authoritative auditing voice in session saying floor floor floor floor trying to turn off the condemned rock slam so he could get on with the game you see not any more if i hear anybody using floor floor floor to turn off dirty needle or rock slam during an assessment and so forth why i will conclude that he doesnt know how to get in mid ruds and is trying to get the pc loss because thats all thats going to happen now rock slam when it turns on suddenly and inexplicably in the middle of doing something else is still great embarrassment but you had better find out what turned it on and why pc on the rock slam channel while hes following the rock slam very nicely and youre doing everything to get him to follow the rock slam has tiny withhold the tiny withhold if its in the direction of the rock slam object of course is just the rock slam reactivated by the withhold and this makes life more complicated because it gives us this interesting fact that while youre doing list and finding the last items on the list the pc can have withhold on certain item which will make it look like it is in when it is not the rock slam is occurring on the pcs withhold or invalidation or protest and not on the item oh isnt that grim well thats justmakes life more interesting doesnt it thats hurdle this can actually occur particularly on pc who incipiently slams on auditors he just has this one little slight withhold youre going down this list everything is fine and maybe the list is total blank maybe theres nothing on this list nothing nothing to be found anywhere its not going anyplace and you get down to the last three items and one of them is cadaver and while you read cadaver the last time through the pc invalidated your auditing now you read cadaver again and it rock slams beautifully makes life more interesting doesnt it well it merely gives us some of the reasons why you do what you do and the answer to that of course is you get list down to the last three or four items and then you take the remaining items out not by elimination but by tiger drill you got that you dont eliminate the last three simply by calling them off with commit overts and that sort of thing you take the last three and you tiger drill them and then you test them with would it commit overts against or some such thing and then you will see whether or not it is actually rock slamming not because the pc has withhold on that item do you understand that now because there are so many liabilities in this business there are certain textbook formulas now these textbook formulas will prevent you from making 98 percent of your mistakes thats not choosing whether you oppterm or represent they wont totally eliminate that but theyll eliminate 98 percent of your mistakes now i said 98 percent lf you followed them perfectly they would eliminate 98 percent and then the other 2 percent will just come swinging in from mars on an unpredicted wavelength so youve still got to audit alertly in doing 3ga criss cross then the byword and password is be alert and be lucky youre going to see some odd things happen to pc and if you dont catch the brass ring when you see them and do something about it youre going to be out of luck so its very nervy experience and theres substitute for experience its nerveracking therefore there are certain textbook activities go on in this particular procedure such asi got caught with this one the other night and ceased to be cocky about it 100 percent took all the wind out of my sails after all ive argued with people about not completing 3d criss cross lists after all of the enamel chipping and jaw chomping that i have done on the subject so help i didnt get list complete isnt that ooowww that should happen and i didnt get list complete and at the end of the session picked up the fact as missed withhold and having worked all that session to undo all of the mess which was constantly occurring seedirty needle and everything else occurring on this thingi finally find out where it comes from list wasnt complete well i hadnt even really been careful to complete that list so i actually earned exactly what i got it looked complete it was apparently complete by test but i didnt test it very hard so i sighed and i said the next time i do this i will be guided by 3d criss cross rules of complete list now we can actually increase and improve those rules today so the rules of listing actually go as follows you list everything the pc can give you easily and when he tells you thats it on list you dont keep chanting the auditing command at him because some pcs will go on an automatic you know of answering the auditing command every time its asked did you realize that you see youre not doing prepchecking now thats the first habit youve got to get out of in listing youre not prepchecking youre not sitting there waiting for the pc to say thats the last one you understand and if you ask the question every time every time every time some pcs just go on an automaticity of answering the question they havent got any more items but they just keep answering it because its being asked do you see that so you will find yourself occasionally shutting the pc off just letting him run down rather than get some overbearingly long and meaningless list some pcs want the list 495 items every time you ask them one question well that is unbearably embarrassing i consider complete list in this business of somewhere around eighty ninety items but that that wont hold good for all pcs but i can tell when pc is endlessly and arduously listing and theyre going to list it all and so forth well in such pc i would tend to repeat the command less often id sort of start omitting the command and the pc would eventually say what was the command and i would say well all right good good thats fine thats fine now lets make test out of this just ignore the whole invitation to go on with this automaticity dont you see but youve got to have complete list so there is rule that you can underscore youve got to complete the list but that doesnt mean an endless list done by the pc it simply means list that has discharged the charge theres phenomenon occurring here that if you list anything the pc will have less charge on it now there is also danger here you cannot go ahead and just list at random you can list on the rock slam or near the rock slam with complete impunity because youre listing on the goals channel you understand that but just taking off from nowhere or from an arbitrary point that has nothing to do with anything and permitting the pc to list long time on it is exactly the same as wrong goal and every phenomenon that occurs in listing wrong goal is liable to occur in listing four or five hundred items with rock slam from rock slam item and then four or five hundred items from another rock slam item you know rock slam thisno rock slam item has occurred you know and the next thing you know your pc stargoing to start going sen and wog and that sort of thing so you have to keep some control of this listing the whole operation consists of taking something on which the pc is likely to have overts against and making list of it and out of this developing rock slam and then taking that list by assessment and finding the one item on it which really contained the rock slam now the oddities are that you can make list of things the pc is likely to have overts against you can null that list and pick out the item and will find that the rock slam has settled on one thing if its complete but if its incomplete of course the thing thats least likely to be on an incomplete list is the item you understand because list completes rapidly after the item is put on it so an incomplete list is less likely to have the item you understand thatwhy now finding this item we have something against which the pc has overts similarly we could have something which was terminal with which the pc has committed overts now why overts well the whole phenomena of rock slam and meter behavior is based on the overtwithhold sequence and rock slam is the result ofas meter representationis the result of innumerable committed overts in certain direction and when youve got that certain direction isolated that is to say the items against which the overts are committed isolated you then have of course rock slam and therell be one thing that he has more overts on than others now if he gave you list of eighty which is pretty close to right if he gave you list of eighty he will actually have committed overts on all eighty but the reason hes committed overts on all eighty is aaa hes identified them with one thing that he really commits overts on and these are all of its cousins and sisters and brothers and aunts you see the odd part of it is is getting list of that character at all but he of course isnt inventing these things hes just dealing them off the bank now this whole thing is an interesting activity of doing clearingyou should look at it as to what it isit is clearing without having found the goal now itll take you an awful long time to do it and it is notit is not well located or well centered or anything else but in theory you could go on finding these and finding these and finding these and finding these and at the end of few hundred hours you would have found all of them and your pc would have been sitting there clear and then he tells you what his goal is you see so what youre doing is kind of swindle here you see youre actually finding the items before you find the goal see now in routine 3 youre supposed to find the goal and then find the items well why does this make such difference to the pc actually why doesnt he find his goal in the first place thats because hes got so many overts and so many withholds that he himself doesnt know what it is doesnt dare confront what it is has lessened the overt so thoroughly and has then withheld it even from himself to such an extent that he cant even tell you what his goal is so this is the basic mechanism of how the pcs goal gets obscured in the first place it gets overlaid with heavily charged items that the pc has used to commit overts with and things on which the pc has committed overts the symbol of the rock slam is overt now of course as every overt or confusion is followed by stills so the overt is followed by the withhold so you could actually do this by withholds you could do dynamic assessment by withholds you understand but stills dont run well out of the bank this would be much less reliable but it still furnishes you test after youve found the overt you can ask the pc what he wouldnt give it and youll get the slam back see because the slam was held in place by the overt see the slam is still residual as the withhold even though youve gotten rid of the overt dont you see so you can still pull this trick as test trick you understand lets say weve run all the slam off the bank against waterbucks with overts you know consider committing overts aagainst waterbucks slamslamslam slamslamslamslamproven good reliable item it all goes up in smoke we dont know anything more about it its disappeared and thats that we could still get it to slam again by saying what wouldnt you give waterbuck and of course thats what would you withhold from waterbuck you see and itll go slamslamslamslamslam but if you ask it very much of course it all blows up in smoke because theres powder under it now see that one will wear right out but you can at least see that it did slam at some time or another on overts this will be useful to you some time when trying to recover from some hpas attempt to do 3ga criss cross who has run off the slam it gives you nightmares sometimes its very hard to recover the entrances to slams when they are discharged all rightmeans someday well have central division central division of some kind or another of what was my item you know and all goals and items and everything else when found are registered there at the central division dont you see and in extremis why you can always cable it and get the pcs reliable items anyway such doesnt exist now so youre left on your own now the mechanism here then is the pc has lived and being terminal has committed overts against oppterm b the effort then merely consists of locating the cousins sisters and aunts or character of oppterm b then listing this thing down in order to recover slam because of course while being and committing overts on b he will produce on the meter the rock slam and oddly enough you can find by just askingthat is the terminalby just asking if it would commit overts and it will slam you dont even really have to have against anything see now would you commit overts lets say the terminal is waterbuck and the oppterm tigerwould you commit overts against tiger slamslamslamslamslam if the tigers reliable item you see all right thats fine thank you now would waterbuck commit overts slam slamslamslam you see so therefore terminal will slam as well as an oppterm its just how you word it you must realize that the terminal commits the overt and the oppterm receives them therefore that will always give you the proper direction for your wording now this is an interesting action then because it goes down through some part of the gpm actually if carried on to hundreds and hundreds of items you recognize that just speaking loosely as far as items are concerned that pcs list ten fifteen thousand items to go clear you realize that so supposing that every 100 of those 15000 items contained key item that was really built in terminal or oppterm see thats 15000 that gives you 150 items to find on the pc to make him go clear and in view of the fact that youre going to be wrong at least 25 percent of the time matter how lucky you are that means you will actually be running up the bank at something on the order of about 200 items lot of them meaningless you see and lets suppose youre an old slowpoke and it takes you two hours why your whole clearing activity then boils down to something on the order of 400 hours see thats far too much and its only theoretical that you could go the whole way you understand that because after the slam is gone you might not find yourself going anyplace at all and then youd have to shift gears and go by cognition and youd have to go by needle manifestations and little tiny slams and youd work your way through this thing most arduously so therefore you make far more mistakes in the last half of the clearing than in the first half so id say maybe you got about five hundred six hundred hours to clear going at it in this way but recognize it as clearing procedure now guy got all messed up because he had goal see he wanted to do something somebody has already written in and said to well now look if the pcs goal is this important shouldnt you look just little bit earlier ron and find the assertion now im give you an idea of what i mean to catch catfish now little bit earlier he must have had to assume that there were catfish to be caught and therefore you find the assertion that there are catfish and therefore it would clear the pc much faster well thats perfectly valid thinkingas long as you just think about it thats perfectly valid and im very glad that somebody was thinking about it at all but of course thats the second goal hes talking about so hes asking why dont you find the second goal before you find the first goal well if he knew how much sweat it was on most pcs just to find the first goal he wouldnt be worried about finding the second goal before you found the first one because thats impossible the second goal is totally detached from the third goal and the third goal totally detached from the fourth goal but the truth of the matter is they tend to be solutions one to next its quite interesting second goal set up problems which the first goalyou know i mean were speaking now of the first goal we findis solution to to catch catfish well its some kind of solution second goal is to make too much of everything see and it happens that its terminal its chief terminal is catfish so he gets down the track while and he all of sudden has this brilliant inspiration the way to remedy it all is to catch catfish hehheh that will solve the problem set up you see on his earlier goal they arent actually connected and they will blow separately which is the most marvelous thing about clearing that i know of they will take separate stance and they do blow separately and so forth but nevertheless i have noticed that the second goal is solved by the first goal youll find and so on now this piece of bank started up by to catch catfish resulted in the fellow being something that would catch catfish and having assumed that identity went about his business happily catching catfish until he ran into an oppterm which said thou must not catch catfish of course you say well catfish is enough of an oppterm that sort of generally runs through the whole thing and catfish arent going to be solved totally by that goal but he gets to game warden and the game warden says you mustnt catch catfish see so weve got pcfisherman game warden see is the oppterm all right now thats all dandy but he goes into some kind of aan avoidance there of game warden so county commissioner appoints game warden dont you see so he gets the idea that he had better be politician see and that sort of gets him around this oppterm and youll get by these devious things and so forth and then he finds out that economics inhibit the catching of catfish because the tackle is very expensive you know i mean all kinds of wild things happen so he picks up additional oppterms and additional terminals and hes still going on this goals line but hes becoming different things opposing different things and different things are opposing him see and so you get this horrible muddle of little black balls which you call the gpm all right now as this dance continues you recognize that its full of overts hes getting motivators like crazy as terminal you see and hes passing out overts like mad while being this terminal against other specialized and selected terminals and the meter manifestation of all this activity is rock slam so all youve got to do is follow the rock slam and you wind up with the later day things thatyou know you wont wind up with the fundamentals youll wind up with the later day things you know like world conqueror you see that was the ultimate of politician you know and nut house is the oppterm because every time he says he wants to conquer the world they tell him theyre going to put him in the nut house dont you see and its very funny you look back on the item track of the pcafter you have cleared himand it all makes sense everything makes sense it looks completely idiotic though to you perhaps while you are finding items but they all make sense and they are oppterms and they are terminals of course the time were doing this on most pcs we dont know what the pcs goal is but these things are so stacked on it that we cant find the pcs goal easily the saving of time amounts to this the pcs goal we find it well some body sits down and he says whats your goal and he writes down five goals and one of them rocket reads and it goes bang and hes got the pcs goal and its all set and so he gets prehav level and hes going to list the whole thing and he gets down there and he says now who or what would want to catch catfish and the pc says hrrmm and it rock slams hrmm and so on i get so on he says soandso and soandso and soandso and rock slams pretty bad tone arm starts up and gets up and gets up and there it is 50 its just sitting at 50 you found his goal but the tone arm is now sitting at 50 what do you do about this just 3ga criss cross you dont even have to find out you see what hes stuck on that made him go up to 50 youve just got to find an item that rock slams dont you see and then you will take the weight off the bank and then because the weight is so great his overts are so great in that direction he dare not confront in that direction anymore so he runs into this section of the bank and he says oh theres nothing there hahaha lessens the overt see aha game wardens hahahaha oh yeah game warden well theyre pretty unreal to actually game war dens really arent part of existence and i prefer not to associate with game warden anyway and theres sense in putting that own on the list so he starts dealing off old items you know its treadmill he never deals you this item and his tone arm responses go up to 45 50 stick everything looked very mucky and muddy well he couldnt confront it see you found his goal but youve got asuch thoroughly burdened bank that the pc cant run it and youll find that more than often is the case so the safe way to do it is not to spend endless hours prepchecking goals but find an item or two or three and then check the goal again find the goal any way you want to do you see how that would be you can take enough weight off of this rock slam you can take enough charge off of his overts so that he can confront what he has overts on and then find out what he is while hes confronting overts against and therefore he can list you see the track hes trying to list through you see the game hes trying to list through the complexities of it all all right now as we enter the case on some cases well find the goal more easily than we will find the item when the goal isnt real then neither are items but thats beside the point we arrive at the toughest end of 3ga criss cross which is its beginning now oddly enough the toughest end of every case is its beginning and the toughest end of any procedure is its beginning and this is very sad because at that end of the game we of course know the least about the pc the toughest part of auditing should be down toward the end of the intensive wouldnt you agree it never is its right there in the first session see the pc has to be in the best possible condition to handle this but we find him at this stage of the beginning you see in the worst possible condition casewise to handle it and all this is very unfair because it makes the auditors job much tougher ease of course should always be clear before you start auditing him well turning on the rock slam is the first difficulty that you will run into in 3ga criss cross now in some eases this is deadeasy you give them see check rock slamming see check and they just drop it in your laps the thing is slamming like mad and one of the things you used on the see check was it well youve got your first item and you just do what you do with it and carry on and there you are thats easy some other ease you sit there and you try this and you try that and you try something else and theres rock slams now there is method which will undoubtedly be espoused by the american psychiatric associationafter it goes nuts and is dealing in one of its spinbins and trying to clear itself will of course for the auditor to beat the pc often enough and long enough for the pc to develop rock slam on the auditor but this is not advised because all its going to do is wind up as its basicbasic with the first session and you were there anyway so you might as well not take that excursion at all the thing to do is to get the pc insession that is your first action because if this pc is suppressing like mad and throwing his rudiments out like mad youre never going to see rock slam its going to start to turn on its going to turn off the pc is going to suppress before anything occurs because rock slam can suppress out of existence careful of can turn off rock slam and particularly protest protest i have found is very hot button on rock slams you get off the protest and then you get off the careful of and then you get off the suppress and you usually have your rock slam back but protest is very vital in turning off rock slams now how do you turn it all on well the first thing get the pc in session the next thing there could be many steps and are several different methods the easiest pc would be one that you simply say list the dynamics or parts of existence he does you assess it and youve got your first rock slam next type of pc next grade up who or what have you detested they give you list it rock slams youve got one of the persons there and youve simply got your first item and you go on and use it another pc not quite as easy as this isyou sneak up on him byget whatwhat do you wish hadnt been part of existence or some such phrase and then get what isnt part of existence and he gives you long dissertation on what isnt part of existence you get long list one of those items rock slams like crazy youre in and youve got your first item now lets take slightly upgraded pc from this and lets get what would you prefer not to associate with or what wouldnt you want to associate with that is another entrance point and you make list of these things the pc wouldnt care to associate with and you will find there your rock slam at the final end of this now there are undoubtedly other approaches to this we do not know them at this particular time there are undoubtedly gradients that carry us in further on this particular road but those are the various approaches that you can use to turn on rock slam on pc straight from scratch now how do we write this list that might take up little bit of interest here we sit down we put the pc insession weve got the pc well insession well under the auditors control we take piece of legal length paperthats 13 inch by 8 or something like this 13inchlong paper and we write the list in single column is usually best gives you lots of latitude some people who write very small can get two columns on the page with the greatest of ease but if it gets too scrimpy and too small why the auditor starts having trouble and the next auditor that picks it up could shoot the last auditor that did it if hes having to renull something so actually leave some space for things to happen all right so you write it like this you write the pcs name you write the date and you write the question that youre asking the pc to get this list now that is vital because if anybody including you is ever going to make sense out of whats been going on with this pc youre going to need those data youre going to need the date the pcs name we dont care who the auditor is we cant read it and we still know who you are i mean were getting to be terrific deciphering calligraphers or something like that in scientology man you talk about cryptography well be getting orders in here any minute from the royal navy to decipher the japanese codes were getting good you know i mean good youd think so if you could look at some of these lists its all written in arabic anyway you write those data now when you turn the page over of course to write on the back side of itand its perfectly good and you should use the back side of that page its of course pure idiocy to repeat the question and the pcs name and the date but how about page 3 so you dont write anything on the back of page 1 but you do write the figure 3 and the question that gives you consecutive series for page 3 dont you see and you somebody can see that 3 and they know theres missing first page then they can find all the brutal data from the first page dont you see because in the speed of writing up things you dont want to delay too much but its very easy to write 3 and the question isnt it then you can add it up because you know theres page there well supposing it goes over to another list of course you go on the back of this list you dont write anything on the back of this list now you go to 5 dont you and on 5 youd better write the question again that makes all these lists join up beautifully you dont number 2 you dont number 4 dont you see you dont date those things and so on because that just holds up the pc you get how that system works i think youll find thats very serviceable your lists actually seldom go beyond page 5 if youre doing any kind of job of watching what the score is at all and you keep repeating the question to some pcs and the pcs will keep on giving it to you and then on some pcs you will get two or three hundred list to make it complete list and all that sort of thing all thats allowed for now when you null this list your administration should actually to keep you from making mistakes as youre flying along the line your administration should be multiple color and the best way to handle this is the first time you go down the column just to use the pen that you wrote the thing with ive been using various versions of this and how easy it is or is not to spot and this is the one i have been using lately and find its working very well i also have to work out administration while im doing these various things because you see other people read these lists besides you and if we dont standardize then the next auditor cant make head nor tails out of what went on all right now you see its important that there be next auditors particularly if youre finding goals and somebody else is listing the goal this character will want to know what cooked here because he may have to take off in the middle of something and do something about it dont you see or some other goals finder may have to pick this thing up and hell want to know what went on see and you may have left it at dead end or something and then listed the goals against your last reliable item but that wasnt good enough to carry the listing through they want to find some more items theyve got the guys goal but theyve got to find some more items well theyd certainly better know where it all ought to stop dont you see well you put slant marks just the plain slant mark for everything that is in in the color pencil that you wrote the list with and then everything that is out you put an x your next time through grab red ballpoint you actually could carry it on through with red ballpoint the second time through if its out you put full x that leaves you there with things that are still in glaringly apparent dont you see and it also by the timeyoull find out by the time youve got two or three slants or cross to well three slants and cross after several items on pageit gets very hard to pick out if there are any still there and you know weve had some cases bog down in the past with 3d criss cross just because the auditor didnt follow this very stupid point theytheretheres two items in on this sheet that are still in and the auditor never nulled them and the whole thing went blooey and he couldnt find the goal and it all went up in smoke and then mary sued go over the thing again and theres two in it was one of those see he just missed it completely it was sitting in the middle of the page so this color code systems pretty good i havent ever bothered to carry it on into greenflash system after it but you could now how do you call list thats your most interesting thing ive given you the headings of these listsprefer not to associate with all those these other headings of one kind or another you ask the pc to list these things well you actually just ask the question and he gives you flock of answers and you ask the question again or he wants you to ask the question again and you do and he gives you some more answers and then the needleyoure watching it all the time now the best way to handle this on meter is to pull your sensitivity down pull your sensitivity down so that you dont have to be adjusting this tone arm all the time you got the idea you dont pull it down to one or anything crazy like that but you justyou just bring it down thatd be very important to you when you get to mark v it just flies around so doggone much that you have to put it on lower sensitivity than you would use to null dont you see and remember then your rock slam wont be so big so you sit there with one thumb on the thing and your other hand wrapped around the pencil writing this list keeping that thing in center and watching the moment before the pc says it watching the meter the moment before the pc says it see if there was slam you understand and every time you write down an item you put after it if it slammed rs and if its just little dirty needle turned on with itjust went bzzbzzyou write dn and if the pc volunteers that he had some pain on ityoure not terribly interested in this but if the pc volunteers he had some pain on an item or sensation on an item whyyou dont pester the pc for that data while hes listing by the way i see some of you have been just write it pn and sen youre much more interested in the aggregate pain and sen of the whole list or sudden pain or sensation that turned on the pc all of sudden is going whhhh and you say whats the matter well my legs just from the waist down arejust went hot as fire you say well when did they go hot as fire and try to trace it back up the list to what item turned it on and then mark it over here as very likely item because the somatic is one of your indicators got it pc tells you theyretheyretheyre uncomfortableyou ask the pc and they say they aretrace it back to where it turned on thats good procedure you dont go nulling back there you just say all right when and the pc will eventually tell you and remember the pc nearly always tells you one or two late see its onits on itemits on item 83 on your listyou dont number these items by the wayand actually the pc says it turned on on item 83 that was when he noticed it it might also have been 82 or 80 dont you see so you kind of watch that closely he gives you an indicator sometimes on dynamic assessment somatic will turn onor sensation more likely sensationwill turn on so shatteringly when you hit the dynamic that there isnt any thought of going on with the session the pc is practically booted out of his chair dont you see and youd just better take care of that right now youd better listen to the pc about it and youd better hear about this and youd better hear how it turned on and youd better mark it down very adequately on your report and you persuade the pc now without invalidating this item or abandoning it or anything like that of coursehave to null the rest of the listis that all right with you and you go on and null the rest of the list and then cope with it afterwards do you understand but every once in while when youve got an item bang youhe thinks the roof fell in and thats terrific indicator it almost always is the item all right now just your administration of this should be fairly neat and somebody should be able to read these lists but how do you call this list off all right if it is an oppterm list its consider committing overts against or to shorten it up overts on uh consider committing overts on now thats mouthful but youre not going to be able to get away with it i made several tests of just calling it off all by itself and i found out that i missed the boat when i did that on oppterms so oppterms are always called with consider committing overts against or think of doing bad things to you could also say would you do bad things to or would you commit overts on or would you commit it overts against its what registers with this pc what makes sense so theres variations of this but they all carry the connotation of consider committing overts against because its the overts against that are going to turn on the slams now youve got checkpoint consider withholding things from and youre going to get the same responses on your assessment but its not going to discharge it as well you understand once consider committing overts against is all worn out on this item you can always say think of withholding things from and youll get the slam back see theyre both sides of the same coin you see that all right so an oppterm list is always called in this particular way now terminals lista terminals list can be called directly or very involvedly it can simplyyou just call it you know waterbuck tiger cat dog fire warden see and register the instant reads thats terminals list you just go bark bark bark bark bark down the line because it gets very involved to say would awhatever your item is on the listcommit overts against tiger because nearly every one of them turns on slam how do you pick slam out of all those slams because one of the characteristics of slams is they are persistent you understand now one of the best ways to sort this thing out so it doesnt slam is to put the terminal its against if youre repeating that terminal every time before the sentence on tigers would waterbucks commit overts on tigers would fire wardens commit overts see thats if youre calling the whole sentence youll find thats one of the most desirable phrasings because you get rid of the tigers rock slam and then you just pick up general rock slam that turns on either with the item itself or overts against but overts itself occasionally slams so picking your way through it is quite interesting but fortunately with your meter turned up to very high sensitivity you can read them once and take any instant read on terminal you cannot do this for an oppterm terminals list can just be bark bark bark bark bark once each you understand now consider committing overts against you see any such phrasing as this can also be read just once if youre an old sharpie on the meter now if youre not sure for gods sakes dont fake it just read it again now do you tell the pc if its in or out you dont the more words you can get the hell out of auditing kick them out now would waterbuck commit overts against tiger thank you would waterbuck commit overts against tiger thank you would waterbuck commit overts against tiger thank you that is out how long did it take to say that shocking length of time multiply it by 80 and youll see why it takes you week and half to find an item see all right weve got an oppterm list see its got tiger on it and right after tiger why its got carnivore we say consider committing overts against tiger consider committing overts against carnivore wheres the thats in wheres the thank you well the hell with it pcs got all the thankyous he needs how does he know if its in or out wont that develop you dirty needle well after while hell get bright enough to find out that your pencil goes flickflick when its out and flick when its in they smarten up quick in other words you can read them once theres thank you theres thats in thats out were talking about this peculiar type of nulling this doesnt alter nulling and doing other things in other departments of the game see this is talking about 3ga criss cross the auditor says bark bark bark bark new one every time you know then all of sudden why consider committing overts against fire warden didnt miss that you know you dont say well im awfully sorry pc iheyi im awfully sorrycome out of your boiloffim awfully sorry that i missed that iii think i should havehavehave watched the meter more closely and if its all right with you id better run some havingness first all right im run some havingness on him see thats not the way you do it at all see you say consider committing overts against fire warden didnt read it see you didnt read it but you dont say anything at all you just say consider committing overts against fire warden consider committing overts against fire warden thats all you didnt get it the first time so you read it twice pc knows youre reading it twice and going to read it again because hehis mind very rapidly gets educated to the fact that you dont go slantslant see he hears your ballpoint go scrape scrape slash you got the idea well thats how you pick it up to an hour and ten minutes to list and find the item see now that requires very very reliable meter reading because you miss the key one and youve had it you shouldnt have gotten out of bed that allat all that morning because the pc now has missed withhold and the pc has this and the pc has that and everything has gone to hell in balloon now the upshot of all this auditing culminates in reliable item reliable item that can be an oppterm or terminal and that meant one that slams when you found it it slams in the same session that you found it it doesnt have to slam the next day it reliably slams and that means found you completed the whole nulling and that one slams you completed the whole nulling and that one now slams and that is the proven item that is your last reliable item next day doesnt have to slam never has to slam again to the end of time because of course you discharge the slam off and itll be rapidly transferred onto something else just the moment you start listing youve got to its got to find it that day though see and it had to slam very nicely and then you mark it down there on the report in letters of fire that that item slammed and how wide it slammed and how long it slammed now one that slams just twice is something that the pc and then passed out you cant tiger drill it back on again thats not good enough in the session see because you should be able to get that slam on and off you should be able to regulate that slam with tiger drill you understand you understand that its not enough to have it go slamslam while youre listing and then never slammed again and didnt slam at the end and you call that an item youll be up in soup all the way down the list youve got an item slamming slamming clear to the end youve got items slamming you go over it again you dont have slam in the whole lot and itshuhhh you say what happened nothing happened except the pcs rudiments may be out but the fact of the game is because the pc was saying them while you were listing them put the pc on the other side of the fence and now when youre nulling them you dont get slams back on so dont let it worry you when something doesnt slam again while youre listing only start worrying if it doesnt slam at the end of the activity then you should start worrying slam on the list you understand that you dont have to get slams back what do you expect this list to do just stay preserved in wax till the end of time what do you think was happening while you were listing you were listing slam off it very often puzzles you because you go by rock slam you know it listed it and you marked it rs and you go by nulling it and it doesnt rs theres many an auditor here then spends the next half an hour fooling around trying to get that to rs aw to hell with it dont bother with it so it didnt rs so what make fairly sure your middle rudiments are in and carry on that doesnt mean you get your middle rudiments in just because it didnt rs either you just go sailing down the list youre only interested in rock slam on the last item its the only rock slam youre interested in you want that thing to slam oddly enough you can instant read it all the way through on terminals assessment just calling the item consider overts get down to the last three tiger drill the last three you know on this item soandso has anything been suppressed you know and add protest to your tiger drill and get that all tiger drilled off and then ill say all right would waterbuck commit overts on tiger slamslamslamslamslamslamslamslamslamslam slamslams great do the next two see theres slam in those they just clean up and disappear you gotyouve got your item slamslamslam slam now it stops slamming dont say to the pc what the hell did you do what kind of pc are you anyway what are you doing you know i found out that doesnt pay pc begins to selfaudit if you do it too much the thing for you to do is tiger drill it again and then use big tiger start using big tiger when the pcs pulling tricks on you see not suppress is one of the things not careful you know careful all of sudden you suddenly wake up and realize you arent saying committing overts thats the thing that produces the slam you know you have to say committing overts ah yes well would waterbuck commit overts against tiger slamslam slamslamslamslamslamslamslamslamslamslam thats fine slams went off and came on and go out and you mark it down in your auditors report and you say reliable item in your red pencil in the middle of your blue report you say reliable item tiger there it is underscored never has to slam again to the end of your days or anybody elses and probably wont you understand but youve got the last reliable item now why do you want the last reliable item very simple theres the law of the last reliable item what do you do when youve followed the rock slam to dirty needle and went off the deep end of the cliff and you are now nowhere and the pc is arc broken and disinterested and all life has turned green and gorgeously bilious what do you do you return to the last reliable item and do something else with it second rule is there are two things you can do with an itemyou can oppose one or represent one if you have opposed one the other thing you can do is to represent if you oppose one and dont get slam then you can represent and down to slam in other words if youve done one you now do the other if youve done one with result you now do the other and youll probably get your result now items that are listed on oppose are always reversed you say would waterbuck you know who or what would oppose tiger you know and who or what would tiger oppose you always call them both ways you make two lists treat it as one list when you null it but reverse your consider committing overts command if youre doing it that way or if it is terminals list just call it oneshot you know one item at time on the way down mark any instant read as in in other words you get two lists out of an oppose would waterbuck op in other words wouldwho or what would oppose tiger and who or what would tiger oppose and youll always catch the brass ring in that particular fashion now inertthis is the law on this inert items are represented most of the time and active emanating items are opposed and you wont go very far wrong by doing that if you ask the pc is itpc sometimes doesnt know well do one or the other and youll only be 50 percent of the time wrong you see how this is in other words you represent an inert item something that is not active dumb bunny there is good inert item so you represent dumb bunny supposing you come to the end an ox head all right now you represent an ox head dont you see because its still inert and all of sudden youll find yourself sitting there with an active item so you oppose it got the idea spitting cat oppose get the idea shotgun oppose see and you most of the time youll be right and part of the time youll be wrong what do you do when you go off the deep edge you use the rule of the last reliable item thats very reliable rule the last one that you could really count on you represented and it wound you up nowhere haha go back and oppose it supposing you neither get represent nor oppose off of it and it all goes to hell then you go back to the last reliable item before that got it an item may rock slam and not be accompanied by cognition very doubtful very doubtful youll get sensation on oppterms pain on terms you will get rock slam and cognition in other words the pain or sensation depending on whether its terminal or oppterminal and in addition to that the rock slam and in addition to that pcs interest and cognitions and thats what it takes to make an item if you follow that on down and you either oppose or represent against the rule of whether its inert or emanating youll find yourself following the rock slam and you will do very lot for the pc and eventually you will find that an item you get to rocket reads unless the pc has something against going clear but i will take that up in another lecture thank you very much good night
