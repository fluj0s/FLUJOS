summary the us steel industry has faced in creasing difficulties since the late 1990s about 40 us steel producers have gone in to bankruptcy while different companies and parts of the industry have been affect ed to different degrees the two types of domestic producers of raw steel integrat ed mills and minimills have both supported restrictions on imports which they say have undermined the ability of the us industry to produce steel economically u s policymakers have responded with variety of measures but c ould not prevent new downturn in the domestic industry in late 2000 and 2001 active and retired steelworkers and their union representatives have also become particularly concer ned about the industrys possible inability to continue to fund pension nd health care benefit commitments an issue known as legacy costs already more than 100000 retir ed steelworkers have lost health care benefits which were funded by steel companies that have been liquidated supporters of

their health care benefits because of corporate bankruptcies pensions are guaranteed up to statutory limits by the pension benefit guarantee corporation which acted in 2002 to take over the plans of three of the largest integrated steel producers pressed to act by members of c ongress steel companies and labor representatives president bush in june 2001 requested the us international trade commission itc to undertake new sec tion 201 trade investigation on the steel industry the itc ruled that much of the industry was being injured by increased imports and recommended relie f measures to president bush on march 5 2002 the president decided to impose threeyear safe guard tariffs with top rates of 30 the safeguard tariffs were only one element of an administration strategy concerning steel which also included multilateral international negotiations on global overcapacity in the steel industry and future rules for world steel trade meanwhile us trading partners have challenged the section 201 measures under rules of the world trade organization some members of congress economists and representatives of steelconsuming industries have expre ssed concerns that measures to aid the industry are having negative impact on the competitiveness of broad range of us businesses supporters of this view in the 108th congress urged the itc to give consideration to the impact on us steelconsuming industr ies in the review of the effects of president bushs safeguard measures on september 19 2003 the itc produced reports on the effects of the safeguard m easures on both the

american steel industry changing profile since the late 1990s the us steel industry has experienced increasing difficulties much of the industry has b een in serious trouble since the financial crises of 199798 in asia russia and latin america contributed to rise in us steel imports after reactions from the clinton administration and congress imports fell in 1999 and the domestic steel industry staged partial recovery by early 2000 however this recovery was undermined by renewed rise in imports by suddenly slowing domestic us economy and by the big rise in energy prices that affected the energyintensive steel industry in 2000 so commentators also say that there are still too many older inefficient steel mills that are not competitive with newer more productive plants here and abroad and that contracted wage nd benefit costs have been obstacles to restructuring consolidation and modernization almost 40 steel companies have been in ba nkruptcy at least at some point in this period companies operating under chapte r 11 have included bethlehem steel republic engineering wheeling pittsburgh weirton steel and national steel all well known as integrated producers ie companies that produce steel from iron ore ltv reportedly the thirdlargest us integrated producer was liquidated under chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code though mo st of its assets are back in operation under new ownership as the in ternational steel group isg geneva steel of utah the only integrated mill west of the rock ies has ceased operating and number of minimills which generally produce steel from re melted scrap have also gone out of business the industry found it difficult to raise the financing necessary for further restructuring and modernization also integrated steel companies have had problems in funding the pension and health care packages to which they agreed for steelworkers and retirees in the 1980s an issue known as legacy costs while us policymakers responded to the problems of the industry with variety of measures the situation in th domestic industry continued to worsen in 2001 under increasing pressure from c ongress industry and labor and after consultations with all three groups pres ident george w bush took action under section 201 of us trade law this allo ws the president to implement temporary trade relief for domestic industry after an independent finding that it has been injured by surging import levels under us law the presidential request went to the us international trade commission itc for an investigation to determine if high import levels are substantial cause of injury to the us industry the itc reported affirmatively that imports are substantially injuring large part of the domestic industry and forwarded recommendations of relief to president bush although criticized by us trading partners the president on march 5 2002 announced series of threeyear remedy tariffs known as safeguard tariffs of up to 30 on selected range of steel products httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31748crs2 1 it has been estimated that exchange rate ch anges affected the price competitiveness of both integrated us steel mills and minimills by between 66 and 164

tons equal to 2000 pounds most continuedthe section 201 action combined with other trade remedy actions under us antidumping and antisubsidy laws decline in operating capacity that squeezed supply and an initial domestic economic recovery may have all contributed to rapid price recovery in the american steel market in the first half of 2002 steel consuming industries some of which had protested the section 201 remedy actions now claim by contrast that higher steel prices have endangered their businesses and are driving their customers to seek fore ign production sources subsequently the price of steel has generally fallen again meanwhile the amer ican steel industry itself has accelerated process of restruct uring and consolidation begun even before the bush safeguard tariffs were in place the balance of this report examines the current situation of the american steel industry it looks at both the domestic structure of the us industry and the international competition including the chan ges brought to the import market by the safeguard tariffs and the impact of the gacy cost issue on industry restructuring overall performance of the us steel industry the asian financial crisis began in thailand in 1997 and quickly spread it dampened demand for steel in that previ ously fastgrowing region and led asian steelmakers to seek markets in the ited states and europe by mid1998 the financial crisis had spread to russia and brazil these countries also sought to maintain steel production in the face of domestic recessions and global oversupply of steel by selling larger share of their output to the united states the result was onethird increase in steel imports in 1998 over imports that were already near record level in 1997 exacerbating the surge was rise in the us dollar exchange rate during that period that made low priced foreignproduced steel even more competitive against us products1 according to the department of commerce study global steel trade structural problems and future solutions the heavy volume of lowcost steel entering the us market drove prices be low levels at which us producers could continue to make steel at profit2 figure 1 shows the evolution of market s upply in the 1990s it indicates the total apparent us consumption of steel finished and semifinished for each year and the share that was provided by im ports apparent domestic

commerce international trade administration testimony of undersecretary robert s larussa befo re the senate and house steel caucus december 12 2000 httpwww itadocgovmedialarussa121200htmsome authors have suggested that steel s problems in part are attributable to older inefficient integrated st eel mills unproductive domestic capacity5 but 1999 report by the itc suggested then that problems of integrated mills provided only partial explanation indeed the same trends for the industry as whole are also apparent in the separate results of both integrated mills and minimills in fact minimills fared even worse than integrated mills from 1997 to 1998 the worse financial performance of minimill producers reflects in part their greater dependence on the merchant market where imports are concentrated6 in any case by mid1998 us companies were losing substantial market share to imports of cheaper foreign steel many previously profitabl domestic steelmakers experienced decline in sales revenue operating income and profit in 1998 and 1999 some small companies experienced loss of access to capital and liquidity problems which forced many companies into bankruptcy7 confronted with these problems us steel companies steelworkers and many members of congress argued that federal support for the steel industry and its workers was necessary in september 1998 the steel industry f iled antidumping ad cases with the itc against hotrolled steel from brazil ja pan and russia and countervailing duty cvd case against brazil8 as the situation worsened in other product areas additional petitions were f iled in response to the import surge and growing congressional concern the clinton ad ministration conducted more than 100 adcvd investigations on steel products number of which were expedited to provide faster relief to industry accordin g to robert larussa then under secretary of commerce for international trade these helped turn back massive import surges seen during the 1998 crisis9 the clinton administration announced steel action program on august 5 1999 which had three main elements 1 vigo rous enforcement of us trade laws including expedited investigations 2 b ilateral efforts to address the underlying problems that led to the crisis including consultations with japan and korea and an agreement with russia to limit steel imports and 3 improved import monitoring mechanisms to detect potential import rges moreover the congress passed andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31748crs5 10 in section 101b of that act congress explicitly linked the surge in imports

steel companies unable to obtain commercial loans at reasonable rates10 despite these measures large parts of the us steel industry have never fully recovered from the 199798 import surge st eel imports initially fell in 1999 as share of us consumption as shown in fi gure 1 however imports rose again in 2000 to 27 50 higher than the averag 18 market penetration of the early 1990s with penetration leve ls at 25 or higher imported steel captured much of the increase in demand for steel that accompanied the strong growth in the us economy in the late 1990s many product areas experienced doubledigit or even tripledigit oneyear import percentage increases in 2000 moreover the increases were registered from wide range of foreign sources11 but there was substantial disagreement between domestic producers nd users over the causes and nature of the problems of the us industry almo st universally us steel producers blame the secondhighest import year on record fo r their late2000 fina ncial losses steel importers disagree saying the problems can be traced to early2000 domestic price increases that made cheaper foreignmade steel more attractive12 domestic steel market growth ended ab ruptly in late 2000 as the manufacturing sector of the economy entered recessiona ry period average steel industry capacity utilization through early august 2001 wa s 79 down about 10 points from the same period in 2000 according to weekly american iron steel institute aisi figures by late october the capacity usage level fell to 6513 capacity usage rates for november and

8 million tons in capacity shut down in december together these developments closed 10 million tons in potential capacity equal to about 10 of total us domestic production in early march 2002 president bush announced his decision to establish safeguard duties of up to 30 on wide range of products as the outcome to the section 201 trade case prices generally rose following these developments by the week ending march 23 2002 the capacity utilization rate increased to 925 the first time it had been above 90 since may 200014 aisi commented the figure is higher in part because there is less capacity overall in operation nevertheless it does reflect some increase in optimism based on improved order books and expectations that the 201 remedy will benefit the

stayed near or above 90 and raw us steel output rose to more than two million short tons per week approximating the 100millionton annual leve l reached in the late 1990s and 2000 but as the year nded both output and capacity utilization began to slip as percentage capacity usage in december 2002 was between 8085 output was back below two million tons per week even though ltvs successor company isg had restarted production16 import tonnage was actually higher in 2002 than in 2001 despite the section 201 safeguard tariffs the total for 2002 wa s 327 million tons compared to just over 30 million in 2001 aisi president andrew sharkey commented that the numbers proved that imports are flowing freely spite the tariffs and that price and supply relationships were stabilizing by contrast david phelps of the american institute for international steel representing importers said that the net increase was solely because of semifinished imports brought in by domestic steel producers themselves otherwise he noted imports were actua lly down by 15 despite higher domestic demand17 in the first half of 2003 steel imports we re clearly down in quantity more than 20 according to commerce department and aisi figures meanwhile domestic production was slightly higher by 4 comp ared to the first half of 2002 due only to an increase in integrated mills produc tion yet while imports substantially declined in quantity the value of imports as reported by the commerce department was only 3 less than in the first half of 200218 in addition to the impact of section 201 trade remedies these developments can be explained by number of factors semifinished steel imports had surged in early 2002 to beat anticipated us trade action once the safeguard was in place such surge did not recur in 2003 which impacted import volume more than value in addition there has been an unexpected prolongation of the period of slow us ec onomic growth and fall in the us dollar exchange rate which made some imports more expensive reflecting this last development also is an increase in us steel exports by nearly 60 in volume terms to an annual rate of more than 9 million tons in the first half of 2003 as they have become more competitive and as dema nd in china particularly has boomed supporters and opponents of the us st eel safeguard tariffs have produced conflicting reports on the impact

threevolume repor t found somewhat mixed results with respect to price effects for the highestvolume categories flat carbon and alloy steel products from both integrated producers and minimills the itc sampled quarterly pricing data for eight products it found in each case that pr ices for domestically produced items were higher in the first quarter of 2003 than in the first quarter of 2002 th last quarter before the imposition of safe guard duties the range was from 23 to almost 30 although in most cases the 2003i price was actually lower than prices in late 2002 moreover in seven of the eight cases th 2003i price was lower than in the second quarter of 200020 this lends credence to the argument of steel producers that even if though the safeguard had raised prices th ey were not restored to earlier levels by contrast steel consumers have argued that domestic producers are trying to restore prices to an unusual spike in prices in early 2000 other carbon and alloy products tended to follow this pa ttern but stainless steel did not tin plate prices we re higher in 2003i than in 2002i and lower than in late 2000 but the total variation was greater than about 10 on base price around 600ton21 three long products now produced almost exclusively at minimills hot rolled bar coldrolled bar and concrete reinforcing bar rebar all followed the pattern but like tin only to limited degree rebar was higher in price in 2003i against 2002i but only by 02 for example22 stainless steel generally has displayed higher levels of import penetrati on while receiving lower levels

report august 2003 p 1 however the blackout was the continuedprices to be eroded by the reorganization and reopening of some shuttered mills more recently as prices stabilized at lower levels in 2003 this industry review expressed some concern about the increas ed buildup of foreign capacity and the ultimate effects on us price levels on the other hand most of the us industry in midyear 2003 was trying to raise prices to counter higher costs specifically because of rising natural gas and steel scrap prices 24 changing structure of the domestic steel industry it seems unlikely that the american industry will disappear even the long beleaguered integrated steel mills but the structure the ownership and the labor organization patterns in the industry are ll changing for example john anton of global insight accurately predicted in 2002 during the bethlehe m and national steel bankruptcies that if either company were driven into liquidation it is highly probable that each mill would quickly resta rt under new ownership there is not enough sheet capacity in the united stat without them and the facilities are attractive if the legacy cost burden is erased through liquidation25 unlike ltv neither bethlehem nor national went into chapter 7 as their operating assets were acquired out of chapter 11 bankruptcy by isg and us steel respectively however while the industry should rvive both changi ng technol ogy and international competition have contributed to tougher and more competitive environment for american steelmaking figure 2 illustrates how the impact of trad and industry problems for steel has not been even across the sector the pr oduction of the large integrated mills using mostly basic oxygen furnaces the last us open hearth plant closed in 1991 hovered around 60 million tons per year in th 1990s then fell substantially below that figure minimills employing electri carc furnaces eafs steadily increased production after the recession of

adcvd laws the role of china in the future of the u s steel industry is primarily an indirect one china has become both the world s largest producer and largest importer of steel fueled by its booming domestic industrial economy in 2002 china produced 182 million mt of steel to lead the world reportedly in production for the seventh straight year estimates are that it will top 200 million mt in production in 2003 but it also imported more than 24 million mt of rolled steel to become the leader in that category as well us total steel imports of nearly 30 million mt in 2002 included about 8

this rapid industrializa tion of china may also ve some negative effects the first is the rapid buildup of new capacity in china plus the maintenance of old capacity which is now outdated and should

this squeezes us producer s between increasing world market prices for inputs which they are not able to pass through because dom estic market demand is still weak for their output64 another indirect effect is that chinas steel consumers are rapidly expanding their manufactured goods output into global as well as domestic markets there are concerns that chinas fixed currency exchange now seriously

institute for interna tional economics note that inte grated steel mills have high fixed costs so that it makes sense for stru ggling steel firms to continue running their plants so long as the marginal revenues from extra production at least cover variable costs economic logic differs somewhat for minimills but while they account for big share of us steel production their share of global

international joint ventures to develop and employ new smelting process to improve the quality of iron ore for steel mills73 steel industry employment and the legacy cost issue the loss of jobs in the steel industry is almost an iconic issue symbolizing declining employment in traditional industrie s as the industry has consistently shed jobs over the past three decades the reasons relate to whole range of issues not just import competition but also productiv ity improvements and changes in the market for steel products figure 5 illustrates the change in employment in the steel industry since 1993 after the united states recovered from the previous recession74 it is based on the industry employment series published by the bureau of labor statistics annual average empl oyment data by industry the first thing to note is that employme nt in the steel industry overall defined as blast furnace and basic steel products sic 331 slowly but steadily declined throughout the 1990s from 240300 employees in 1993 to 223900 employees in 2000 this included oneyear decline of 3400 employees in 2000 the second highest year ever for total domestic steel production the total fall in employment in 1993 2000 was decline of 7 by comparison however the decline was accelerated by the recession that started in 2001 in two years it fell by 16 to 187600 employeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31748crs26 figure 5 steel industry employment moreover the figure shows that the situation is far worse if we just focus on blast furnaces and steel mills sic 3312 leaving out such activities as pipe and tube making which use raw steel made in the hot end of mills between 1993 and 2000 employment at the mills that pr oduce raw steel fell from 175400 to 150700 persons decline of 14 even before the 20012 industry recession in 20012 employment fell by another 18 to 124200 persons altogether 50000 jobs were eliminated in basic steelmaking over the decade number that accounted for nearly all of the net loss of jobs in the steel industry by contrast steel pipe and tubes increased employment by 18 nearly 5000 jobs between 1993 and 2000 then lost about 10 of those jobs in 20012 but ended up with 1400 more jobs in 2002 than in 1993 legacy costs and how they are to be met in any restructuring of the us steel industry to meet international competiti on have colored the political debates over steel issues legacy costs may be defi ned as pension and health care benefit provisions of steel worker contracts whic h provide benefits beyond those that are available through public entitlements nd which are funded by earnings of steel companies these benefits were negotiated especially at unionized integrated steel companies heavily affected by job losses to encourage workers to accept rationalization and pr oductivity improvements that were deemed necessary to keep these companies competitive uswa pr esident leo gerard in may 2003 estimated

interested in maintaining existing operations on an ongoing basis but had interest in supporting large numbers of retir ees the legacy cost issue has been an important one for both current and future be neficiaries of steel industry pension and health care plans and for potential acquiring parties of integrated steel mills suffering financial distress but the latter issue for the largest integrated companies has been resolved by pbgc takeover of some integr ated steel company pension plans under this arrangement retirees may lose their health care benefits but in some cases they will be partially compensated by new trade adjustment assistance taa provisions in the 2002 trade act pl 107210 and s upplemented by provisions negotiated in collective bargaining on new labor agreements76 retirement pensions were already pr otected under federal law the ltv pension plans were taken ove r as of march 31 2002 by the pbgc this move has protected the pensions of 82000 ltv worker s retirees and dependents insofar as they are eligible under pbgc rules pbgc estimates that about half the total 44 billion ltv pension liability was unfunded so the net cost to pbgc was about 22 billion77 pbgc

program requiring urgent atte ntion and possible statutory reform82 comptroller general david walker and kandarian stified on september 4 2003 before the house committee on education and the workforce at hearing to examine this subject walker stated that particular concern was that the pbgc had responsibility for securing pensions in disproportionate number of pension plans in traditional industries such as steel which have been seri ously and adversely affected by international competition the reactions of the companies and the uswa were sharply negative to the national and bethlehe m pension fund takeovers by the pbgc although it was not contested that the pension funds were in solvent and would eventually have to be taken over by the pbgc the companies had apparently hoped to be able to utilize them in covering some legacy costs of laidoff workers as they restructured for bankruptcy reorganization or acquisiti on the timing of the pbgc action was therefore surprise and was heavily criticized by both companies83 leo gerard of the uswa also reacted negatively on th national pension fund takeover he said in this era of unbridled corporate greed we are disappointed but not surprised that the pbgc has acted to limit its own liability rather than to fulfil its mandate to protect the pension benefits of worker s and retirees and in the case of bethlehem he said this pre empts our ability to negotiate with an employer its not the governments business to for ce consolidations through the pbgc84httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31748crs29 85 uswa domestic steelmakers retiree

integrated companies are at competitive disadvantage against domestic companies that do not face legacy costs or foreign manufacturers whose governments already provide health care to steelworkers through national health care plans domestic companies that operate minimills such as nucor have younger work force few retirees and unfunded postretirement obligations85 uswa supported action such as that proposed by members of the senate steel caucus which wrote president bush on february 8 2002 that the total costs to federal state and local govern ments of relief of workers who face reduced pensions and lost health care benefits through bankruptcies mig ht be equal to or greater than government support of industry legacy cost burdens86 but beyond the provisions described bove as part of

original drag on the us economy measured in terms of job loss they find the net impact of the itcs numbers imply net job loss of 12000 though they are certain that the impact is probably high er in the range of 2600043000 jobs note that this may not mean actual jobs lost but loss of overtime re duced hours and other net negative impacts on earnings by workers99 conclusion and outlook since neither the general situation of the economy nor other specific policy measures between 1998 and 2001 resolved di re financial problems within the steel industry president bush was encouraged to adopt safeguard tariff measures provided under section 201 of us trade law some said that under period of temporary protection the industry would hunker down behind tariff walls and conduct business as usual then plead for continued protection when the tariffs were eliminated in three years but this did not happen the minimill side of the us industry whose output now roughly equals that of the older integrated industry has moved aggressively to consolidate and restructure operations after period of delay as it sought an acceptable formula of legacy cost relief the integrated industry has also moved decisively to consolidate ownership an additional question which members of congress encouraged the itc to consider is whether the interests of steel consuming industries are being negatively affected by the section 201 polic the itcs answer was that the net impact of the remedy measures may be ne gative for private sector industry though perhaps not by the order of magnitude ggested in earlier studies supported by steel users the big issues with respect to the shap of industry restructuring may now shift to the international side first the wto dispute settlement panel ruled the administrations use of section 201 as inco mpatible with global trade rules on november 10 2003 the bush administrations appeal against this decision was reportedly rejected by the wto appellate body

withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31748crs33 other significant producers in the forum of the steel committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development these nego tiations have sought to address the elimination of excess steel capacity worldwide as well as governmental subsidies to the steel industries these two problems have been considered by both the bush and the clinton administrations as the root causes of longterm problems in the steel industry can the administration bring back meaningful resolution of these problems through in ternational negotiations
