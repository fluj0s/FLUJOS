policy guidance and requirements for ensuring adequate protection of all department of defense dod special access program sap information that is stored or processed on an information system is an information system is defined as any telecommunications andor comput er related equipment or interc onnected system or subsystems of equipment that is used in the acquisiti on storage manipulation management movement control display switching interchange trans mission or reception of voi ce andor data digital or analog it includes software firmware and hardware the secretary of defense requires all united states government departments and agencies their contractors and allied governments processing sap information to establish implement maintain and abide by the protection measures identified in this manual 1a1 this manual includes 1a1a requirements for an information system security program 1a1b guidance on an approach to risk management for systems 1a1c technical and administrative security requirements for system in given environment and 1a1d examples of appropr iate documentation 1a2 this manual provides guidance to assist designated accrediting authority daa or daa representative described in chapter 2 in determining the appropriate set of technical and nontechnical safeguards for prot ecting the information in given system 1a3 this manual provides guidance to assist an information system security manager issm or information system security officernetwork security officer issonso in structuring and implementing the security protections for system 1b applicability 1b1 this manual applies to all entities that process store or communicate dod sap information including united states gove rnment organizations their commercial contractors and llied governments 1b2 the term information system as defined in this manual makes the distinction between traditional systems eg computers hosts and networks irrelevant to the selection of protection requirements unless noted otherw ise the terms system and information system and is are used intercha ngeably throughout this manual 1b3 traditionally providing security for system has meant protecting the confidentiality of the information on it although for some syst ems protecting data integrity and system and data availability has always been concern while the traditional operational concern over confidentiality of classified information has not diminished integrity and availability have become critical parts of security for all systems the requirements in this manual reflect that understanding introduction for official use only 12 for official use only 1b4 the operational elements of government orga nization have in the past been concerned with and fiscally responsible for ensuring th integrity and availability of the information on the system while this manual describes re quirements for ensuring the integrity and availability of the system and of the information on it nothing in this manual shall be construed to state or imply that there has been transfer of fiscal responsibility to the security elements from the operational elements 1b5 this manual establishes the security requirements for all applicable systems accrediting authorities may establish additional security measures if deemed appropriate any such measures shall comply with the relevant references listed in this manual 1c administration 1c1 the ddcicm has designated the community management staff cms to act in matters pertaining to the administration of this manual for intelligence related issues 1c2 the paa shall be responsible for addressing any unresolved conflicts to this manual and the associated policy as it pertai ns to the individual service 1c3 this manual supersedes chapter 8 of the department of defense overprint to the national industrial security program oper ating manual supplement nispomsup 1d background 1d1 us sap information has three attributes that require protection confidentiality integrity and availability the degree of emphasis on each varies with the type of information processed and the mission of th organization responsible for the data 1d2 this manual recognizes the contributions to security made by operating environments and allows the technical safeguards of system s to be modified accordingly for example while encryption can be an effective way to protect the confidentiality of information during transmission if the information passe s only through areas that are approved for open storage of the information or across protected distribution system within an inspectable space then encryption of the information for that purpose may be unnecessary 1d3 the requirements specified in this manual are based on the assumption that the system is otherwise protected at an ppropriate level for the inform ation processed on it these other protections include ppropriate levels of physi cal personnel communications emanations and technical surveillance counter measures tscm security as required in other directives 1e system information collection the following information must be collected to determine the requirements for operating system 1e1 the category classification and all appli cable security markings for all of the information on or to be put on the system 1e2 the needtoknow status of the users on th system including their formal access approvals clearances and nationalityies for official use only introduction for official use only 13 1e3 the perimeter and boundary of the system 1e4 the operating environment of the system and connecting systems including the service provided eg electronic mail internet ac cess and foreign access to the system connecting systems and the fac ilities housing these systems and 1e5 the technical and administrative secu rity requirements of the system 1f how to use this manual eleven steps are required to accredit an is the following summarizes those steps and in each case refers to the relevant chapter or chapters of this manual 1f1 determine levelsofconcern chapter 3 the daa using formal specifications from the data owner examines the information char acteristics in light of the material in table 31 and determines the appropriate levelofconcern ratings one each for confidentiality integrity and availability the levelofconcern ratings for integrity and availability are each basic medium or high because all of the iss covered by this manual process classified dod sap inform ation the levelofconcern rating for confidentiality is always high in this context information is expressed as humanreco gnizable data and machinerecognizable data in hardware software firmware and especially data that is used to control security functions such as router table entries 1f2 determine protection level c hapter 3 based on the guidance provided in chapter 3 the daa determines protection level for confidentiality for the system and also determines any threats unique to the system or the information 1f3 determine interconnected system require ments chapter 7 and administrative requirements chapter 7 the daa determines the appropriate security requirements for interconnected systems and for the us of advanced technology specified in chapter 7 and the administrative requirements specified in chapter 8 1f4 identify technical security and assuranc requirements chapters 4 5 and 6 the applicable technical security requirements and assurances are identified chapter 4 presents the technical securi ty requirements and assurances for confidentiality organized by protection levels chapters 5 and 6 pres ent the technical security requirements and assurances for integrity and availability respectively organized by levelsofconcern 1f5 determine required documentation and testing activities chapters 4 5 and 6 the assurance requirements in chapters 4 5 and 6 are examined to determine the appropriate documentation and testing activities required for the system 1f6 write the system security plan chapter 9 and appendix c the system security plan ssp described in appendix c is written to describe the planned operating conditions of the system and the expected residual risk of operating the system chapter 9 the daa andor issm approves the ssp and the system is then implemented with the security requirements that have been deter mined for it paragraphs 1f1 through 1f5 in the case of operational systems with their security requirements already implemented the ssp is written to describe the operating conditions of the system and the residual risk of operating the system introduction for official use only 14 for official use only 1f7 validate security in place the isso ensures that the security requirements and procedures are in place for the system 1f8 testing against security requi rements chapters 4 5 and 6 the system is tested based on the security testing requirements in chapters 4 5 and 6 1f9 prepare certification package chapters 4 5 6 and 9 the isso and issm prepare the certification package based on the documenta tion requirements in chapters 4 5 and 6 and the certification package requi rements specified in chapter 9 1f10 forward certification package the certifi cation package is presented to the daa for accreditation 1f11 accreditation decision by the daa the daa determines whether the level of residual risk is acceptable and consistent with that indicated in the ssp and if it is accredits the system testing shall be performed to validate the extent of residual risk when this manual refers to the daa the daa representative is assumed to be included at the discretion of the daa 1f11a if the daa accredits the system the system goes into operation or continues to operate according to the accreditation 1f11b if the daa grants an interim approval to operate the system may be operated for up to 180 days and the interim approval to operate can be renewed once for an additional 180 days the daa must indicate in the agreement granting interim approval to operate the actions necessary to meet accreditation by the end of the second 180day period the system shall ither be accredited or cease operation 1f11c if the daa neither accredits the system nor grants an interim approval to operate then the requester must modify the system or its safeguards and the process repeats from paragraph 1f6 above until the daa accr edits the system grants an interim approval to operate or decides to disallow system operation 1g use of cryptography 1g1 cryptography is critical tool used to pr otect confidentiality of data to assure the authenticity of information and to detect the alteration of info rmation national policy requires the national security agency nsa to review and approve all cryptography used to protect classified information from access by uthorized persons ie not cleared for the information 1g2 cryptography may also be used to sepa rate compartments or protect needtoknow among cleared users on classi fied systems for such uses the daa may select the cryptographic mechanisms including commerc ially available products to be used after consulting with the data owner on requireme nts daas should also consult with nsa for assistance and advice regarding the secu rity of the proposed implementation they should pay particular attention to key ma nagement since appropriate secure key management is an important factor in overall system security for official use only introduction for official use only 15 1h general notes 1h1 in the following pages the term good engin eering practice refers to the state of the engineering art for commercial systems that have equivalent problems and solutions good engineering practice by definition meet s commercial requirement s these practices are usually part of the normal installation and operating procedures for systems when placing security reliance on items that imp lement good engineering practice such as commercial offthe shelf cots software the daas or their designees shall verify that the items are set up properly and are operating as expected 1h2 in this manual the word or is used in its common english meaning that includes all three cases of single element in list any combination of elements in list and all elements in the list 1h3 conventionally information protection has been expressed as combination of the following characteristics confidentiality integrity and availability other expressions include other characteristics such as utilit user accountability authenticity possession currency and nonrepudiation but most of these other characteristics are not independent of confidentiality integrity and availability in other words these additional characteristics can be expressed as some function of confidentiality integrity and availability thus this manual will use the conventional characteristics confidentiality integrity and availability as the appropriate descriptive elements while recognizing that some systems have additi onal operational require ments for services 1h4 the security support structure consists of those component s hardware firmware and software that are essential to maintaining the security policies of the system to prevent access by general users the security support structure is normally protected at greater level than the rest of the system 1h5 while this manual primarily discusses protection mechanisms for the information on systems it explicitly assumes that the hardware software and firmware related to the system are given appropriate levels of protection 1h6 the terms department and agency refer to the organization that is responsible for information systems security in given situ ation when stating requirements the terms department or agency are not limiting but rather are intended to include all subordinate organizations involved in given information systems security situation for example the secretary of defense may dele gate many of the operational aspects of compliance with this policy to tactical military field command responsible for systems that contain classified information for official use only roles and responsibilities for official use only 21 2 roles and responsibilities 2a overview this chapter describes eight roles pertaining to is security and assigns responsibilities to each 2a1 separation of roles 2a1a some systems are extensive enough to require different individual to fill each of the eight roles 2a1b more typically however the eight roles can be collapsed into four or five depending on whether the principal accrediting authority paa is also the data owner there is only one restriction on collapsing roles at the operational level implementers and examiners shall not be the same person fo r example this structure prohibits the designated accrediting authority from also being the information system security officer in some agencies the same individual eg paa may fill management roles at high level as both chief exa miner and chief impleme nter but single individual can fill both operational roles 2a1c the ssp shall specify which roles may be collapsed and which must remain separate 2a2 applicability in the following subsections the system referred to is the system or systems under the purview of the indivi dual whose roles are being defined 2b roles and responsibilities 2b1 special provision for waivers of citizenship requirements all concerned paas and data owners shall approve per paragra ph 8e1 any

protection levels and explains how to use them to ascertain the appropriate technical curity requirements for confidentiality integrity and ava ilability that each is must meet 3a1 conformance with technical security requi rements in order to be certified and accredited each is must conform to set of technical security requirements for confidentiality integrity and availability the specific technical security requirements and associated assurances with which an is must comply are provided in chapters 4 confidentiality 5 integrity and 6 availability of this manual to determine which of these requirements are appropriate for gi ven is the daa must first ascertain the appropriate levelsofconcern and protection level for the is 3a2 nonmultiuser systems the technical requirements provided in chapters 4 5 and 6 are intended for multiuser systems applying them by rote to nonmultiuser systems is likely to result in unnecessary costs and trimental operational impact paragraph 9g provides supplemental guidance for dealing with special systems th at may be secured without applying all of the technical requirements of chapters 4 5 and 6 3b description of levelsofconcern 3b1 overview 3b1a the daa using guidance from the data owner and after examining the information characteristics of the is in ques tion must determine the appropriate levelsofconcern ratings for confidentiality integrity and availability the levelofconcern rating for each of these areas can be basic medium or high the levelofconcern rating is independent for each of these three areas thus for example systems levelofconcern for c onfidentiality could be high for integrity could be basic and for availability could be medium when system has more than one kind of information on it the levelofconcern assigned is the highest levelofconcern for any information on the system 3b1b the daa shall determine and assign leve lofconcern rating for confidentiality integrity and availability for each is that is to be accredited 3b1c the decision regarding the levelsofconcer n shall be explicit for all including interconnected systems the record of th is decision shall be written and the daa shall ensure that these records are retained for the operational life of the systems involved at the daas discretion the decisi on can be made for groups of systems but it shall be explicit 3b2 determining the levelofconcern 3b2a confidentiality here the levelofconcern rating is based on the sensitivity of the information that the is maintains processes and transmits the more sensitive the information the higher the iss levelo fconcern systems that process dod sap information require high levelofconcern since all systems accredited under the levelsofconcern for official use only 32 for official use only authority of this manual by definition proce ss sap information all systems accredited under this manual must be assigned high confidentiality levelofconcern 3b2b integrity here the levelofconcern rating is based on the degree of resistance to unauthorized modification of the information maintained processed and transmitted by the is that is necessary for accomplishi ng the mission of its users the greater the needed degree of resistance to unauthor ized modification the higher is the levelofconcern 3b2c availability here the levelofconcern rating is based on the degree of ready availability required for the information maintained processed and transmitted by the is in order to accomplish the mission of its users the greater the need for rapid information availability the higher the levelofconcern 3b2d table 31 is designed to assist thos involved in system development implementation certif ication and accreditation in termining the appropriate levelsofconcern for confidentiality integrity and availability for given system processing given set of information 3c protection levels 3c1 protection level overview 3c1a the concept of protection levels applies only to confidentiality having verified that an is will maintain process or transmit sap information and therefore that its level of concern for confidentiality must be high the daa must next ascertain the appropriate protection level for the is based on the required clearances formal access approvals and needt oknow of all direct and indirect users who receive information from the is without manual intervention and re liable human review it indicates an implicit level of trust that is placed in the systems technical capabilities 3c1b the daa must assign protection level to each is that is to be accredited the decision regarding the protection levels shall be explicit for all including interconnected systems the record of this decision shall be in writing and the daa shall ensure that these records are retained for the operational life of the systems involved at the daas discretion the decisi on can be made for groups of systems but it shall be explicit 3c2 determining protection levels 3c2a table 41 presents the criteria for determinin g which of the five protection levels is appropriate for the is being accredited 3c2a1 an is operates at protection level 1 when all users have all required approvals for access to all information on the is this means that all users have all required clearances formal access approvals and th need to know for all information on the is 3c2a2 an is operates at protection level 2 when all users have all required formal approvals for access to all information on the is but at least one user lacks administrative approval for some of the information on the is this means that all for official use only levelsofconcern for official use only 33 users have all required clearances and ll required formal access approvals but at least one user lacks the need to know for some of the information on the is 3c2a3 an is operates at protection level 3 when at least one user lacks at least one required formal approval for access to all information on the is this means that all users have all required clearances but at least one user lacks formal access approval for some of the information on the is 3c2a4 an is operates at protection level 4 when at least one user lacks sufficient clearance for access to some of the informati on on the is but all users have at least secret clearance 3c2a5 an is operates at protection level 5 when at least one user lacks any clearance for access to some of the information on the is 3c2b an is operating at protection level 3 presents potential risk of loss of compartmented information to users lacking the necessary formal access approvals an is operating at protection levels 4 or 5 presents potential risk of the loss of classified information to users lacking th necessary clearance daas must recognize the technical risk of operating such iss and shall require all reasonably available assurances of the effectiveness of the protection mechanisms for such iss 3d determining security features and assurances 3d1 having determined the appropriate levels ofconcern and protection level for an is the daa next needs to ascertain the specif ic technical security requirements and assurances for confidentiality integrity and availability provided in chapters 4 5 and 6 respectively for example assume that system has protection level of 2 medium integrity levelofconcern and high availability levelofconcern that system would have to conform to the security feat ures and assurance requi rements of protection level 2 in chapter 4 the security features and assurance requirements for medium integrity levelofconcern provided in chap ter 5 and the security features and assurance requirements for high availability levelofconcern provided in chapter 6 3d2 the security features and assurances for conf identiality integrity and availability are independent of each other the daa is res ponsible for ascertaining the appropriate security features and assurances for confidentiality integrity and availability levelsofconcern for official use only 34 for official use only table 31 consolidat ed levelsofconcern level of concern

availability will have an adverse effect on national level interests or loss of availability will have an adverse effect on confidentiality notes 1 in this context flexible tolerance for delay means that routine system outages do not endanger mission accomplishment however extended system outage s days to weeks may endanger the mission 2 in this context minimum tolerance for delay means that routine system outages do not endanger mission accomplishment however extended system outages seconds to hours may endanger the mission 3 see table 41 protection levels for more information regarding requirements for high levelofconcern for official use only confidentiality for official use only 41 4 confidentiality system security features and assurances 4a overview 4a1 this chapter provides the tailed confidentiality techni cal security features and assurances as noted in chapter 3 the daa must select the appropriate technical security features and assurances for an is based on the protection level of the is integrity and availability security features and assurances are provided in chapters 5 and 6 respectively as noted in chapter 3 the daa must ascertain the technical secu rity requirements and assurances for confidentiality integrity and availability prior to accrediting an is 4a2 this chapter separately sets forth the confidentiality requirements for systems operating at each of the five protection levels 4a3 the underscored terms in brackets preceding the sets of requirements eg access1 indicate how those requirements are identified in the tabular presentation in appendix d 4a4 the notations pl1 pl2 pl3 pl4 and pl5 refer to protection levels 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively 4a5 requirements listed in boldface type are in addition to or different from the requirements for the previous protection leve l entries for protection level 1 are in boldface type because the lowest level is the first entry for given requirement 4b confidentiality requirements each is shall incorporate security features that will control the release of information commensurate with the sensitivity of the information being processed as well as with the clearance formal access approval and needtoknow of the users of the is as determined by the protection level assigned for each is assu rance commensurate with the protection level shall be provided table 41 identifies the factors used to select the appropriate protecti on level and cites the paragraphs of this chapter where the relevant requirements can be located as noted in the previous chapter the protection level for confidentiality is based on clearances formal access approvals and needtoknow of all users where users refe rs to direct and indirect users who receive information from the is without manual intervention and reliable human review but when applying the confidentiality requirements of this chapter the term user refers only to the direct users of the system confidentiality pl1 for official use only 42 for official use only table 41 protection levels lowest clearance formal access approval need to know protection level at least equal to highest data all users have all all users have all

chapter discusses the security requirement s for safeguarding interconnected information systems and for safeguarding information system s that employ advanced technologies such as such as world wide web servers mobile code electronic mail or collaborative computing 7a1 an interconnected is is composed of separately accredited iss each selfcontained is maintains its own intrasystem services nd controls protects its own resources and retains its individual accreditation each participating is has its own isso 7a1a interconnected iss shall have mechanism capable of adjudicating the different security policy implementations of the participating iss 7a1b interconnected iss require accreditation that explicitly addresses their interconnectivity see chapter 9 for disc ussion and definition of accreditation 7a2 when connecting two or more iss the daas shall review the security attributes of each system to determine whether the combination of data or the combination of users who have access to the interconnected iss necessitates higher level of security requirements daas shall ex plicitly make this determina tion even if the systems are accredited at the same level of technical requirements 7a3 the characteristics and capabilities of inte rconnected iss require special security considerations eg controlling the flow of in formation into or out of an interconnected is this chapter introduces additional requirements for interconnected iss and expands on the security requirements stated in chapters 4 5 and 6 as they apply to interconnected iss 7a4 many environments employ technologies ch as world wide web servers mobile code electronic mail or co llaborative computing to accomplish their mission such technologies may be employed across interconnected iss to enhance intersystem services or within an is to enhance intr asystem services these technologies have security ramifications that are not always readily handled by the requirements provided in chapters 4 5 and 6 this chapter introduces additional security requirements for such technology and expands upon the security requi rements in chapters 4 5 and 6 as they apply to such technologies 7b controlled interface 7b1 controlled interface overview 7b1a controlled interface is mechanism that facilitates adjudicating the security policies of different interconnected iss eg controlling the flow of information into or out of an interconnected is controlling the flow of information into an interconnected is helps preserve the integrity of the is and the integrity and confidentiality of the information maintained and processed by the is controlling the flow of information out of the is he lps preserve the confidentiality of the information leaving the is and may protect the integrity of the receiving iss the requirements for interconnected iss for official use only 72 for official use only adjudication of integrity and confidentiality policies may be handled in variety of ways for example controlled interfaces that control the flow of information out of an is are often employed to facilitate push technology where the goal is to push information to an indi rect user residing outside of the is perimeter but within the is boundary 7b1a1 single controlled interface may perform all of the confidentiality and integrity adjudication or 7b1a2 one controlled interface may be employed for adjudicating confidentiality policies while another adjudicat integrity policies or 7b1a3 the adjudication of confidentiality and integrity policies may be distributed across set of controlled interfaces where each performs some subset of confidentiality and integrity policy adjudication in this instance the set of controlled interfaces adjudicates all of the required integrity and confidentiality policies 7b1b while controlled interface is often implemented as mechanism or set of mechanisms separate from the iss it is intended to protect this need not be the case controlled interface can be constructed so that some of its f unctionality resides in the iss themselves regardless of its imp lementation the controlled interface must conform to the requireme nts provided below 7b2 common controlled interface requirements 7b2a the daa shall ensure that 7b2a1 mechanisms or procedures exist to prohibit general users from modifying the functional capabilities of the controlled interface 7b2a2 automated mechanisms are employed that can monitor the controlled interface for symptoms of failure or compromise the mechanisms shall be protected against failure or compromise 7b2a3 the controlled interface is physically protected 7b2b routing information employed for either controlling the release of outgoing information or the delivery of incoming in formation shall be supplied or alterable only by the security support structure of the controlled interface 7b2c each controlled interface shall be configured and located to facilitate its ability to provide controlled communi cation between the interconnected systems 7b2d each controlled interface shall be config ured to ensure that all incoming and outgoing communications protocols serv ices and communications not explicitly permitted are prohibited 7b2e each controlled interface shall be tested to ensure that it satisfies all of the appropriate controlled interface criteria listed in this chapter for official use only requirements for interconnected iss for official use only 73 7b2f the controlled interface shall be included in configuration management program security policies procedures etc shall be documented 7b2g recovery procedures and technical system procedures will be in place to assure that recovery of the controlled interface is done in trusted and secure manner if any circumstances can cause an untrusted recovery such circumstances shall be documented and appropriate mitigating procedures shall be put in place 7b2h the controlled interface shall implement data and software storage integrity to include to the use of strong storage integrit mechanisms eg controls that track and report changes to security configurations files 7b2i safeguards shall be provide d to assure that users cannot circumvent technical controls 7b2j all direct user access to the controlled interface shall be audited 7b2k remote administration of the controlled interface is discouraged all remote administration of controlled interfaces requires written approval of the daa if remote administration is employed the sessi on must be protected through the use of the following techniques 7b2k1 strong authentication and either 7b2k2 physically separate communications paths or 7b2k3 logically separated communicati ons paths based upon either 7b2k3a nsaapproved encryption or 7b2k3b nsaapproved encryption and daaapprove d privacy encryption to provide privacy of the remote administration session 7b2k4 direct user access to the controlled inte rface shall require strong authentication 7b2k5 the requirements imposed upon controlled interfaces do not release the daa isso or issm of the obligation to ensure that the iss comprising the interconnected is provide the required security functionality 7b2k6 the introduction of controlled interface do not impact the determination of the protection level or levelsofconcern of the iss comprising the interconnected is 7b3 controlled interface confidentiality requirements 7b3a controlled interface shall be required for facilitating the adjudication of confidentiality policies if 7b3a1 the two interconnected iss are approved to process information of different classifications and 7b3a2 neither interconnected is is opera ting at protection level 4 or 5 requirements for interconnected iss for official use only 74 for official use only 7b3b controlled interface shall be required for facilitating the adjudication of confidentiality policies if 7b3b1 the compartments subcompartments caveats control markings or special handling of information processed by one in terconnected is is different than the compartments subcompartments caveats control markings or special handling of information processed by the other interconnected is and 7b3b2 neither interconnected is is operatin g at protection levels 3 4 or 5 7b3c at minimum the following confidentiality policy adjudication features shall be provided one circumstance in which additional security requiremen ts should be considered involves the is receiving information via the controlled interface which in turn is directly connected to another system accessible by user holding lower clearance this topic is further discussed in paragraph 9d3c1 7b3c1 traffic review review the classification of all outgoing ie going outside of the interconnected is perimeter traffic based on associated security labels where provided or data content if applicable be fore being released if labels are used the controlled interface must maintain the integrity of the labels 7b3c2 controlled release ensure that only traffic that is explicitly permitted based on traffic review is released from the perimeter of the interconnected is 7b3c3 encryption encrypt as needed all outgoing communication including the body and attachment of the communication with the appropriate level of encryption for the information transmission dium and target system 7b3c4 protection ensure that users and pro cesses in lower protection domain are prevented from accessing information for which they are not authorized that resides in higher domain in addition when information at higher security level is made available to lower security leve l the information shall be protected and maintained at the higher security level until it satisfies the traffic review and controlled release requireme nts described above 7b3c5 auditlogging log all data release activities to include identity of releaser identity of recipient identity of data rel eased device identifier id eg port id time and date of release modification or application of security labels 7b3c6 failsecure ensure that the operational failure of the controlled interface does not result in any unauthorized release of info rmation outside of the is perimeter 7b3d the availability levelofconcern of each confidentiality controlled interface shall be at least as high as the lowest availability levelofconcern level of the interconnected iss 7b3e in addition to the requirements imposed upon the controlled interface each interconnected is that is receiving information shall 7b3e1 be accredited to process the levels and compartments of information that it receives for official use only requirements for interconnected iss for official use only 75 7b3e2 provide the features and assurances necessa ry to ensure that information received is made available only to those aut horized to receive the information 7b3f the security requirements imposed upon c onfidentiality controlled interfaces are less stringent than those imposed upon pl4 or pl5 systems because confidentiality controlled interfaces are more constraine d in their operation and function than complete iss the information that flows through the controlled interface is generally push only or pull only in those instances where the controlled interface supports both push and pull capabilities some other constraint limits the bandwidth or format of information flowing through eg information may be limited to fixed format or users may be limited to set of fixedformat queries where information is flowing between systems approved to process differen t security levels or compartments and the information flow is not constrained in some manner similar to that described above then the requirements of pl3 pl4 or pl5 as appropriate shall be applied 7b4 controlled interface integrity requirements 7b4a controlled interface facilitating the adjudication of integrity policies shall control all information flows into an interconnect ed is the controlled interface shall be required regardless of 1 the protection leve l of the systems comprising the is or 2 the protection level of the systems co mprising the interconnected systems with which it communicates 7b4b at minimum the following integrity policy adjudication features shall be provided one circumstance in which additional security requirem ents should be considered involves the is sending information to the controlled interface which in turn is directly connected to another system accessible by users holding lower clearance this topic is further discussed in paragraph 9d3c1 7b4b1 malicious code screening review incoming information for viruses and other malicious code as feasible having the controlled interface review incoming information for malicious code does not relieve the receiving is from the responsibility of also checking for malicious code 7b4b2 delivery ensure that incoming communications have an authorized user and as applicable authorized addr esses as destination 7b4b3 filtering support and filter communications protocolsse rvices from outside the perimeter of the interconnected is according to isappropriate needs eg filter based on addresses identity protocol authenticated tra ffic and applications 7b4b4 proxies support as appropr iate protocolmediation soft ware ie proxies that are able to understand and take protec tive action based on applicationlevel protocols and associated data streams eg filtering ftp connections to deny the use of the put command effectively pr ohibiting the ability to write to an anonymous ftp server 7b4b5 extensibility where appropriate provide security support for the incorporation of additional system services as they become available requirements for interconnected iss for official use only 76 for official use only 7b4b6 auditinglogging log data communications into the interconnected is to include identity of sender eg person endsystem identity of recipient eg ip address host and user device id eg port id data time and event 7b4b7 failsecure ensure that in the event of the operational failure of the controlled interface information external to the interconnected is shall enter the is 7b4c the availability levelofconcern of each integrity controlled interface shall be at least as high as the availability levelofconcern of the is into which the information flows are directed 7b5 controlled interface platform protection requirements unless the daa provides written exemption the platform underlying th controlled interface mechanism must be able to isolate and protect the controlled interface application 7c web security 7c1 overview 7c1a web technology is that part of networ k communications in which the parties communicate through the use of the hypert ext transfer protocol http or some variant 7c1b many organizations are employing web technology ie http web servers and clients to establish intranets and extranets an intranet is web communications system established within limited confines of given enterprise eg internal to given business or agency an extranet is private network using web technology to share part of an enterprises informa tion or operations with suppliers vendors partners customers or other enterprises the technology employed in intranets and extranets is the same as that employed in the larger world wide web but is confined usually by controlled interfaces such as firewalls to limited audience 7c1c because the web technology is an enhanced form of network communications many of the security requirements stated elsewher in this manual apply directly to the use of web technology for example nsa approved encryption technology would be required to prevent the exposure of classifi ed information to individuals who are not cleared for the information see paragraphs 1g1 and 1g2 7c2 securing web clients 7c2a because of the power of web technology th web client and associated workstation must be appropriately configured and secu red it is particular ly important to be sensitive to combinations of unclassified data that in aggregate reveal classified information and to combinations of inform ation classified at one level that in aggregate reveal more highly classified information 7c2a1 all certificates shall be protected via passw ords that adhere to daa guidelines or some daaapproved biometric mechanism certificate is an association between an identity and public key certificates are used as way to verify the authenticity of an organization or individual for official use only requirements for interconnected iss for official use only 77 7c2a2 only daaapproved certification authorities shall issue certificates that are installed on iss that pr ocess sap information certification authority is an organization that issues public key certificates 7c2a3 if the web client supports other capabilitie s eg email collaborative computing mobile code in addition to traditional browser capabilities then the use of these other capabilities shall be consistent with the appropriate guidelines stated elsewhere in this manual or as called for by the daa 7c2b in addition as web client updates that address known security flaws become available the isso shall ensure that th ey are implemented as soon as possible 7d securing servers 7d1 various technologies such as web or file tr ansfer protocol ftp provide convenient means for sharing information such technolog ies are examples of pushpull technology which allow one entity to push information into location and another entity to pull it from that location documents that an or ganization wishes to share with other organizations could be placed on pushed out to an external web or ftp server ie outside of the organizations is and then an yone able to access the server could access pull off the information documents that an organization wishes to share internally could be placed on an internal web or ftp rver ie within an organizations is and then anyone within the organization able to access the server could obtain pull off the information 7d2 because such servers are by their nature relatively accessible they are potentially subject to attacks that could result in modificati on or destruction of the operating system or insertion of malicious code to address these concerns unless the daa provides written permission to do otherwise 7d2a external servers shall be located external to sites controlled interface eg firewall or shall be on network separate from the sites intranet 7d2b the operating services and programs on server s external and internal shall be kept to minimum and services that are security risks eg tftp rlogin rshell or not required shall be disabled 7d2c the system that supports the server functi onality shall as much as possible be dedicated to that purpose 7d2d all operating system protocol and applica tion eg ftp and web security patches shall be implemented as soon as possi ble after they become known and their functionality has been tested 7d2e remote access to servers by privilege d users requires the use of strong authentication mechanism and all such accesses shall be audited 7d3 servers can be delineated into two broad categories public ie general access servers and restricted access serv ers described below requirements for interconnected iss for official use only 78 for official use only 7d3a public servers the information that is placed on public server shall be limited to general access holdings that can be accessed by anyone who has authorized access to the interintranetlan on which the server resides servers employed as public servers shall implement all of the requirements stated in paragraph 7d2 above and general user accounts shall be permitted on the server 7d3b restricted access servers the information that is placed on restricted access server is information which should only be accessed by authorized authenticated users in addition to the requirements stated in paragraph 7d2 above restricted access servers shall implement the following security requirements 7d3b1 the underlying operating system shall satis fy the confidentiality requirements of protection level 2 or higher integrity re quirements for basic levelof concern or higher and availability requirements for basic levelofconcern or higher 7d3b2 web servers shall implement secure web technology eg secure sockets layer secure http where capable 7d3b3 strong authentication shall be required for all users accessing the restricted servers and all such ccesses shall be audited 7e mobile code and executable content 7e1 mobile code is code obtained from remote systems transmitted across network and then downloaded onto and executed on local sy stem in recent years mobile code has come to refer to webbased c ode downloaded onto users c lient and run by the users browser examples of such webbased m obile code include ja va javascript and activex the larger set of mobile code norma lly involves an explicit decision to execute either by the user or by an application examples of mobile c ode that are directly executed by the user include perl tcltk rexx python java and platformspecific executables eg com exe examples of mobile code that are executed by an application with little or explicit user action include macros activex postscript and java in this instance remote system would include any system which is physically separate from another is but is able to communicate via some data link this would include systems connected via internets intranets clientserver local area networks lans etc 7e2 executable content is the subset of mobile code that is largely invisible to the user and that operates without user decision executa ble content consists of code that is referenced or embedded in hypertext ma rkup language html and extensible markup language xml page or an email message typically executable content is automatically activated upon viewing or load ing the containing document without any specific user interaction the user may be ware that separate executable has been downloaded on the users machine exampl of executable content include java applets activex controls javascript and vbscript 7e3 hostile mobile code or execu table content could be used to introduce viruses or other malicious code modify programs and allow unauthorized access to system corrupt data or deny service for official use only requirements for interconnected iss for official use only 79 7e4 hostile mobile code or executable content is completely different from more traditional malicious code such as viruses and worm s and is not currently detectable by conventional antivi ral software 7e5 until reliable executable content scanning detection technology is available as determined by the daa to address the security concerns with regard to mobile code or executable content obtained via the we b the following requirements apply anticipated security enhancements to webbased mobile code or executable content include mobile code or executable content that is digitally signed so as to iden tify the author and constrained by the browser so that the privileges granted to the mobile code or executable content would be based on who signed the codecontent from where it was downloaded and other factors which could be tailored by an issom to the needs of the specific environment also under development are tools that would search for the signatures of known malicious mobile code or executable content in manner analogous to the way current antiviral software detects viruses 7e5a all mobile code or executable content employed within an intelligence intranet enclave shall be registered within that clave unless the daa authorizes otherwise 7e5b as feasible organizations shall implement code review and qu ality control process for deployed mobile code or executable content and shall be responsible for the mobile code or executable c ontent that they deploy 7e5c for those instances where there is opera tional need to download mobile code or executable content the isso or appropriate privileged user shall configure the is or controlled interface to prevent the downloa ding of mobile code or executable content 7e5d unless written exception is granted by the daa organizations shall not run mobile code or executable content on missi oncritical information systems 7e5e downloading of mobile code or executabl content from system that processes information of different classification level shall only be permitted if controlled interface appropriately configured to handle such download is in place and with the written approval of the daa 7f electronic mail email 7f1 encryption and email email shall confor m to the electronic communications and transmission requirements regarding confidentiality stated elsewhere in this manual in particular an email message and associated attachments shall be appropriately encrypted if during its transmission it may be accessible to individuals who lack either clearance or formal access approval for the information contained in the email and associated attachments 7f2 viruses and email 7f2a the daa shall ensure that the threat of viru ses in email or attach ments is addressed requirements for interconnected iss for official use only 710 for official use only 7f2b where technically feasible the daa shall requi re the use of antiviral mechanisms to detect and eradicate viruses in incomin g and outgoing email and attachments 7f2c the means employed to address the virus threat shall be stated in the ssp 7f2d the use of antiviral procedures and mech anisms to detect and eradicate viruses transported by email or att achments does not relieve the isso of ensuring that there are procedures and mechanisms eg central choke points where diskettes are scanned for viruses prior to distribution with in the is in place to safeguard against virus infection of the is from other sources 7g collaborative computing 7g1 collaborative computing allows members of work group to share electronically any information applications nd hardware to accomplish group assignments examples of collaborative computing mechanisms include shared white boards application sharing lanbased video and audio conferencing screen sharing and text chatter collaborative computing may be done in either peertope er manner in which user workstations act as servers to other group users or in clie ntserver manner in which user workstations connect to common server where the data sharing is handled 7g2 if not correctly configured collaborative com puting technologies can allow user to see and hear everything happening at another us ers workstation area or to read modify and delete any information on or acc essible to users workstation 7g3 until collaborative computing technologies in corporate security capabilities eg ia access control auditing to the satisfaction of the daa the following requirements apply 7g3a collaborative computing mechanisms sha ll be hosted only on systems operating at protection levels 1 2 and 3 and between sy stems that process information of the same classifications but hosting collaborative computing mechanisms on systems operating at protection leve l 3 requires the explicit written approval of the daa and the daa may impose additional technical or other security safeguards as needed 7g3b collaborative computing mechanisms shall not be remotely activated activation requires an explicit action by the workstation user eg in the case of desktop video teleconference the user of the desktop shall be required to take an explicit action to turn on the camera and microphone remote user s shall not be allo wed to activate users camera or mic rophone remotely 7g3c peertopeer collaborative computing mechanisms between systems operating at protection level 2 shall be configured to ensure that only the information on the screen is observable to the remote us er information located elsewhere on the workstation shall not be observable nor sha ll the remote user be able to modify or delete any information on the workstation th restrictions also apply to any other is to which the users workstation is logi cally connected eg any logically mounted disks for official use only requirements for interconnected iss for official use only 711 7g3d collaborative computing mechanisms that provide video andor audio conference capabilities shall provide some explicit indication that the video and audio mechanisms are operating 7g3e running collaborative computing mechan isms on missioncritical systems is discouraged and shall require explicit written daa approval 7g3f the server portion of the clientserver collaborative computing mechanism shall authenticate all users or processes acting on their behalf 7g3g while conducting collaborative computing ssion the user shall take all reasonable measures to ensure that sensitive information is inadvertently made either audibly or visually accessible to the collaborative computing mechanism this includes advising all personnel in the immediate area that the collaborative computing mechanism will be operating 7g3h once the collaborative session is completed the user shall immediately take an explicit action to disconnectterminate the collaborative computing mechanism 7g3i users shall not leave the workstation ttended while peert opeer collaborative computing mechanism is in progress 7h distributed processing distributed processing systems can be considered single or netw ork systems and can be handled in accordance with the guidelines provided in chapters 4 5 6 and 8 distributed parallel processing occurs when an application on one is divides task into two or more parts and then sends the parts to the other iss on the network for processing this allows the idle cpu cycles on many iss to be used for cpu intensive calculations the results are then sent back to the originating is for final processing distributed parallel processing should be restricted to protection level 1 and basic level of concern networks and not be permitted on mission critical systems for official use only administrative security for official use only 81 8 administrative security requirements 8a overview the

level and category of data ever recorded on it until destroyed or sanitized using approved procedures the ssp shall specify the approved release procedure for the media of given system procedures to be used for the sanitization declassification and reuse of storage media are described below 8b5a clearing vs sanitizing vs destroying media 8b5a1 clearing is the process of eradicating the data on the media before reusing the media in an environment that provides an acceptable level of protection for the data that was on the media before clearing in general laborat ory techniques allow the retrieval of information that has b een cleared but normal operations do not allow such retrieval purging or sanitizing is the process of removing the data from the media before reusing the media in an environment that does not provide an acceptable level of protection for the data that was on the media before purging or sanitizing in general laboratory techniques cannot retrieve data that has been purged or sanitized destroying is the process of physically damaging the media so that it is not usable as media and so that known method can retrieve data from it 8b5a2 overwriting clearing purging degaussing and sanitizing are not synonymous with declassification declassification is the separate administrative process resulting in determination that given media longer requires protection as classified information procedures for declassifying media require daa approval 8b5a2a overwriting media for official use only administrative security for official use only 87 8b5a2a1 overwriting is software process that replaces the data previously stored on magnetic storage media with predetermined set of meaningless data overwriting is an acceptable method for clearing 8b5a2a2 several factors can reduce the effectiveness of overwriting these include ineffectiveness of the overwrite procedures equipment failure eg misalig nment of readwrite heads and inability to overwrite bad sectors or tracks or information in interrecord gaps 8b5a2a3 to clear magnetic disks overwrite all locations three times the first time with random character the second time with specified character and the third time with the complement of that specified character 8b5a2b degaussing media 8b5a2b1 degaussing ie demagnetizing is procedure that reduces the magnetic flux on media virtually to zero by applying reverse magnetizing field pr operly applied degaussing renders any previously stor ed data on magnetic media unreadable and may be used in the sanitization process degaussing is more effective than overwriting magnetic media 8b5a2b2 magnetic media are divided in to three types based on their coercivity coercivity of magnetic media defines the magnetic field necessary to reduce magnetically saturated materials magnetization to zer type i degaussers are used to degauss type i media ie media whose coercivity is greater than 350 oersteds oe type iia degaussers are used to degauss type iia medi ie media whose coercivity is greater than 900 oe currently degaussers can effectively degauss all type iii media ie media whose coercivity is over 900 oe some degaussers are rated up to 1700 oe but their specific approved rating must be determined prior to use the correct use of degaussing products improves assurance that data is longer retrievable and that inadvertent disclosure will not occur 8b5a2b3 refer to the current issue of nsas information systems security products and services catalogue degausser products list section for the identification of degaussers acceptable for the procedures specified in this manual the vendor will provide test proce dures to verify continued compliance the issm using these vendorsupplied test procedures shall ensure testin g at least annually of these products to verify that they continue to meet their manufacturers specifications administrative security for official use only 88 for official use only 8b5a3 sanitizing media sanitization removes information from media or equipment so that data recovery using any known technique or analysis is prevented sanitizing is twostep process that includes removi ng data from the media by effectively degaussing the media and removing all sensitivity labels markings and activity logs after magnetic media are properly degaussed in accordance with nsacssm 1302 and all identifying labels removed they are considered to be sanitized 8b5a4 destroying media data storage medi will be destroyed in accordance with paaapproved methods 8b5b media containing cla ssified information 8b5b1 reuse of media cleared or sanitized media that has previously contained classified information may be reused at the same classification level eg ts ts or at higher level eg s ts sanitized media may be downgraded or declassified with the daas and as app licable the data owners approval as specified in the ssp only approved equipment and software shall be used to overwrite and degauss magn etic media containing cla ssified information each action or procedure taken to overwrite or degauss such media shall be verified 8b5b2 clearing only approved equipment and overwriting software that is compatible with the specific hardware for overwriting shall be used to clear media that have contained classified information use of such software shall be coordinated in advance with the daa the success of the overwrite procedure shall be verified through random sampling of the overwritten media items that have been cleared ie not sanitized shall remain at the previous level of classification and remain in secure controlled environment 8b5b3 sanitizing 8b5b3a magnetic media containing classified information can be sanitized by use of an approved degaussing procedure the daa with the data owners approval if applicable can allow overwriting of some types of classified information as sanitizing procedure 8b5b3b media that have ever contained sens itive compartmented information other intelligence information top secret sap information or restricted data cannot be sanitized by overwriting ch media shall be degaussed before release media that has ever contained comsec material cannot be sanitized at all it shall be destroyed before release 8b5b4 optical disks optical disks including compact diskread only memory write onceread many digital versatile disk and writeable compact discs offer mechanism for sanitization and must be destroyed via incineration or any other nsaapproved method they should be placed in classified trash bag labeled nonsoluble and disposed as classified waste for official use only administrative security for official use only 89 8b5c malfunctioning media magnetic storage media that malf unctions or contains features that inhibit overwriting or degaussing shall be reported to the isso who will coordinate repair or destruc tion with the responsible daa 8b5d release of memory components and boards 8b5d1 before the release of any components or boa rds from an area used to process or store classified informati on whether because they are malfunctioning or because they are longer needed the requirement s of subsections 2 and 3 below shall be met this section applies only to components identified by the vendor or other technicallyknowledgeable individual as having the capability of retaining

certification and accreditation 9a overview this chapter discusses risk management the certif ication process the ac creditation process and the interrelationship of the three activities 9a1 risk management is the discipline of identifying and measuring security risks associated with an is and controlling and reducing those risks to an acceptable level the goal of risk management is to invest organizational resources to mitigate security risks in costeffective manner while enabling timely and effective mission accomplishment 9a2 the risk management process identifies asse ts to be protected potential threats and vulnerabilities and countermeas ures and safeguards that can eliminate vulnerabilities or reduce them to levels acceptable for is accreditation risk mana gement is based on careful identification and evaluation of the threats and vulnerabilities that apply to given is and its opera tional environment 9a3 the certification process validates that ppropriate levelsofconcern for integrity and availability and an appropriate protection level for confidentiality have been selected from the tables and descriptions chapters 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 and appendix d in this manual and that the required safeguards have been implemented on the system as described in the ssp this process culminates in the accreditation permission for the system to operate processing specific classi fication and compartments of information at the approved protection level for confiden tiality and approved levelsofconcern for integrity and availability by the daa 9a4 the certification and accreditation process from initial certification and accreditation to the withdrawal of accreditation covers the entire life cycle of an is 9b risk management 9b1 risk management is relevant to the entire lif cycle of an is during is development security countermeasures are chosen du ring is implementation and operation the effectiveness of inplace countermeasures is re confirmed and the effect of current threat conditions on system security is assessed to determine if additional countermeasures are needed to sustain the accredited iss security in scheduling risk management activities and designating resources careful considera tion should be given to certification and accreditation ca goals and milestones associated risks can then be assessed and corrective action taken for unacceptable risk s risk management requires the routine tracking and evaluation of the security state of an is 9b2 the risk management process includes 9b2a analysis of the threats to and vulnerabilities of an information system as well as of the potential impact that losing the systems information or capabilities would have on national security this analysis forms basis for identifying appropriate and costeffective countermeasures risk management for official use only 92 for official use only 9b2b risk mitigation analysis of tradeoffs among alternative sets of possible safeguards 9b2c residual risk determin ation identification of the ri sk remaining after applying safeguards 9b2d acceptable level of risk judicious and carefully considered assessment by the appropriate daa that the residua l risk inherent in operating the is after implementing all proposed security features is acceptable 9b2e reactive or responsive risk management pr ocess to facilitate investigation of and response to incidents 9b3 for interconnected systems all of the re quirements stated in paragraph 9b2 above shall be applied to connections including any changes or requested changes to and exploitation potential or real of connections 9b4 initial information gathering for the risk management process determines mission requirements eg requirements for timeliness confidentiality availability and correctness of information resources available to mitigate risks eg financial staffing constraints eg commitment to use specific information technologies architectures or products and applicable policies and requirement s this information should be made available and updated as necessary throughout the is life cycle risk management activities provide important information for daas and typically include 9b4a risk analysis the analysis and assessment of information regarding threats vulnerabilities and assets 9b4b costbenefit analysis an analysis of the costs of providing and maintaining safeguard versus the cost of losing or co mpromising the information or is resource including the operational impact of implementing security safeguard 9b4c security test and evaluation an analysis of the safeguards protecting an is in given operational environment for the purpose of termining the security posture of that system 9b4d countermeasure implementation the imp lementation of any action device procedure technique or othe r measure that reduces risk 9b4e penetration testing security testing in which the testers attempt to circumvent the security features of an is based on thei r understanding of the system design and implementation 9b4f is review periodic review of the security posture of an is done at regular intervals and whenever there are any major changes to the is 9b5 chapters 3 4 5 and 6 provide guidance for determining the correct safeguards to employ at the selected integrity and availability levelsofconcern and the confidentiality protection level chapter 7 provides guidance regarding the appropriate safeguards to employ when interconnectin g information systems and using advanced technology this guidance is generic and addresses only minimum security requirements specific threats vulnerabilities or constraints associated with an is and its environment may impose additional security requirements on an is or the substitution of safeguards from different security disciplines for official use only risk management for official use only 93 9b6 the following additional risk management considerations apply when systems are interconnected 9b6a the risk management process must addr ess new risks encountered by individual systems and the interconnected infrastr uctures to which they will connect 9b6b the risk management process must addre ss the concerns and requirements of the organizations and elements eg data ow ners that are part of the information infrastructure being used to achieve interconnectivity 9b6c additional constraints can arise due to organizational commitments to specific technologies or architectures variations in policies or treaty agreements 9b6d risk management responsibilities ma be shared by multiple daas 9c certification 9c1 certification is the comprehe nsive evaluation of the techni cal and nontechnical security features of an is and other safeguards made as part of and in support of the accreditation process to establish the extent to which particular design and implementation meet specified set of security requirements 9c2 the certification process validates that ppropriate levelsofconcern for integrity and availability and an appropriate confidentiality protection level have been selected from the tables and descriptions chapters 3 4 5 6 and 7 and appendix d in this manual and that the required safeguards have been implemented on the system as described in the ssp 9c3 the issm shall provide package of certif ication documentation to the daa this certification package shall include 1 the ssp 2 the test plans if system testing is required 3 the test results or at the daa s discretion summary of the test results 4 statement that the system implements the required security safeguards as described in the ssp 5 an identification of any additional safeguards required by the daa 6 an identification of factors mitigating poten tial risk and 7 recommendation for daa approval or disapproval 9c4 the certification process culminates in an accreditation decision by the daa 9d accreditation 9d1 overview 9d1a the accreditation of an is is the official management decision to operate an is in specified environment the certification findings for the is are the principal technical inputs to the accreditation decision therefor the daa is involved from the start of the system to ensure that accreditation goals are clearly defined daa assumes responsibility for the decision to allow an is to operate and therefore must be satisfied that the certification can support an inform ed decision the accreditation statement is the daas acceptance of responsibility for the appropriateness of is security as implemented risk management for official use only 94 for official use only 9d1b an is accreditation provides formal approval for an is to operate and identifies the following 9d1b1 stated operational concept and environm ent including mission criticality and characterization of user communities ie approximate number of users clearance formal access approvals needtoknow privileges 9d1b2 classification and sensitivity of the information on the is including specific applicable classifications compartments caveats control markings and special handling instructions that may be handled by the is 9d1b3 given confidentiality protection level 9d1b4 given integrity levelofconcern 9d1b5 given availability levelofconcern 9d1b6 specified operating conditions including prescribed safeguards 9d1b7 stated interconnections with ot her iss when applicable 9d1b8 specified period of time 9d1c daas accreditation of an is and its envir onment is an assertion of an acceptable level of security risk acceptable security risk is the expectation that an is will adequately protect against unauthorized access alteration or use of an iss resources and against denial of the iss services to authorized users this expectation is based on the assumption of continuous employment of administrative procedural physical personnel communications security emanations security and is security controls is security controls can be features of the so ftware hardware or firmware of an is or associated securityspecific devices 9d1d both iss under development and iss in ope ration can be accredited iss in operation

integrity and availability levelsofconcern respectively have been implemented 4 ensure that the applicable requirements specified in chapter 7 requirements fo r interconnected systems and advanced technology and chapter 8 administrativ security requirements have been implemented and 5 ensure that the re sidual risk is within acceptable limits an impartial party selected by the daa shall determine the level of residual risk the impartial party may not be the system devel opers however the ultimate responsibility for accepting the residual risk rests with the daa while the daa assumes formal responsibility for operating system and accepti ng the risk of such operation the data owner has statutory responsibility for the information processed on the system as such the data owner has the authority to revok permission to process information on the system if unsatisfied with the protection pr ovided by the system the data owner shall notify the paadaa of any decision to revoke access to information 9d3a accreditation of similar systems 9d3a1 at the daas discretion the daa can deter mine that systems in group are for accreditation purposes essentially the same systems can be considered as essentially the same if 1 the protection levels and the levelsofconcern are the same 2 the users have at least the required clearances and access approvals for all information on the systems 3 the systems are processing the same levels and specific sets of information 4 the system configurations are essentially the same and 5 the environments of the systems are essentially the same if the daa chooses to accredit this set of systems as unit then an ssp may be written and approved by the daa to cover all of the similar systems this type of approval applies only to syst ems operating at protection levels 1 and 2 chapter 3 and under the purview of single daa the ssp for these systems shall specify the information required for certification of each system to be accredited under this procedure the daa shall accredit the first system under the ssp all of the other individual systems to be operated under such an ssp shall be tested by the isso and certified by the issm as meeting the conditions of the approved ssp this certification in effect accredits the individual system to operate under the ssp the issm shall retain copy of each certification report with the approved copy of the ssp and make copy available to the daa 9d3a2 in determining whether two sets of systems are similar for the purposes of this section consideration must be given to any required changes to the ssp adding similar systems requires changes only in id entification such as location internal system configuration and so forth an other required changes such as administrative control outside the purview of single daa indicate that the systems are not similar within the meaning of this section for official use only risk management for official use only 97 9d3a3 master system

identity of all systems covered such listing can be as simple as reference to particular database containing the identifying information nd locations of applicable systems 9d3b sitebased accreditation 9d3b1 the daa may choose an alternate accredita tion approach that consolidates all systems at location into single management entity called site the size and bounds of each site are determined by th relationship of each system component to the infrastructure command lines of au thority and the span of control of the sites issm site accreditation begins with all systems at the site being evaluated and certified the site is then accredited as single entity and the issm may be delegated the authority to add more systems to the site 9d3b2 site security conops and site security architecture are required for sitebased accreditation and shall contain listing of all systems covered under the sitebased accreditation description of how the site complies with the requirements of this manual and wiring diagram showing external connections 9d3c interconnected systems 9d3c1 the accreditor for system that is to be connected to another system shall consider the security characteristics of the other system as well as the security characteristics of all systems directly connected to the ot her systems this has been described as considering conn ections one layer further if any of the systems that are one layer further are considered greater security risk eg having users of lower security level then the accreditor should consider increasing the protection level or integrity levelofconcern or both 9d3c2 the daa for each interconnected system is re sponsible for ensuring that all data is properly protected by each system that is directly connected to the daas system 9d3c3 the security requirements applicable to the interconnected systems are determined by the confidentiality protection level and the integrity and availability levelsofconcern of the interconnected systems chapters 4 5 and 6 and appendix d b their interface characte ristics chapter 7 and c their operational environment 9d3c4 an interconnection security agreement isa is required whenever an accredited system is connected to system accred ited by different daa the contents of such an isa are specified in appendix some types of interconnected networks particularly those that are community wide do not require formal isa in this case the function of the isa is handled with list of requirements to be satisfied prior to connection upon verification that the list has been satisfied the interconnection is made 9d3c5 chapter 7 of this manual contains further requirements for interconnected systems 9d4 accreditation decision based on all available documentation and mitigating factors the daa shall decide whether to grant risk management for official use only 98 for official use only 9d4a accreditation approval for the syst em to operate as certified 9d4b accreditation disapproval including recommendations and time lines for correcting specified deficiencies 9d4c interim approval to operate identifying the steps and any additional controls to be completed prior to full accreditation 9d4c1 the daa may grant interim approval to opera system to meet written validated requirements or to permit major c onversion of system this interim accreditation may be granted for up to 180 days and can be renewed once for an additional 180 days by the end of the second 180day period the system shall either be accredited or cease operation 9d4c2 protection measures specified by the daa shall be in place and functioning during the period of interim approval 9d4c3 system that is under development or ma jor modification and is expected to be under development or major modifica tion for an extended period can be accredited to operate in such an environment such an accreditation shall include detailed descriptions of ch anges or types of changes that would not require additional daa approvals and changes or types of changes that would require additional daa approvals 9d5 invalidation of an accreditation an accreditation immediately becomes invalid whenever detrimental securityrelevant changes occur to any of the following the required protection level the operational environment the operational concept or the interconnections any nondaaapproved security relevant changes to the is may result in the invalidation of the accreditation 9d6 withdrawal of accreditation 9d6a the daa shall withdraw accreditation and suspend operation if the security measures and controls established nd approved for the system do not remain effective 9d6b the daa shall withdraw accreditation when the system is longer required to process sap information or if the ope rational need for the system longer outweighs the risk of operating the system 9d7 reevaluation of an accreditation 9d7a an accreditation shall be reevaluated within three years after it is issued or whenever any securityrelevant change occurs an accreditation shall immediately be reevaluated upon detrimental securityr elevant change in the threat to or vulnerability of the system change to the technical or non technical security requirements or significant increa in the level of residual risk 9d7b reevaluation of an accreditation involve s determination by the daa based on recommendation by the issm whether the original accreditation is still valid the daa can reaccredit the system or require further action for official use only risk management for official use only 99 9e the certification and accreditation ca process 9e1 the ca process from initial certification and accreditation to the withdrawal of accreditation covers the entire life cycle of an is the ca process depends upon careful identification of the securityrelevant aspects of an is complete is certification considers large number of factors associated with the is and its operational environment these factors in clude identification of the daa mission criticality functional requirements is securi ty boundaries applicable security policies security conops is configuration is components user characteristics and authorizations eg includes foreign nationals integrees contractors is applications sitefacility locations external interfaces and interconnections pr otection level levels of concern classification of th data and associated caveats is and data ownership risk analysis including threat and vulnera bility assessments and countermeasure implications and counterintelligence aspects 9e2 this section discusses the points in the is life cycle both development and operation at which the requirements of this document are usually applied 9e2a systems under development the various phases of system development are described below and depicted in table 91 9e2a1 design and development phase 9e2a1a the confidentiality protection level and the availability and integrity levelsofconcern are determined see chapters 4 5 and 6 for specific requirements 9e2a1b the security requirements are defined using the matrices and requirements tables in this document 9e2a1c the threats to an is and its vulnerabilities to the threats are identified all known hardware software firmware operational and environmental vulnerabilities are identified determination is made whether or not the requirements of this manual satisfactorily mitigate the vulnerabilities if they do not it may be necessary to specify additional security requirements 9e2a1d the ssp for the is is developed and submitted to the daa or daa representative for approval this step is prerequisite for starting the iss fabrication and production phase 9e2a2 first test and evaluation i phase during i the certification test plan and test procedures are developed the certification test plan outlines the is certification test it describes the test sets needed to demonstrate that the is implements its security requirements the plan also gives specific guidelines for conducting the tests certifica tion test procedures expand the test set descriptions into stepbystep descriptions of the security requirement tests 9e2a3 second test and evaluation ii phase 9e2a3a most of the ca process is conducted during ii once functional testing is complete the security test and evaluation is conducted based on the certification test plan and test procedures shortfalls and vulnerabilities are risk management for official use only 910 for official use only identified and risks are analyzed the outcome of the risk analysis is used to develop plan to address shortfalls the plan includes actions required to fix or work around particular shortfalls the ce rtification package see paragraph 9c above is then prepared and submitted to the daa 9e2a3b the daa reviews the certification packag and uses its information as the basis for the accreditation decision the daa considers all relevant factors in determining whether to accredit system these factors include security environment system mission availa bility and cost of alternative countermeasures and residual risks th daa may also consider factors that transcend security such as program and schedule risks 9e2a4 operations and maintenance om phase changes to the iss security structure may require recertification and reaccr editation see paragraphs 9c and 9d above 9e2a5 disposal phase when the is is longer required the process ends with its secure disposal 9e2b operational systems these systems sha ll be accredited under the requirements of this document all of the steps listed in paragraph 9e2a bove will be conducted except for disposal this process will be conducted under the om phase prudent risk management dictates that careful consideration be gi ven before adding expensive additional safeguards to system that s an extensive history of operation with effective security daas accrediting existing sy stems are strongly encouraged to give appropriate weight to the sy stems operating history 9f ca process exceptions 9f1 limitations in resources and technical capabilities may prevent the satisfaction of all security requirements without introducin g unacceptable delay in achieving the operational requirements that the system wa s intended to satisfy therefore daas are authorized to grant written exceptions to some security requirements identified in this manual under the following conditions for the purposes of this manual an exception indicates that the implementation of one or more security requirements is temporarily postponed and that satisfactory substitutes for the requirements may be used for specified period of time this is in contrast to waiver that implies security requirement has been set aside and need not be implemented at all for

9f2a development of system secu rity plan including users security guide when applicable 9f2b implementation of security training and awareness program 9f2c compliance with all applicable physical personnel and communications security requirements 9f2d the appointment of an isso 9f2e completion of risk manageme nt requirements described in paragraph 9b above the certification process describe d in paragraph 9c above and the formal acceptance of the risk of operation by the designated accr editing authority as specified in paragraph 2b4 above 9g special categories of iss 9g1 general 9g1a this subsection describes veral categories eg dedicated servers embedded systems tactical systems of iss that can often be adequately secured without implementation of all the technical features specified in chapters 4 5 and 6 these systems are not exceptions or special cases of the requirements specified in chapters 4 5 and 6 9g1b unthinkingly applying the technical security requirements specified in chapters 4 5 and 6 to these iss could re sult in unnecessary costs and operational impacts in general the technical question is where when and how to apply given set of safeguards rather than whether to apply the safeguards for many of these special iss such as dedicated servers and tactical data ac quisition and embedded systems the physical security protecti ons for the is provide the required access control while the application running on the platform provides the required user separation 9g1c these special systems still must underg the ca process including risk management described earlier in this chap ter key part of that ca process for these systems is determining whether all of the technical features specified in chapters 4 5 and 6 are applicable 9g2 dedicated servers 9g2a certain specialized iss when acting as part of network as dedicated servers may need fewer technical security countermeas ures these iss have the characteristics listed below 9g2a1 user code is present on the is for official use only risk management for official use only 913 9g2a2 only is administrators and maintainers can access the system 9g2a3 the is provides noninteractive services to clients eg packet routing or messaging services 9g2a4 the hardware andor application providing network services otherwise meets the security requirements of the network 9g2a5 the risk of attack against the secu rity support structure using network communications paths is low 9g2a6 the risk of attack against the security support structure using physical access to the system itself is sufficiently low 9g2b the platform ie hardware and operatin g system on which the dedicated server runs usually needs meet more than prot ection level 2 security requirements the dedicated server may have large number of clients ie individuals who use the servers functional capabilities in severely constrained way the server application itself will have to provide the more stringent technical protections appropriate for the systems protection level and operational environment assu rances appropriate to the protection level and levelsofconcern for the is shall be implemented 9g2c an is that does have general users or does execute general user code is not dedicated server within the meaning of this section and so shall meet all security requirements specified for its protecti on level and operational environment 9g2d the term dedicated server is not intended to limit the applicability of this section to systems that have traditionally been referred to as servers for example messaging system implemented on generalpurpose co mputer platform could be accredited under this manual and if such system m eets the specifications in above the systems technical requirements could be characterized by this section 9g2e the use of the above technical security requirements does not imply any relaxation in other security requirements eg ph ysical and communications security requirements which are determined by the information handled or protected by the is changes to technical requirements are predicated upon adequate application of physical security and other appr opriate security disciplines 9g3 embedded and specialpurpose iss some iss have general users are incapable of alteration by users and are designed and implemented to provide very limited set of predetermined functions for such iss if the daa determines that the applications running on the is provide an adequate level of security then the security requirements specified in chapters 4 5 and 6 do not apply 9g4 tactical or deployable systems tactical system may be part of fixed location or maintained in deployable configuration so that it can be moved quickly to another location to support operational mission require ments the system can operate in standalone mode or be attached via communi cations to mobile or fixed facility under an extended lan or wan configuration tacti cal systems shall provide the appropriate protection level and levelsofconcern base d upon the operating environment network connection requirements portability and degree of access to other systems the protection level and levelsofc oncern shall be applied while the system is ingarrison risk management for official use only 914 for official use only intransit andor deployed the daa may re quire additional security requirements or safeguards for tactical systems while int ransit or in the deployed environment 9g5 iss with group authenticators 9g5a many of the security measures specified in this manual assume that an is includes an acceptable level of individual accountability this is normally assured by the use of unique user identifiers and authenticators operationally the design of some iss necessitates more than one individual using the same identifierauthenticator combination such situations are often re ferred to as requiring the use of group authenticators 9g5b in general the use of group authenticators pr ecludes the association of particular act with the individual who initiated that act in turn this can preclude assignment of responsibility and can exacerbate the difficu lties involved in inci dent investigation daas shall avoid situations in which the gr oup authenticator is effectively the sole access control mechanism for the system use of group authenticators for broader access after the use of unique authenticator for initial identification and authentication carries much less risk th use of group authenticators shall be explicitly authorized by the daa 9g5c positions and applications requiring the use of group authenticators shall be discussed in the ssp 9g6 information systems using periods processing 9g6a an is is said to operate in periods pr ocessing environment if it is appropriately sanitized between operations in differing protection level periods or with differing user communities or data 9g6b as long as the sanitization procedures between each protection level segment have been approved by the daa based on guid elines from the data owners or responsible officials the is need meet only the security requirements of each processing period while in that period if the sanitization procedures for use between periods are approved by the daas the curity requirements for given period are considered in isolation without consider ation of other processing periods such sanitization procedures shall be detailed in the ssp 9g6c under periods processing the highest sensitivity level and the most restrictive data processed on the system will determine the daa the daa shall coordinate authorizations for using the system at lower or less restrictive levels 9g7 singleuser standalone iss extensive tec hnical safeguards are normally inappropriate and inordinately expensive for singleuse r standalone iss daas can approve administrative and environmental protections for such iss in lieu of technical safeguards except for systems that operate in periods processing environment as specified above iss that have one user at time but have total of more than one user are multiuser iss and the
