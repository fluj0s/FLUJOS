helpful in fo recasting the economy is thus of interest two economic indicators that get lot of ttention because of their presumed value as leading indicators of economic conditions attempt to measure the relative optimism of consumers about current econo mic conditions and prospects one of these indicators is the index of consumer sentiment published by the university of michigan survey research center and th other is the consumer confidence index published by the conference board both indexes are based on data collected in monthly survey the michigan survey contacts 500 households by tele phone the conference board contacts 5000 households by mail of which about 3500 typically resp ond in both surveys five questions are asked two of which have to do with curre nt economic conditions and three of which have to do with expectati ons for the economic outlook each of the survey questions is multiple choice while intuitively it makes sense that consumer attitudes would affect spending decisions there remains uncertainty regarding the theoretical connection between the attitude indexes and spending that makes it difficult to interpret individual observations and shortrun va riations in the indexes these indicators are not apparently insign ificant on their own and in concert with other economic variables they have been shown to contribute to forecasts of future consumer spending and hence of overall economic growth but their contribution may be somewhat more mode st than the attention they get would suggest this report explains how these two indexes measuring consumer

discusses why they might be expected to predict consumer behavior and examines their contributions to economic forecasts calculation of the indexes both indexes are based on data collected in monthly

two of which have to do with curre nt economic conditions and three of which have to do with expectati ons for the economic outlook each of the survey questions is multiple choice the michigan survey the michigan index of consumer sentiment is based on the answers to the following five questions we are interested in how people are getting along financially these days would you say that you and your family living there are better off or worse off financially than you were year ago bettersameworse now looking ahead do you think that year from now you and your family living there will be better off financially or worse ff or just about the same as now bettersameworse now turning to business conditions in the country as whole do you thinkthat during the next twelve months we ll have

questions ar converted into index numbers by subtracting the proportion of negative responses from the proportion of positive responses and adding that to 100 the inde x is then expressed relative to its value in base year which is set equal to 100 the current base year for the michigan consumer sentiment index is 1966 1966100 so that the index for any given period expresses consumer attitudes re lative to what they were in 1966 like any index it is not measured in any specific units but rather indicates only the extent to which measured consumer sentiment is rising or falling over time the surveys of consumers program at the university of michigan estimates that the index of consumer sentiment has 95 confidence interval of plus or minus 33 index points that means that given the way the sample is constructed the estimate is within 33 index points of its true value for the entire population represented by the sample the 95 confidence interval for monthtomonth changes in the index is 48 points in other words for change in the index to be c onsidered statistically significant it must be greater than 48 index points2 the conference board survey the conference board index of consumer confidence is based on the answers to the following five questions how would you rate the present gene ral business conditions in your area goodnormalbad six months from now do you think business

somewhat from the michigan index the conference board index is calculated by dividing the percentage of positive respons by the sum of the positive and negativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31942crs3 response percentages the result for give n period is then expressed relative to its value in the base year which is 1985 1985100 the two indexes are not directly comparab for one thing they do not measure exactly the same thing the index levels are also different because they have different base years because they are calculated differently monthtomonth changes are not directly comparable for given change in consumer attitudes the conference board index will tend to change more than will the michigan index historical comparison given the nature of these indicators ther is longterm trend in either series figure shows both indexes since 1978 while the two indexes may differ with respect to the magnitude of changes in consumer attitudes they do not seem to disagree for the most part as to whether consumers are becoming more or less sanguine about the economy figure 1 consumer attitude indexes sources conference board university of michigan survey research center given the subjective nature of responses to these surveys it may be unwise to read too much into comparisons of index vels over long intervals if for example the population has become more sophisticat ed with regard to economic matters it may be that at different points in time similar economic cond itions yield different survey responses in both surveys two of the five questi ons relate to curre nt economic conditions and three relate to economic prospects of the three questions related to economic prospects it is unclear what information c onsumers take into account in forming their views it is likely

spending if so why the american economic review dec 1994 pp 13971408prospects are influenced by other econo mic indicators such as unemployment or interest rates consumer attitudes and the economy what is the connection given the attention paid to each release of these consumer attitude indexes it seems to be presumed that they are economically significant but if these indexes do provide useful information about the economic outlook what is the connection the reason these indexes were developed is that it was believed that consumer spending was in some part dependent on consumer attitudes in particular it was believed that spending on discretiona ry items depended on income and job prospects it is unclear however how consumer attitudes influence spending decisions without some theoretical connection betw een consumer attitudes and actual economic events any correlation between these indexes and economic growth might be dismissed as coincidental the basic economic model used to expl ain consumer beha vior relies on the assumption that individuals seek to avoid substantial variations in their living standard over the course of their lifetime in other words it is assumed that in order to insulate consumption from fluctuations in income individuals prefer to vary their saving rate thus early in their careers they will tend to be relatively low savers and consume most of if not more than their income peak earning years will tend to be years of relatively high saving rates and in retirement saving will decline again if that simple model is correct it provides little basis for expecting variations in consumer attitudes to anticipate changes in consumption spending but it may be that not everyone behaves in this way it has been suggested for example that those who are unable to borrow against future income and who desire to consume more than their income will tend to vary th eir consumption directly in response to variations in income if changes in overall consumer attitudes anticipate variations in income they will also tend to anticipate variations in the consumption spending of this group3 there is another explanation for why changes in consumer attitudes might foretell variations in consum ption spending in addition to using saving to insulate consumption levels from expected lifetime variations in income some saving may be motivated by uncertainty this is usually referred to as precautionary saving households that save in an ticipation of the unexpected might be prompted to savehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31942crs5 more in times of declining consumer confidence in this way decline in consumer confidence might be associated with an increase in precautionary saving and slowdown in consumer spending changes in consumer attitudes might be expected to affect some types of consumer spending more than others for example spending on those goods and services often considered to be necessities might be less likely to change in response to the shifting moods of consumers discretionary spe nding is believed to be more sensitive to shifts in consumer atitudes for the most part the indexes are taken at face value as just one of many indicators available to analysts it is unclear however what influences the attitudes measured by these surveys if consum er attitudes simply reflect other economic indicators reported in the media then it is unlikely that consumer attitude indexes would yield any information not already inherent in those statistics economic forecasts by both government agencies as well as private concerns are also widely reported consumer attitudes may be influenced by thes forecasts and thus reflect what more sophisticated observers alr eady believe they know about the economic outlook are the indexes meaningful while the attention devoted to the release of these indexes suggests that they are of considerable importance any real valu they may have depends on whether or not they contain any useful information not inhe rent in other objectiv indicators their significance depends on how much of contribution they make to forecasts of the economy even if these indexes can make some contribution to economic forecasts their usefulness may be limited to the very s hort run it seems unlikely that consumer attitudes could be useful in forecasting mo re than few quarters into the future beyond that time horizon forecasters must make assumptions about what consumer attitudes are likely to be difficult task given the limited understanding of the factors that influence those attitudes number of studies have tried to measure any possible contribution of consumer attitude indexes to forecasts of the economy in some cases the direct relationship between consumer confiden ce and various measures of consumer spending was examined other studies looked to see if consumer confidence contributed anything new to equations which explained variations in consumer spending using number of other economic variables many economic models rely on an quation which explains current consumer spending using consumer spending in pr evious periods as well as wealth andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31942crs6

change in wealth that is perceived to be permanent is likely to affect consumer spending income is included to account for those who are not able to borrow or save and do not fit the typical lifecycle consumer some models also include an interest rate variable empirical studies study done by carrol fuhrer and wilc ox attempted to test whether or not changes in consumer sentiment forecas ted changes in consumer spending5 the study found that by itself lagged values of consumer sentiment could explain about 14 of variations in real personal consumption expenditures but there is less evidence that the sentiment index reveals information not inherent in other economic indicators when added to an equa tion relying on other economic variables6 the sentiment index explained only an additional 3 of variations in consumer spending carroll et also cast doubt on some of the theories that have been advanced regarding the connection between cons umer attitudes and economic performance they point out for example that an increase in uncertainty may prompt contemporaneous increase in precautionary saving and thus drop in consumption spending but that does not necessa rily imply drop in future growth rates of consumption spending just lower level of consumption if consumer sentiment measures uncertainty then drop in the sentiment index might indicate simultaneous drop in consumption gr owth but subsequent recovery in study published by the federal reserve bank of new york bram and ludvigson estimate number of equations in order to forecast consumer spending7 separate equations are specified for total consumer spending as well as for selected categories such as spending on motor ve hicles durable goods and services the authors then added measures of consumer attitudes to the equations to see if they improved the equations forecasts curiously the authors found that adding the michigan sentiment index did not improve the equations ability to forecast to tal consumer spending but that

ppthe conference board confidence index di d specifically adding data on four successive quarters of consum er confidence explained an additional 9 of the next quarters variation in tota l consumer spending of the other categories the improvement was slightly less except for dur able goods less motor vehicles in which case the addition of the confidence index explained an additional 15 of the variation in spending the authors sugge st that the difference between the two indexes is due to the differences in the questions they ask they also indicate that it is unclear whether or not the attitudes revealed by the surveys are simply predicting future economic growth or are actually the reason for it in study published by the brookings institution howrey examined how well the sentiment index predicted future changes in consumer spending as well as whether or not the index could be used to predict business cycle turning points the beginnings and endings of ex pansions and contractions8 howrey found that there was statisti cally significant relationship between monthly variations in consumer sentiment and future variations in the growth rate of consumer expenditures but while the relationship was significant there was so much instability in the correlation as to make it difficult to draw much useful information from any single observation howrey also found that the sentiment i ndex both on its own and in conjunction with other economic indicators was sign ificant indicator of the likelihood of an economic recession within the next one to f our quarters the other indicators were the conference boards index of leading indicators the difference between long and shortterm interest rates and the new york stock exchange composite price index paper by souleles published by the national bureau of economic research examined the usefulness of the cons umer sentiment index in forecasting expenditures9 interestingly souleles points out that each respondent to the michigan survey gets an equal weight in the overall sentiment index but that they do not each account for an equal share of c onsumption spending thus respondents who spend less than average receive greater weight in the index than might be appropriate and those who sp end more than average are under represented in the index that could result in bias in the index depending on how these two groups attitudes differ souleles found that consumer sen timent was useful in for ecasting consumer expenditures even in conjunction with number of other economic variableshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31942crs8 10 maria ward otoo consumer sentiment and th stock market board of governors of the federal reserve system nov 1999 19 ppexamining cross sections of the survey data he also found th at sentiment was not heterogeneous but rather that certain demographic groups exhibited different tendencies for example highincome households nded to underestimate future economic growth and lowin come households tended to overestimate it in the aggregate relatively high levels of confidence tended to be associated with lower saving rates and vice versa suggesting th at variations in precautionary saving had lot to do with the effects of changes in consumer sentiment on spending although it remains unclear what dete rmines consumer attitudes paper published by the board of g overnors of the federal rese rve board looked to see if the ups and downs of the stock market had any effects on either the michigan or the conference board indexes10 there are two reasons why stock prices might be expected to influence consumer attitudes first there is the direct wealth effect if an increase in stock prices is higher or lower than was expected the effects on household wealth might be reflected in cons umer attitudes sec ond stock prices are widely understood to be leading indicator of economic activity it might be that households are simply taking their cue fro m variations in stock prices if for example they see rising stock prices as leading indicator of rising income that might tempt them to increase spending in the fed study otoo found that the sen timent of households that did not own stock responded in much the same way to changes in stock prices as did the sentiment of households that did own stoc k that suggests that consumers tend to view stock price movement s as leading indicator of economic conditions conclusions measures of consumer attit udes get considerable medi attention with each new monthly release is th at attention warranted while intuitively it makes sense that consumer attitudes would affect spending decisions there remains uncertainly regarding the theoretical connection between the attitude indexes and spending that makes it difficult to interpret individual observations and shortrun va riations in the indexes these indicators are not apparently insign ificant on their own and in concert with other economic variables they have been shown to contribute to forecasts of future consumer spending and hence of overall economic growth but their contribution may be somewhat more modest than the attention they get would suggesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31942crs9 it is also unclear what factors c onsumers consider in assessing economic conditions and prospects measures of consumer attitudes do seem to be source of useful information above and beyond what is inherent in other variables such as income and interest rates but given the number of important factors that affect consumer spending looking at measures of consumer attitudes alone and apart from other economic events might give misleading impression
