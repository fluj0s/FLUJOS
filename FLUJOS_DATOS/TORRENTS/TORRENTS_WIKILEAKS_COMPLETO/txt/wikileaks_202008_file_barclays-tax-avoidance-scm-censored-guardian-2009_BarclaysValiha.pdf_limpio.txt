1 memo to scm approvals committee from iain abrahams date 12 october 2007 subject approvals paper project valiha barclays capital 1 summary structured capital markets scm is seeking approval for project valiha the transaction with credit suisse in the uk the counterparty barclays bank plc barclays is currently party to number of sterling denominated fixed floating interest rate swaps with two of its affiliates cayco1 cayman incorporated uk tax resident subsidiary and uksub2 uk incorporated and tax resident subsidiary since these interest rate swaps were entered into sterling interest rates have moved such that they are now standing at material gain for barclays of 3814m the terms of the interest rate swaps are such that when considered together barclays has an economic exposure akin to fixed rate amortising loan the proposed transaction will involve transferring the value in these swaps from barclays to the counterparty without triggering taxable gain although it is proposed that the transaction will involve all of the interest rate swaps between barclays and cayco1 tranche 1 and between barclays and uksub2 tranche 2 for simplicity the transaction description and detailed analyses in this paper will refer only to the entities and instruments relating to tranche 1 unless specifically stated otherwise economic benefit the interest rate swaps between barclays and its affiliates are 3814m in the money for barclays across tranche 1 and tranche 2 the economic benefit of the transaction is derived from the barclays groups ability to transfer the fair value gain on these interest rate swaps which is currently unrealised for uk tax purposes to the counterparty without triggering taxable gain barclays is entitled to 625 of such benefit it should be noted that the benefit arises to barclays on posttax basis and to the counterparty on pretax basis which results in pte benefit split of approximately 70 30 100 of the barclays benefit will arise in 2007 2 the key financial data is set out below please see section 9 for summary of the transaction economics and the impact of varying provision levels if any pre provision if any post provision if any assumes

cayman incorporated uk tax resident investment company affiliate of barclays investco owns all of the ordinary share capital in cayman incorporated uk tax resident subsidiary cayco1 both investco and cayco1 have sterling functional currency and prepare accounts under uk gaap and ifrs respectively 214 barclays owns 2000m of redeemable preference shares in cayco1 the class prefs 4 215 barclays also owns all of the ordinary share capital in an existing uk incorporated and uk tax resident subsidiary parent parent has sterling functional currency and prepares its accounts under uk gaap parent owns all of the ordinary share capital in two existing cayman incorporated and uk tax resident subsidiaries sub1 and sub2 sub1 and sub2 both have sterling functional currencies and prepare their accounts under uk gaap 216 in march 2007 cayco1 received 48m the then market value to acquire ten out of the money sterling denominated interest rate swaps the irsas from its wholly owned uk incorporated and uk resident subsidiary uksub1 not shown subsequently sterling interest rates moved such that in aggregate the irsas were standing at loss of 186m in cayco1 at that time cayco1 entered into set of ten swaps with barclays the irsbs and together with the irsas the irss such that barclays had an economic exposure akin to that of fixed rate amortising loan of 186m 217 barclays designated the irss as posttax fair value hedges of its investment in the class prefs cayco1 has made reg 65b election 218 since march 2007 interest rates have moved further such that barclays in the money position under the irss is 1907m 219 in october 2007 barclays capitalised parent with 100k of redeemable preference shares the parent prefs parent then capitalised sub1 and sub2 with 95k and 5k of redeemable preference shares respectively the sub1 prefs and the sub2 prefs 2110 sub1 and sub2 used the capitalisation proceeds of the sub1 prefs and the sub2 prefs to form an english limited partnership elp under the limited partnership agreement the lp agreement sub1 holds the lp1 interest and sub2 holds the gp interest in elp the lp1 interest and the gp interest are entitled to 95 and 5 respectively of elps profits and losses and elps assets on winding upupon leaving the partnership sub2 as general partner holds 100 of the voting rights in elp 2111 barclays then made 120m loan to elp the barclays loan which elp used to acquire 120m of gilts 22 proposed transaction 221 on the first day of closing day 1 barclays will enter into novation agreement with cayco1 and sub1 whereby it will novate its in the money legs of the irss to sub1 in exchange for 1907m being the market value of the irss sub1 will use the proceeds from issuing an additional 1907m of sub1 prefs to parent to fund its payment to barclays for acquisition of the irss the novation payment 222 the following day day 2 sub1 and cayco1 will agree to novate the irss to elp and sub2 will make cash contribution to elp of 15m in exchange for which elp will credit the capital account of sub1 with 1907m reflecting the fair value of the irss contributed and will credit the capital account of sub2 with 15m the terms of the lp agreement will be amended to entitle the lp1 interest holder to preferred entitlement on liquidation the lp1 preferred of 1623m with the rest of elps residual assets being distributed in proportion to the profit sharing ratio of 95 5 223 elp will draw up management accounts for the accounting period ended on day 2 224 on the final day of closing day 3 counterparty will subscribe for 1827m limited partnership interest in elp the lp2 interest which will entitle counterparty to 95 of elps profits and losses and elps assets on winding up after taking into account the lp1 preferred the lp2 interest holder will have voting rights but will have the right to retire from the partnership on 5 business days notice in exchange for 5 cash proceeds equal to its share of the fair value of elps net assets the termination entitlement 225 the lp2 interest will also be redeemable at fair value at the option of sub2 on behalf of elp on 5 business days notice 226 sub2 will continue to hold 100 of the voting rights in elp however the proportion of profits and losses and assets on winding upretirement from the partnership to which the lp1 interest and the gp interest are entitled will be reduced to 475 and 025 respectively 227 sub2 will enter into an agreement with barclays the management agreement to delegate the day to day running of elp to barclays subject to the provisions of the lp agreement which will be amended to specify that elp may only invest in specified classes of assets 228 elp will use the 1827m proceeds from issuing the lp2 interest to repay the 120m barclays loan with the balance being kept on deposit with barclays or invested in additional sterling denominated treasury bills or gilts 229 barclays and counterparty will each guarantee the performance andor obligations of their relevant affiliates under the transaction 2210 at some time after day 3 the irss will either mature or may be terminated prior to their scheduled maturity at the option of either cayco1 or sub2 as general partner of elp if the irss are terminated prior to their scheduled maturity cayco1 will borrow 1907m from barclays the cayco1 loan to pay elp the termination value of the irss the termination payment 2211 it is anticipated that sometime after the irss have matured or been terminated the transaction will be unwound counterparty may choose to retire from the partnership in exchange for cash proceeds in accordance with the lp agreement alternatively sub2 may give notice and redeem the lp2 interest or liquidate elp disposing of the assets and distributing the proceeds in the ratios provided for in the lp agreement 23 tranche 2 231 the irss relating to tranche 2 are currently and have always been between barclays and uksub2 rather than between barclays and cayco1 uksub2 is uk incorporated and uk tax resident company which prepares its accounts in sterling under uk gaap uksub2 is wholly owned subsidiary of cayco2 cayman incorporated uk tax resident affiliate of barclays therefore in applying the transaction steps described above the role of cayco1 will be carried out by uksub2 232 uksub2 currently holds the irss as hedge of floating rate certificates of deposit the frcds that it previously acquired from barclays barclays will redeem the frcds before the year end 6 3 economics and economic drivers 31 the tranche 1 and tranche 2 irss each currently have market value of 1907m respectively ie total in the money position for barclays of 3814m 32 currently barclays is taxed on the irss on an accruals basis the economic benefit of the transaction is derived from the fact that the barclays group is able to transfer the gain on the barclays legs of the irss to the counterparty without triggering taxable gain on the increase in fair value of the irss since their inception 33 100 of the transaction benefit is realised in 2007 and barclays is entitled to 625 of the benefit 34 the total tax capacity relating to the transaction of 3623m is determined as follows 341 1907m of tax capacity relating to the irss has been used in cayco1 in 2007 irrespective of whether the transaction takes place or not 342 1907m of tax capacity relating to the irss will be used in uksub2 when the frcds that uksub2 holds and which are currently being hedged in uksub2 by the irss are disposed of anticipated to be on 7 december 2007 and 343 191m of tax capacity will be created by the transaction in sub1 and sub2 this capacity will be created in 2007 344 thus viewed over the full term of the original swaps this transaction uses 3623m of capacity 35 refer to section 9 for summary of the impact of different provision levels if any on the transaction economics 36 assuming elps gilt portfolio is disposed of by 31 december 2007 at the latest the expected cost associated with holding the gilts should not exceed 300k 4 intended tax treatment 41 barclays tax analysis the transaction has been discussed with slaughter may and the following summary is supported by draft uk tax opinion attached at appendix 2 barclays 411 the irss are designated as fair value hedge of the class prefs therefore fair value movements on both the irss and the class prefs are recognised in the income statement the reg 65b election made by barclays is disregarded by virtue of reg 65aa therefore reg 9 should apply to bring the debits and credits arising on the irss into account on an accruals basis 412 paragraph 28 sch 26 fa2002 should apply to the transfer of the irss to sub1 such that barclays is treated as disposing of the irss for consideration equal to their notional carrying value as determined for tax purposes under an appropriate accruals basis therefore for tax purposes barclays should not recognise any gains or losses on the transfer of the irss to sub1 investco 413 the transaction should have material uk tax implications for 7 investco cayco1 414 the irss are recognised as derivatives with fair value movements recognised in the income statement cayco1 made reg 65b election and the irss are not designated as hedge of any instruments in cayco1 therefore reg 9 does not apply so that debits and credits are brought into account on fair value basis parent 415 the transaction should have material uk tax implications for parent sub1 416 once sub1 becomes party to the irss following the novation relevant credits and debits would be brought into account on an accruals basis paragraph 28 sch 26 fa2002 applies to the novation therefore for the purposes of determining such credits and debits sub1 should be deemed to have acquired the irss for their notional carrying value as determined by barclays under reg 9 on the date immediately before the novation ie approximately nil 417 debits or credits should be brought into account as result of novation of the irss to elp following the novation of the irss to elp sub1 should be deemed under paragraph 49 sch 26 fa2002 as owning the irss and will continue calculating credits and debits on the irss on an accruals basis bringing 95 of those credits and debits into account 418 following the admission of the counterparty as partner in elp the share of credits and debits brought into account as discussed in 417 above will be reduced to 475 in particular on termination of the irss sub1 will be taxable on 475 of the gain determined against notional carrying value of approximately nil sub2 419 debits or credits should be brought into account as result of the novation by sub1 of the irss to elp as partner in elp sub2 should be deemed under paragraph 49 sch 26 fa2002 as owning the irss and will calculate credits and debits on the irss on an accruals basis and bring 5 of those credits and debits into account 4110 following the admission of the counterparty as partner in elp the share of credits and debits brought into account as discussed in 419 above will be reduced to 025 similarly to paragraph 418 on termination of the irss sub2 will be taxable on 025 of the gain determined against notional carrying value of approximately nil on the basis that sub 2 acquired its interest in the irss under paragraph 28 sch 26 fa2002 elp 4111 elp is not taxable entity in the uk uksub2 4112 uksub2 accounts for the irss as hedge of an investment the frcds and recognises income on an accruals basis accordingly any credits and debits on the irss are brought into account on an accruals basis 4113 after termination of the irss fair value losses will be amortised and 8 brought into account over the remaining 19 year term of the frcds or if the frcds are disposed of or redeemed it is anticipated that the frcds will be redeemed before the year end the full fair value debits would be brought into account at such earlier time cayco2 4114 the transaction should have material uk tax implications for cayco2 42 counterparty tax analysis 421 counterparty is uk resident financial trader therefore after becoming partner in elp it should be taxable in respect of its interest in the irss on fair value basis under paragraph 50 sch 26 fa2002 43 disclosure regulations 431 the disclosure position is to be determined 5 tax risk having had discussions with slaughter and may the following is scms assessment of the key tax risks gain on novation to elp 51 the analysis of the transaction concludes that there should be credits or debits arising to sub1 as result of the novation of the irss to elp this analysis is based on the application of paragraph 49 sch 26 fa2002 which deems sub1 as being party to the irss held by elp the expected effect of this deeming is that either 511 sub1 is treated as party to the irss prior to and after the novation and therefore there is disposal of the irss by sub1 and therefore related transaction or 512 even if the novation were related transaction the uk gaap accounts prepared by sub1 on the basis of such statutory fiction would show credits or debits since sub1 would have to determine the effects of the disposal of the irss to itself 52 if the above analysis were not correct sub1 would have to determine credits arising on the novation of the irss to elp and for these purposes the carrying value of the irss would be based on the notional carrying value of the irss as determined for tax purposes by barclays under reg 9 on date immediately before the novation to sub1 ie approximately nil 23 53 the nature of the transaction means that there are number of debits and credits arising on mark to market basis in cayco1 or on an accruals basis in uksub2 it is necessary to consider the risk that paragraph 23 sch 26 fa2002 23 may apply to the transaction such that debits on the irss are disallowed 54 the irss were entered into as part of previously approved uk accretive transaction debits arising to cayco1 on the irss to date and to uksub2 on the eventual disposal of the frcds which the irss are hedging would be claimed regardless of whether the transaction is implemented or not 9 13 55 there are debits and credits arising to barclays and its uk tax resident affiliates on internal loans in particular on the barclays loan to elp it is necessary to consider the risk that paragraph 13 sch 9 fa1996 13 may apply to the transaction such that debits on the internal loans are disallowed 56 the barclays loan was made in order to enable elp to purchase the assets and the relevant debits will arise regardless of whether the transaction takes place furthermore for any debts arising to barclays and its affiliates in respect of the internal loans including the barclays loan there will be equal and opposite credits arising to barclays or its affiliates taxable in the uk 6 accounting 61 the below accounting treatments have been discussed with scm finance and will be confirmed with pwc prior to closing 62 it is intended that elp sub1 sub2 parent and uksub2 will prepare or continue to prepare accounts under uk gaap subject to approval by the barcap cfo confirmation that the relevant entities can prepare or continue to prepare accounts under uk gaap will be obtained from chris lucas group cfo prior to closing barclays solus 63 barclays prepares its solus accounts under ifrs 64 the irss have been designated as fair value hedge of the class prefs barclays treats the irss as derivatives and accounts for them on fair value basis with any fair value gains or losses recognised in the income statement under ias39 barclays is taxed in respect of the irss on an accruals basis accordingly barclays recognises deferred tax liability under ias12 on the difference between the carrying value of the irss and their tax base taking the tax expense to the income statement ias1258 65 on day 1 novation of the irss to sub1 will result in barclays derecognising them in its accounts at that time barclays will cease to be liable to tax in respect of the difference between the carrying and fair market values of the irss therefore the deferred tax liability will be reversed through the income statement cayco1 solus 66 cayco1 prepares accounts under ifrs 67 cayco1 treats the irss as derivatives under ias39 and accounts for them on fair value basis with any fair value gains or losses recognised in the income statement cayco1 is taxed on the irss on fair value basis with the relevant current tax impact recognised in the accounts on current basis 68 cayco1 will continue recognising the irss on the same basis after novation of the barclays legs to sub1 uksub2 solus 69 uksub2 prepares accounts under uk gaap and does not adopt frs26 610 uksub2 treats the irss as derivatives and accounts for them as hedge of 19 year loan asset ie the frcds on an accruals basis on disposing of the frcds any 10 unrealised loss on the irss is taken immediately to the profit and loss account 611 uksub2 is taxed on the irss on an accruals basis with the relevant current tax impact recognised in the accounts on current basis elp solus 612 elp prepares accounts under uk gaap and does not adopt frs26 613 elp recognises the gp interest as equity under frs25 since it is not redeemable at the option of the holder or at fixed future date upon the receipt of further contribution from sub2 on day2 the equity would be increased accordingly 614 elp recognises the lp1 interest as equity under frs25 since it is not redeemable at the option of the holder or at fixed future date on novation of the irss to elp and the corresponding increase in elps capital the equity would be increased accordingly 615 elp will recognise the lp2 interest as liability frs2518a ag25 as it is redeemable at any time on 5 business days notice at the option of the holder 616 elp treats the assets as debt investments with the relevant interest income recognised in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis 617 elp will recognise the irss as an investment in synthetic amortising fixed rate loan under frs5 with the respective interest income recognised on an accruals basis 618 taxes arising on the irss held by elp will be imposed on its partners sub1 and sub2 but will be born by elp under the terms of the tax payment agreement any payments made by elp under the tax payment agreement will be recognised as tax in its profit and loss account there will be timing differences arising to elp in respect of the irss and therefore deferred tax liability would be provided in this respect sub1 solus 619 sub1 prepares accounts under uk gaap and does not adopt frs26 620 sub1 recognises the sub1 prefs as liability under frs25 as they are redeemable at any time at the option of the holder on 1 business days notice 621 sub1 will treat the investment in the irss as an investment in synthetic amortising fixed rate loan under frs5 with the respective interest income recognised on an accruals basis 622 taxes imposed on sub1 in respect of its interest in elp as well as the payments received from elp under the tax payment agreement will be recognised as tax items in the profit and loss account there will be timing differences arising to sub1 in respect of the irss and therefore deferred tax liability would be provided in this respect 623 on day 2 sub1 will derecognise the irss and will instead recognise an investment in an affiliate at the carrying amount of the irss accordingly profits will be recognised on contribution of the irss to elp 624 on day 3 when counterparty subscribes for the lp2 interest sub1 will recognise an impairment loss in respect of its investment in elp sub2 solus 625 sub2 prepares accounts under uk gaap and does not adopt frs26 626 sub2 recognises the sub2 prefs as liability under frs25 as they are 11 redeemable at any time at the option of the holder on 1 business days notice 627 sub2 recognises the investment in elp at cost 628 on day 3 when counterparty subscribes for the lp2 interest sub2 will recognise an impairment loss in respect of its investment in elp parent solus 629 parent prepares accounts under uk gaap and does not adopt frs26 630 parent recognises the parent prefs as liability under frs25 as they are redeemable at any time at the option of the holder on 1 business days notice 631 parent recognises its investments in sub1 and sub2 at cost barclays consolidated 632 barclays prepares consolidated accounts under ifrs 633 barclays has sole control of parent sub1 sub2 elp uksub2 and cayco1 and therefore consolidates them as its subsidiaries under ias27 634 barclays treats the assets as financial assets available for sale under ias39 and therefore recognises them at fair value ias3946 with interest recognised in the income statement using an effective interest method as3955b and changes in fair value being recognised directly in equity 635 the current tax asset arising in cayco1 on the irss is currently recognised in the consolidated accounts as the current tax asset cannot be eliminated on consolidation the corresponding deferred tax liability in respect of barclays solus position in the irss is also currently recognised in the consolidated accounts 636 uksub2s ifrs equivalent accounts for consolidated purposes would show current tax asset in respect of the irss this current tax asset relates to the fair value loss in the irss which barclays will crystallise before the end of the year by redeeming the frcds that the irss are used to hedge as the current tax asset cannot be eliminated on consolidation the corresponding deferred tax liability in respect of barclays solus position in the irss is also recognised in the consolidated accounts 637 on day 1 once the irss are novated to sub1 barclays will reverse the deferred tax liability in respect of the irss and will provide for the deferred tax liability in respect of sub1s position in the irss for similar reasons to those set out in 635and 636above on day 2 barclays will reverse the deferred tax liability in respect of sub1s position under the irss and will instead provide for the deferred tax liability in respect of elps position in the irss 638 on day 3 following the admission of the counterparty as partner the terms and the scope of elps activities will be amended in accordance with the agreed deal terms and as result will become narrowly defined therefore elp will become sic12 entity from that point counterparty will become entitled to the majority of the benefits and exposed to the majority of the risks incident in the assets and the activities of elp accordingly barclays will cease consolidating elp in accordance with sic12 at that point barclays will be treated as having disposed of its subsidiary and will recognise profit on disposal of elp in the consolidated income statement equal to the excess of the disposal proceeds over the carrying value as calculated under ifrs of elps net assets ias2730 the carrying value of the consolidated net assets will include the deferred tax liability 12 recognised by barclays in respect of the irss held by elp 639 following the admission of the counterparty as partner barclays will recognise the investment in the lp1 interest and the gp interest as well as the liability under the irss at their respective fair values ias3943 640 there should be material differences between barclays consolidated ifrs analysis and its consolidated us gaap analysis 7 credit and market risk 71 due to the nature of the assets sterling denominated uk gilts with remaining maturity of 5 months the credit risk and market risk associated with the assets should not be material this was discussed and agreed with credit and market risk prior to acquisition of the assets by elp 72 sub2 wholly owned barclays subsidiary as gp will always have 100 voting control of elp in addition elp will repay the barclays loan using the proceeds from issuing the lp2 interest therefore there should be material credit risk on the barclays loan 73 in the event any credit approval is required for example in respect of the acquisition of additional gilts by elp this will be obtained by scm through gfrm via the normal process 74 the economic profile of the irss taken together will be equivalent to fixed rate amortising loan across both tranches of the transaction the total fair value of this loan is currently 3814m although there will be ongoing movements in the fair market value of the irssloan this is not expected to be material during the closing period whilst the volatility will affect the overall size of the transaction the variation will impact both barclays and the counterparty in accordance with the agreed benefit split 8 regulatory capital 81 basel i barclays solus 811 the additional parent prefs are treated as debt for regulatory purposes and therefore generate internal of 3814m on day 1 across the two tranches however also on day 1 the irss are novated from barclays to sub1 currently barclays is marking internal of 492m including addons in respect of the irss which will longer be necessary once they are novated to sub1 since the existing parent prefs generate internal of 100k on day 1 upon novation of the irss the overall internal position will be reduced by 1105m 812 on day 2 an additional 30m of internal across the two tranches will arise on the further capitalisation of parent ie the issue of 30m of additional parent prefs 813 upon counterparty subscribing for the lp2 interest barclays will guarantee the obligations of cayco1 and of uksub2 under the irss therefore on day 3 internal of 3814m will arise across tranche 1 and tranche 2 in respect of this exposure in the event the irss are terminated early the guarantee by barclays will longer be required however internal will arise on the cayco1 loan and also on any loan from barclays to uksub2 anticipated to be total of 3814m across the two tranches 814 the 120m internal arising on the barclays loan has been mitigated by 13 virtue of elp pledging the assets eligible collateral for regulatory purposes in support of its obligations under the barclays loan 815 in aggregate an additional 2739m of additional internal will arise as result of the proposed transaction steps such that the total internal position is 7659m treasury concession will be required for this internal large exposure subject to approval from barcap and group treasury to the extent that cash received by elp upon early termination of the irss is repatriated to parent parent may use these proceeds to partially redeem the parent prefs and hence reduce the amount of internal 816 the sub1 and sub2 capital accounts of 3815m and 30m respectively across both tranches will be treated as equity in their respective solus accounts for accounting and regulatory purposes barclays could unwind the structure and cause the lp1 interest and the gp interest to be redeemed on short notice within 10 business days therefore there should not be any issues in respect of connected lending of capital nature and hence deduction from solus capital elp should not be taxable entity for uk tax purposes therefore hmrc should not be creditor and elp should not have any other external senior creditors barclays consolidated 817 barclays currently consolidates cayco1 and uksub2 for regulatory purposes barclays will also consolidate parent sub1 sub2 and elp for regulatory purposes elp will continue to be consolidated after counterparty has subscribed for the lp2 interest since the barclays group will retain control of elp even though barclays will cease consolidating elp for accounting purposes 818 10 wras should continue to be marked on the assets since they comprise fixed rate zone central government paper with remaining maturity of less than one year in the event that elp uses the proceeds from issuing the lp2 interest and terminating the irss to acquire further gilts or uk treasury bills after repaying the 120m barclays loan since it is anticipated that these assets will also be 10 weighted up to 627m additional wras may arise 10 of 2 x 1827m 120m 3814m 819 to the extent the proceeds from issuing the lp2 interest and terminating the irss are simply put on deposit with barclays additional wras would arise 82 basel ii barclays solus 821 parent sub1 sub2 and elp will have their centre of management and interests in the uk and should fall within the ukig therefore there should be internal or wras on the parent prefs the sub1sub2 prefs sub1s capital account or sub2s capital account barclays consolidated 822 barclays will consolidate cayco1 uksub2 parent sub1 sub2 and elp for regulatory purposes elp will continue to be consolidated after counterparty has subscribed for the lp2 interest since the barclays group will retain control of elp even though barclays will cease consolidating elp for accounting purposes 823 the wras on the assets including any additional gilts or uk treasury bills acquired will be modelled using standard probability of default loss given default maturity and exposure at default inputs and is not expected to be significant given the nature of the assets 14 83 the regulatory capital reporting has been agreed with finance 9 provision 91 the provision level for the transaction has yet to be determined 92 the economic benefit of the transaction at
