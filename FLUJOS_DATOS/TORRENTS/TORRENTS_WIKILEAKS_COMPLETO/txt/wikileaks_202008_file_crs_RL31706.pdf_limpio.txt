consequently the conference report on hr 333 107th cong 1st sess 2001 did not come up for vote in either chamber2 little has changed in the economic and legal landscape that has fueled both support for and opposition to bankruptcy reform statistics to date for 2002 indicate that personal bankruptcy filings are at an all time high3 2002 also featured high profile bankruptcy filings by major corpor ations rising unemployment rates and rising health care costs the goal of proponents of consumer bankr uptcy reform is to make filing more difficult and thereby thwart bankruptcies of convenience to revive the social stigma of bankruptcy filing to prevent bankruptcy from being utilized as financial planning tool to determine who can pay thei r indebtedness and to ensure that they do and to maximize the di stribution to both secured and unsecured creditors opponents argue that making it more difficult to file will undermine the rehabilitative purpose of bankruptcy and have disparate impact on financially less sophisticated debtors including single parents and families with children they continue to believe that there is insufficient evidence of pervasive abuse to warrant major revisions to bankruptcy law httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31706crs2 4 in liquidation the debtor pledges all of his or her prebankruptcy assets to pay off pre bankruptcy debts in consumer

debtor can fund chap ter 13 plan for purposes of dismissal of chapter 7 case as substantial abuse the essen tial inquiry is whether the debtor has the ability to repay creditors with future income sufficiently to make chapter 7 filing substantial abuse there is requirement that debtor be eligible for chapter 13 relief and in some cases despite substantial abuse dismissal the debtor may not qualify under chapter 13 6 the bill directs the court to consider whethe r the petition was filed in bad faith or whether the totality of circumstances demonstrates abuse only when the means test does not apply or has been rebutted by the debtor 7 hrept 107617 at 106 8 id at 316since its introduction in 1998 the reform legislation has employed complex means test for prospective debtors to determine whether they may file under chapter 7 governing liquidation4 the legislation has ne ver proposed applying the preexisting less complicated and more discretionary standards for determining abuse by prospective chapter 7 debtors employed by some bankruptcy courts namely finding an ability to pay creditors sufficiently from future income5 although ability to pay may be considered by the court in limited circumstancesunder the bill the primary emphasis for pr esumption of abuse is the means test which takes formulaic approach to determining each debtors ab ility to pay past indebtedness from future income 6 failure to satisfy the means test is presumptive abuse of chapter 7 and the di squalified debtor ither must file for reorganization under chapter 13 or refrain from filing likewise since the original bills in troduction in 1998 the various versions of bankruptcy reform have incorporated many amendments but the legislation nevertheless retains core f eatures this report reviews

at httpwwwabiworldorgtablepdf the statutory language provides that the court shall presume abuse if the debtors current monthly income reduced by the amounts determined under clauses ii iii and iv and multiplied by 60 is not the lesser of i25 percent of the debtors nonpriority unsecured claims in th case or 6000 whichever is greater or ii 10000six months preceding bankruptcy minus living expenses results in the debtors having 16667 per month in excess of living expenses then abuse is presumed and the debtor may not file under chapter 7 if the debtor has 100 per month of excess income abuse is presumed if unsecured indebtedness is 24000 or less likewise for income in excess of 150 per month with unsecured indebte dness of 36000 or less9 the centerpiece of the means test howev er is the new method for calculating the debtors living expenses the test does not look at the debtors actual expenses it applies hypothetical expenses based upon the intern revenue services irs national standards and local standards the formula is complex and in addition to the national standards factors in other specific deductions which may be allowable eg child support and alimony reasona ble and necessary costs for the care of chronically ill or disabled family members actual costs of up to 1500 per year per child for costs to attend public or private school and payments to secured creditors the debtor may also deduct an additional allowance of up to 5 percent of the irs national standard for food and clot hing and actual expenses in categories specified as other necessary expenses issued by the irs for the area in which the debtor resides including excess housing nd utility costs thus abuse is presumed if debtors real income measured against the combination of hypothetical and real living expenses results in th monthly excess cited above all prospective debtors are subject to scrutiny under the means test although there is safe harbor from finding of abuse for individuals and families whose income is less than the applicable median state income level the bill provides variety of mechanisms for parties to challenge the debtors eligibility to file in accordance with the mean s test in many instances attorneys fees will be awarded to the prevailing party either creditor challenging the debtors qualification or the btor defending it new regulations for bankruptcy attorneys another important feature of the bill is the imposition of new controls on attorneys representing certain consumer debtors among controls are the following increased requirements for inves tigation and verification of the accuracy of the debtors fina ncial information and increased sanctions if the debtors chapter 7 filing proves to be ineligible under the means test if debtor loses motion to have

services owed to single creditor incurred within 90 days of the f iling and for cash advances and credit card charges for more than 750 incurred within 70 days of filing other categories of

chart infra one category of nondischargeable debt intende d to benefit the debtor is that for loan repayments to the debtors retiremen t savings or thrift plan the function of nondischargeability is to permit debtor who has borrowed from his or her retirement savings plan to continue to re pay the loan through employer withholding despite the bankruptcy filing the most controversial category of nondisc hargeable debt was that for violence against providers of lawful services reproductive health services in an earlier version of the legislation and for inten tional violations of protective orders and injunctions questions have been raised repeatedly about the scope and legal effect of this provision16 child support and alimony another contentious i ssue in the debate over bankruptcy reform is the effect it would have on the ability of families to collect child support and alimony which are defined as domestic support obligations17 supporters of the legislation point to the f act that these paymen ts are fully protected under the legislation indeed they are pr otected throughout the entire course of bankruptcy proceeding18 subtitle ii b of the bill deal s with priority child support19 the bill elevates domestic support obligati ons from seventh to first priority among unsecured claims against the debtor unde r current law the costs of administering the bankruptcy proceeding that is administrative expenses hold first priority this means that these expenses are paid first from any available assets of the bankruptcy estate the conference report recognizes however the fact that the trustees compensation is derived from marshaling the debtors assets and is treated as an administrative expense because trustees cannot be expected to expend effort to collect and distribute debtors assets with prospect of compensation the conference report creates superpriority which will allow them to be paid before domestic support creditors when they administe r assets that are otherwise available for domestic support20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31706crs6 21 id at 219 22 see eg rebecca m burns killing them with kindness how congress imperils women and children in

be excep ted from the automatic stay which stops all collection activities when debtor files in bankruptcy new notice requirements are imposed on trus tees in chapter 7 case trustee must advise domestic support creditor of the right to use the services of state child support enforcement agency he or she must report domestic support claim to the state child support agency including the name and address of the creditor and if the debtor receives bankruptcy discharge for nonsupport claims the trustee must report the debtors name address and employer to the state enforcement agency21 as the foregoing illustrates domestic support payments are fully protected against delay and discharge during and af ter bankruptcy proceedings but critics of the legislation still contend that singleparent families and children will be adversely affected by the bill22 among other things critics argue that making it more difficult to get bankruptcy relief and making more categories of debt nondischargeable under both chapters 7 and 13 will leave domestic support creditors in worse position outside of bankruptcy debtors who emerge from bankruptcy will have more creditors holding nondischargeable cl aims and in the competition for post bankruptcy assets or the ssets of those who refrain from filing or go underground domestic creditors may fare more poorly than commercial creditors since state support enforcement agencies will also st and in the shoes of domestic support creditor holding priority and nondischarg eable domestic support claims the debtor may owe money to them as well chapter 13 adjustment of debt s of an individual with regular income chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code governs consumer reorganization amendments to this chapter would be among the most farreaching of the proposed changes the goal of channeling debtors in to chapter 13 involuntarily is new to us bankruptcy code practice under current law debtors may choose this chapter voluntarily often to take advantage of unique provisions such as the ability to cure arrearages in and continue payment on home mortgage the debtor proposes reorganization plan which is generally pe rformed over threeyear period unless the court approves an extension to five years for cause two major changes to this chapter are fi rst as discussed bove debtors who are disqualified under the means test from f iling under chapter 7 will have choice but to file under chapter 13 or to refrain fro m filing second debt ors many of whom may have mandatory fiveyear plans may be required to adhere to living budgets based upon the same irs living standa rds employed in the means test23 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31706crs7 24 challenges to reasonably necessary expenses are determined by the bankruptcy court 25 hrept 107617 at 102currently chapter 13 debtor may be required to fund reorganization plan with projected disposable income for threeyear period disposable income is defined in the code as that reasona bly necessary for the debtors support24 the bill however defines reasonably necessary di sposable income by reference to the means test standards the bill expressly permits chapter 13 debtors to include health insurance costs in repayment plan if ch expenses are reasonable and necessary25 requiring chapter 13 debtors to live in accordance with hypothetical cost of living standards will be like the means test itself wholly new to bankruptcy practice chapter 13 debtors will also be limited in the extent to which they may reduce indebtedness on automobiles nd consumer goods currently chapter 13 debtor is permitted to bifurcate secured claim for an automobile or other consumer good into secured and unsecured claim the secured cl aim is valued at the fair market value of the secured property as opposed to the c ontract price of the item the debtor must repay the secured portion of the claim but may discharge the unsecured portion debtors ability to split the claim known as lien stripping will be reduced by the bill reducing the am ount owed on claims will not be permitted w ith respect to automobiles purchased within two and onehalf years before filing or for any other item purchased within one year of filing for any item the claim for which may still be bifurcated its value will longer be fair market value but will be its replacement or retail price thus in addition to enlarging the cat egories of nondischarg eable debt which would apply to all debtors the bill substantially curtails the scope of relief that is currently permitted in chapter 13 critics argue that the net result w ill not be greater repayment of creditor claims but an exceedingly high failure rate for reorganization plans by chapter 13 filers survey of selected provisions the legislation
