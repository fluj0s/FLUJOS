disabilities with free appropriate public education fape including special education and related services according to each childs individualized education plan iep or individualized family service plan ifsp states receive some federal aid under idea but are otherwise responsible for the expense of special education and related services one approach congress has taken to ease the burden on states and school districts of fulfilling these idea requirements is to allow medicaid to finance covered health services eg physical occupational and speech therapy and diagnostic preventive and rehabilitation services delivered to lowincome medicaideligible special education students g20g142g140g142g151g157g561g10g146g156g157g152g155g162g561 prior to 1988 medicaid did not pay for coverable services that were listed in childs iepifsp since special education funds were available to pay for these services and because generally with few explicit exceptions medicaid is always the payer of last resort congress changed the financing relationship between idea and medicaid in the medicare catastrophic coverage act of 1988 pl 100360 however there is some controversy about the exact nature of this legislative change idea requires states to establish interagency agreements to ensure that ideaeligible students receive the services to which they are entitled these agreements must include an identification of the financial responsibility of all relevant agencies idea regulations further stipulate that the financial responsibility of medicaid and other public insurers must precede the financial responsibility of the local education agency lea or the state agency responsible for developing the childs iep in other words medicaid is deemed to be the first payer in contrast according to officials with the centers for medicare and medicaid services cmsthe federal agency that administers the medicaid programthe 1988 law allows but does not require state medicaid agencies to pay for services included in an iepifsp 1 thus given cms interpretation of this law the idea requirement that medicaid be the first payer applies only to those states that have elected to pay for services listed in iepsifsps according to cms most states do pay for these services since 1988 other complicated issues surrounding the relationship between idea schools and medicaid have arisen while congress made it clear that medicaid funds can be used to pay for reimbursable schoolbased services rendered to idea children enrolled in medicaid at various points in time some members have expressed concern that some of these medicaid payments may be made improperly in 1999 and 2000 the senate finance committee asked the us general accounting office gao later renamed the government accountability office to examine medicaid schoolbased services and held two hearings on this subject 2 three main concerns were identified by gao billing practices for schoolbased administrative services coupled with uneven oversight of these practices by the heal th care financing administration hcfa now cms resulted in at least 2 of 17 states receiving improper payments 1 personal communication with cms

failed to account for variations in service needs among children and often lacked adequate documentation demonstrating that the benefits paid for were actually delivered in every case3 however both gao and hcfa believed that bundled rates if proper assurances can be built into the approach are the preferred method for leas to bill medicaid in some states school districts received little of the reimbursements claimed for schoolbased services because state agencies and private contractors hired by schools to assist in billing medicaid retained significant portions of federal payments for example seven states retained from 50 to 85 of total federal reimbursements for both health services and administrative activities some school districts paid private contractors contingency fees as high as 25 of federal payments for schoolbased administrative activities in the worse case reported schools received as little as 750 for every 100 claimed for services and activities performed in support of medicaideligible children in order for leas providing idearelated services to qualify for reimbursement under medicaid four conditions must be met 1 the child receiving the service must be enrolled in medicaid 2 the service must be covered in the state medicaid plan or authorized in federal medicaid statute 3 the service must be listed in the childs iep and 4 the lea or school district must be authorized by the state as qualified medicaid provider to help schools obtain medicaid reimbursement for health care services and also related administrative activities hcfa and later cms issued two manuals medicaid and school health technical assistance guide august 1997 and medicaid schoolbased administrative claiming guide may 2003 prior to the release of the 2003 guide on two occasions congress urged the administration to revise early drafts 4 the 2003 guide represents consolidation of existing requirements for administrative claiming and drew on the input from education community on the two earlier draft versions released in 2000 and 2002 some in the education field have questioned the usefulness of these guides5 g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 nationwide estimated medicaid expenditures for schoolbased services were 27 billion in fy2006 see table 1 roughly 19 billion or 69 of total expenditures was for medicaid benefits provided in schools and about 849 million or 31 was for schoolbased administrationtraining activities there was wide variation in spending patterns across states with respect to the proportion of expenditures for benefits versus administration and training among the 45 states reporting any schoolbased spending 14 had expenditures for benefits only at the other extreme six states reported schoolbased spending for administration and training only 3 bundled payments typically means fixed rate is paid for package of specific services made available to children with specific condition during set period of time eg month in may 21 1999 memorandum to state medicaid directors hcfa prohibited additional states from applying to use the bundled rate methodology 4

that medicaid claims for services provided in school settings have been prone to abuse and overpayments especially with respect to transportation and administrative activities as of november 2007 the hhs office of inspector general oig has published reviews of schoolbased claims in 22 states based on this and other research both the hhs oig and gao have reached similar conclusions6 for transportation services examples of inappropriate medicaid billing include 1 verification that transportation was in fact provided 2 medicaidcovered school health service other than transportation was not provided on the day that transportation was billed and 3 childfamily plans did not include recommendation for transportation services or there was iep or ifsp school districts may perform administrative functions for medicaid purposes such as outreach eligibility intake information and referrals health service monitoring and interagency coordination examples of inappropriate medicaid billing include 1 payments based on inaccurate time studies used to allocate the cost of these administrative activities across funding sources including medicaid 2 expenditures for school employees who do not perform medicaid administrative activities 3 expenditures for operating costs such as nursing supplies non medicaid outreach supplies and educationrelated expenditures 4 expenditures for personnel funded by other federal programs and 5 payments for personnel who render only direct medical services on december 28 2007 the bush administration published final rule 7 regarding medicaid payments for schoolbased administration and transportation first the rule would restrict federal payments for schoolbased administrative activities eg outreach service coordination referrals that may be conducted on behalf of children dually eligible for medicaid and idea as well as those eligible for medicaid only second the rule would restrict federal payments for certain transportation services provided to children dually eligible for medicaid and idea this rule supercedes prior guidance from cms on these issues and is estimated to reduce federal medicaid outlays by 635 million in fy2009 and by 36 billion over the period fy2009 fy2013 the congressional budget office cbo estimat that this final rule will reduce federal medicaid outlays by 42 billion over 5 years and by 102 billion over 10 years 8 recent congressional report indicates that this rule woul d result in the loss of roughly 32 billion over the next five years in 34 states affected by the rule that could provide such estimates9 cms indicated that school budgets for the 20072008 school year would not be affected by the rule according to cms federal medicaid reimbursement would longer be available for 1

inconsistent application of medicaid requirements by schools or 2 transportation from home to school and back for schoolaged children with an iep or ifsp because such transportation does not meet the definition of an optional medical transportation service nor is it necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the medicaid state plan many in the education and state medicaid communities are opposed to these cuts10 opponents argue that the rule 1 will reduce the availability of and access to needed health care for children 2 is inconsistent with decades of ap proved state plan amendments allowing federal funding of these administrative and transportation services and 3 falsely assumes that health care administrative activities performed by school personnel are inconsistent with the proper and efficient administration of the state medicaid plan because such activities improve childrens health reduce inappropriate medical care utilization and thus ultimately save money moreover additional federal funding for existing programs like idea or other new appropriations to offset these medicaid cuts are unlikely to be on the horizon while the final rule eliminates federal matching funds for certain schoolbased spending under medicaid other types of schoolbased expenditures remain reimbursable states may still claim federal matching dollars when schoolbased administrative activities are conducted by employees of the state or local medicaid agency for which proper oversight and allocation of costs to medicaid is more reliable according to cms in addition federal funding would still be available for administrative overhead costs eg patient followup assessment counseling education parent consultations and billing activities that are integral to or an extension of specified direct medical service to the extent that those costs are represented in the rate paid for such services and reimbursed at the applicable federal matching rate medicaid outreach and eligibility intake conducted by local or state medicaid employees would also remain reimbursable cms would continue to reimburse states for the costs of schoolbased direct medical services under idea that are covered in approved state medicaid plans and for transportation of schoolage children from school or home to nonschoolb ased direct medical service provider that participates in medicaid or from the nonschoolbased provider to school or home cms would also continue to reimburse states for transportation of children who are not yet school age from home to another setting including school and back to receive direct medical service as long as the visit does not include an educational component or activity unrelated to the direct medical service pl 110173 prohibited the secretary of hhs from restricting coverage or payments for school based administration and transportation under medicaid relative to policies in place on july 1 2007 this moratorium was effective until june 30
