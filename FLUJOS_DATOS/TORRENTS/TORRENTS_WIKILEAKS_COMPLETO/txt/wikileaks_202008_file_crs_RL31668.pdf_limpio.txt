summary the federal pell grant program author ized by the higher education act hea is the single largest source of grant aid for postsecondary education attendance funded by the fede ral government it is timated to provide nearly 14 billion in fy2007 to about 53 million underg raduate students for fy2007 the maximum pell grant was funde d at 4310 with the expiration of the hea the congress is likely to debate what changes may be needed in the pell grant program as part of its considera tion of hea reauthorization pell grants are needbased aid intende d to be the foundation for all federal student aid awarded to undergraduates eligibility is limited to undergraduates there is absolute income threshold that determines who is eligible and who is ineligible for pell grants nevertheless pell grant recipients are primarily low income in fy1999 an estimated over 90 of pell grant recipients considered to be dependent upon their pare nts had total parental in come below 40000 of pell grant recipients considered to be indepe ndent of their parent s over 90 had total income below 30000 among the issues that may be deba ted by the congress during the hea reauthorization process is the extent to which the pell grant program continues to act as the foundation for all federal needbas ed aid for undergraduates concern has been raised about the diminished role th at the pell grant may be playing for example needbased aid recipients are as likely to borrow subsidized loans under the federal stafford loan program as they are to receive pell grants this overarching issue may trigger considerati on of various steps to increase the amount of pell grant aid flowing to the neediest students this might include deliberation over raising the pell grant minimum award those with the smallest grants are the least needy of pell recipients converting the program into an entitlement possibly with higher annual maximum grants converting the program to an entitlement is also seen by some as response to the periodic uncertainty about the adequacy of the annual appropriation to meet program costs and resulting funding shortfalls other issues that may engage the congress include whether some elemen t of academic merit should be introduced into the process of determining pell eligibility and level of pell assistance this report will be upda ted to reflect major legisla tive

approximately 14 billion to about 53 million undergraduate students in fy2007 pell grants are needbased aid intended to be the foundation fo r all federal student aid awarded to undergraduates the us department of edu cation ed estimates that in fy2006 pell grants constituted approximately 17 of all federally supported aid including grants loans and work opportunities that benefit postsecondary education students at all levels1 the statutory authority for the pell grant program was most recently reauthorized by the college cost re duction and access ac t of 2007 pl 11084 through fy2017 however comprehensiv reauthorization of the hea has not occurred since the hea amendments of 1998 and s till awaits congressional attention most recently the hea was am ended and extended by the third higher education extension act of 2007 pl 110109 until march 31 20082 s i t deliberates on the reauthorization of the hea the congress may debate what changes if any to make to the pell grant program this report reviews how the program wo rks and provides analysis of program funding recipients numbers and characteristics and the role being played by the program in the distribution of federal

legislative action to reauthorize the pell grant programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31668crs2 3 as explored below if costs for the pell grant program exceed the current fiscal years appropriation additional funds can be used fro m the subsequent years appropriation this process of ensuring that grant payments will be made has led some to liken the program to quasi entitlement the issue of making the program into an actual titlement is discussed later in this report 4 students completing home schooling as recognized under state law are considered to be eligiblehow the program works this section provides an overview of the structure of the pell grant program and the process through which grants are ma to students it describes student eligibility the award rules fo r determining students gran ts program funding and the role played by postsecondary institutions in the program briefly the pell grant program provides grants ie aid that does not have to be repaid to needy undergraduates in any year federal funding is available to ensure that all eligible st udents attending eligible ins titutions receive pell grants3 to apply for these grants students must complete the free application for federal student aid fafsa with requested fina ncial and other info rmation and submit it to central processor under contract w ith ed the central processor provides each applicant

the efc is desc ribed in detail below pell grants are portable that is the grant aid follows the student to the eligible postsecondary education institutions in which they enroll institutions that receive valid sars or valid isirs for students meeting all other program eligibility requirements must disburse pell grants to them the size of the grants is based principally on the financial resources that students and their families are expected to contribute toward postsecondary educa tion expenses and the maximum grant that the annual appropria tions process sets for the program student eligibility to be eligible for pell grant student must meet requirements that apply to federal student aid in general and require ments specific to the pell grant program among the

eligible to receive pell grants there is statutory limit on the number of years in which studentscan receive grants students who are incarcerated in federal or state penal institutionare ineligible for pell grants the program provides assistance onl to financially needy students as determined under the progra ms award rules see below award rules key concepts an eligible students annual pell grant is determined on the basis of set of award rules certain co ncepts are key to an understanding of the application of these award rules appropriated maximum pell grant the appropriated maximum pell grant is specified in the nnual appropriations gislation for the us department of education that legislati on appropriates funding for th pell grant program and sets the maximum award that can be made during the fiscal year the revisedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31668crs4 9 award year 20072008 began july 1 2007 and ends june 30 2008 10 for federal student aid purposes and the calculation of the efc an individual is considered independent of his or her parent s ie parental income and assets are not considered in determining the efc if the i ndividual is at least 24 years old by december 31 of the award year is an orphan or ward of the state or was until age 18 is veteran of the armed forces or active duty military is gr aduate or professional student is married has dependents other than spouse or is deemed independent by financial aid officer for other unusual circumstancescontinuing appropriations resolution 2007 set the maximum appropriated pell grant award at 4310 for award year 200720089 this maximum award is different from the authorized maximum pell grant which is the annua l maximum pell grant specified in the hea this topic is expl ored further in the section below on program funding additionally the college cost reduc tion and access act of 2007 included mandatory funding for the pell grant pr ogram to increase the amount of the maximum appropriated award specifically the maximum appropriated award would be increased by the following amounts 490 for award years 20082009 and 20092010 690 for award years 20102011 and 20112012 and 1090 for award year 20122013 this newly added provision specifies that any individual who qualifies for pell grant award under the provisions associated with the current appropriated maximum pell grant award is eligible to receive this addon amount for example for the 20082009 award year assuming the max imum appropriated pell grant award remains 4310 an individual who qualifies for pell grant award of 500 would receive an additional 490 for total of 990 because heshe qualified under the provisions for 4310 maximum award thus if person is eligible for pell grant award of at least 200 on the basis of the appropriated maximum award this individual would receive the addon amount in any given award year expected family contribution the efc is the amount that the federal need analysis system determines can be expected to be contributed by student and his or her family toward the students cost of education this calculation is based on consideration of available income and for some families available assets basic living expenses federal income tax liability retirement needs and other expenses are taken into account in this process different efc formulas are applied to three different groups of students those who ar considered dependent on their parents the efc formula assesses the financial resources of both the parents and the dependent student independent students with pendents other than spouse if any and independent students with dependents other than spouse eg children10 the efc determination utilizes financial information submitted by the aid recipient on the fafsa cost of attendance the cost of attendance coa is measure of students educational expenses in general it is the sum of tuition and fees anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31668crs5 11 it can also include an allowance for dependent care expenses for students with dependents costs associated with study ab road programs for students engaged in such programs expenses associated with disability for students with disabilities and the costs associated with employment under cooperativ education program students who are less than halftime are eligible for room and board costs for more than three semesters of which more than two can be consecutive 12 the hea prohibits the pell grant from ex ceeding the difference between the coa and the efc this precludes the awarding of pe ll grant in excess of what student might need to cover coa after taking efc into account 13 much of the information in this section is based on the us depa rtment of educations federal student aid handbook for 20062007 available on the web at httpifapedgov ifapwebappcurrentsfahandbookspagjspallowance for books supplies transporta tion and miscellaneous personal expenses and room and board allowance11 award rules the primary pell grant award ru is that students annual grant is the least of the maximum appropriated pell grant minus efc or coa minus efc12 additionally by law pell grant aw ard cannot be less than 400 for those students whose pell grant would be be tween 200 and 400 the law provides 400 grant those whose calculated pell grant is less than 200 receive grant prior to the enactment of the college cost reduction nd access act of 2007 there was third award rule tuition sens itivity that functioned to reduce the amount of the pell grant award for students attending higher education institutions with very low tuition charges the tuition sensitivity provision was first adopted by the higher education amendments of 1992 and was inte nded to protect base amount of the pell grant maximum award and make portion of increases above that base sensitive to tuition more specifically tuition sensitiv ity reduces the pell grant award received by small number of the lowincome students who also attend institutions with very low tuition charges for fy2007 the only students whose pell grant would possibly be reduced under tuition sensitivity are thos students whose tuition charges and any allowances for dependent care or disability related expenses are less than 805 whose efcs are 800 or less and whose to tal coa is 3500 or higher however this provision was eliminated by the college cost reduction and access act of 2007 effective july 1 2007 finally an important feature of the pell grant award rules is that the grant is determined without consideration of any other fina ncial assistance student may be eligible to receive or may be receiving this reflects the intention to make the pell grant the foundation to which other assistance is added institutional role an eligible institutions role in th pell grant program primarily involves determining student eligibility disbursing awards adjusting awards to ensure that students do not receive more assistance than they are eligible for record keeping and reporting to ed13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31668crs6 14 for additional information on institutional eligibility and federal student aid see crs report rl31926

entitlements when it describes the award determined for student based on the published award schedule 17 some form of authority to reduce awards was provided to the secretary between the inception of the program in 1972 and the 1992 amendments immediately prior to its repeal in 1992 this provision permitted reduction in awards only within certain limits award could be reduced for students whose efc was 200 or less ie the awards for the neediest students would be protected schedule of reductions for other awards had to use single linear reduction formula that applied uniformly increasing percentage reductions as initial entitlements decreased award could be made to student whose initial award was reduced to less than 100 under the reduction formula 18 the appropriations legislation required the secretary to reduce awards using fixed or variable percentages or using fixed dolla r reduction if prior to issuing the payment schedules he or she determined that ppropriated funds could not fully fund the appropriated maximum grant schedule of reduced grants would then be publishedthe annual appropriation level and maximum grant are determined well in advance of the award year they are inte nded to support the annual appr opriation is determined on the basis of estimates of the program costs that are likely to be incurred at the chosen maximum grant to the extent those estimates of future program costs are inaccurate the annual ppropriation may be t oo much or too little in the event of surplus the authorizing statute provides ed with limited carryover authority what has been of most concern to federal policymakers recently are the measures that can be taken to address funding shortfall the hea requires the secretary of education when he or she has determined that the appropriated funds are insufficient to satisfy all pell entitlements16 to notify each house of congress of the shortfall identifying how much more is needed to meet those entitlements prior to the higher education amendments of 1992 pl 102325 the secretary of education had statutory au thority under the hea to reduce awards to respond to shortfall in appropriated funds17 reductions were made in awards in eight years using this authority the last in 19901991 after this hea authority was repealed appropriations gislation for fy1994fy2001 continued to provide the secretary with reduction authority but that authority was not used18 the fy2002 and subsequent appr opriations legislati on have not included such language the secretary can respond to shortfall in pell grant funding by

not taken into account in determining students pell grant how well does the pell grant currently function as the foundation aid this secti on explores this question by analyzing the purchasing power of the pell grant and the distribution of other federal aid to pell recipients purchasing power the appropriated maximum pell grant ava ilable to students with zero efcs is often used as gauge of the pell grant programs level of support in each year in fy2001 the appropriated maximum grant 3750 covered 73 of the average tuition fees room and board at public two year institutions 41 at public fouryear institutions and 16 at private fouryear institutions figure 3 below compares the appropriated maximum grant to average undergraduate tuition f ees room and board charges at public twoyear public fouryear and private fouryear institutionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31668crs21 29 the data used for figure 3 are average undergraduate tuition and fees paid by fulltime equivalent students the room and board am ounts are fulltime charges the average full cost of attendance for federal need analysis purposes w ould be higher than these socalled fixed charges including additional expenses for such things as books and transportation the inclusion of fulltime room and board in figure 3 may be somewhat problematic particularly at the communitycollege level b ecause these charges are not adjusted for part time enrollment and may not reflect the actual costs faced by students living off campus but as noted later in this section the over all conclusions regarding pell grant purchasing

it must be stressed that it is not clear what impact the coa cap would have had on the coverage data presente d in this figure first the expenses covered in the figure are averages meanin g that students actually faced charges that ranged above and below the levels shown second char ges for tuition fees room and board do not constitute the full costs that make up c oa as result annual percentages of average coa covered by the appropriate d maximum pell grant would have been lower than the percentages delineated in this figure31 nevertheless even if one assumes that the percentage of coverage by the maximum pell grant of tuition fees room and board would have been limited to the 50 or 60 caps these caps would have had impact on the coverage of average public and private fouryear expenses s hown here from fy1985 onward as result it is evident that from the mid 1980s th rough the early 1990s the appropriated maximum pell grant lost ground relative to average tuition fees room and board at public and private fouryear institutions despite recent increases in coverage the fy2006 percentages remain below the fy 1985 percentages 54 for public four year colleges and 23 for private fouryear colleges indeed for private fouryear institutions the peak purchasing power which occurred in the mid to late 1970s when the percentage of these average costs covered at those institutions was well in excess of 30 would not have been affected by the coa caps since average charges in that sector were always below the caps the erosion depicted in figure 3 is found when other comparisons are made for example the trend lines are very similar if the annual average pell grant is compared to average tuition fees room nd board or if eith er the appropriated maximum or average grant is compared to just tuition and fees32 pell grant recipients and other federal aid one measure of the role that the pell gr ant plays as the foundation award is the extent to which undergraduate s who received federal needbased student aid from the hea33 were pell recipients data from fy 2003 suggest that pell grants alone may not have constituted the prima ry foundation for these students in fy2003 although nearly twothirds of federal needbased aid recipients received pell grants comparable portion of needbased aid re cipients borrowed stafford subsidized loans34httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31668crs23 34 continued loans 35 see for example advisory committee on student financial assistance empty promises the myth of college access in america june 2002 pp 1113these data certainly raise questions bout the foundation role intended for the pell grant program the extent to which needbased aid recipients borrowed stafford loans whether subsidized or uns ubsidized is troubling to policymakers and analysts who believe that borrowing imposes burden on lowincome families that may adversely affect students enrollment patterns35 another approach to delineating the role of pell grants is to explore the extent to which pell recipients as group relied solely in fy2003 on the grant to meet college charges without having to secure other federal aid par ticularly loans with their repayment obligation in fy2003 for just 158 of pell recipients was that grant their only source of aid as shown in table 8 pell grant recipients participated in other

programpossible reauthorization issues this section provides brief overviews of several issues that may be considered by the congress as it deliberates on the pell grant program there is an overarching question which to some extent links the fi rst three specific issues described below as was delineated earlier there may be so question about whether the pell grant is playing the foundation role intended for it particularly for the neediest students steps to increase the targeting of pell grant assistance to such students may be debated by the congress during this reauthorization process and are part of the initial issues discussed below at various points in the analysis below fy2007 cost estimates of changes to the program are presented and compared to an estimate of the fy2007 cost under current law at 4310 maximum appropr iated grant these estima tes were made using the pell grant estimation model of the us depa rtment of educations budget service36 entitlement the pell grant program is subject to annual appropriations as delineated earlier the authorized maximum award has usually been higher than the maximum set in the appropriations process the last time they both were the same was for fy1979 further given the difficulty in estimating program costs the annual appropriation has in several years been significantly less than what was needed to meet those costs causing shortfalls and leading to reductions in grants borrowing from subsequent years appr opriations or supplemental ppropriations as result in many years there may be uncertainty among students their families and higher education institutions about the level of support the program will provide one response to these circumstan ces has been the proposal that the pell grant program be made into an entitlement as cons equence its funding would be mandatory this would preclude shortfalls support ma ximum pell grant at the level set in the authorizing legislation and reduce annual uncertainty about the program advocates of this step may also stress that funding higher maximum pell grants would direct greater funding to the neediest students congress has wrestled with this issue in the past indeed during legislative action on the higher education amendments of 1992 the house and senate education committees approved versions of reauthorized hea that would have made the program an entitlement these provisions were not enacted concerns about the consequences of ma king the pell grant an entitlement have centered on several issues questions are ra ised about the cost of doing so for example if the authorized maximum pell grant for fy2005 award year 20052006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31668crs25 37 crs report rl31484 higher education tax credits targeting value

to be about 198 billion more than 414 increase in the estimated cost of the program minimum grant there has been longstanding interest in ensuring that the pell grant program serves needy students and in maximizing the grant that can be awarded to those students this interest is often heightened by efforts to expand eligibility for the program because as additional presumably higher income students are drawn into the program raising the appropriated maximum grant which would focus greater amounts of funding on the neediest stude nts becomes more costly higher maximum generally means somewhat more aid for all students eligible for assistance further with the recent gr owth in federal support for middleincome students through the fede ral income tax system37 concern has been raised about the continued federal commitment to aid for lowincome students38 among the changes to the pell grant program that might be considered in any effort to target the grants more fully on lowincome students and if possible increase the size of their grants39 is raising the minimum grant as has been described unde r current law the minimu m pell grant annual award for any recipient is 400 any applicant ligible for pell grant of at least 200 but less than 400 is awarded the 400 minimum thi s retention of grantees eligible for between 200 and 399 and the boost in their grants to 400 is identified in this discussion as the minimum grant bump overall any increase in the minimum pell grant will reduce the number of recipients and program costs the impact may actually be more significant with regard to recipients than to program costs based on the estimated consequences for program costs and recipients shown in table 9 it appears that without very large increase in the minimum pell grant what is gained financially by greater targeting on lowincome pell recipients may not be enough to support substantial increase in the appropriated maximum pell grant for remaining eligible students table 9 shows estimates for the impact of three different increases in the minimum pell grant for award year 20072008 400 true 400 minimum without the 200 bump 600 and 800 for ll of these estimates the maximumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31668crs26 40 under nobump 400 minimum the actual decrease from current law may be less than 400 for some current recipients losing eligib ility this may arise in part because pell grants must be paid out to recipients in installments over the academic year as consequence change in enrollment status ma lead to receipt of total pell grant funding of less than 400 for example student enro lled fulltime for the fall semester and eligible for the minimum award of 400 could receive an initial payment of 200 for the first semester if he or

pell grant model these selected increases in the min imum annual pell grant have greater impact in percentage terms on the number of recipients than on the total costs of the program this general pattern is not surprising an increase in the pell grant minimum affects those recipients with the smallest grants only those recipients whose current pell grant falls below the new minimum lose eligibility while those with larger grants are unaffected thus for example establishing true 400 minimum bump decreases program cost s by at most 400 per recipient losing eligibility40 raising the minimum grant by mo re substantial amounts will lead to proportionately greater reducti ons in program costs although more recipients will be affected and will lose larger grants academic merit the
