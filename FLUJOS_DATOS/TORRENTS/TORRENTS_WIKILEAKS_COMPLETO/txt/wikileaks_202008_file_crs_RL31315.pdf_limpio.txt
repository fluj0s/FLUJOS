and immigrant education under the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 esea were consolidated and underwent veral important changes with regard to the funding mechanism method of instructional deliver and focus on educational outcomes and accountability the nclba consolidated several compe titively awarded grants in the bilingual education act and formula grant in the emergency immigrant education act esea title vii parts and c into single populationbased formula grant the new language acquisition state formula grant program esea title iii allocates 80 of funding according to the population of limited english proficient lep students and 20 according to the popula tion of recently arriving immigrants the law gives state and local educational agencies greater flexibility in the design and administration of language instructional pr ograms and removes language in title vii that encouraged bilingual inst ruction methods ie curricula that develop proficiency in more than one language at the same time the law develops and focuses greater attention to the ach ievement of eng lish proficiency among many amendments to pupil assessment the nclba builds upon language in the 1994 esea amendments the law increases the reporting requirements for language and academic assessments as well as the accommodations under which those assessments are given to lep pupils recipients of title iii money are also subjected to greater accountability standard s tied to title i adequate yearly progress ayp provisions in the first year of its existence funding for

in the child left behind act of 2001 introduction the language acquisition state grant program under title iii of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 as amended by the child left behind act nclba contains provisions intended to address the specific educational needs of limited english proficient lep students and students who have recently immigrated to the united states1 title iii represents major overhaul of federal programs for lep students former ly provided under esea title vii parts and c one of the most significant policy changes made in this part of the law pl 107110 was the shif t from several competitively awarded grants to single populationbased formula grant state educational agencies seas and local educational agencies leas were also given greater flexibility in the design and administration of language instructional programs at the same time program objectives were more narrowly define d and were subject to new accountability standards as well as parent notification requirements appropriations for this program increased nearly 45 from 460 million in fy2001 to 665 million in fy2002 and leveled off at 686 million for fy2003 681 million in fy2004 676 million in fy2005 and 669 million in fy2006 these amendments occurred at the end of decade that saw two important and potentially conflicting developments with re gard to the education of lep students the first concerns rapid growth of the nonnative english speaking student population the second involves increasing pressure to conduc t assessments and hold schools accountable fo r academic achievement demographic trends the population of foreignborn individua ls residing in the united states increased by more than 50 duri ng the 1990s from 20 million in 1990 to 31 million in 20002 in

enrollment in us schools during the 1999 2000 academic year was 4 million students up from 2 million during the 1989 1990 academic year4 student assessment simultaneous with the influx of immigrants and students with limited english skills there has been growing pressure on seas and leas to develop academic assessments and require that schools meet performance standards in addition to education policies adopted in most states5 the improving americas schools act of 1994 iasa pl 103382 directed states to develop and imp lement standards based assessments in the late 1990s schools were facing increasing pressure to test their students and in some cases demonstr ate improvement in student achievement the iasa also required reasonable adaptations and accommodations be made for lep pupils the purpose of these accommodations was to provide an accurate and reliable measure of stude nts knowledge in core acade mic areas in subjects other than english such as math and science the nclba also contains such accommodations but stipulates that they can only be made during an lep pupils first three years in us schools after three consecutive years in us schools lep students are to be assessed

iii provisions require that leas inform parents within 30 days of the beginning of the school year or two weeks during the school year if their child is identified for participation in language

the standards assessments and accountability provisions described in the pages above ed has more recently announced tw new policies regarding the implementation of the academic assessment and ayp provisions of the nclba16 in february 19 2004 press conference th secretary described these new policies as followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31315crs7 17 the text from this press conference is av ailable at httpwwwedgovnewspressreleases 20040202192004html 18 for more information see crs report rl31487 education for the disadvantaged overview of esea title ia amendments under the child left

ates which do this would also be required to hold firstyear lep students out of calculation of the starting point which is based on data for the 20012002 school year 11112ethe new flexibility will allow lep students during their first year of enrollment in us schools to have the option of taking the readinglanguage arts content assessment in addition to taking the english language proficiency assessment they would take the mathematics assessment with accommodations as appropriate states may but would not be required to include results from the mathematics and if given readinglanguage arts content assessments in ayp calculations since lep students exit the lep subgroup once they attain english language proficiency states may have difficulty demonstrating improvements on state assessments for these students accordin gly the other new flexibility would for ayp calculations allow states for up to two years to include in the lep subgroup students who have attained english proficiency17 by exercising the option not to give firstyear lep students the readinglanguage arts assessment leas could more easily meet the requirement in the ayp provisions that at least 95 of all pupils in each demographic group within each school must be included in assessments18 waiving the requirement that these firstyear lep pupil content assessments be counted in ayp cal culations might also make meeting the requirements easier in the later stages of ayp implementation as states try to meet progressively higher levels of performance doing so would presumably increase the proportion of lep student s scoring at an ade quately high level19 exercising the second policy option would seem to have definite positive effect on states ability to meet ayp re quirements former lep students recently moved out of that subgroup would presum ably score lower on average particularly on reading assessments than those who never were classified as lep thus including former lep pupil assessments with those nonlep subgroup would lower that subgroups average score likewise including former lep pupil assessments with those still in the lep subgroup woul d raise that subgroups average score the first of these new policies might have the effect of buffering states and leas in particular from the effects cause d by large influx of lep inmigrants from other areas being able to hold the new students out of ayp calculations would allow such leas to demonstrate the progress theyve made with the lep students that have been in their schools for year or two the second of these new policies will have the effect of smoothing the re quirement that schools must transition lep pupils into nonlep classrooms that is it may remove one disincentive to reclassifying lep students as nonlep studentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31315crs8 funding table 1 shows the formulabased allocation of these funds to each state for the last three fiscal years note that these estimates were produced on
