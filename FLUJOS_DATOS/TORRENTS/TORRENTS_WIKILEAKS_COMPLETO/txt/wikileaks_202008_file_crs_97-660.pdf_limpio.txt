reno v american civil liber ties union 96511 june 26 1997 the supreme court by 72 vote declared unconstitutional two provisions of the communi cations decency act cda that prohibited indecent communications to minors on the internet the cda is title v of the telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104 104 section 502 of the act rewrote 47 usc 223a and added subsections d through h to 47 usc 223 it did not amend subsections b or c which restrict commercial dialaporn services in reno v aclu the supreme court struck down 223a in part and 223d in whole the statute 47 usc 223a section 223a1a makes it crime by means of telecommunications device knowingly to transmit communication that is obscene lewd lascivious filthy indecent with intent to annoy abuse threaten or harass another person section 223a1b makes it crime by means of telecommunications device knowingly to transmit communication that is obscene or indecent knowing that the recipient of the communication is under 18 years of age although the statute defines telecommunications it does not define telecommunications device however it provides in 223h1b that the term does not include the use of an interactive computer service it defines interactive computer service as any information service system or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to computer server 47 usc 230e2 thus it appears that 223a1a and b by excluding interactive computer services are intended to apply to communications by telephone fax machine or computer that are sent to particular individuals not those that can be accessed by multiple usershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97660crs2 in reno v aclu the supreme court held 223a1b unconstitutional insofar as it applies to indecent communications 47 usc 223d section 223d makes it crime knowingly to use an interactive computer service to send to specific person or persons under 18 years of age or to display in manner available to person under 18 years of age any communication that in context depicts or describes in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards sexual or excretory activities or organs this prohibition seems equivalent to prohibition of indecent material but 223d does not use the word indecent fact of which the supreme court took note in reno v aclu slip op at 2425 when it held 223d unconstitutional the decision the supreme court found that the cda is contentbased blanket restriction on speech slip op at 21 as such it may be found constitutional only if it serves to promote compelling interest and is the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest sable communications of california inc v federal communications commission 492 us 115 126 1989 the court did not say that the cda serves compelling interest but it did refer to the legitimacy and importance of the congressional goal of protecting children from harmful materials slip op at 1 later the court wrote we need neither accept nor reject the governments submission that the first amendment does not forbid blanket prohibition on all indecent and patently offensive messages communicated to 17year old matter how much value the message may contain and regardless of parental approval it is at least clear that the strength of the governments interest in protecting minors is not equally strong throughout the coverage of this broad statute slip op at 32 in addition the court noted as possible alternative to the cda making exceptions for messages with artistic and educational value slip op at 33 these quotations suggest that there may be less than compelling interest in protecting older children from indecent material at least such material as has artistic or educational value moving on to the least restrictive means test the court held that the cdas burden on adult speech is unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives would be at least as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted to serve slip op at 28 the governmental interest in protecting children from harmful materials does not justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of speech addressed to adults as we have explained the government may not reduce the adult population to only what is fit for children slip op at 29 this leaves uncertain whether if there is less restrictive means than the cda by which to protect children the government could constitutionally reduce the adult population to only what is fit for children the court did not reach this question but neither did it find that there were less restrictive means than the cda to protect children rather it found that the government had failed to meet its burden to explain why less restrictive provision would not be as effective as the cda slip op at 33 the court found that the cda was too broad and too vague the breadth of the cdas coverage the court wrote is wholly unprecedented slip op at 31 it is nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97660crs3 limited to commercial speech or commercial entities its openended prohibitions embrace all nonprofit entities and individuals posting indecent messages or displaying them on their own computers in the presence of minors the general undefined terms indecent and patently offensive cover large amounts of nonpornographic material with serious educational or other value moreover the community standards criterion as applied to the internet means that any communication available to nationwide audience will be judged by the standards of the community most likely to be offended by the message slip op at 3233 as for the cdas vagueness the court wrote regardless of whether the cda is so vague that it violates the fifth amendment the many ambiguities concerning the scope of its coverage render it problematic for purposes of the first amendment for instance each of the two parts of the cda uses different linguistic form the first uses the word indecent while the second speaks of material that is patently offensive given the absence of definition of either term this difference in language will provoke uncertainty among speakers about how the two standards relate to each other and just what they mean the severity of criminal sanctions may well cause speakers to remain silent rather than communicate even arguably unlawful words ideas and images slip op at 2426 unlike obscenity as defined in miller v california the material proscribed by the cda need not be specifically defined by the applicable state law and is not limited to sexual conduct but extends also to include 1 excretory activities as well as 2 organs of both sexual and excretory nature slip op at 2527 the supreme court provided examples of communications that it seemed troubled that the cda could potentially cover these included any of the seven dirty words used in the pacifica monologue discussions about prison rape or safe sexual practices artistic images that include nude subjects and arguably the card catalog of the carnegie library slip op at 32 it could also make felon of parent allowing her 17year old to use the family computer to obtain information that she in her parental judgment deems appropriate similarly parent who sent his 17yearold college freshman information on birth control via email could be incarcerated even though neither he his child nor anyone in their home community found the material indecent or patently offensive if the college towns community thought otherwise slip op at 33 in addition the cda would confer broad powers of censorship in the form of hecklers veto upon any opponent of indecent speech who might simply log on to for example mail exploder also known as listserv and inform the wouldbe discoursers that his 17yearold child would be present slip op at 35 the court distinguished the internet from radio and television on which it has permitted the government to limit indecent material first the cdas broad categorical prohibitions are not limited to particular times and are not dependent on any evaluation by an agency familiar with the unique characteristics of the internet slip op at 20 second the court has never decided whether indecent broadcasts would justify criminal prosecution slip op at 20 third radio and television unlike the internet have as matter of history received the most limited first amendment protection in large part because warnings could not adequately protect the listener from unexpected program content on the internet the risk of encountering indecent material by accident is remote because series of affirmative steps is required to access specific material slip op at 2021httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97660crs4 congresss options could congress reenact the cda in narrower form that would be constitutional the supreme court did not say that it could but neither did it foreclose the possibility it wrote the arguments in this court have referred to possible alternatives such as requiring that indecent material be tagged in way that facilitates parental control of material coming into their homes making exceptions for messages with artistic or educational value providing some tolerance for parental choice and regulating some portions of the internet such as commercial web sites differently from others such as chat rooms slip op at 33
