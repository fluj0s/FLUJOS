u tasking of scalawag tssirel to usa fvey scalawagus3310bg has long since reached the point where it was collecting and sending home far more than the bandwidth could handle over collecting has significantly increased the latency of pri 12 content data because scalawag is nsas 1 provider of actionable sigint on redacted country name measures had to be taken to alleviate pressure on the bandwidth and decrease latency of priority 12 data in the summer of 2011 in an effort decrease the amount of voice content brought home sso deleted large quantity of priority 4 and below tasking that was bringing content and according to the doublearrow database had not been touched additionally change of priority 4 tasking to priority 6 was effected again based on doublearrow results as result the latency for primarily pri 12 had dropped considerably however these actions were still falling short because the volume of collection was increasing ssirel to usa fvey on 15 december 2011 sso collection and program management implemented rule for scalawag utt tasking that basically does not allow any effective collection priority ecp pri 4 and below tasking it must be understood that the priority of tasking in utt is not the same and straight forward as octave analysts must choose fields whose net result is priority 13 additionally all utt ecp pri 4 and below tasking was deleted since implementation some topis may have noted decrease total volume in their scalawag collection delivered to their nucleon accounts many scalawag users are familiar with and have access to the retrospective retrieval tool retro tool the retro tool is unique oneoff capability that exists only at scalawag it allows analysts to go nominally 30days into the past and retrieve audio of interest that was not tasked at the time of the original call analyst retrievals should be based on metadata sri found in fascia thatll indicate theres target of interest thats been detected in scalawags environment once the audio is identified retrieved and forwarded to your nucleon account analysts would then consider tasking the number in utt at ecp 13 based on the critical need for the data ssirel to usa fvey retrieval and forwarding via the retro tool will significantly reduce bandwidth and latency issues it will also likely result in getting the audio data back to your nucleon account more quickly than if tasked at ecp 4 and below we strongly request that topis do not artificially inflate the priority of their tasking just to get numbers tasked sigdevtarget development should be accomplished using the retro tool and subsequent tasking occur based on sigdev topis should make use of the retro tool whenever possible to retrieve the desired audio content we do not have the luxury of task and forget
