largest us shipyards among its membership asked the us trade representative ustr t investigat the subsidy practices of korea japan germany and norway the us shipbuilding subsidy program had end ed in 1981 commercial orders for large oceangoing vessels had fallen to zero military programs were being cut back and foreign subsidie s continued the shipbuilders council filed its petition under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 as amended which authorizes remedial action eg raise tariffs if th administration concludes that another country is engaged in unfair trade practices the shipbuilders council eventually withdrew its petition with the understanding that th ustr would seek multilateral end to shipbuilding subsidies through either the oecd or the uruguay round of negotiations after 5 years of negotiation under oecd auspices countries concl uded an agreement that provides for elimin ation of noncompetitive support measures compensatory charges for injurious pricing and dispute settlement proceedings elimination of noncompetitive measures with some exceptions the agreement requires the elimination of subsidies eg grants tax credits loan guarantees n preferen tial terms for

requirements including regulations such as cargo reservation programs linked with domestic shipbuilding would have to be eliminated the united states alo ne reserved the right to retain domestic build requirements for coastwise shipping the foremost coastwise law is the jones act merchant marine act of 1920 which requires that goods transported b etween points in the united states be on usbuilt ships documented under us law usflagged and owned by us citizens the agreement requires the united states to report on vessels contracted for coastwise transport other agreement countries may be

vessels for the building countrys fishin g fleet the agreement requires close monitoring of support measures each party mus t report on prices and credit terms for ships sold and on proposed assistance to th shipbuilding industry they must provide extensive data such as ownership financia l statements and capital contribution for shipyards building larger vessels the date for entry into

legislation in the 105 congressth 3 legislation to implement the oecd shipbui lding agreement was considered but not enacted during the 104 congress 19951996 new implementing legislation is beingth 4 considered during the 105 congress legislation includes changes to us law that areth necessary to implement the agreement it also includes provisions that are related t shipbuilding but are not necessary under the agreement legislative provisions to implement the oecd agreement current us antidumping law does not cover unfair pricing for trade in vessels because of the unusual nature of this trade implementing legislation proposes to add new title to us trade law to cover unfair pricing in shipbuilding some provisions of the new title provide that when us buyer purchases an unfairly priced vessel an injured industry can petition nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97662crs4 investiga tion by the us trade representative the new title would authorize th imposition of an unfair pricing fee if there is negative finding against the shipbuilder implementing legislation also would eliminate domesticbuild or domesticconten t requirements in us law that are not allowed under the agreement among the us programs that would be amen ded to meet this obligation are 1 the current duty levied on repairs of usflag vessels in foreign shipyard 2 tax deferral on deposits by us operators into funds for construction of usbuilt ships and 3 cargo preferenc programs that favor usbuilt ships proposed legislation would give the same treatment to ships built in any of the signatory countries the agreement calls for an end to subsidies in the form of loan guarantees n preferential terms one such loan guarantee program is the title xi maritime program which provides for government guarantee of debt obligations by us or foreig n shipowners for the construction of eligible vessels in us shipyards to implemen t commitme nts reached under the oecd legislation would have to amend the title x i program many experts estimate that the title xi guarantee program will become s attractive and offer reduced support to us shipbuilding as consequence legislative provisions related to the shipbuilding agreement among othe r provisions that might be included in implementing legislation is proposal to allow more time for shipbuilders to adjust to the change in the title xi guarantee program larg shipbuilders had been dependent on military orders through the 1980s but these order s fell and builders turned to commercial orders supported by the title xi program the large shipbuilders have argued for longer phaseout for the title xi program than th oecd agreement allows questions that might be considered during debate on th legislation include how long phaseout period is optimal for us shipbuilders and the consequences of phaseout period that differs from that in the agreement some opponents of the oecd agreement have argued that the definition of military vessels should be national not international decision supporters of the agreemen t respond that each signatory country cannot dec ide on its own which vessels will fall under the agreem ent and which will not otherwise the agreement will fail some legislativ proposals would authorize us officials in particular the secretary of defense to decide which vessels will be defined as military and therefore be exempt from the shipbuilding agreement other proposals seek to more clearly define military vessels by statute third issue that might be addressed in other legislative provisions is the level f protection for us shipyards that build vessels for coastwise trade trade between us ports or jones act trade coastwise trade is now reserved for usbuilt vessels the agreement allows other si gnatories to take action against us shipyards that build jones act vessels but only if certain conditions are met proposals for legislation addres s whether coastwise trade should be more strongly protected nd whether the united states should continue to participate in the agreement if another country eventually take s punitive action analysis the most serious opposition to the oecd agreement and the implementing bil l comes from major us shipyards the six largest us shipbuilders withdrew from th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97662crs5 shipbuilders council and are n ow represented by the american shipbuilding association their position is that the agreement does not end subsidies because foreign shipbuilders can continu to receive aid through restructuring provisions and other loopholes the large shipyards oppose any change to the title xi program because they say that th program is the reason us shipyards are again building large commercial vessels they insist that if title xi benefits must be given up long transition should apply the major shipbuilders argue that the injurious pricing mechanism will be ineffective because th strongest prote ctions apply only when us buyer makes the purchase but us buyers represent small share of vessel purchases worldwide to the extent that shipyards i n other signatory countries are hurt by purchase they can seek an injurious pricing charge through the thirdcountry provisions they argue that jones act vessels and militar reserve ve ssels are not adequately protected and point out that some major shipbuilding nations for example china are not parties to the agreement and can continue t subsidize their yards secondtier shipyards represented by the shipbuilders council and ship operators support the oecd agreement and implementing bill they argue that the united states will not return to construction subsidies so the b est way to help us shipyards is to agree on set of rules wher other countries limit their subsidies the midsized yards say that title xi helps us shipbuilders now because other countries agreed to freeze suppor t when they signed the agreemen t but once the other countries decide that the agreement is not going into force they will subsidize again and wipe out any benefit from title xi supporters of the agreement also argue that any expectation of negotiating anothe r agreement is unrealistic bec ause it took 5 years to reach this deal and the united states is not in strong negotiating position because it already unilaterally ended its own subsidy program the agreements requirement to reduce subsidies for shipbuilding represents potentially large benefit to the us domestic industry since the united states has n subsidy program and other countries do the title xi program has been crucial for some ship orders and some shipyards especially the largest shipyards which have depended on title xi guarantees in the face of severe cutbacks in mil itary shipbuilding the importance of title xi to the entire us shipbuilding industry and naval defense base might b weighed against possible opportunities rising from the subsidy restrictions th agreement allows us coastwise trade to continue to be protected but permit s countermeasures if all signatories decide us construction of coastwise vessels disrupts other signatories markets although it is not clear how the agreement might affect the defense fleet it is unlikely the united states would stay in commercial agreement that it perceives jeopardizes its national defense some opponents have called for renegotiation of the agreement to obtain bette r terms for the us industry us negotiators could attempt to reach agreement on new terms but other countries have indicated unwillingness to participa in renegotiation and even so woul d expect us concessions if the terms were changed countries migh t question the man date of us negotiators without some assurance that an agreement will be approved back home fasttrack procedures would assure congressional vote an d would not allow for amendments to an implementing bill but these procedures do t apply to the shipbuilding agreement the agreements original date for entry into force has passed and signatory countries have begun to subsidize their shipyards again ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97662crs6 congressional vote on the agreement will decide whether the united states agrees to those rules to govern shipbuilding
