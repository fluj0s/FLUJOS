from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to michael mann mannvirginiaedu ray rbradleygeoumassedu subject re bbc email new row on climate hockey stick date thu mar 17 135417 2005 mike on horizon im supposed to be called in few minutes by someone not sure who yet this program is generally good they did something on global dimming few months ago and now want to do something on the truth about global warming ipcc and skeptics thats all i know so far persons name is paul olding should be calling at 2pm so 5 minutes time cheers phil at 1321 17032005 michael mann wrote hi phil i agreelike all of these sources eg boreholes treerings etc each one has its own potential weaknesssesin this case i think coldseason precip could be playing greater role w the midlatitude glaciers than oerlemans cares to admit not clear that should give systematic bias towards underestimating temperature variations though which is the argument youd need to make if youre boreholer the important thing is that it is entirely independent of everything else that has come before and looks remarkably like the bradley and jonesmann et aljones et alcrowley lowerymann jones type reconstructions somehow the word hasnt really gotten out on this ive got call in from different bbc reporter today ben dempsey who seems much better hes doing something for horizon on climate change do you know anything about this thanks mike at 0802 am 3172005 phil jones wrote mike reporter was paul rincon paul rinconnewsi paulrinconbbccouk noone seems to have picked up on oerlemans paper yet you did send that earlier so i should have told him about that sarah raper here has some doubts about oerlemans work but it does reproduce the curve very well need to be objective though in interpreting it cheers phil at 1248 17032005 michael mann wrote hi phil yes bbc has been disappointing in the way theyve dealt with thisalmost seems to be contrarian element there do you remember the name of the reporter you spoke to thanks mike ps interesting that they also dont seem to be aware of the oerlemans paper which reproduces the hockey stick using completely independent data and method glacial mass balance ive attached in case you havent seen at 0326 am 3172005 phil jones wrote ray i tried to convince the reporter here there wasnt story but he went with it anyway at least he put in quote from that there are loads of other series that show similarish series to mbh and mj had to mention the moberg et series to achieve this the reporter said hed not seen moberg et and it wasnt flagged up by nature to them at the appropriate time odd then why are you running with this grl paper as there are 10s issued each week well it turns out not surprisingly that mm have issued numerous press releases themselves using their networks waterhouse is at anglian polytechnic uni apu its in cambridge and chelmsford keith said what does john waterhouse know about paleo my thoughts also weve worked with john several years ago on an isotopes in trees project that didnt produce much apu is ok when it comes to counselling studies ruth works for them teaching at yarmouth his quote is typical of many i get to here pity the reporter didnt mention this to my response would have been what is the point of doing any more paleo work if we are constrained by the answer we are allowed to get if we dont have the mwp and lia then we are wrong we have orders of magnitude more data than when these came into vogue in the 1960s but we still are expected to find them cheers phil cheers phil at 1720 16032005 you wrote ray saw this story on bbc news online and thought you should see it message anglia polytechnic new row on climate hockey stick new controversy has erupted over one of the most provocative symbols of the global warming debate the socalled hockey stick graph 1httpnewsbbccoukgoemfr2hisciencenature4349133stm bbc daily email choose the news and sport headlines you want when you want them all in one daily email
