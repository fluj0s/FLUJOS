tax debate has centered on the perceived need to relieve heirs of the responsibility of remitting taxes on the decedents transferred assets particularly in the case of family farms and businesses the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 phases out the estate and gift tax by 2010 repeal of the estate and gift tax for all estates would achieve the policy objective of relief for farm and smallbusiness estates however farm assets and business assets represent relatively small share of total taxable estate value approximately 131 of gross taxable estate value in 2005 the provisions phasing out the estate tax expire after 2010 although repeal may be made permanent g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 the estate and gift tax minimum filing requirement is 20 million for deaths occurring in 2007 generally estates valued below the threshold are not required to file return estates valued over the threshold amount calculate their tax liability based upon the entire or gross value of the estate inclusive of the 20 million deductions from the gross estate value such as bequests to surviving spouse the marital deduction state estate and inheritance taxes and donations to charitable organizations are then subtracted from the gross estate value the tentative tax liability is determined by the progressive rate schedule provided for in the tax code the next step in the calculation of estate tax liability and perhaps the most important is the applicable credit the applicable credit is set such that an estate has the equivalent of 20 million exemption for deaths occurring in 2007 see table 1 below in many cases the marital deduction combined with the deduction for charitable contributions can eliminate all estate tax liability t able 1 increases in the

returns are defined as those estates that include assets typically held by businesses closely held stock limited partnerships real estate partnerships and other noncorporate business assets estates reporting one or more of the four assets were termed business returns this methodology is imperfect and likely double counts many estates as result the number of business estates would be significantly overstated by this estimate g22g138g161g138g139g149g142g561g7g156g157g138g157g142g561g22g138g161g561g20g142g157g158g155g151g156g561 of the approximately 24 million deaths in 2004 of people 25 years old and over 13 incurred estate and gift tax liability3 further only 1715 decedents with taxable estates included farm assets 007 of all deaths and 11011 taxable estates listed assets of the type typically held by businesses 046 of all deaths the primary reason for the low number of filers relative to the number of deaths in 2004 is the high gross estate value filing threshold in tax year 2004 only estates valued at greater than 1500000 were required to file an estate and gift tax return4 this makes the estate tax relatively progressive tax source table 2 suggests the progressivity of the estate and gift tax in 2005 taxable estates worth over 10 million accounted for 72 of the total taxable estates yet 478 of all estate tax revenue the 3600 estates 195 of taxable

detailed occupation of the decedent such as farmer or business person however the data do provide significant detail on the distribution of the decedents assets table 3 summarizes estate tax return asset data from the returns filed in 2005 generally assets that represent more of the taxable estate shoulder greater share of the tax burden the value of taxable estates is concentrated in the following asset categories publicly held stocks state and local bonds nonfarm real estate personal residences and cash these five assets represent 664 of total taxable estate value in 2005 thus eliminating the estate tax will reduce the tax burden on these assets g8g138g155g150g561g138g151g141g561g4g158g156g146g151g142g156g156g561g3g156g156g142g157g156g561 table 3 reports that the value of total farm assets farm real estate and other farm assets is approximately 35 of total taxable gross estate value note that the irs does not separately report farm real estate crs estimated an amount for this report farm real estate would have been included in the other real estate asset category real estate represents about 84 of total assets held by noncorporate farms according to recent us department of agriculture usda data 5 thus new category farm real estate was created to better represent farm asset distribution the primary assumption used to determine the amount of farm real estate is that the ratio of nonreal estate farm assets to farm real estate assets 1 to 53 is the same for the farms of decedents and for the farms in the usda data thus by this interpolation approximately 30 billion of the assets in the reported other real estate irs category would likely be farmland the data reported in table 3 reflect this adjustment of the irs reported data the business assets in table 3 represent approximately 110 billion of total taxable estate value or 108 the largest is closely held stock worth approximately 59 billion however total business assets as reported do not explicitly indicate the portion of those assets held in small businesses though farm and business decedents may have other taxable assetssuch as equities and cash the burden on farm and business assets alone is quite small relative to other assets thus removing the estate and gift tax or lowering the rates in general will have much greater effect on nonfarm and nonbusiness assets 5 the farm data are from the
