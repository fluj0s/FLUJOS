gary guenther analyst in business taxation and finance government and finance division small business tax preferences significant legislative proposals in the 110th congress summary some policy issues seem fixed on congresss legislative agenda one such issue is the taxation of small firms and its effects on their formation performance and growth in the view of some lawmakers the current federal tax burden on small firms though smaller than it could be because of existing small business tax benefits should be reduced further because it hinders their formation and retards their growth others find it difficult to justify on economic grounds additional tax relief for small business owners the federal tax code offers numerous benefits of varying importance to small firms regardless of their lines of business most of these benefits take the form of deductions exclusions and exemptions credits deferrals and preferential tax rates growing number of proposals to expand certain existing small business tax preferences or create new ones have been introduced in the 110th congress several related bills are worth noting because they played central role in congressional approval of legislation to increase the federal minimum wage early in the current congress the house and senate passed differing versions of legislation hr 2 to raise the federal minimum wage from 515 to 725 over two years the house version included tax benefits intended to soften the impact of the increase on the financial condition of small firms whereas the senate version contained set of such benefits and package of revenue raisers intended to offset their revenue cost over 10 years with negotiations over moving to conference on minimum wage legislation stalled the house passed on march 23 fy2007 supplemental appropriations bill hr 1591 that included the minimum wage provisions from hr 2 and the business tax benefits from bill it approved in february hr 976 the senate responded by passing an amended version of hr 1591 on march 29 that included the same minimum wage increase and an expanded version of the business tax benefits from hr 2 differences between the two versions of hr 1591 led to the formation of conference conference report hrept 110107 was filed on april 24 that combined set of business tax benefits with package of revenue raisers intended to offset their estimated 10year revenue cost of 48 billion the house approved the report on april 25 and the senate did likewise the next day but president bush vetoed the bill on may 1 mainly because it included timetable for removing us combat troops from iraq that he opposed the house and senate then passed second fy2007 supplemental appropriation bill hr 2206 that omitted any such timetable but contained the same business tax benefits and revenue raisers president bush signed the measure on may 25 this report describes significant proposals in the 110th congress to create new tax benefits for small firms

point is the taxation of small firms and its effect on their rate of formation economic performance and prospects for growth many bills to assist small firms through new or enhanced tax preferences were introduced in the past few congresses though relatively few of the proposals were enacted the perennial congressional interest in small business taxation stems from the interplay of combination of factors chief among them are the economic importance of small firms as whole the widely held belief that such firms are major driving force behind technological innovation over time and relentless pressure from the small business community for additional tax relief1 the powerful allure of small entrepreneurial firms and the considerable political clout of small business owners are reflected in the federal tax code which contains number of tax benefits for small firms across broad range of industries nonetheless some lawmakers say existing tax relief for small firms is inadequate thus they favor the adoption of further targeted reductions in the tax burden on small business owners in the 110th congress growing number of proposals to enhance certain existing small business tax preferences or create new ones are being considered this report describes those proposals and discusses how they would change current tax law current small business tax preferences firm size plays significant role in the performance of certain industries and behavior of certain markets but it exerts similar influence on the organization of the federal tax code the code makes formal or explicit distinction between the taxation of small firms and all other firms for example there are separate sections in the code for the tax treatment of small and large firms instead current tax law contains numerous provisions scattered throughout its many sections that confer preferential treatment on small firms but not on firms that many would regard as large 1 according to the small business administration sba firms with fewer than 500 employees account for half of privatesector employment and generate more than half of nonfarm gross domestic product see small business administration office of advocacy frequently asked questions washington june 2006 available at httpwwwsbagovadvostats crs2 small business tax benefits differ in kind most take the form of deductions exclusions and exemptions credits deferrals and preferential tax rates in combination tax benefits such as these lower marginal effective tax rates on the income earned by small firms relative to all other firms still existing small business tax benefits are not confined to those that shrink tax burdens few tax code provisions benefit small firms by reducing their cost of tax compliance research has indicated that this cost tends to be regressive with respect to firm size which means that tax compliance costs typically claim larger share of pretax income as firm size shrinks2 in addition some other provisions grant tax relief to eligible small firms in exchange for the provision of certain fringe benefits eg pension plans to employees not only does the federal tax code make formal distinction between the taxation of small firms and all other firms it also incorporates uniform definition of small firm nor any consistent criteria for identifying the firms that qualify for current small business tax benefits as consequence eligibility criteria can vary from one such benefit to the next for example some tax benefits are available only to firms with annual gross receipts below certain level while other benefits are limited to firms beneath certain asset or employment size some may find it surprising that among the eligibility criteria for current small business tax preferences employment size is seldom found by contrast the small business administration relies heavily on employment size to collect and publish data on the economic condition of small business and to provide support to small business through the programs it administers3 existing small business tax benefits also differ in scope and economic importance some apply to small firms in specific industries only eg life insurance banking and energy production and distribution while others can affect nearly every small firm regardless of industry affiliation those benefits with the broadest reach outside agriculture include the rules governing the taxation of passthrough entities including subchapter s corporations graduated corporate income tax rates the expensing allowance for certain depreciable business assets the exemption of small corporations from the corporate alternative minimum tax the amortization of business startup costs 2 joel slemrod small business and the tax system in the crisis

cashbasis accounting the exclusion of gains on certain small business stock and the tax credit for portion of the startup costs of pension plans offered by certain small firms4 this report deals only with small business tax benefits with such reach all small business tax benefits except those intended to ease the tax compliance burden for small firms entail loss of federal revenue at least in the short run but owing to insufficient data and disagreement among budget analysts over which provisions in the tax code rightfully constitute small business tax benefits it is difficult to derive an accurate and widely accepted estimate of the revenue cost of existing small business tax preferences nevertheless recent estimates by the joint committee on taxation and the treasury department of the revenue loss caused by variety tax expenditures indicate that the cost exceeded 8 billion in fy20055 legislation enacted in the 109th congress while many bills with provisions intended to enhance or create new small business tax benefits were introduced in the 109th congress only two were enacted the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 tipra pl 109222 and the pension protection act of 2006 ppa pl 109280 among other things tipra extended for two years through 2009 the enhanced small business expensing allowance enacted under the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra and extended through 2007 by the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca the ppa permanently extended some of the provisions in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of

tax preferences or create new ones have been introduced in the current congress they vary in scope potential economic effects revenue cost and the support they command among the republican and democratic leaders in the house and senate several such proposals merit discussion because they played central role in congressional approval of legislation to increase the federal minimum wage they are hr 2s 349 hr 976 hr 1591 and hr 2206 pl 11028 legislation to increase the federal minimum wage the house took the first major step in enacting an increase in the federal minimum wage by passing hr 2 on january 10 2007 hr 2 would have increased the federal minimum wage from its current level of 515 to 725 over two years but it would have done so without extending tax benefits to small firms likely to be affected by the increase the senate responded by passing an amended version of hr 2 on february 1 its version of the bill replaced the text of the housepassed version with the text of s 349 which was introduced by senator max baucus and unanimously approved by the senate finance committee srept 1101 on january 17 s 349 paired the same increase in the federal minimum wage with package of tax benefits intended to mitigate the impact of the increase on the financial conditions of small firms in addition the measure would have offset the estimated revenue cost of those benefits 83 billion from fy2007 to fy2016 with package of revenue raisers none of which would have disproportionately affected small firms for senate democratic leaders chief motive for combining an increase in the minimum wage with package of small business tax benefits was to secure the 60 votes needed for passage of the measure in the senate6 republican leaders in the senate and house had said that they would support legislation increasing the minimum wage only if it included significant targeted tax relief for small firms despite news reports to the contrary not all of the six tax preferences included in the senatepassed version of hr 2 would have benefitted small firms exclusively or even predominantly but some of them would have benefitted small firms more than others three of the preferences would have bestowed most of their benefits on such firms oneyear extension of the expensing allowance an increase in the 6 kurt ritterpusch and heather rothman baucus outlines 10 billion in tax breaks for small firms offsets not announced daily report for executives bna january 11 2007 p gg1 crs5 threshold for using cash accounting methods and modification of certain rules governing the formation and taxation of subchapter s corporations but the measure also included two tax preferences that could have benefitted firms of all asset or employment sizes namely 1 an extension of the straightline 15year depreciation life for restaurant and leasehold improvements through march 2008 and an expansion of the property eligible for this tax treatment to include comparable improvements in retail property and new restaurant construction and 2 an extension of the work opportunity tax credit wotc for five years through 2012 and an expansion of the credit to include veterans disabled after september 11 2001 and certain highrisk youths in bid to pave the way for conference with the senate over hr 2 the house passed hr 976 on february 16 though the measure did not address the minimum wage it contained more modest package of tax benefits targeted at small firms than the package of business tax benefits in the senatepassed version of hr 2 and it would have offset their estimated revenue cost 13 billion from fy2007 to fy2016 with package of revenue raisers that also differed in kind and size from the revenue raisers in hr 2 once again none of the revenue raisers in hr 976 would have disproportionately affected small firms hr 976 would have provided five business tax benefits 1 oneyear extension of the wotc through 2008 an expansion of the credit to include disabled veterans and an increase from 25 to 40 in the age limit for eligible employees living in empowerment zones and enterprise and renewal communities 2 oneyear extension of the expensing allowance through 2010 an increase in the maximum allowance to 125000 and the phaseout threshold to 500000 starting in 2007 and an indexation of both amounts for inflation 3 freeze in the minimum wage at the current level of 515 for the purpose of determining the tax credit that employers in the restaurant business may claim for federal payroll taxes paid on employee tips above the federal minimum wage 4 permanent waiver of the limitations under the individual and corporate alternative minimum tax on claims for the wotc and the business tax credit for federal payroll taxes paid on employee tips and 5 revision of current tax filing requirements to allow married couple who owns an unincorporated business to file as sole proprietorship instead of partnership without incurring penalty and to allow both spouses to receive credit for payroll taxes paid while many small firms would be likely to benefit from each provision only the proposed changes to the expensing allowance and tax filing requirements would have aimed most or all of their benefits at such firms with negotiations between house and senate leaders over moving to conference on hr 2 or hr 976 stalled house democratic leaders trying to find an expeditious way to break the impasse added the minimum wage provisions from hr 2 and the business tax provisions and revenue raisers from hr 976 to bill hr 1591 to provide supplemental fy2007 appropriations the house passed the measure on march 23 facing pressure to act quickly the senate passed its version of the bill on march 29 it included the minimum wage provisions from hr 2 and package of business tax benefits whose estimated revenue cost would be offset by package of revenue raisers both packages differed somewhat from the business tax benefits and revenue raisers included in hr 2 the senatepassed version of hr 1591 contained the same business tax benefits as hr 2 with two exceptions crs6 first hr 1591 would have extended the straightline 15year cost recovery period for leasehold and restaurant improvements through 2008 while hr 2 would have extended that treatment only through march 2008 second hr 1591 would have expanded the wotc and expensing allowance under irc section 179 to apply to rural renewal counties which were defined as counties outside metropolitan statistical areas that experienced net population loss either between 1990 and 1994 or between 1995 and 1999 hr 2 had similar provision the estimated revenue cost of the business tax benefits in the senatepassed version of hr 1591 was 126 billion from fy2007 through fy2016 house and senate leaders agreed to conference to resolve the differences between the two versions of hr 1591 on april 24 house and senate negotiators filed conference report h rpt 110107 that included package of business tax benefits with projected revenue cost of 48 billion from fy2007 through fy2017 and package of revenue raisers designed to offset that cost the house approved the report on april 25 and the senate did likewise on the following day but president bush vetoed the measure on may 1 mainly because it contained timetable for withdrawing us combat troops from iraq that he deemed unacceptable an effort to override the presidents veto failed in the house on may 2 second bill to provide supplemental appropriations for fy2007 hr 2206 was passed by the house on may 10 and by the senate on may 17 it omitted any timetable for withdrawing troops from iraq but included the same packages of business tax benefits and offsetting revenue raisers from the version of hr 1591 vetoed by the president president bush signed the measure on may 25 the new law included the following small business tax benefits 1 an increase in the maximum expensing allowance to 125000 and the phaseout threshold for the allowance to 500000 in 2007 and an indexation of both amounts for inflation in 2008 through 2010 2 modifications in some of the rules governing subchapter s status7 and 3 change in tax filing requirements so that married couples who jointly own an unincorporated business may file as sole proprietorship rather than partnership none of the revenue raisers included in the new law was likely to have disproportionate effect on small firms 7 the new law made six changes in the rules governing the tax treatment of subchapter s corporations first it eliminated gains from the sale or exchange of stock or securities held by an s corporation as source of passive investment income second it exempted shares of stock held by bank directors from the rules governing the tax treatment of s corporations third it allowed banks that stop using the reserve method of accounting for bad debts in their first tax year as an s corporation to make the needed adjustments to income under irc section 481 during the final year they operated as c corporations fourth it modified the tax treatment of the sale of an s corporations interest in any of its qualified subchapter s subsidiaries fifth it required all corporations not organized as s corporations in their first tax year after 1996 to reduce their accumulated earnings and profits at the beginning of the 2008 tax year by any accumulated earnings and profits they had in tax year before 1983 when they operated as an electing small business corporation under subchapter s and sixth it allowed electing small business trusts to deduct any interest paid or accrued on debt used to acquire s corporation stock in computing the taxable income of their s portions crs7 other proposals four other legislative proposals are worth noting because they were introduced by members of the house and senate with significant influence over the legislative agenda for small business in the 110th congress one such proposal is hr 324 which was introduced on january 9 2007 by representative mckeon with the backing of house republican leaders the measure has three key elements 1 gradual rise in the federal minimum wage 2 three tax preferences intended to benefit small business owners likely to be affected by an increase in the minimum wage and 3 removal of the legal obstacles to the creation of association health plans only one of the three tax preferences targets most of its benefits at small firms oneyear extension through the end of 2010 of the enhanced small business expensing allowance enacted under jgtrra the other two reduction in the period for recovering the cost of new restaurant buildings through depreciation allowances from 39 years to 15 years and repeal of the surtax for the federal unemployment trust fund enacted in 1976 could benefit firms of all sizes it seems reasonable to maintain that hr 324 is intended in part to set forth some of the key conditions that must be satisfied before the republican leadership could accept an increase in the federal minimum wage representative nadia velazquez chairwoman of the house committee on small business introduced hr 46 in early january 2007 among other things the bill would allow buyers of eligible small firms to amortize over five years up to 5 million in qualified intangible assets increase the capital gains exclusion for the sale of eligible small business stock from 50 to 625 raise the minimum home office deduction to 2500 and expand the maximum number of shareholders for subchapter s corporations to 150 senator john kerry chairman of the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship introduced bill s 99 that would create partially refundable tax credit for certain small firms that provide health insurance coverage to employees the credit would range from 50 of qualified health insurance expenses for employers with fewer than 10 such employees to 20 for employers with 25 to 49 employees firms with 50 or more employees would be ineligible for the credit senator max baucus chairman of the senate finance committee introduced bill s 41 that seeks to bolster the domestic climate for technological innovation while its central focus is improving the efficacy of the research tax credit under irc section 41 the bill includes new nonrefundable personal tax credit to encourage an increased flow of equity investment in small firms that invest heavily in research and development r d the credit would be equal to 5 of the amount paid to qualified research entity for an equity stake it could be claimed for the first five years an investor owns stock in such an entity qualified research entity is defined as any domestic corporation or partnership that provides investment capital for qualifying small business innovation companies an explanation of how these and other legislative proposals would change current tax law follows the discussion is divided between proposals to enhance current small business tax benefits and proposals to establish new ones crs8 current small business tax benefits expensing allowance under irc section 179 under irc section 179 business taxpayers buying qualified assets may write off as current expense some or all of their cost depending on the amount in the year they are placed into service certain conditions must be met in order to claim this expensing allowance for the most part the qualified assets consist of machinery and equipment including motor vehicles taxpayers unable to claim the allowance may recover the cost of qualified assets over longer periods through allowable depreciation deductions expensing is the most accelerated form of depreciation as result it lowers the cost of capital simplifies tax accounting and can boost the cash flow of firms that take advantage of it8 in 2007 the maximum allowance for most firms is set at 125000 from 2008 through 2010 this amount is indexed for inflation beginning in 2011 and beyond the maximum allowance will drop to 25000 its level before the enactment of jgtrra the allowance begins to phase out dollar for dollar when the total cost of qualified assets placed in service in the 2007 tax year exceeds threshold of not less than 500000 this amount is also indexed for inflation in 2008 to 2010 assuming change in current law the phaseout threshold will fall to 100000 in 2011 and beyond its level before the enactment of jgtrra so in 2007 firms that purchase and place in service 625000 or more in qualified assets may claim expensing allowance for those investments instead the cost of the assets may be recovered over longer period through allowable depreciation methods hr 324 hr 1012 s 439hr 2 as amended by the senate and s 299 each bill would extend the current expensing allowance through 2010 after which the maximum allowance would fall to 25000 and the phaseout threshold to 100000 with indexation for inflation hr 976hr 1591hr 2206 pl 11028 the bills would extend the current expensing allowance by one year through 2010 increase the maximum expensing allowance to 125000 and the phaseout threshold to 500000 starting in 2007 and index both amounts for inflation beginning in 2011 and thereafter the allowance would fall to 25000 and the phaseout threshold to 200000 with adjustment for inflation president bush signed hr 2206 on may 25 hr 1797 the bill would permanently increase the maximum expensing allowance to 20000 and the phaseout threshold to 800000 as of january 1 2007 it would also permanently index both amounts for inflation add offtheshelf business software to the assets eligible for the allowance and modify the phaseout 8 crs report rl31852 small business expensing allowance current status and legislative proposals and economic effects by gary guenther crs9 of the allowance so that it is reduced by 050 for each dollar of spending on qualified assets above the phaseout threshold s 14s 1197 the bill would permanently extend the features of the expensing allowance before it was modified by pl 11028 s 269 the bill would raise the maximum expensing allowance to 200000 and the phaseout threshold to 800000 and index both amounts for inflation starting in 2007 and thereafter it would also make purchases offtheshelf software for business use permanently eligible for the allowance beginning in 2010 cashbasis accounting under irc section 446 business taxpayers have some flexibility in choosing the method of accounting they use to compute taxable income nonetheless regardless of which method of accounting firm uses for tax purposes it must clearly reflect all relevant items of income two methods of financial accounting are widely used in the private sector cash basis and accrual basis under the former which is generally the preferred method for selfemployed individuals income is recorded when it is received in the form of cash or its equivalent and expenses are recorded when they are paid regardless of when income is actually earned and expenses actually incurred under accrualbasis accounting by contrast income and expenses are recorded when the transactions giving rise to them are completed or nearly completed regardless of when cash or its equivalent is received or paid in general company using accrual accounting records income when its right to receive it is legally established and expenses when the amounts are fixed and its liability for them is legally established each accounting method has its advantages cash accounting is simpler to administer but accrual accounting often yields more accurate measure of firms economic income as it does better job of matching income with expenses in addition firms using the cash method have more control over when income is recognized for tax purposes under irc section 448 c corporations partnerships with c corporations as partners trusts subject to taxation on unrelated business income and legal tax shelters are barred from using cash accounting an exception is made for firms engaged in farming or the commercial cultivation of trees and firms organized as personal service corporations this exception also applies to c corporations and partnerships with c corporations as partners when those entities have average annual gross receipts in the three previous tax years not in excess of 5 million under irc section 471 the irs may require firms to maintain inventories using the accrual method to make sure that the accounting method used for tax purposes clearly reflects all relevant items of income this requirement is generally applied to firms whose income hinges on the production purchase or sale of merchandise nevertheless an exception is made for firms in this position whose average annual gross receipts in the three previous tax years do not exceed 1 million they are free to use the cash method crs10 s 269 s 347 s 349hr 2 as amended by the senate the bill would allow c corporations and partnerships with corporate partners whose average annual gross receipts in the three previous tax years do not exceed 10 million to use the cash method of accounting for tax purposes it would also raise the threshold for using cash accounting to 10 million for firms that otherwise would be required to maintain inventories using the accrual method starting in 2008 or 2009 and thereafter the 10 million threshold would be indexed for inflation subchapter s corporations and partnerships under the federal tax code firms have the option of being organized as subchapter s corporation9 s corporations are passthrough entities that are treated like partnerships for federal tax purposes unlike c corporations s corporations do not pay an entitylevel tax like the corporate income tax instead their items of income or loss are passed on or through to shareholders who must account for them separately on their individual income tax returns this attribution of income occurs even if the s corporation retains its earnings instead of distributing them to shareholders to avoid double taxation of income when shareholder sells or otherwise disposes of his or her s corporation stock each shareholders basis in the stock is increased by any amount included in his or her income in tax year or decreased by any loss that is taken into account shareholders loss may be deducted on his or her individual income tax return only to the extent of his or her basis in the stock or debt of the s corporation while s corporations generally are not taxed on the income they earn they are subject to taxation at corporate tax rates on passive investment income in excess of 25 of their gross receipts s corporations also are subject to tax on accumulated earning and profits under irc section 1375 not all firms are eligible for subchapter s status only those that qualify as small business corporation such corporation is defined as domestic corporation with more than 100 qualified shareholders and more than one class of stock qualified shareholders are estates certain trusts and taxexempt organizations and individuals who are residents or citizens of the united states families have the option of being treated as single shareholder partnerships and c corporations cannot serve as s corporation shareholders firms that meet the requirements for classification as small business corporation do not automatically gain subchapter s status to gain that status qualifying corporation must elect to do so and all shareholders at the time of the election must consent to the decision corporation can lose its lose s status by failing to continue to meet all the criteria for small business corporation or by having excess passive investment income and accumulated earnings and profits at the 9 business enterprises may be organized for tax purposes as some kind of passthrough entity or c corporation which is subject to an entitylevel tax on its income the major categories of passthrough entities are partnerships including limited liability companies s corporations and sole proprietorships most firms operate as some kind of passthrough entity in 2004 the most recent year for which data are available sole proprietors filed 206 million federal tax returns s corporations 36 million returns partnerships 25 million returns and c corporations 20 million returns see internal revenue service statistics of income bulletin fall 2006 washington 2006 pp 342346 crs11 end of the year for three consecutive tax years once firm loses its s status it or any successor must wait five years before it can elect that status again for many investors and business owners key advantage of seeking s status rather than c status is the avoidance of double taxation of business income in 2007 the maximum individual tax rate is the same as the maximum corporate tax rate 35 so avoiding one layer of taxation can have its appeal especially for individuals taxed at the highest marginal rates but other tax considerations might lessen this appeal for example s corporation earnings passed through to shareholders are not considered dividends and thus are not taxed at the current 15 rate for dividends by contrast c corporation earnings distributed to shareholders as dividends are taxed at that rate another important advantage of s status over c status is that shareholders of s corporations have greater latitude to take advantage of corporate losses while c corporation may use net operating losses only to offset income in the last two or next 20 tax years s corporation shareholders can use corporate losses immediately to offset income from other sources the ability to use losses immediately is especially valuable to shareholders during the early years of business when profits may be meager and shareholders investment in the business is large enough to allow them to use any losses s 349hr 2 as amended by the senate the bill would make six changes of varying significance in the rules governing the taxation of s corporations on the whole the changes seem intended to create more level playing field among the tax treatment of s corporations limited liability companies and partnerships and to modernize outdated rules and restrictions10 one provision of the bill would eliminate gains from the sales or exchanges of stock or securities as source of passive investment income for s corporations another provision would clarify the status of shares of bank stock owned by directors of banks operating as s corporations under the provision the bank stock would not be treated as second class of stock as it currently is the directors holding the stock would not be treated as s corporation shareholder as they currently are the stock would be disregarded in allocating items of income and loss among shareholders and the stock would not be considered in determining whether bank operating as an s corporation holds 100 of the stock of qualified subchapter s subsidiary the bill would also allow banks that convert to s status and wait until the first year of s status to discontinue the reserve method of accounting for bad debts to declare all adjustments from the change in accounting method as income for the year before the conversion and to pay tax on that income such provision would prevent the transfer of tax burden to the shareholders that occurs under current law 10 stephen joyce minimum wage bill amendment seen giving favorable tax treatment to s corporations daily report for executives bna january 25 2007 p g13 crs12 another provision would allow nonresident aliens to become beneficiaries of an electing small business trust esbt that owns stock in an s corporation the change would enable families who control an s corporation to expand its access to equity capital by inviting family members who are not us citizens and live abroad to participate in the business as shareholders11 the bill would also modify the tax treatment of the sale of stock in qualified s corporation subsidiaries by the parent s corporation under the provision the sale would be regarded as sale of an undivided interest in the subsidiary followed by transfer of all the assets to new corporation that is subject to the rules of irc section 351 another provision concerns some c corporations that once were organized as s corporations it would allow c corporation that was not organized as an s corporation after 1996 to reduce its accumulated earnings and profits at the start of the first tax year after the enactment of the provision by any accumulated earnings and profits it had in the final tax year before 1983 when it was organized as an s corporation hr 46 the bill would raise the maximum number of qualified shareholders for an s corporation from 100 to 150 s 270 the bill would allow s corporations partnerships and startup firms more flexibility than they have under current tax law in selecting tax year current law requires s corporations and partnerships to adopt tax year that ends on december 31 under s 270 qualified firms could select tax year that ends on the last day of any of the months from april through november to qualify for this exception firm must be an s corporation or partnership with average annual gross receipts in the past three tax years of 5 million or less or startup firm new small business tax preferences tax credits for employee health benefits current law current federal tax law offers tax credits to employers that provide health insurance to employees instead there are variety of tax incentives to encourage individuals to purchase health insurance either on their own in the individual market or through their employers in the group market employees pay federal income or payroll taxes on employer contributions to health and accident plans in which they participate this exclusion also applies to certain health benefits received by employees who participate in socalled cafeteria plans operated by employers in addition many employers offer health benefits to employees through flexible spending accounts fsas under such an arrangement an employee chooses benefit limit at the start of calendar year and draws on the

refundable tax credit under irc section 36 for eligible small firms that offer health insurance to employees the credit would be equal to 60 of the total amount paid for qualified employee health benefits by firms that employ 25 or fewer individuals or 40 of the total amount paid for the same benefits by firms that employ 26 to 100 individuals firms with more than 100 employees would be

employers health plan covers less than 75 of its workforce 3 the employers health plan offers fewer benefits than any of its previous health plans or 4 the share of their cost covered by an employer falls below the share it covered under any previous health plan crs14 s 99 the bill would establish new permanent refundable tax credit irc section 45o for qualified small employers that offer health benefits to eligible employees the credit would depend on qualified employers employment size specifically it would equal 50 of employer spending on health insurance coverage up to limit per employee of 4000 for single coverage and 10000 for family coverage for qualified firms with fewer than 10 qualified employees the credit rate would drop to 25 for qualified firms with 10 to 24 such employees

qualify for the credit by demonstrating that they are likely to employ an average of 2 to 49 qualified individuals in the current tax year qualified employee or individual is defined as current employee who meets two criteria first such an employee is not eligible for health insurance coverage through health plan offered by spouses employer or through any federal health plan eg medicare medicaid or military health plans second he or she receives more than 50000 in compensation from qualified employer in calendar year this amount would be indexed for inflation s 158 the bill would create new permanent nonrefundable tax credit irc section 45n for qualified small employers that offer health insurance to eligible employees beginning in 2008 the credit would be equal to 50 of qualified employee health insurance expenses for employers with fewer than 10 qualified employees and 30 for employers with 10 to 25 qualified employees for each qualified employee there would be limit on such expenses of 2000 for single coverage and 4000 for family coverage eligible employers could claim credit when over 20 of their employees qualify as highly compensated under irc section 414q the credit would become part of the general business credit under irc section 38 and thus subject to its limitations to claim the credit an employer would have to offer health insurance to all qualified employees pay for minimum of 50 of the premium for that coverage and have an average of 25 or fewer qualified employees in one of the two previous calendar years new employers could qualify for the credit by demonstrating that they expect to have more than 25 qualified employees in the current calendar year the bill defines qualified employees as employees whose annual wages total 5000

the cost of qualified intangible assets they acquire by amortizing that cost over 15 years beginning in the month when the assets are acquired in the case of qualified intangible assets this treatment applies regardless of the actual useful life crs15 of such an asset other depreciation allowances may be claimed on intangible assets subject to this treatment amortization is equivalent to straightline depreciation in that equal amounts of taxpayers basis in an asset are deducted in each year of the costrecovery period the cost of the following intangible assets may be amortized over 15 years goodwill goingconcern value work force in place an information base any patent copyright formula process design pattern knowhow format or similar item any customerbased intangible any supplierbased intangible any license permit or other right granted by governmental unit or agency any covenant not to compete entered into in connection with the acquisition of trade or business and any franchise trademark or trade name hr 46 the bill would carve out permanent exception under irc section 197 for the depreciation of intangible assets acquired from certain small firms specifically it would allow business taxpayers to amortize over five years rather than the 15 years allowed under current tax law up to 5 million of the cost of intangible assets they acquire when they purchase firms whose average annual gross receipts in the three tax years before the acquisition do not exceed 5 million shorter period for cost recovery might make it easier for owners of small firms with relatively high amounts of intangible assets to sell them as it would reduce the tax burden of the buyer in the first few years after the acquisition partial exclusion of capital gains from the sale of qualified small business stock current law irc section 1202 permits noncorporate taxpayers including partnerships and s corporations to exclude 50 of any gain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock qsbs issued after august 10 1993 and held for more than five years qsbs can be issued only by c corporation whose assets do not exceed 50 million at the time the stock is issued

federal empowerment zones as defined under irc section 1397c the provision is intended to encourage private investment in small startup firms that may have trouble raising funds in debt and equity markets hr 46 the bill would permanently increase the share of capital gains on the sale or exchange of qsbs that may be excluded under irc section 1202 to 625 crs16 for qsbs issued by qualified entities operating outside empowerment zones and to 75 for qsbs issued by qualified entities operating within such zones tax credit for qualified equity investment in eligible small firms current law current tax law offers tax credit for equity investment in firms of any size but there are several tax incentives to encourage such investment in small startup firms that may have difficulty raising adequate funds in debt and equity markets under irc section 1202 noncorporate taxpayers may exclude 50 of any capital gains they realize from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock under irc section 1242 taxpayers who invest in small business investment companies sbics may deduct from their ordinary income any losses they incur from the sale or exchange or loss of value of sbic stock they own there is limit on the size of the deductible loss in the absence of such provision individual taxpayers who realize loss on the sale or exchange of sbic stock would be able to deduct

states and meets the appropriate size standard set by the small business administration under section 3 of the small business act an investor would be able to claim the credit for an equity investment in qualified small business only if the business uses at least 80 of its assets in the active pursuit of qualified trade or business during substantially all of the period the investor holds an equity stake in the enterprise qualified trade or business would have the same meaning as qualified trade or business for the partial exclusion of capital gains on the disposition of qualified small business stock under irc section 1202 activities related to research and development would meet the test of qualified trade or business for the credit s 411712 the bills would establish complicated new nonrefundable tax credit under irc section 45n for individuals who invest indirectly in small research intensive companies the credit would be equal to 5 of the amount invested in socalled qualified

innovation company of more than 10 million in single tax year or the purchase from another qualified research entity of any loan it has made to such company two additional rules would govern the availability of the credit first there would be annual limits on the aggregate credit that could be claimed in 2007 through 2011 specifically the aggregate credit could not exceed 500 million in 2007 750 million in 2008 and 2009 and 1 billion in 2010 and 2011 it is not clear from the language of the bill what would happen in 2012 and thereafter second the treasury secretary would have the authority to allocate these annual limits among qualified research entities single entity could receive an allocation of more than 25 million in single tax year in making the allocations the secretary would be required to give priority to any entity with record of having successfully provided capital or technical assistance to qualifying small business innovation companies tax incentives for small employers of activated reservists current federal tax law offers employers in the private sector of military reservists incentive to provide partial or full compensation to reservist employees or to cover any difference between the military and civilian pay received by these employees when they participate in active duty nor does current federal tax law give such employers an incentive to hire replacements for activated reservist employees s 455 the bill would establish new nonrefundable business tax credit under irc section 30c for eligible small employers that employ military reservists

military pay and allowances while serving in active duty the credit would also apply to the compensation paid by such an crs18 employer to individuals hired to replace activated reservist employees when they serve in active duty in the case of the former the credit would be equal to 40 of any qualified compensation paid by an eligible small employer to qualified employee in excess of his or her
