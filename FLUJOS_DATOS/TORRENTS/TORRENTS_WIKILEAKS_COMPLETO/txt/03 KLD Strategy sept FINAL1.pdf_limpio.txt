consultees 29 appendix 2 monitoring strategy actions 30 page 2 of 33 acknowledgements this strategy has been written after wideranging consultation with internal and external stakeholders carried out by three of our boar d members erica death judith timms and jane tunstill the outcome of this consultation and their indepth work has largely informed this strategy and their commitment to making cafcass learning organisation is the inspiration for it for this we owe them our thanks they were supported in their work on this strategy by group of family court advisors fcas business support staff and managers in cafcass and staff and colleagues within the wider family just ice and social care network we are grateful to them for so generously gi ving their time and expertise to help develop this strategy this broad spectrum of agencies associ ations and individuals who took part in the consultation are listed at appendix 1 section 1 11 introduction the chief executives consultation paper on the future culture and structure of cafcass at the end of 2004 set out to establish clear direction for cafcass this was based on strong cal teams strong regional co ordination and strong national leadership the aspirations of that paper included putting service delivery at the heart of our work becoming world class front line service for children and families becoming more clearly recognised and valued in our role in representing children delivering consistently high quality outcomes fo r children and ensuring our performance is of the best possible quality the consultation for this strategy showed enormous consensus across cafcass in support of these aspirations confirming that they are the right ones to drive the future agenda further consultation paper every day matters has helped the whole organisation focus on the changes to our wo rking practices that are necessary and deliverable the paper raised wide debate across the family justice system at the same time as the findi ngs of review of the child care proceedings in england and wales under t he children act 1989 were made public the two aims of the child care review of proceedings were to improve the system for children and families subj ect to proceedings and to ensure that all resources in the system are used in the most timely effective way every day matters seeks to address some of these findings to keep up to date with modern family patterns to find new ways of responding when the demand for our service is increasing to improve those areas where we know we need to improve and most of ll to respond to developing understanding that children and young people should not only be the recipient and focus of our work but deserve to be active players in the process page 3 of 33 new national service standards hav been launched which update the 2003 service standards and principles and ar intended to operate from 1 april 2007 after period of consultation lasting until september 2006 the standards are safe national minimu m standards which all staff and contractors will be required to comply with they will be supported by six month leadin period for organisational development including opportunities for learning and the development of practice tools given the cumulative messages from 4 recent inspections about the lack of improvement in frontline practice there is an urgent need to address these concerns the kld strategy sets out the framework within which practice improvement can take place and pla ys an important part to support the implementation of the new national standards and the practice development program cafcass also developed twoyear bus iness plan for 2005 to 2007 which set out two broad aims 1 transforming services nd modernising practice our social work practice needs to be modernised to take account of contemporary research and practice models 2 transforming the organisation we need to play our part in delivering the vision for radically modernised family justice system we need to ensure that cafcass is in the mainstream of new public and private law change and that services to children and families develop as set out in every child matters the children act 2004 the green paper on parental separation children s needs and parents responsibilities the new framework for private law cases and the latest joint inspectors report on arrangements to safeguard children this knowledge learning and development kld strategy sets out to support the achievement of all thes aims the challenge will be to turn aspirations into real achievements and for the changes to be effectively implemented not only will hearts and minds have to be won but we will need to ensure that the new changes are supported by the sk ills they need to implement them 12 strategic aims this strategy sets out four broad stra tegic aims which we hope to achieve to provide world class human right s convention compliant service for children and their families who are in volved with the courts through the most effective use of limited resources to lead the way in developing new knowledgebased approach to representing children and young people and their interests before the court resolving family disputes and ensuring better outcomes and greater safeguards for children page 4 of 33 to ensure all members of staff can enhance their skills commitment and contribution to cafcass practice policy and underlying knowledge base on an equitable basis to contribute to the body of knowl edge which informs law practice and policy in relation to children and young people 13 key principles continuing professional development cpd is now recognised as an essential part of workforce development to deliver appropriate service outcomes and priorities it benefits serv ice users and carers the worker and the organisation it helps to create stable workforce which improves the service users experience of services by providing consistent approach an employer who provides good opportuniti for cpd and positive learning environment to support learners will be more attractive than another1 skills for care the childrens workfo rce development council cwdc and partners defines cpd as an ongoing planned learning and development process that enables workers to expand and fulfil their potential contributes to work based and personal development can be applied or assessed against competences and organisational performance includes any activity that incr eases knowledge experience and understanding improves performance and contributes to lifelong learning ensures continuing confidence and co mpetence particularly in ever changing environments competence means that people have the relevant skills knowledge understanding and attributes to do particula r job in particular context to an agreed standard cpd includes any activity which increases knowledge experience understanding improves performance and c ontributes to lifelong learning cpd

experiences experiential learning cpd can be used creatively to help peopl prepare for changes in existing roles new roles or the next job and s hould demonstrate how learning is being applied throughout career it is shar ed responsibility as described in the gsccs codes of practice for employ ers and workers employers must actively provide learning opportunities for the worker to strengthen and develop skills and knowledge and create an environment where learning can flourish individual workers have res ponsibility for maintaining and improving their knowledge and skills which can be done through range of learning and development activities knowledge learning and development in cafcass will occur within this context and within the fram ework of the following key principles cafcass is learning organisation committed to achieving better outcomes for childr and families delivered by high quality staff and informed by clear best practice standards on nationally consistent basis promoting and respecting children s statutory and convention human rights as central tenets of all its service delivery actively involving children in the decisions that affect their lives developing practice and service quality in proactive manner in line with the new national regulatory inspection and post qualification pq framework encouraging the delivery of wide r ange of training models single and multidisciplinary in house and external learning at national regional and local level ensuring that all staff are provided on an equitable basis with the training and support necessary to enable them to carry out their statutory professional and organisational duties in timely effective and cost effective manner enabling all staff professional administrative it and financial to contribute to better outcomes for children recognising the responsibilities of m anagers for influencing the culture of learning within their work setting and of best practice through the standards set and expectations from themselves and their staff allocating sufficient resources to ensure high standards of service delivery recruit and retain staff and contribute to the growth of the next generation of the social care and family justice professionals by providing professional pathways for career progression which are equitable and transferable page 6 of 33 14 the cafcass learning model we need to make the transition from t rainingstaff to becoming learning organisation people learn in vari ety of different ways including one to one learning via s upervision or mentoring peer support and case discussion groups to examine different aspects of professional policy and practice interdisciplinary seminars and discussion groups formal courses both monodisciplinary and interdisciplinary participation in pq or other nationally validated course undertaking ones own research and evaluation work interactive learning via the internet personal reading and reflective time library study whether via the internet or through access to relevant hard copies we want to ensure that staff have access to flexible range of different approaches to teaching and learning through this strategy the social care institute for excell ence scie is governmentfunded independent company established to develop and promote knowledge about good practice in social care it wor ks to increase understanding of ways to improve the use of researchbased knowledge throughout the social care workforce and for example produces and makes available free of charge series of reviews and reports about how knowledge works in social care2 its work has been helpful in defining the nature of knowledge in social care types of knowledge of relevance to cafcass comprise the following adapted from scie 20043 organisational knowledge practitioner knowledge user knowledge research knowledge policy community knowledge legal knowledge scie has also analysed the organisati onal models of thinking about and developing and using research in social care and evolved this typology the researchbased practitioner model the embedded research model the organisational excellence model it identifies the most successful as the organisational excellence model 2 wwwscieorguk the electronic library for social care can be found at wwwelscorguk 3 walter w nutley s percysmith j mcneish d frost s 2004 improving the use of research in social care practice sciepolicy press page 7 of 33 the key to successful knowledge us lies with social care delivery organisations their leadership management and organisation knowledge use is supported by developing knowledgeminded culture there is local adaptation of resear ch findings other knowledge and ongoing learning within organisations partnerships with local universitie s and intermediary organisations facilitate the creation and use of res earchother types of knowledge this model meets the needs and aspirations of cafcass as can be seen from these knowledge and organisational characteristics the fit between knowledge learning and workforce developm ent is seamless one and this is one of the aspirations of our kld strategy 15 four key kld objectives we have identified four key objectives which we will work on to realise our vision and strategic aims these over arching objectives have been further broken down into several strands whic h we will work on to ensure that we deliver our strategic vision these are detailed in the next section our four objectives are 1 to acknowledge consolidate and expand the role of cafcass as learning organisation which can both generate and apply knowledge including especially research based knowledge 2 to identify and establish kld oppor tunities for all groups of staff leaders and managers fcas and business support staff and specialists 3 to put in place devolved kld function with strong strategic overview 4 to aim by 2010 for cafcass to allocate resources to kld activities at level commensurat with kld needs and at the same proportion as equivalent knowledge based organisations section 2 where are we now an audit 21 why we need kld strategy the internal context cafcass is the biggest single employer of social workers in the country and carries out complex function requiri ng experience knowledge and practice which is informed by evidence our vision to deliver world class service to children and families in the court setting means that our social workers need ongoing access to good quality training to be able to access information and knowledge easily and to each have an indi vidual programme of development which helps them to carry out their ro to the highest standards equally our page 8 of 33 business support staff must be able to support the functions of the organisation efficiently and effectively so that the overall experience of our service users who engage with us at one of the most difficult times in their lives is good one our fcas structurally cafcass has 110 office s in england and employs around 130 first line managers around1235 family cour t advisors fcas and around 470 self employed contractors our social care workforce hold social work qualification and are registered with the gscc additionally they have minimum of 3 years post qualifying experience however 60 of our empl oyed staff are over the age of 50 and therefore averagely the experience is much more an older workforce also brings with it issues of culture change change in working practices and modernisation for example many of our older fca s are not it literate and this has proved difficult when trying to implement modernisation of our services the national average for our turnover is 4 which we recognise is low compared to local authoritie s we do know from in house research we carried out with our fcas that ther is high level of satisf action with the job itself and fcas tend to stay in the job becaus of this however approximately 250 fcas will retire by 2010 and replenishing our levels of staff is one of our key concerns planning can be complicated by the new change in retirement age and many of our staff approaching re tirement have indicated positive desire to stay on as bank or sessional staff for example in the ne 13 staff around 14 of fcas could retire by march 07 however we only have confirmation of 4 actual staff retiring it is important to recognise that our essential criteria of 3 years post qualifying experience in child protection setting means that we are competing for staff with local authorities and others in t he statutory sector this has been shrinking market for some years and t he success of government recruitment campaigns for teachers and nurses has not been as successful for social workers cafcass social care workforce is primar ily white female workforce over the age of 50 table 3 below shows the make up of our staff in 3 categories over 75 of our social care staff are female this has particular implications for us in our private law work with fathers however women generally dominate the childrens social care workforce and th is is an issue for the governments recruitment campaign unfortunately we currently do not have age and diversity data about our self em ployed contractors secs page 9 of 33 cafcass diversity 2005 2006 to date staff gender profiles 904 754 589 96246411 020406080100 support staff fcabank staff servicesenior managerfemale male the huge diversity of service users in m any parts of the country such as in london birmingham and manchester contribut to the complexity of our work we need to routinely work through interpreters and working successfully with them is skill we are still acquiring we also need to think about recruiting first language fcas in some of the main languages we encounter recent inspection on how well we ar meeting our duties under the race relations amendment act 2000 highlighted that our front line practice in relation to our black and ethnic minority service users continues to have gaps in the quality and this is key area for the development of our staff during the 5 years that cafcass has been operating training and development for staff has been patch good modular programme was rolled out to ensure staff from different backgrounds of public and private law were trained so that they could work flexibly between the two specialisms other professional devel opment opportunities are currently provided for practitioners through commissioning external and internal trainers to deliver courses identified however standst ill budget in 200506 forced us to cut back considerably on kld activites in 200506 we allocated 005 of the st aff budget to kld in each region and the national office teams in addition centrally held kld budget of around 250k brought the total amount spent on kld across cafcass in 0506 to 646k amounting to around 1 of the total staffing budget this year however despite another standstill budget year we have made substantial investment in the kld function because we fully appreciate the imperatives to do so our total budget for 200607 is around 122 million region and national and this constitutes 16 of the total staffing budget this does not include the time spent by t he kld leads in their role which is in addition to the 122 m table 4 below shows our current levels of post qualification awards amongst employed cafcass staff this amounts to 11 of the fca and first line managers given that cafcass staff are providing expert advice to courts and page 10 of 33 critiquing local authority care plans th is has serious consequences for us as an employer and we may well fail to attrac t staff if we cannot offer the same pq framework as local authorities our staff as experts could well become discredited as they fall behind in terms of pq awards awards fcas first line managers 76 26 with pq1 only pq1 44 child care award cca 31 pq award in social work pqsw

both financially and administratively to pay par ticular attention to the kld needs of our business support staff business suppor t covers range of skills including risk management financial and it syst ems and management relationship management project management information management communications public relations and business skills and the more effective use of technology we now employ around 500 business s upport staff who carry out wide range of business support functions all of whom are critical in running the systems which underpin the efficient and cost effective delivery of cafcasss services review of their roles is currently being finalised and new competences have been written to support this the review has also identified their kld needs such as management development for those with managerial responsibilities and the need for an induction programme for all new administrative staff which covers the statutory ro and duties of cafcass and its financial it and risk management systems they may also of course potentially proceed to social care social work or family justice training below is breakdown of our business support staff by job role job group staffing

communities whilst just under 6 have said they are disabled page 11 of 33 our managers service managers are pivotal in addressing and managing the changes required of cafcass the delivery of successful social work service for children who are the subject of fam ily proceedings is highly dependent on the quality of frontline practitioners in cafcass and the effectiveness of their service managers that is first line management4 the demands of the service managers role are overwhelming and they are required to possess managem ent and supervision skills as well as detailed knowledge of an extensive range of the law and practice relating to children and young people across both public and priv ate law matters work is under way jointly with unions to look at revi sion of their roles creating some heads of service and practice manager roles to make the task more effective the recent inspection on first line management is timely in contributing to this major review specific national induction programme is now provided for all new managers cafcass has also provided some m anagement training but there is overall externally accredited pr ogramme inputs so far have included ¾ management of change training for c50 managers ¾ supervision training for 4 m anagers who will go on to undertake training the trainer courses in november 065 ¾ briefings on specific subjects such as contract management recruitment and selection ¾ sponsorship to some managers to undertake formal qualifications c10 we now need to put comprehensive management development programme in place managers are working under great pressure to achieve the correct balance between meeting the service delivery demands of children and courts and their responsibility to meet both the c ontinuing training requirements of gscc registration and the kld needs of all sta ff within the organisation operational pressures sometimes make it difficult to enable personnel to be released to attend training events that are sometimes poorly attended as result our supervision policy and appraisal fr amework provides an opportunity through individual personal development pl ans to construct qualifications and skills audit and kld needs analysis to help inform our workforce development strategy we have number of assets which we need to protect and develop the expertise and commitment of all our staff who are in pole position to help build as well as apply relevant knowledge for underpinning world class service 4 an inspection of first line management hmica august 2005 5 cafcass is using the model of supervision in social care developed by tony morrison endorsed by the managing effective supervision unit devel oped by hz management and training consultancy for skills for care in august 2005 revised in 2006 page 12 of 33 cafcass have unique contribution to make to the development of childcare policy and practice generally as their work gives them birds eye view of local authority practice nationally and its impact on children and families the legal advice helpline the need for prompt updates and access to legal advice briefings on new legisl ation and recent relevant case law was emphasised by many of those who were consulted the work of the research coordinat or whose role entails providing research and information servic to ensure cafcass work with families is informed by research and other relevant information that existing and new services are effe ctively evaluated and that policy development and practice guidance is grounded in evidence this work includes the production of the exce llent and much valued research digest we also have an existing partnership wit h research in practice 12500pa which has produced several helpful output s but the impact of these are inevitably weakened by the centrally delivered framework of rip and the limitations of depending on cascade effect for national events by 200708 the cafcass practice learning pr oject is seeking to provide 130 annual practicelearning placements across cafcass nationally workload relief and backfill costs have been addressed 22 the policy practice context there have been number of recent devel opments in social care and health which impact on cafcass work with vul nerable children and families it is essential that cafcass is able to mainta in constant and critical review of all impending or new legislation in addition to new guidance and regulations and contribute to the consultation process in order that we can identify the implications for cafcass we must ensure all staff are appropriately informed trained and prepared for any such changes it is equally critical that we can monitor the impact of the new pr ovisions and learn from our practice to inform the future development of services to children and their families involved in range of proceedings across the family jurisdiction we need to note the impact on our work of the childrens act 2004 and which provides the legal underpinning for every child matters change for children the programme aimed at transforming child rens services it is also important to recognise the national service framework nsf for children young people and maternity services september 2004 doh which applies to all those working with children young peopl and families in both health and social services each child death enquiry including the 2001 the victoria climbie inquiry has elicited responses and stat ements which point out the significant under investment in knowledge skills and management over several years and across many sectors but particularly wit hin social care this underinvestment page 13 of 33 has been often compounded by the tensi on between meeting the service delivery demands of the agency and of the children young people and families who might be the subjects of proceedings and the responsibility to meet the kld needs of all staff in an agency the adoption and children act is the first major review of adoption legislation for thirty years both this and the children contact and adoption bill published in february 2005 and currently before parliament have considerable workload implications for cafcass the joint departmental dca dfes green paper on parental separation childrens needs and par ental responsibilities has significant implications for the way in which cafcass will develop over the next five years with new and important emphasis on family support and early incourt conciliation schemes in july 2004 the president of the family division announced the implementation of new framework for private law cases aimed at providing earlier intervention and support to child ren and their families which could divert them away from court pr oceedings cafcass is central to the implementation of this programme significant new areas of practice in clude representing children involved in private law proceedings fpr 95 and s122 adoption and children act 2002 developing cafcass in court conciliation schemes and family resolutions pilots increasing support to families under the expanded prov isions of s16 children act 1989 as well as monitori ng and facilitating contact arrangements under the children contact and adoption bill this represents substantive new body of work in addition to the tradi tional core roles of reporting to the court s7 ca 1989 and representing the inte rests of the child before the court s41 ca 1989 specified proceedings the policy context continues to change with review of the family justice system in the area of child care proceedings being taken forward to improve the crossgovernment delivery of the co re welfare minimum intervention and minimum delay principles set out in the children act 1989 new report on safeguarding children by csci and seven other independent government inspectorates safeguarding children joint inspectorate report july 2005 contained specific re commendation to hmcs and cafcass to increase the participation of children in family court proceedings an earlier report from hmica safeguarding children in family proceedings april 2005 had already highlighted range of concerns from lack of clarity over the term safeguarding reliance on acpcs for training not addressing diversity issues in frontline practice and unt enable fundamental differences in the practice of involving children finally all cafcasss services to children and young people must be convention compliant taking fully into account and respecting the human rights of children and young people as required by the human rights act page 14 of 33 1998 and the united nations convention on the rights of the child uncrc 23 cafcasss role in safeguarding children the cafcass kld strategy must be constructed to reflect and be informed by cafcasss core business of safeguarding children and young people involved in range of family proc eedings cafcass protects children and young people involved in those proceedi ngs primarily through independent investigation and representati on of their interests befo re the court it is this independent representation of their views and in particular their independence from the other par ties to the respective proceedings be they public or private law which is itself the safeguard for t he child indeed the childs safety increases proportionately as function of the quality of the investigation critical analysis of all the available facts and clarity of the recommendation made to the court t he cafcass practitioner is committed to respect and promote the statutory and convention rights of children and young people and is an integral part of t he process through which the courts achieve the correct balance between right s and welfare necessary to secure the best possible outcome for this particular child within this framework the amplificati on of the childs voice in the proceedings becomes an active dynamic which may act in public law matters as catalyst for change reflection and review of previous interpretations of best interest and in private law matters as agent of dispute resolution cafcass practitioners operate within the family courts and they need to be confident and competent in that arena particular skills necessary to equip them for this were identified by the judiciary as follows courtroom skills including confi dence in addressing the court and commanding credibility as an expert witness in general child care matters case management skills as set out in s41 10 ca1989 including proactive management of the timetable of the case in order to avoid delay an in depth knowledge of t he framework of law st atutory regulations and guidance which regulate local authority pr actice in relation to children and young people the ability to provide succinct and critical independent analysis of the evidence before the court follo wed by clear and reasoned recommendation 24 the social work context government has made clear that cons olidation and expansion of the child care workforce is the key process whic h underpins almost all of its current aspirations for children and families there is now new gscc regulatory framework that is designed to expand t he amount and range of post qualifying pq awards for the social care workforc this is therefor the time to be proactive and to take advantage of major strategic opportunity of benefit to page 15 of 33 everyone in growing the cafcass workforce for the future and increasing the childcare workforce across the board cafcass has seat on the board of t he childrens workforce development council cwdc which aims to impr ove the lives of children and young people by ensuring that the people wo rking with children have the best possible training qualifications suppor t and advice it will also help children and young peoples organisations and services to work together so that the child is at the centre of all servic cwdc is one of five bodies forming the uk skills for care and development sector skills council and coordinates the childrens workforce network it acts as partner and critical friend of the government carrying forward the results from the paper every child matters our seat on the cwdc board has given us crucial voice in the current developments in the new training and cpd stru ctures introduced by the every child matters agenda it is vital we continue to make strategic alliances and strengthen our links so as to ensure that our specialist role is understood and taken account of in current national dev elopments we also need to be able to capitalise on the various financial and nonfinancial resources currently potentially available cafcass recruits its professional workforce on the basis of requirement to have three years post qualifying experience but we need to take account of the new threeyear degree r equirements in our role as supplier of practice placements an experience widely cknowledged to influence subsequent career choices by course candidates the practice learning taskforce was established to work with statutory voluntary and independent employers to increase the amount range and quality of practice learning opportunities 6 we also need to investigate the accredita tion of prior learning possibilities for cafcass practitioners as many will have qualifications andor experience to credit against the new post qualifications pq framework the overall objective of the revised framework is to ensure that postqualifying education and training improves the standard of soci work practice there are three levels in the structure of which the first is at graduate level and aimed at the consolidation of competence in specia list area of work from the perspective of cafcass this would be work wit h children young people and families the higher levels higher specialist and the advanced award programmes lead to postqualifying awards in higher specialist social work all programmes are to be linked to uni versity awards the higher education institutions heis that are to deliver the awards must be accredited by gscc to do so in addition there is require ment to work within regional planning networks which will involve employers service users and carers at regional subregional and local level to provide an active ongoing dialogue between employers as commissioners and universities as providers of education gscc 2005 p9 6 see httpwwwpracticelearning orguk including national project plan for learning resource centre networks 2004 page 16 of 33 given the core business of cafcass ca reful thought needs to be given to how we develop our staff given their experience roles and job function and this will be set out in detail in our pq strategy the proposal for family justice professional has ready been the subject of extensive consultation and has received7 widespread support most important ly it has the backing of the family justice council it is equally important that we work with heis gscc cwdc and other key par tners to ensure that t he content of the new pq framework meets the development needs of our fcas 25 the social work regulatory framework the social care register came into fo rce in 2005 to regulate the wider social care workforce it means that everyone who works in social care in england will join the register and must abide by t he code of practice for social care workers in order to reregister with the gscc after the initial threeyear period registered social workers are r equired to complete either 90 hours or 15 days of study training courses seminars reading teaching or other activities which could reasonably be expected to advance the social workers professional development or contribute to the development of the profession as whole they are required to keep record of such training and learning gscc regulations specify training and related activities undertaken to continue on the register should incl ude benefiting the candidates current employment as well as hi sher career progression specific examples in addition to using evidence of study to wards postqualifying award include arranging to shadow the work of colleague in related teamprofession negotiating protected time to resear ch latest policy and good practice developments in candidates field of practice undertaking piece of research related to practice the code of practice for employers of social care workers states that employers are expected to support registered workers to meet the requirements and supervision sessions ar cited by gscc as appropriate for identifying training learning and devel opment needs selfemployed social workers are also subject to these requirements section 3 how we will meet our four key objectives 31 objective 1 to acknowledge cons olidate and expand the role of cafcass as learning organi sation which can both generate and apply knowledge including especially researchbased knowledge cafcass is unique agency the only one of its kind in the country which carries out its specialist function this puts us in position of being not only 7 an inclusive curriculum for continuing profession development for family justice professionals httpwwwfamilyjusticecouncilorgukhtmspubsetsubcomhtm page 17 of 33 experts in what we do but also being able to lead the debate on practice issues in the family court setting social workers in the field see the fca role as career aspiration we must us our privileged position to both generate and apply knowledge to improve the lives of children and families we work with we are datarich organisation and t here is considerable interest amongst academics and practitioners to carry out research which will inform practice in the family courts we will encourage this interest and seek out interest and funding for where we feel there ar gaps for example the cwdc will plan and resource an annual programme of prac titioner and children led research and we will encourage and support cafcass st aff and children we work with to do this we have developed our res earch governance framework which will approve all future research projec ts which require our support we will ensure that messages from such research are properly debated and disseminated throughout cafcass we will adopt bottomup process for identifying the knowledge needs of cafcass staff and for engaging cafcass staff and service users in actually setting the research agenda t he model below illustrates virtuous circle which builds on cafcass existi ng strengths and strives to remedy identified gaps v l u t i n g i t s accessingapplying usefulness and the knowledge impact base b u i l d i n g contributing identifying gaps to the knowledge base source jane tunstill 2006 we will ensure that our st aff have up to date knowledge through the latest books and research findings so that t hey feel equipped to do the job we will do this by continuing to publish and disseminate the muchacclaimed research digest published quarterly by our research coordinator in addition we have commissioned library and information service from barnados and this will become available to all our staff during 2006 we hope this arrangement will have other spin offs which will enhance practice and service delivery by learning from best practice in barnados page 18 of 33 the partnership with bar nados is an example of how we will collaborate with other agencies for mutual benefit we have also joined scies practice partners forum where we both contribut to and learn from best practice nationally we will be proactive in influencing the national policy debates on children and families with dfes and ot her key agencies by ensuring that we have seat the table we were influential in shaping the private law developments and have seat on the board of the childrens workforce development council cwdc we will continue to seek out opportunities to inform future policy debates we will keep the voice of the children and families we work with at the centre of our learning and developmen t because it is ultimately their experience of our service that matters for this we need to be honest and open in the way we work actively seek feedback on our work and not only listen to it but also use it to improve our services we will do this by embedding our quality assurance framework systematically l earn from feedback we receive through this and our compliments comments and complaints system and through viewpoint and begin to actively engage our service users and stakeholders in an ongoing dialogue there are many local init iatives that are working well with regions and teams these need knitting together into rec ognisable pattern at national regional and local level to provide flexible kl d matrix of learning learning can be achieved via many routes and may be both direct and indirect there are also constructive opportunities for costeffective joint or partner ship training events and initiatives with key stakeholders and other ngos and organisations active in the field and we will explore delivery of courses at national regional and local level with them in this cont ext all cafcass training courses and programmes will be registered for law societys continuing professional development cpd points we will create opportunities for all st aff to learn continuously through promoting and supporting culture of learning from each other from best practice and from experts in the field to enable this we will

new ways of working such as dispute resolution so that our servic remains relevant to the needs of our service users and we can dem onstrate what works for this we must put time and thought into setting up the evaluation at the start of any new innovation we recognise that we have to be proactive in growing our future workforce this brings learning opportunities for not only the students but also our fcas as practice teachers and in some case s for the team as whole following the success of the 200405 practicel earning programme in the northern regions we will extend this to provide oppor tunities for social work students to gain practice experience throughout cafcass we will appoint practice learning coordinators in all r egions to develop our capacity to do this want all teams to be

2 to identify and establish knowledge learning and developemnt opportunities for all gr oups of staff leaders and managers fcas and business support staff and specialists the performance management framework which includes the supervision and one to one policy and appraisal and pers onal development plans is the key mechanism by which we can ens ure our practice competences and national standards are supported by kld programme of activities which are properly planned good induction lays t he foundation for any new member of staff to be prepared for the job ahead and we will ensure all new staff are properly introduced to their role and f unction we will provide supervision for our fcas at minimum standard of not less than six weekly intervals have regular one to one meetings with all other staff by arrangement appraise all staff and ensure they have personal development plan which identifies learning opportunities that contribute to continuing professional development

programme t he impact of new legislation and developments and inspection and audit recommendations we will set out our detailed and costed pr iorities each year through our kld action plan however there are some key priorities which we will deliver over the next 23 years domestic violence training programme of activities for the development of our service managers and for our business support staff two national conferences on diversity and research findings major national it training programme to up skill our staff foundation training for all new fca s which will include legal input from cafcass lawyer or childrens panel solicitor training in early assessment and repor t writing to help implement the new national standards and programme of activities to impr ove practice with focus on domestic violence safeguarding and diversity in addition we will strengthen our sponsor ship programme which has in the past two years supported over 50 individuals to undertake career development opportunities some of these were pq courses for fcas but we also supported many business support hr and specialist staff to complete courses such as ma and cipd in personnel development nvq administration cima management accounting hnd computing business and information technology and diploma in management we will ensure that access to k nowledge learning and development opportunities is fair and that group or individual will be disadvantaged or discriminated against we will in line with our duties under the race relations amendment act 2000 monitor the impact of training on bme staff groups unlike any other social care agency ca fcass is sociolegal service whose officers have direct line of accountab ility to the court and who operate at the heart of the family justice system we have achieved considerable progress in setting out detailed and costed pq strategy which aims to develop highly skilled and competent practitioners capable of providing top quality service to vulnerable children and families referred by the family courts the strategy has two strategic goals to develop pq curriculum in the c ontext of the revised pq framework that meets cafcass needs as an organisation with specific professional strategy operating in both social care and the more specialist family justice fields to establish an organisational system that enables practitioners to access the required pq programmes we will finalise this strategy consult on it actively implement it and work with our funding body the dfes to ensure it is properly resourced page 22 of 33 it is essential that changes in cafcass activities and statutory responsibilities are fully supported by recognising the equivalent needs for continuing professional development for staff providing administrative and business support information technology human resources and financial reporting business support staff provi the infrastructure within which practitioners can deliver effective services to children and families they also require agreed occupational standards developmental objectives and opportunities for accredited training with the leadership of the head of business development we will develop business academy approach to support both our business support staff as well as our other specialist functions such as hr and it and finance roles our electronic case recording system crs which is being rolled out to all or regions will require all our business support staff fcas and managers to change we will ensure that they ar trained to be able to use crs purposefully both as information and as management tool in order to modernise our working practices we will ensure that our staff have access to modern working tools and learni ng methods such as online training and are properly trained to use them ou r ict strategy builds on this and comprehensively sets out the training requi red to ensure that all our staff are it literate and can access their emails the intranet and the internet as we rely on this to communicate effectively with our nationally dispersed staff the successful use of the new library serv ice also depends on staff being able to access their emails and log on to the library website we recognise that the expertise and knowledge of staff within the agency and across all grades is considerable and that accessing this through training events is of benefit to cafcass and can be developmental opportunity for the trainer we will ensure that trainers appointed and used reflect the broad backgrounds and needs of staff and the wider community some regular training events such as foundati on training are particularly suitable for delivery by internal trainers and that this gives both an opportunity to staff and recognises the skills and talent which ex ist within cafcass to this end we have protocol in place which includes back fill costs for regions releasing staff and we will monitor its success in t he delivery of internal training our first line managers are key function in the organisation and we have made some good links with key agencies such as cwdc and skills for care to seek funding for and provide comprehensive management development programme over 3 years for first line managers this seeks to fulfil recommendation 9 of the skills for care leadership and management strategy 8 all first line managers who do not have relevant management qualification and are not covered by the registered manager awards should be registered for the agr eed management qualifications 8 leadership and management strategy employers

social care council9 continuous professional devel opment cpd whole systems approach is proposed with 3 key elements ¾ leadership and management formal training ¾ coaching and mentoring ¾ organisation specific developmental inputs we recognise that any such progr amme should be employer led and cafcass is fully committed to such key development we have small number of bm managers in cafcass and we acknowledge industry research which demonstrates the disadvantage they face in career and employment opportunities we will support their development in particular withi n our management and leadership development programme equally our chief executive corpor ate directors regional directors and heads of service provide critical leadership to the organisation and we will similarly work with scie and

over 3 years for first line managers support the development of our bme managers work with scie and other key agencie s to put in place leadership development programme for our senior managers 33 objective 3 to put in place devolved knowledge learning and development function with strong strategic overview it is vital the cafcass places itself as key agency within the context of the national social care workforce devel opments and both informs itself and is able to contribute to the debate whic h will inform current developments for this it needs local and national l eadership and strong structure number of functions were devolved to regions in 2005 following the broad consensus around the chief executives consultation on the future structure and culture in cafcass this devoluti on took place within strong national frameworks and corporate leadership the corporate director for strategy performance has the strategic lead for kld and chairs national kld steering group which will hav responsibility for setting national priorities and monitoring the implementati on of this strategy in addition regional director nw provides bridge between st rategic and operational issues and supports the kld function at regional level each region now has lead kld manager reporting to the regional director with links to the national kld network manager regions also have some dedicated administrative support not all these regional posts are full time but it is critical t hat we begin to lay the foundations and infrastructure to deliver this longerte rm strategy for kld for all staff and we will build on this reviewing the hours allo cated in line with the size of the region and the workload the duties and responsibilities of these posts will ultimately include liasing with heis to develop appropr iate pq opportunities within the nationally agreed strategy proactive membership of the new l earning resource network centres to under pin the links with heis maximising local training opportuniti with local authorities local safeguarding childrens boards lscb family justice councils fjc heis voluntary organisations and stakeholder organisations providing consultancy and support to fc as involved in pq training or other professional development monitoring and ensuring that reregi stration requirements for gscc are met contributing to the budget requirem ents of kld including the direct delivery of training page 25 of 33 ensuring the fair distribution of tr aining opportunities and funds throughout the region identifying and facilitating kld needs wit hin teams and also to identifying kld resources within teams the kld network manager fac ilitates the coordination of the regional kld leads through the kld network which will be responsible for implementing the kld strategy and coordinating regional training events and initiatives this structure is relatively new but in the short time it has been in place it has begun to offer more local response to the local understanding of kld needs we need to continue to monitor the structure and ensure that it allows us to create good balance between the national priorities and local needs the results of the extensive consultation in formulating this strategy reflect the fact that while some service manager s are eminently well qualified in both public and private law matters others ar not and this requires flexible approach to practice teaching suppor t and supervision the national change programme proposes new structure c onsisting of mixture of posts of heads of service service managers and practice managers and all regions will ensure that they have the appropriate balance of posts to ensure that practice is of good standard and is informed by research and new developments the kld function is supported by the research coordinator who provides regular and timely brie fings on key government and other consultation papers legislation r egulation and inspection reports and others including research as relevant to the work of cafcass analyses the implications of such paper slegislation for practice and for better outcomes for children young people and their families and disseminates the information to all cafcass staff the research coordinator also s upports the work of the research governance committee set up to ensure t hat research and related activities involving cafcass staff service users or data are conducted ethically and to the highest standard and that their findings contribute in costeffective timely and relevant way to the abilit of the organisation to offer the best possible service to the children and fam ilies with whom we work she also chairs the steering group for evidence informed practice sgeip which was set up to champion and provide lead in relation to an evidenceinformed approach to practice and whose work is monitored by the kld steering group we will ensure that the role of the research coordinator and related span of activities is properly linked within the kld matrix actions embed the new devolved kld stru ctures with strong corporate leadership ensuring there is good balance between national priorities and local needs page 26 of 33 regions to ensure they have t he appropriate balance of management posts to ensure that practice is of good standard and is informed by research and new developments monitor the role of the kld leads reviewing the hours allocated in line with the size of the region and the workload continue to strengthen the role of the research coordinator and its function within the kld matrix 34 objective 4 to aim by 2010 fo r cafcass to allocate resources to kld activities at level commensurat with kld needs and at the same proportion as equivalent knowledge based organisations in 2000 the training organisation for personal social services topss now skills for care published the first national strategy for modernising the social care workforce this referred to the responsibility of all employers to allocate an increased proportion of their st affing budget to meet direct training costs 3 of budget on traini ng linked to qualifications in addition all employees to contribute personal study timebursary or loan resources to achieve 15 of the total cost of their own qualifications by 2005 the implementation of this strategy has very considerable resource implications we cannot i gnore the pressures of managing service within context of growing demand but neither can we stand still phased implementation of the strategy is proposed with an incr emental approach to increasing the percentage of budget allocation to kld in addition we must make the best possible use of all avail able resources and deploy them as part of this strategy in order to be both effective and cost effective cafcass has made commitment in its two year business plan to incrementally allocate by 2010 3 of it s staffing budget to training activities in line with these recommended national gui delines employees too will need to contribute personal study time and other resources to achieve percentage of the total cost of their own qualifications this is not an easy course for either party within standstill budget it is critical therefore t hat each region determines its kld activities through an annual kld plan and spends its devolved budgets within the broad priorities and frameworks set out within this strategy there should be clear understanding of how each pi ece of expenditure fits within the cafcass kld matrix at national regional and local level the treasury funding for the development of social workers through post qualifying courses was been devolved to cal authorities which leaves other employers of social workers such as cafcass with access to this type of funding we risk erosion of our credibility as an agency which reviews the work of local authorities and widening development gap if we do not develop our fcas to pq levels in order to ens ure that our pq stra tegy is properly resourced we will make our business case to our sponsorship department page 27 of 33 the dfes and ensure that this is s hared risk with them we will ensure that this is properly lodged in time for the governments next comprehensive spending review in autumn 2006 which will allocate funding for 200811 we will also continue to establish and make links with other key players to ensure we have best opportunities available to us and we are linked in to available pots of funding we hav been successful in obtaining cwdc funding for developing our leadership pr ogramme for first line managers and this will allow us to pull together an application to bid for funding the programme from skills for care we have also been successful in obtaining contribution to the development of our pq programme from the cwdc we need to continue to make alliances and to ensure cafcass gets its fair share of available funding from agencies with remit to fund opportunities equally we must streamline and ensur efficient use of existing kld resources in order to avoid duplication and ensure efficient use of all available resources there may be opportunities to pool some resources with key stakeholders ngos heis the 42 loca l family justice councils and local safeguarding children boards for costeffective approach to kld the potential may exist for constructive and cost effective training partnership initiatives and we will need to exploit these actions allocate by 2010 3 of staffing budget to training activities in line with recommended national guidelines each region to determine its kld acti vities through an annual kld plan and to spend its devolved budgets within the broad priorities and frameworks set out within this strategy business case for pq funding lodged with dfes in time for the comprehensive spending review in autumn 2006 strengthen external alliance to ensure cfafcass can access its fair share of available funding avoid duplication and ensure efficient use of all available resources including cost effective training partnersh ip initiatives with key stakeholders section 4 41 implementation monitoring review monitoring and evaluating our performance agai nst our objectives is critical to our understanding of whether we have deliv ered or not it also helps to ensure that our objectives remain relevant and challenging progress against this strategy will be monitored through quarterly performance review meetings at regional level the kld network meetings and through the kld steeri ng group in addition progr ess will be reported to board and to cdg and published in the annual report page 28 of 33 priorities and targets will be review ed and developed against consultation responses to this strategy and over time 42 having your say it is important that all cafcass staff feel ownership of our kld strategy this strategy is neither static doc ument nor an end in itself but has been developed to reflect our approach to cont inuous learning flexible enough to respond to our own changing internal env ironment although many staff and stakeholders were consulted in drawing this strategy up there will be others who will not
