from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to tas van ommen tasvanommenutaseduau subject re fw law dome o18 date mon feb 9 092343 2004 cc mannvirginiaedu dear tas thanks for the email steve mcintyre hasnt contacted directly about law dome yet nor about any of the series used in the 1998 holocene paper or the 2003 grl one with mike i suspect hope that he wont i had some emails with him few years ago when he wanted to get all the station temperature data we use here in cru at that time i hid behind the fact that some of the data had been received from individuals and not directly from met services through the global telecommunications service gts or through gcos ive ccd mike on this just for info emails have also been sent to some other paleo people asking for datasets used in 1998 or 2003 keith briffa here got one for example here they have also been in contact with some of keiths russian contacts all seem to relate to trying to get series weve used in the russian case issues relate to the russian rashit hantemirov having paper out with the same series keith used for the yamal peninsula series are different for two reasons one keith used the rcs standardization method and secondly rashit has added some series since keith got the data couple of years ago ill just sit tight here and do nothing mike will likely do the same but well expect another publication in the nearish future as for the series for ld you sent us we used it in the paper for reviews of geophysics this paper has had 4 good reviews and weve just sent back revised version this will likely get reviewed by 1 or 2 of the same reviewers of the editor but i think it will come out this year some time when it does we will put all the series onto web site hope this is ok with you it will unlikely be before our summer months cheers phil at 1756 09022004 1100 you wrote dear phil what you will find below is in reverse chronological order an email interchange between steve mcintyre and myself he has been asking for ld data for while since your grl paper came out and to my chagrin i have put him off once already for reasons i spell out below for your information i am close to submitting the full ld isotope record which i hope to present at scar bremen along with some interesting spectral analyses and comparison to epica dome c anyway i am aware of mcintyres controversial history and am trying to handle things in noninflammatory way he seems not to be troubling over my own delay but has asked for data that was used in your holocene paper of 1998 for this i have referred him to you i expect he wants to replicate your synthesis and so he should use the identical data set and i give you permission to pass on whatever it was i gave you for that work with the caveat that it is representative of where the ld proxy record was in 1997 not 2004 i leave it to you to decide how to deal with this you may prefer to ignore the issue and i would understand let know if there is anything i can do to assist

dome o18 dear stephen i suggest you ask phil jones for copy of that older data set jones et cite morgan and van ommen 1997 although that data set was heavily smoothed gaussian of rms13 years from memory so the one they show is not direct version of morgan and van ommen 1997 i think that i provided them with high resolution version and from their notation it seems that they are using novemberapril subset but you would have to ask phil especially if what you seek is to replicate their analyses apart from anything else our set has been continually in state of development which is why i have not wanted to widely circulate it until now over this period we have had made new measurements which improved our layer counted dating and filled the gap that you see in jones et retreived more cores using better technology and derived robust gastied flowmodel that dates the core to 90ky now that the new development has ceased we will soon be releasing the full data set as i have indicated to you this is the set i would want to see in wider use and it is worth noting that it is essentially the same as the portion used by mann and jones in their grl paper in 2003 all the best

mcintyre sent saturday february 07 2004 1115 pm subject re law dome o18 dear stephen the 18o data used in mann and jones 2003 was provided as an advance copy in 2003 and you are welcome to have access to it and it will certainly be placed in public archives the data in question is part of the full 90 ky isotope record from law dome for which peerreviewed dating scale has only recently been published actually it is in press see van ommen et in press annals of glaciology 39 at 9httpwwwantcrcutaseduautashomeopenaccesshtmlvanommen04ld1 now this job is done i am finalizing paper that will allow to release the isotope record more widely it is this next paper that controls the timeframe for release to you and archives while i should await peer review for release to the archives i am happy to pass on copy of the data set to you on an advance basis as soon as the paper is submitted i expect in couple of months you will appreciate that at this time of the year we in the south are in our vacation season not to mention dealing with our antarctic summer field program so i thank you for your patience do check back with in while if you dont hear more regards tas original message from
