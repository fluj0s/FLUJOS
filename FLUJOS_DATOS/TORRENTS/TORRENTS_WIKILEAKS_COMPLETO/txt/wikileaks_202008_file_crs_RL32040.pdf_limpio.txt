limit the discretion of sentencing court to impose sentence that does not include term of imprisonment or the death penalty they have long history and come in several varieties the notlessthan the flat sentence and piggyback versions critics argue that mandatory minimums undermine the rationale and operation of the federal sentencing guidelines which are designed to elim inate unwarranted sentencing disparity counter arguments suggest that the guidelines themselves operate to undermine individual sentencing discretion and that the ills attributed to other mandatory minimums are more appropriately assigned to prosecutorial discretion or other sources state and federal mandatory minimums have come under constitutional attack on several grounds over the years and have generally survived the eighth amendments cruel and unusual punishments clause does bar mandatory capital punishment and apparently bans any term of imprisonment that is grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime for which it is imposed the supreme court however has declined to overturn sentences imposed under the california three strikes law and challenged as cruel and unusual the constitutional rule that any fact that increases the maximum penalty for crime must be charged in the indictment presented for jury determination and proven beyond reasonable doubt has application to fact that triggers mandatory minimum penalty at least with regard to facts traditionally considered sentencing factors it does mean however that federal sentence guidelines remain important considerations but are longer binding double jeopardy ex post facto due process separation of powers and equal protection challenges have been generally unavailing lists of various federal mandatory

including some whose status might be disputed the most widely recognized are those that demand that offenders be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than designated term of imprisonment 6 some are triggered by the nature of the 1 although others may differ this report does not classify as mandatory minimum sentencing statutes those statutory proscriptions that call for mandatory minimum fine unless they also call for mandatory minimum term of imprisonment 2 commentators have defined mandatory minimums in number of ways see eg mandatory minimum sentences coupled with multifacet interventions an effective response to domestic violence 6 u niversity of the district of columbia law review 51 68 2001 quoting determinate sentencing and judicial participation in democratic punishment 108 h arvard law review 947 1995mandatory minimums require judges to impose specified minimum prison term if an offense meets certain statutory criteria lowenthal mandatory sentencing laws undermining the effectiveness of determinate sentencing reform 81 c alifornia law review 61 64 1993 mandatory sentencing statutes generally provide that when specified circumstance exists in connection with the commission of crime 1 the court must sentence the defendant to prison and 2 the duration of the defendants incarceration will be substantially longer than it would have been in the absence of the circumstance bernstein discretion reduxmandatory minimums federal judges and the safety valve provision of the 1994 crime act 20 u niversity of dayton law review 765 768 1995ellipse in the originalmandatory minimums which are most commonly applied in drug cases are statutory provisions calling for sentence of less than for given offense adjusted for criminal record the definition used here ie any statute that effectively requires federal judge at minimum to sentence convicted defendant to term of imprisonment is mandatory minimum is designed to avoid exclusion of any provisions that should arguably be listed 3 eg 18 usc 3553e upon motion of the government the court shall have the authority to impose sentence below level established by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect defendants substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of anothe r person who has committed an offense emphasis added prosecutorial discretion is somewhat confined however by the courts authority to accept or reject plea bargains frcrimp 32 and their consideration of relevant but uncharged misconduct under the federal sentencing guidelines ussg 1b13 4 eg usconst artii 2 the president shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the united states 5 various parts of the report are drawn from earlier reports principally crs report rl30281

members of this not less than category are less mandatory than others because congress has provided partial escape hatch or safety valve for example several of the drugrelated mandatory minimums are subject to safety valve for small time first time offenders that may render their minimum penalties less than mandatory or at least less severe9 some of the other notlessthanmandatory minimums purport to permit the court to sentence an offender to fine rather than to mandatory term of imprisonment 10 second generally recognized category of mandatory minimums consists of the flat or single sentence statutes the vast majority of which call for life imprisonment11 closely related are the 7 eg 18 usc 844f1whoever maliciously damages or destroys by means of fire or an explosive any personal or real property owned or possessed by the united states shall be imprisoned for not less than 5 years and not more than 20 years 8 eg 18 usc 2252b1whoever violates paragraphs 1 2 or 3 of subsection relating to commercial activities with respect child pornography shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than 5 years and not more than 20 years 9 notwithstanding any other provision of law in the case of an offense under section 401 404 or 406 of the controlled substances act 21 usc 841 844 846 or section 1010 or 1013 of the controlled substances import and export act 21 usc 960 963 the court shall impose sentence pursuant to guidelines promulgated by the united states sentencing commission under section 994 of title 28 without regard to any statutory minimum sentence if the court finds at sentencing after the government has been afforded the opportunity to make recommendation that 1 the defendant does not have more than 1 criminal history point as determined under the sentencing guidelines 2 the defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess firearm or other dangerous weapon or induce another participant to do so in connection with the offense 3 the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person 4 the defendant was not an organizer leader manager or supervisor of others in the offense as determined under the sentencing guidelines and was not engaged in continuing criminal enterprise as defined in section 408 of the controlled substances act and 5 not later than the time of the sentencing hearing the defendant has truthfully provided to the government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of common scheme or plan but the fact that the defendant has relevant or useful other information to provide or that the government is already aware of the information shall not preclude determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement 18 usc 3553f when the safety valuecan be claimed the sentencing guidelines call for minimal offense level of 17 if the otherwise applicable mandatory minimum is at least 5 years ussg 5c12b an offense level of 17 translates to permissible sentencing range of between 2 and 25 years imprisonment ussg ch5 pta sentencing table and is beyond the level for which an offender may be sentenced either to probation or to split sentence of imprisonment and some other less restrictive form of supervision id ussc 5c11 10 eg 2 usc 390 every person who having been subpenaed as witness under this chapter relating to congressional contested elections to give testimony or to pr oduce documents willfully makes default or who having appeared refuses to answer any question pertinent to the contested election case shall be deemed guilty of misdemeanor punishable by fine of not more than 1000 nor less than 100 or imprisoned for not less than one month nor more than twelve months or both emphasis added although these might seem to stretch the definition ie statutes that require judge to impose minimum sentence of imprisonment they are mentioned because the sentencing commission included them within its definition of mandatory minimums united states sentencing commission special report to the congress mandatory minimum penalties in the federal criminal justice system commission report 45 1991under some statutes mandatory prison term is only required when the court otherwise determines to impose sentence of imprisonment moreover they highlight instances where congress might have been thought to establish mandatory minimum but where its treatment of the fine to be im posed may leave its intentions in doubt see eg 18 usc 242 whoever willfully subjects any person to the deprivation of any rights if death results shall be fined under this tit or imprisoned for any term of years or for life or both emphasis added 11 eg 18 usc 1651 whoever on the high seas commits the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations and continued

death penalty or imprisonment for life or death or imprisonment either for life or for some term of years12 the piggyback statutes make up third class the piggyback statutes are not themselves mandatory minimums but sentence offenders by re ference to underlying statutes including those that impose mandatory minimums13 until the supreme court intervened in booker v united states to eliminate the binding effect of the sentencing guidelines14 the final and least obvious group was comprised of statutes whose violation resulted in the imposition of mandatory minimum term of imprisonment by operation of law or more precisely by operation of the sentencing reform act and the sentencing guidelines issued in its name15 after booker and the line of cases that followed the guidelines cannot fairly be characterized as source of mandatory minimum sentences although they continue to tilt heavily towards incarceration 16 continued is afterwards brought into or found in the united states shall be imprisoned for life emphasis added 12 eg 18 usc 1201awhoever unlawfully seizes confines inveigles decoys kidnaps abducts or carries away and holds for ransom or reward or otherwise any person if death of any person results shall be punished by death or life imprisonment most observers might exclude from this category capital crimes made punishable by death life imprisonment or imprisonment for any term of years under the theory that sentence of imprisonment for zero years is sentence of any term of years yet this can hardly have been the intent of congress given the seriousness of the offense to which the sentence attaches 13 eg 18 usc 1114 whoever kills any officer or employee of the united states shall be punished 1 in the case of murder as provided under section 1111 14 543 us 220 2005 booker left the guidelines in place and essentially intact but they continue to have large rather than commanding presence within the federal sentencing scheme see eg rita v united states 127 sct 2456 2007appellate courts may consider sentence within the accurately identified guideline range reasonable gall v united states 128 us 586 2007sentencing courts must begin by determining the appropriate guideline range for the case at hand and then consider the other sentencing factors identified in 18 usc 3553a they may not consider sentence within the guideline range per reasonable nor one outside that range per unreasonable appellate courts are to review trial court sentences under deferential abuse of discretion standard 15 the sentencing commission did not consider its guidelines mandatory minimum provisions commission report at 4 footnote 3 of the commissions report in brackets mandatory minimums mandatory minimum sentencing provisions and related terms refer to statutory provisions re quiring the imposition of at least specified minimum sentence when criteria specified in the relevant statute have been met consistent with the intent of the statutory directive for this report only minimums required by statute are considered to be mandatory minimums not included in the definitions and in fact contrasted with mandatory minimums in later chapter of this report are sentences required by the federal sentencing guidelines the sentencing guidelines however are promulgated pursuant to statutory authority and before booker often curtailed the authority of sentencing court to impose sentence that did not include term of imprisonment upon conviction for violation of statute which on its face is not mandatory minimum 16 this is particularly so because the guidelines impose constraints on the option of probation that make sentence other than incarceration more uncommon than was once the case prior to the sentencing reform act the prison to probation ratio in federal criminal sentencing was about sixty to forty congress said nothing in the statute about abolishing or even drastically curtailing probation the commission however drafted guidelines containing presumptive sentence of imprisonment for every felony in the united states code near the bottom of the scale of crimes it established several ranges in which court could sel ect either prison or probation the result is that the incidence of probation since the guidelines has been cut by more than half 155 freed federal sentencing in the wake of guidelines unacceptable limits on the discretion of sentencers 101 ale law journal 1681 1706707 1992 according to the most recent publicly available statistics the current incidence of probation is 75 with an additional 39 of offenders sentenced to some mix of incarceration and probation united states sentencing commission federal sentencing statistics by state district circuit

us from the beginning in fact the history of our criminal sentencing practices is the story of increased reliance upon judicial or administrative discretion in order to mute the laws severity in individual cases17 followed by increased limitations on such discretion in order to curb the resulting arbitrary and discriminatory disparities in punishment18 it is saga in which competing theories of mandatory and discretionary sentencing have been in varying degrees of ascendancy or decline harmelin v michigan 501 us 957 999 kennedy j concurring severity and want of discretion marked the early criminal law the sentence which followed felony conviction was death except in rare instances other punishment could be imposed over time the courts were given some discretion over sentencing but the choices were hardly lenient and corporal punishment and banishment were common 19 yet even early on there were efforts to ease the laws severity both the accused and the convicted could be pardoned at the kings will20 while parliament regularly increased the number of crimes it often replaced common law capital offenses with statutory crimes defined as misdemeanors or subject to the benefit of clergy the result was the same in either case reduced continued table 4 available on dec 21 2007 at httpwwwusscgovjudpackjp2006htm 17 blackstone c ommentaries on the laws of england 1765 chitty

circumstances of terror pain or disgrace are superadded as in treasons of all kinds being drawn or dragged to the place of execution in high treason affecting the kings person or government embowelling alive beheading and quartering and in murder public dissection and in case of any treason committed by female the judgment is to be burned alive but the humanity of the english nation has

drawn and there being very few instances and those accidental or by negligence of any persons being embowelled or burne d till previously deprived of sensation by strangling some punishments consist in exile or banishment by abjuration of the realm or transportation to the american colonies others in loss of liberty by perpetual or temporary imprisonment some extent to confiscation by forfeiture of lands or movables or both or of the profits of lands for life others i nduce disability of holding offices or employments being heirs executors and the like some though rarely occasion mutilation or dismembering by cutting off the hand or ears others fix lasting stigma on th offender by slitting the nostril s or branding the hand or face some are merely pecuniary by stated or discretionary fines and lastly there are others that consist principally in their ignominy though most of them are mixed with some degree of corporal pain and theses are inflicted chiefly for crimes which arise from indigence or which render even opulence disgraceful such as whipping hard labour in the house of correction the pillory the stocks and the ducking stool 4 blackstone commentaries on the laws of

drastically curtailed the number of capital offenses soon after the revolution22 when the first congress assembled it enacted several mandatory minimums each of them capital offense23 the nineteenth century however witnessed the appearance of host of discretionary schemes designed to ease the harshness of criminal law in individual cases the courts could suspend sentence and were vested with broad authority in the selection of those sentences they chose to impose 24 probation and parole were born and became prominent25 by late in the century at the federal level the number of mandatory capital offenses had been reduced26 and while the number of mandatory minimums had increased27 most federal criminal statutes merely established maximum penalty and left to the discretion of the courts sentences to imposed within the maximum the 1909 federal criminal code revision eliminated most mandatory minimums 28 soon thereafter federal prisoners were made eligible for parole after 21

not punishable by death the maximum punishment only leaving the minimum to the discretion of the trial judge the criminal law necessarily subjects to its corrective discipline all who violate its provisions the weak and the vicious the first offender and the atrocious criminal the mere technical transgressor and the expert in crime are alike guilty of the same offense in the one case the utmost verity of punishment can scarcely provide the protection to which society is entitled in the other anything except as nominal punishment may effectually prevent the reclamation of the offender the argument most frequently urged against leaving the minimum punishments to the discretion of the trial judge is that it affords parties convicted of crime of heinous character an opportunity to obtain immunity because of the weakness or dishonesty of judges it has been well said by distinguished authority upon this subject that instances of the former are rare and of the latter none is believed ever to have existed the purity of our judiciary is one of things which calumny has as yet left untouched this recommendation will be found to be in accordance with the humane spirit of advanced criminal jurisprudence the early english statutes were proverbially cruel the grav est crimes and the most trivial offenses alike invoked the penalty of death our own crimes act of 1790 reflected this barbarous spirit and denounced the death penalty for thirteen distinct offenses but this spirit of vindictive retribution has entirely disappeared we have abolished the punishment of death in all except three casestreason murder and rapeand have provided that even in these cases it may be modified to imprisonment for life and as humane judges in england availed themselves of the most technical irregularities in pleadings and proceedings as an excuse for discharging prisoners from the cruel rigors of the common law so jurors here often refuse to convict for offenses attended with extenuating circumstances rather than submit the offender to what in their judgment is the cruel requirement of law demanding minimum punishment srepno10 continued

both to discourage the individual sentenced from further involvement in crime and by example discourage other potential lawbreakers incapacitation especially of the serious offender mandating

continued illicit drug trafficking 21 usc 844 illicit drug possession 21 usc 960 drug smuggling and 18 usc 924carmed career criminals 42 commission report at ii the lack of uniform application creates unwarranted disparity in sentencing and compromises the potential for the guidelines sentencing system to reduce disparity but see stith cabranes f ear of judging 106 1998our analysis suggests four major conclusions 1 interjudge sentence variation was not as rampant or as shameful in the federal courts under the preguidelines regime as congress apparently believed 2 thorough empirical study has demonstrated reduction in the total amount of disparity under the guidelines 3 while reduction of interjudge disparity is worthwhile goal it is complex goal and myopic focus on this objective can result in system that too often ignores other equally important goals of just sentencing system 4 important sources of disparity remain in the guidelines regime farabee disparate departures under the federal sentencing guidelines tale of two districts 30 c onnecticut law review 569 1998discussing sentencing disparity under the guidelines between two adj acent federal court districts payne does interjudge disparity really matter an analysis of the effects of sentencing reforms in three federal district courts 17 i nternational review of law and economics 337 1997 suggesting that interjudge disparity exists the guidelines notwithstanding 43 commission report at iii since the charging and plea negotiation processes are neither open to public review nor generally reviewable by the courts the honesty and truth in sentencing intended by the guidelines system is compromised there are two basic responses to this critique first prosecutors undoubtedly do through charging decisions and plea bargains sometimes seek or agree to lower than the maximum possible sentences they have always done that with respect to charging decisions th guidelines themselves do not even attempt to limit the historical practice indeed it is difficult to imagine system which could eliminate prosecutorial charging discretion nonetheless the justice department recognized at the outset that unrestrained preindictment bargaining over charges would undermine the guidelines therefore it issued internal directives that prosecutors are to charge the most serious readily provable offense consistent with the nature of the defendants conduct as for plea bargains after indictment the primary justification of the relevant conduct guideline is to ensure that prosecutors cannot manipulate sentences by dismissing courts as long as the judge knows all the facts the precise charge of which defendant is convicted is usually of little consequence except to set the st atutory maximum sentence thus in order to really control sentences through plea bargaining prosecutor must be willing to hide facts from the court the truth is that most prosecutors most of the time play the sentencing game straight down the middle to achieve plea bargains they will give defendants the benefit of close class on the provability of certain facts or on the applicability of certain enhancements to the undoubted facts of given case but they will not lie and they will not conceal evidence the consequence is that prosecutors too have had their discretion restrained by the guidelines bowman the quality of mercy must be restrained and other lessons in learning to love the federal sentencing guidelines 1996 w isconsin law review 679 72728 44 commission report at iii the disparate impact of the federal sentencing

to deter46 mandatory minimums breed disparity by transferring judicial discretion to the prosecution47 in contrast to the calibrated approach of the guidelines mandatory minimums create cliffs where minuscule factual differences can have enormous sentencing consequences48 the amendment process of the sentencing guidel ines makes them perpetually selfcorrecting while mandatory minimums are singleshot efforts at crime control49 and the most efficient and effective way for congress to exercise its powers to direct sentencing policy is through the established process of sentencing guidelines permitting the sophistication of the guidelines structure to work rather than through mandatory minimums50 continued minimums in contrast typically look to only one or sometimes two measurements of offense seriousness thus for example whether the defendant was peripheral participant or the drug rings kingpin whether the defendant used weapon whether the defendant accepted res ponsibility or on the other hand obstructed justice have bearing on the mandatory minimum to which each defendant is exposed these arguments would seem to be most persuasive in the case of flat sentence mandatory minimums in other instances the range between the mandatory minimum and the statutory maximum would seem to provide ample room for the type of distinctions just mentioned 46 commission report at iii while mandatory minimum sentences may increase severity the data suggest that uneven application may dramatically reduce certainty the consequen ces of this bifurcated pattern is likely to thwart the deterrent value of mandatory minimums proponents might suggest that incapacitation and the prospect of minimal punishment were always the principal objectives deterrence is at best challenging to judge the fact that not all possible cases receive mandatory minimum treatment is reason to abandon incapacitation for those that are ensnared and the result is one more properly laid to the door of prosecutorial discretion than to mandatory minimums 47 commission report at iii since the power to determine the ch arge of conviction rests exclusively with the prosecution for 85 percent of the cases that do not proceed to trial mandatory minimums transfer sentencing power from the court to the prosecution to the extent that prosecutorial discretion is exercised with preference to some and not to others and to the extent that some are convicted of conduct carrying mandatory minimum penalty while others who engage in the same or similar conduct are not so c onvicted disparity is reintroduced this presumes that unwarranted disparity existed before the guidelines that the guidelines have reduced or eliminated it and that mandatory minimums returned it to the system three prop ositions upon which there is consensus even if one accepts all three the question remains whether disparity produced by plea agreements that make possible the conviction of other wrongdoers is unwarranted or appropriately laid to the door of mandatory minimums 48 commission report at 29 the cliff effect of mandatory minimums related to the proportionality problems posed in mandatory minimums already described are the sharp differences in sentence between defendants who fall just below the threshold of mandatory minimum compared with those whose criminal conduct just meets the criteria of the mandatory minimum penalty just as mandatory minimums fail to distinguish among defendants whose conduct and prior records in fact differ markedly they distinguish far too greatly among defendants who have committed offense conduct of highly comparable seriousness critics might suggest that such cliffs are natura l necessary and frequently occurring in the law eg the age of majority alcoholblood levels statutes of limitations or that few cliffs are as high as the one that stands between crime committed the day before the effective date of the guidelines and one committed the day after 49 commission report at iv critics might note that the perpetual need for selfcorrection neither inspires great confidence nor dilutes the prospect of disparity 50 commission

proportion to the severity of any crime gregg v georgia 428 us 153 173 1976 when life has been taken deliberately by the offender the court could not say that the punishment is invariably disproportionate to the crime 428 us at 187 in coker v georgia plurality of the court found that death is indeed disproportionate penalty for the crime of raping an adult woman 433 us 583 597 1977 it did so after considering the general repudiation of the death penalty in such cases by the legislatures of other jurisdictions the infrequency with which juries in georgia had been willing to impose the death penalty for rape of adult woman and the comparative severity georgia used to punish other equally or more serious crimes the court employed much the same method of analysis in later capital punishment cases which raised the proportionality doctrine 59 continued license the majority opinion disposed of the case on jurisdictional grounds and did not reach the eighth amendment question 56 weems was convicted of falsifying public documents for which he was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment and accessories which meant that while imprisoned he would carry chain at the ankle hanging from the wrists would be employed at hard and painful labor and receive assistance whatsoever from wit hout the institution and that after release he would forever continue under form of civil death during which he could not vote or hold public office or receive pension could not hold or dispose of property and would be subject to lifelong probation 217 us at 364 the court pointed out that the sentence was more severe than might be imposed for some degrees of homicide for misprision of treason inciting rebellion conspiracy to destroy the government robbery larceny or forgery 217 us at 380 from the courts perspective the legislation establishing the sentencing scheme had fellow in american legislation it is cruel in its excess of imprisonment and that which accompanies and follows imprisonment it is unusual in its character its punishments come under the condemnation of the bill of rights both on account of their degree and kind 217 us at 377 57 there are few cases in the interim in which the court may have applied th proportionality doctrine sub silentio because it f ound infirmity in the sentences challenged see eg graham v west virginia 224 us 616 1912 badders v

doctrine trop v dulles 356 us 86 99100 1958 since wartime desertion is punishable by death there can be argument that the penalty of denationalization is excessive in relation to the gravity of the crime fines imprisonment and even execution may be imposed depending upon the enormity of the crime 58 in furman the court found that the eighth amendments cruel and unusual punishments clause made binding upon the states by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment precluded imposition of the death penalty at the unguided discretion of the judge or jury 59 in enmund v florida 458 us

noncapital cases proved unsuccessful shortly after coker petitioner convicted under recidivist statute which called for an automatic life sentence upon third felony conviction sought to persuade the court that the eighth amendment precluded such sentence based upon comparative analysis of the severity of the treatment of recidivism in other jurisdictions rummel v estelle 445 us 263 1980 the majority of the court was not persuaded the proportionality doctrine had only been employed in capital punishment cases and weems it noted both involved punishments different in nature from those in rummel 445 us at 27274 moreover the petitioner had failed to convincingly establish any objective criteria to evidence gross disproportionality without some objectively identifiable bright light marking disproportionality the court feared application of the proportionality doctrine would constitute subjective policy making task more appropriately left to the legislative bodies 445 us at 275 60 any thoughts that the proportionality doctrine might have been abandoned were dashed almost immediately by solem v helm 463 us 277 1983 solem declared that imposition of mandatory term of life imprisonment under state recidivist statute constituted cruel and unusual punishment the objective criteria which guided proportionality analysis included i the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty ii the sentences imposed on the other criminals in the same jurisdiction and iii the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions 463 us at 292 61 individualized consideration consideration of the defendants unique circumstances is one of the foundations of the courts eighth amendment jurisprudence in capital punishment cases furman found that the eighth amendments cruel and unusual punishments clause made binding upon continued participation in the predicate felony on the other hand defendants who were major participants in the predicate felony and who acted with at least reckless indifference to the risk to human life thereby created might be sentenced to death without br eaching the proportionality doctrine tison v arizona 481 us 137 1982 in both instances the court examined the practices in other jurisdictions and the seriousness of the defendants conduct 60 see also hutto v davis 454 us 370 37273 1982 which summarized rummel as follows like the respondent in this case rummel argued that the length of his imprisonment was so grossly disproportionate to the crime for which he was sentenced that it violated the ban on cruel and unusual punishment of the eighth and fourteenth amendments in rejecting that argument we distinguished between punishments such as the death penalty which by their very nature differ from all other forms of conventionally accepted punishments and punishments which differ from others only in duration this distinction was based upon two factors first this courts eighth amendment judgments should neither be nor appear to be merely the subjective views of individual justices and second the excessiveness of one prison term as compared to another is invariably subjective determination there being clear way to make any constitutional distinction between one term of years and shorter or longer term of years thus we concluded that one could argue without fear of contradiction by any decision of this court that for crimes concededly classified and classifiable as felonies the length of the sentence actually imposed is purely matter of legislative prerogative accordingly we held that rummels life sentence did not violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment 61 rummel with prior two nonviolent felony convictions was sentenced to life imprisonment for obtaining 120 under false pretenses helms the solem defendant with six prior nonviolent felony convictions was sentenced to life imprisonment for uttering 100 account check the court distinguished solem from rummel on at least two grounds solem was ineligible for parole while rummel enjoye d the advantage of fairly liberal early release scheme in solem the life sentence without possibility of parole was imposed as matter of judicial discretion while the life sentence in rummel was required as matter of legislative policy 463 us at 300303

amendment precluded imposition of the death penalty at the unguided discretion of the judge or jury the states initially travelled one of two paths to avoid the problems of unguided discretion identified in furman some eliminated discretion others provided guidance the second approach passed constitutional muster gregg v georgia 428 us 153 1976 the first did not woodson v north carolina 428 us 280 1976 mandatory capital punishment offended the eighth amendment on three grounds woodson declared it was contrary to the evolving standards of decency which mark the threshold of the amendments protection 428 us at 288301 it failed to address the objections of furman to imposition of the death penalty at the unguided discretion of the judge or jury 428 us at 302 and it failed to permit consideration of individual characteristics of the crime and offender process that accords significance to relevant facets of the character and record of the individual offender or the circumstances of the particular offense excludes from consideration in fixing the ultimate punishment of death the possibility of compassionate or mitigating factors stemming from the diverse frailties of humankind it treats all persons convicted of designated offense not as uniquely individual human beings but as members of faceless undifferentiated mass to be subjected to the blind infliction of the penalty of death consideration of both the offender and the offense in order to arrive at just and appropriate sentence has been viewed as progressive and humanizing development while the prevailing practice of individualizing sentencing determinations generally reflects simply enlightened policy rather than constitutional imperative we believe that in capital cases the fundamental respect for humanity underlying the eighth amendment requires consideration of the character and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense as constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death 428 us at 304 citations omitted 62 the court regularly and consistently recognized the individual considerations requirement in subsequent capital punishment cases63 although the language cited above and other dicta64 would seem to apply with similar force in noncapital cases the court emphasized that the doctrine was limited to capital cases65 although the gravity of the offense appears to the most critical factor in noncapital cases the seriousness of the offense maybe judged at least in part by the record of the individual who committed it 62 woodsons rejection of mandatory capital punishment seemed to lose none of its force b ecause two members of the five justice majority considered all capital punishment discretionary or mandatory

carried with it mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole harmelin contended that the sentence violated both the individual consideration and proportionality doctrines

least in noncapital cases 501 us at 994 for three other justices kennedy oconnor and souter sentence which satisfies the first of the solem tests seriousness of the offense need not survive or even face comparisons with sentences for other crimes in the same jurisdiction and for the same crime in other jurisdictions 501 us at 1004 more precisely the plurality emphasized that the eighth amendment does not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence rather it forbids only extreme sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the crime 501 us at 1001 66 in the case of harmelin the sentence was not grossly disproportionate because of the severity of his crime ie the pernicious effects of the drug epidemic in this country demonstrate that the legislature could with reason conclude that the threat posed to the individual and society by possession of this large an amount 66 four principles dictate high proportionality threshold for plurality of the court the first is that the fixing of prison terms for specific crimes involves substantive pe nological judgment that as general matter is properly within the province of legislatures not courts the efficacy of any sentencing system cannot be assessed absent agreement on the purposes and objectives of the penal system and the responsibility for making these fundamental choices and implementing them lies with the legislature the second principle is that the eighth amendment does not mandate adoption of any one penological theory the principles which have guided criminal sentencing have varied with the times the federal and state criminal systems have accorded different weights at different times to the penological goals of retribution deterrence incapacitation and rehabilitation and competing theories of mandatory and discretionary sentencing have been in varying degrees of ascendancy or decline since the beginning of the republic third marked divergences both in underlying theories of sentencing and in the length of prescribed prison terms are the inevitable often beneficial result of the federal structure state sentencing schemes may embody different penological assumptions making interstate comparison of sentences difficult and imperfect enterprise and even assuming identical philosophies differing attitudes and percep tions of local conditions may yield different yet rational conclusions regarding the appropriate length of prison terms for particular crimes thus the circumstance that state has the most severe punishment for particular crime does not by itself render the punishment grossly disproportionate absent constitutionally imposed uniformity inimical to traditional notions of federalism some state will always bear the distinction of treating particular offenders more severely than any other state the fourth principle is that proportionality review by federal courts should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent our decisions recognize that we lack clear objective standards to distinguish between sentences for different terms of years although penalty is per constitutional the relative lack of objective standards concerning terms of imprisonment has meant that outside the context of capital punishment successful challenges to the proportionality of pa rticular sentences are exceedingly rare 501 us at 9981001

momentous enough to warrant the deterrence and retribution of life sentence without parole 501 us at 1003 the plurality opinion also contains several useful observations about the constitutionality of mandatory sentences per se67 deference to legislative judgment notwithstanding when the court later applied the same gross disproportionality standard in an excessive fines context it seemed to imply that misconduct legislatively classified as fairly serious crime felony might lack the gravity to support boundless sanctions united states v bajakajian 524 us 321 1998 involved the confiscation of 357144 as consequence of trying to carry it out of the united states without reporting it willful act punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years 31 usc 5322 in the eyes of the court the crime involved minimal level of culpability moreover the harm caused was also minimal failure to report this currency affected only one party the government and in relatively minor way had his crime gone undetected the government would have been deprived only of the information that 357144 had left the country comparing the gravity of respondents crime with the 357144 forfeiture the government seeks we conclude that such forfeiture would be grossly disproportional to the gravity of his offense 524 us at 33840 did this mean that long mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment triggered by misconduct that court might treat as misdemeanor under californias three strikes law might fall because it could result in gross disproportionate sentences four justices said yes but three said and they were joined by two others who said the law survived constitutional scrutiny regardless of proportionality the question arose from the sentencing of an oftconvicted defendant to imprisonment for not less than 25 years pursuant to the california recidivist statute as result of his attempt to steal three golf clubs valued at just under 400 piece ewing v california 538 us 11 2003 68 67 it is beyond question that the legislature has the power to define criminal punishments without giving the courts any sentencing discretion chapman v united states 500 us 453 467 1991 since the beginning of the republic congress and the states have enacted mandatory sentencing schemes to set aside petitioners mandatory sentence would require rejection not of the judgment of single jurist as in solem but rather the collective wisdom of the michigan legislature and as consequence the michigan citizenry we have never invalidated penalty mandated by legislature based only on the length of sentence and especially with crime as severe as this one we should do so only in the most extreme circumstance in asserting the constitutionality of this mandatory senten ce i offer judgment on its wisdom mandatory sentencing schemes can be criticized for depriving judges of the power to exercise individual discretion when remorse and acknowledgment of guilt or other extenuating facts present what might seem compelling case for departure from the maximum on the other hand broad and unreviewed discretion exercised by sentencing judges leads to the perception that clear standards are being applied and that the rule of law is imperiled by sentences imposed for discernible reason other than the subjective reactions of the sentencing judge the debate illustrates that as noted at the outset arguments for and against particular sentencing schemes are for legislatures to resolve 501 us at 10061007 68 ewing was sentenced to life imprisonment but would be eligible for parole after serving 25

under the statute was not an element of new series of crimes but was instead sentencing consideration that had been given legislatively prescribed weight mcmillan v pennsylvania 477 us 79 1986 as such the pennsylvania statutory scheme neither offended due process nor triggered any right to separate jury finding 477 us at 84 93 there followed number of state and federal statutes under which facts that might earlier have been treated as elements of new crime were simply classified as sentencing factors in some instances the new sentencing factor permitted imposition of penalty far in excess of that otherwise available for the underlying offense for instance the supreme court found constitutional defect in statute which punished deported alien for returning to the united states by imprisonment for not more than 2 years but which permitted the alien to be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 20 years upon posttrial judicial determination that the alien had been convicted of serious crime following deportation almendareztorres v united states 523 us 224 247 1998 perhaps uneasy with the implications the court soon made it clear that under the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the sixth amendment any fact other than prior conviction that increases the maximum penalty for crime must be charged in an indictment submitted to jury and proven beyond reasonable doubt apprendi v new jersey 530 us 466 476 2000emphasis added side opinions questioned the continued vitality of mcmillan s mandatory minimum determination in light of the apprendi 72 majority of the members of the court however are unwilling to extend apprendi to mandatory minimums harris v united states 536 us 545 568 2002 reaffirming mcmillan and employing the approach outlined in that case we conclude that the federal provision at issue 18 usc 924c1a ii is constitutional basing 2year increase in the defendants minimum sentence on judicial finding of brandishing does not evade the requirements of the fifth and sixth amendments congress simply took one 72 thus the court appears to hold that any fact that increas or alters the range of penalties to which defendant is exposed which by definition must include increases or alterations to either the minimum or maximum penalties must be proved to jury beyond reasonable doubt in mcmillan however we rejected such rule to the extent it concerned those facts that increase or alter the minimum penalty to which defendant is exposed accordingly it is incumbent on the court not only to admit that it is overruling mcmillan but also to explain why such course of action is appropriate under normal principles of stare decisis 530 us at 533 oconnor with kennedy breyer jj and rehnquist chj dissenting this traditional understanding that crime includes ever fact that is by law basis for imposing or increasing punishment continued well into the 20 th century at least until the middle of the century i think it clear that the commonlaw rule would cover the mcmillan situation of mandatory minimum sentence defendants expected punishment has increased as result of the narrowed range and that the prosecution is empowered by invoking the mandatory minimum to require the judge to impose higher punishment than he might wish the mandatory minimum entitles the government to more than it would otherwise be entitled thus the fact triggering the mandatory minimum is part of the punishment sought to be inflicted it undoubtedly enters into the punishment so as to aggravate it and is an act to which the law affixes punishment further it is likely that the change in the range available to the judge affects his choice of sentences finally in numerous cases the aggravating fact raised

judges legislators lawyers and commentators have criticized those statutes arguing that they negatively affect the fair administration of the criminal law matter concern to judge sand to legislators alike mandatory minimum statutes are fundamentally inconsistent with congress simultaneous effort to create fair honest and rational sentencing system through the use of sentencing guidelines unlike guideline sentences statutory mandatory minimums generally deny the judge the legal power to depart downward matter how unusual the special circumstances that call for leniency they rarely reflect an effort to achieve sentencing proportionality key element of sentencing fairness that demands that the law punish drug kingpin and mule differently they transfer sentencing power to prosecutors who can determine sentences through the charges they decide to bring and who thereby have reintroduced much of the sentencing disparity that congress created guidelines to eliminate they rarely are based upon empirical study and there is evidence that they encourage subterfuge leading to more frequent downward departures on random basis thereby making them comparatively ineffective means of guaranteeing tough sentences 530 us at 57071 breyer j concurring in part and concurring in the judgment 74 united states v kaluna 192 f3d 1188 1199 9th cir 1999 united states v rasco 123 f3d 222 22627 5th cir 1997

jeopardy bans trying defendant twice for the same offense79 and ex post facto bars retroactive criminal statutes80 more precisely the double jeopardy clause protects against successive prosecutions for the same offense after acquittal or conviction and against multiple criminal punishments for the same offense monge v california 524 us at 72728 the ex post facto clauses on the other hand preclude laws that retroactively alter the definition of crimes or retroactively increase the punishment for criminal acts california dept of corrections v morales 514 us 499 504 1995 some argue that recidivist mandatory minimums offend both the double jeopardy and ex post facto clauses they are contrary to double jeopardy it is said because by using first conviction to justify an increased penalty for second conviction they are in effect punishing the first offense twice they contravene ex post facto proscription when they are used to sentence defendant whose first conviction predates the recidivist statute or so it is contended the courts have rejected both arguments as the supreme court explained when it rejected the double jeopardy challenge to the california three strikes statute historically we have found double jeopardy protections inapplicable to sentencing proceedings because the determinations at issue do not place defendant in jeopardy for an offense see eg nichols v united states 511 us 738 747 1994noting that repeat offender laws penalize only the last offense committed by the defendant nor have sentence enhancements been construed as additional punishment for the previous offense rather they act to increase sentence because of the manner in which the defendant committed the crime of conviction an enhanced sentence imposed on persistent offender thus is not to be viewed as either new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes but as stiffened penalty for the latest crime which is considered to be an aggravated offense because repetitive one monge v california 524 us at 728 some citations omitted courts confronted with ex post facto challenges to recidivist statutes have similarly focused upon the latest crime and not upon the first81 79 nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb usconst amendv the double jeopardy clause is binding on the states through the
