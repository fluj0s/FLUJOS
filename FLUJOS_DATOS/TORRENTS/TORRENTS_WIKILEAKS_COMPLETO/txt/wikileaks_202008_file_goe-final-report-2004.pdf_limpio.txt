of independent experts goe established in response to the itlos order of 8 october 2003 interacted with the malaysian and gaporean delegations and with the appointed technical consultant the danish hydrauli cs institute dhi on continuous basis as the work progressed this report summarises the st udy and assesses the significance of the various impacts evaluated by dhi the impacts were categorized as negligible slight impact is seen to be present but is not detectable minor impact is detectable moderate has environmental impact and major major impacts were identified almost all impacts were the result of hydrodynamic changes ie changes in the current patterns and wave action caused by the reclamation s which in turn caused impact on navigation sediment transport and morphology and fishing thus if the hydrodynamic changes are reduced most impacts will also be redu ced or disappear the most important hydrodynamic change is an increa in the current velocities in calder harbour these increased current velocities can be reduced by widening the crucial calder harbour cross sections that restrict the flow wid ening the calder harbour channel also decreases the flow resistance through the channel thereby encouraging greater flow through the calder harbour channel this in turn results in some decrease in the current velocities through kuala johor the goe recommends that the procedure for widening the calder harbour channel should consist of two aspects simultaneously taking bite dredged to 12m out of the proposed reclamatio n area pt case 2 to open up the crucial cross section at pularek b extending the reclamation with nose in less crucial flow area to counteract the loss of reclaimed area by the bite the goe recommends that the maximum velocities in t he calder harbour channel at the critical pularek cross section be reduced to within 10 of the prereclamation maximum values 10 is the margin of error identified by dh i second consideration relates to the large scale ddies generated in the vicinity of changi by flow separating off the changi finger thin pen insula extending from the mainland of singapore along kuala johor although the impact s of these eddies on navigation were found not to cause significant safety issues in the short term due to low traffic density and the compulsory presence of pilots on board of vessels t ransiting this fairway the goe is nevertheless of the opinion that reduction of the strength or complete elimination of these eddies will increase the safety of passage of vesse ls through this channel since the present strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 2 configuration can be considered as construction p hase of the changi reclamation the goe recommends the streamlining of the changi finger as part of the ongoing works in the area conclusions based on the available data and the dhi report the goe draws the following conclusions 1 the reclamations at tuas view and pulau tekong have resulted in number of impacts identified in the dhi study 2 major impacts were identified 3 seventeen impacts were judged to be in the minor to moderate categories 4 of these fourteen impacts are directly related to changes in current velocities near the reclamations these can be mitigated by reducing t he current velocities 5 erosion is expected at the pularek and belungkor je tties it is accepted by the goe that some erosion had occurred at these jetties prior to reclamation this can be mitigated by properly designed and built scour prot ection 6 the sheetpile perimeter wall in pulau tekong pt ca 1 has increased the wave action in calder harbour replacing the sheetpile as soon as practicable by the final perimeter berm will reduce the wave reflection sign ificantly recommendations the goe recommends 1 that the maximum velocities in the calder harbour c hannel at the critical pularek cross section be reduced to within 10 of the prer eclamation maximum values 2 that singapores final design of the shoreline of rea d will include bite dredged to 12m to open up the calder harbour channel and nose to compensate for the reclamation area lost by the bite 3 that the changi finger be streamlined as part of th ongoing works in the area 4 that the sheetpile silt curtain of area d pt cas 1 be replaced by the final revetment protection pt case 2 as soon as pract icable 5 that scour protection be applied to pularek and bel ungkor jetties 6 that fishermen be compensated for any losses as r esult of the works 7 that limited research and workshops on gill netting be conducted to improve the procedures currently adopted by the fishermen strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 3 1 introduction the official title of the action concerning

been selected by malaysia and singapore to undertak the detailed technical studies this work consisted of collecting all available data pe rforming limited field measurement campaign to collect any missing data carrying out extensive numerical computer modelling preparing final report and in this report determi ning the impacts on the surrounding waters that are directly attributable to the singapore rec lamations dhi reported its results to the goe and the governm ents at regular intervals and the goe interacted on continual basis with the malaysian and singaporean delegations and with

on the complex interactive water body in and around the straits of johor the profession attitude and openminded approach by all aided greatly in the completion of the goes work nd in the production of this report 2 description of the basic processes 21 general description for ease of reference figures 1 to 6 show the phys ical layouts of the area and the two reclamation sites figure 2 shows tuas

for the reclamation at pulau tekong referred to as pt case 2 with perimeter revetment around area d from the information provided and particularly from the report entitled detailed studies on tuas view extension and pulau tekong land reclamati on prepared by dhi the goe finds the following number of impacts have been found most of the i mpacts have resulted from the pulau tekong reclamation but there are also impacts from the tuas view extension almost all impacts result from hydrodynamic changes ie chan ges in the current patterns and wave action caused by the reclamations the following three changes were found to be the most important all of these are in the pulau tekong ar ea and listed in order of importance 1 an increase in current velocities in the calder har bour channel east of pulau tekong the major effects from this increase are changes in erosion and sedimentation patterns changes in navigation condi tions and changes in fishing conditions 2 an increase in largescale2 eddy activity in kuala johor in the vicinity of ch angi resulting in stronger current components across the channel this change affects the conditions for navigation through the area 2 these eddies are of size comparable to the wid th of the channel strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 5 3 an increase in current velocities in kuala johor w est of pulau tekong this change affects navigation through the area 4 decrease in the duration of slack water in the vi cinity of pulau ubin slack water as cited in the dhi report is the time when the curre nt velocity is less than 025 ms this affects the planning and execution of large to wing operations through that section because the processes in this tidal estuary system are complex it was necessary to use sophisticated numerical models to determine the cha nges resulting from the physical modifications to the estuary introduced by the recl amations however for general understanding of the major consequences the basic process and the implications for flow in the calder harbour and kuala johor channels can be simplified as outlined in the following sections 22 basic principle the basic principle will be discussed in connection with the pulau tekong reclamation where the most important changes have taken place items 1 to 4 above recognizing that the same principle applies for the tuas view extension the reclamations at pulau tekong have resulted in local narrowing of the calder harbour and kuala johor channels as may be seen from compa ring figure 4 with figures 5 and 6 observations and the model results by dhi showed th at the reclamations had very little influence on the water levels and on the quantities of water flowing into and out of the estuary at any crosssection during tidal cycle to pass the same amount of water through narrower channel requires increased current velocities the increased current velocities in ku ala johor and calder harbour are therefore mainly direct result of the decreases in the cros ssectional area of the channels in the vicinity of the pulau tekong reclamation particularly near area d shown in figure 5 23 current velocities in calder harbour item 1 the increased current velocities in calder harbour can be remedied by widening the crucial cross sections that restrict the flow relocati on of the eastern shore of the pulau tekong area d can widen certain crucial calder harbour cha nnel sections and decrease current velocities in these cross sections widening calde r harbour sections will also decrease the flow resistance through that channel this will courage more water to flow through calder harbour which in turn will result in some decrease in the flow through kuala johor and hence in decreased current velocities in this chann item 3 since the dynamic processes in this area are actual ly much more complex than outlined in the above basic principle the actual design of the eas tern pulau tekong shoreline will be an optimization process requiring many model runs to find an optimum solution to provide some guidelines to such optimisation the goe has sked dhi to study the pt case 4 and case 5 scenarios strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 6 pt case 5 is shown in figure 7 it involves rea lignment of the eastern shore of the expanded island by taking bite out of the linear shoreline of the proposed recla mation area pt case 2 at crucial flow section while at the same time extending the reclamation with nose in less crucial area to compensate for area t in the bite the goe notes that the addition of such nose has negative impact on t he currents in either the kuala johor or calder harbour channels it is therefore an effecti ve way of compensating for the land area lost through creation of the bite the bite has two functions 1 it leads to widening of the calder harbour channe l reducing the local velocities across the channel and secondarily reducing the ve locities in kuala johor 2 it streamlines the calder harbour channel resultin g in smoother through flow the nose also performs two functions 1 it streamlines the flows into and out of the calder harbour and kuala johor channels 2 it expands the reclaimed area to compensate for are lost in the bite the goe proposes that the bite be specifically located to produce the greatest re duction in current velocities in the crucial cross section at pularek shown in figure 7 figure 1 general map of area reproduced fro m the dhi reports strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 7 figure 2 tuas view prior to

velocities that are defensible on the basis of technical reasoning only the dhi stu dy produced substantive scientifically based criteria such as for example velocity limit s to prevent bottom erosion3 nontechnical criteria on the other hand could range from im pact for example change in current velocities is permitted to subjective criteria ch as any state has right to use its territory as long as it does not create unacceptable conditio ns for its neighbours while the goe acknowledges that one substantive scientifically justifiable velocity criterion exists it is nevertheless convinced that if current velocities are reduced as much as is practically possible in critical crosssections th essentially the impacts which depend on these current velocities will be reduced or elimin ated to define practically possible the goe has pursu ed the following approach the basic criterion developed by the goe is to reduce the max imum velocities4 in the calder harbour channel at the critical pularek cross section to th prereclamation values however dhi has indicated that the uncertainty in the current v elocities predicted by its models is of the order of 10 hence the goe recommends that the m aximum velocities in the calder harbour channel at the critical pularek cross secti on be reduced to within 10 of the pre reclamation maximum values singapores redesign of the shape of the reclamati on to meet the above recommendation is necessarily separate and complicated study that r equires time and expertise the goe has proposed the sensitivity tests pt cases 4 and 5 t help in this process by increasing the basic understanding of the flow processes in calder harbo ur focusing specifically on the reduction of current velocities in the pularek section afte r the results for pt cases 4 and 5 were received the goe was satisfied that these tests in dicated the directions to pursue as result the goe recommends that the methodology used in pt cases 4 and 5 constitute the basis for an overall framework for possible solution to cur rent velocities and their secondary impacts in calder harbour the goe recommends that the fin design of the shoreline of area d will include bite to open up the calder harbour channel and nose to compensate for reclamation area lost by the bite the goe notes t hat in case 5 the bite was dredged to 12 m and also recommends this obvious secondary method of reducing current velocities in pt case 4 the maximum distance of the bite inla nd from the original reclamation boundary in pt case 2 was 365 m at 27 km north of the sout hern point of pt case 2 in pt case5 the bite was 570 m maximum at 36 km north of the point in both cases the nose was 650 m long the goe emphasizes that pt cases 4 and 5 are sensitivity tests only they are not final design aimed at defining the optimum location or size of the bite also attempt was made to relate the area of the nose to the area of the bite 24 large scale eddies item 2 there are some large scale eddies in the vicinity f changi that are generated by the flow separating off the changi finger thin peninsul extending from the mainland of 3 the goe does not consider the attempt to relate fish net behaviour to current velocities based on one trial test as valid criterion 4 maximum velocities occur at ebb tide the maxim um velocity was defined by the goe as the maximum velocity averaged between 200 m and 1400 m from the malaysian shore strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 11 singapore along kuala johor indicated in figure 5 these eddies result in increased current velocities across the channel which affect navigat ion through the area although the impacts of these eddies on navigation were not found to cau unsafe conditions in the short term due to the low traffic density in the channel and the c ompulsory presence of pilots on board of vessels transiting this fairway the goe is neverth eless of the opinion that reduction in the strength or complete elimination of the eddies will increase the safety of passage of vessels through this channel the strength of these eddies can be reduced by chan ging the channel crosssection which can be done by modifying either side of the channel h owever since the eddy is mainly generated by the shape of the changi finger its redesign to produce more streamlined transition for the flow into and out of kuala johor would decrease the eddy activity in the most effective way sensitivity tests carried out by dhi and repo rted in an addendum to their final report confirm that by using appropriate curvature the edd can be almost eliminated since the present configuration can be considered s construction phase of the changi reclamation the goe recommends the streamlining of the changi finger as part of the ongoing works in the area this action will require number of numerical mode l simulations to optimize this new shape of changi finger to understand the influence of c hanging the geometry of the changi finger the goe proposed case 6 as final sensitiv ity test in case 5 the finger was streamlined and in case 6 the changi finger shape was replaced at its original shape 25 decrease of slack water tidal window near pula u ubin item 4 the slack water tidal window defined throughout th is study as the duration of flow velocities smaller than 025 ms has decreased near pulau ubi n essentially because the current velocities in the area have increased second re ason is perhaps that the large scale eddies off changi restrict the overall flow both for ebb and flood flows through the kuala johor channel it is difficult to develop changes to the flow that specifically target the duration of the slack water window however the increase of the fl ow area in calder harbour and the possible redesign of the changi finger proposed abo ve will both contribute to increasing this slack water duration reduction in the slack water times requires more careful planning of the movement of large vessels in particular vessels under tow but it do not affect the accessibility of facilities in the port of johor dangerous situations occurred during the tows and all the manoeuvres indicated safe and controlled manoeuvres 3 impacts the overall purpose of this joint study has been to define the impacts resulting directly from the reclamation activities at tuas view and pulau t ekong this definition process involves 1 identifying all of the possible impacts of the recl amation works strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 12 2 determining the magnitudes of the impacts

the identified changes fall withi n clearly defined tolerance limits such that the effect has negligible consequence to the enviro nment task 3 the goes responsibility was to interact w ith dhi on the

reclamations at tuas view and pulau tekong have resulted in number of impacts identified in the dhi study 2 major impacts were identified 3 seventeen impacts were judged to be in the minor to moderate categories 4 of these fourteen impacts are directly related to changes in local current velocities near the reclamations these impacts can be mitiga ted by reducing the local current velocities 5 erosion is expected at the pularek and belungkor je tties it is accepted by the goe that some erosion had occurred at these jetties prior to reclamation this can be mitigated by properly designed and

of reference of the consultant since this list was attached to the tor for the goe it forms part of the goes tor to avoid misunderstandings the goe has used the sa terminology as dhi to classify the significance of any impact with one exception the goe has changed the qualification impact to negligible impact as the goe feels tha t the word has meaning which is too absolute negligible impact changes identified are so small that they cannot be classified from the model studies or the identified changes fall withi n clearly defined tolerance limits such that the effect has negligibl consequence to the environment slight impact changes are identified by the models which are sufficiently clear that they can be classified as either positive or negati ve however the impact in real terms is so small that it is unlikel that it can be detected or measured in the field the resulting consequence to the environment of slight impact is most likely below detection l imits minor impact changes are identified by the numeric models at magnitude where it is expected that the change and consequent environm ental impact can be detected andor measured in the field moderate impact changes and impacts are identified at level which can be anticipated to have direct consequence and may have secondary consequences through ecosystem processes or other linkages not ddressed as part of the present study major impact changes and resultant impacts are ide ntified at level that will have serious direct and indirect environmental consequen ces that will extend the impact out of the immediate area of effect maj or impacts are normally viewed as indicating that development pr oject has impacts on the overall environmental sustainability of the area the goe notes that there are slight differences in some numerical values quoted in volume i and in the respective underlying reports volumes i i ix the goe has generally considered the values from the main reports rather than from t he summary report and the goe has used the higher numbers of range the items have been grouped in the same way as they were grouped in the tor when necessary the sheets addressing particular group of items are preceded by general introduction and followed by general remarks strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 20 1 1 hydrodynamics the section on hydrodynamics addresses changes in t he hydrodynamic boundary conditions as result of the reclamation projects in areas th at were specifically mentioned in the terms of reference water levels current velocities and wave condition s are considered to be the main hydrodynamic parameters that are discussed in this section secondary effects resulting from or caused by changes in the hydrodynamic conditions are addressed in subsequent sections where applicable reference is made to such section s in general it can be concluded from the studies by dhi that the hydrodynamic changes due to tve are relatively small the changes induced by th reclamation of p tekong are mainly changes in current velocities in the channels aroun d the island the changes due to case 2 are generally larger than those due to the case 1 confi guration velocities at some distance about 2km from the island remain largely unaffected wat er levels remain largely unaffected as well wave conditions will become more severe in ca 1 due to reflection of waves by the sheet pile wall in case 2 the wave climate become s milder again because of the lower reflection of the revetment and sheltering by the r eclamation the goe notes that the technical issues that it has to address according to annex 2 of its tor cover broad range of issues the first issue to b addressed ie hydrodynamics has not been found to have primary effect in this study eg flooding this issue does however manifest itself through the other issues to be addr essed by the goe it is therefore not relevant to classify the hydrodynamic changes according to t he scale of impacts as these may relate differently to the various issues only where hydro dynamic changes are so small that they have impact on any of the other issues has cla ssification been given to the

considering the studies the studies indicate an increase in current velocit ies in the channel both for ebb and flood conditions the goe has presented the data given by dhi in table format in more visual way in figure 11 attached to this report the studies indicate that wave action in the vicini ty of pularek is increased for case 1 due to reflection by the sheet pile wall the waves are mainly locally generated wind waves consequently the absolute value of the wave height s depends on an assumed relation between the local wind and the records of the more remote w ind gauge at changi airport for case 2 wave heights will reduce to values slightly below t he original ones because of the sheltering effect of the reclamation on the waves and because of reduction of the reflection the wake waves do not change as result of the rec lamation works except that the wake is reflected off the sheetpile wall in case 1 and to lesser extent from the perimeter revetment in case 2 technical common ground determined by the goe the goe agreed earlier on the calibration of the hy drodynamic model and thus on the changes in current velocities predicted by dhi remaining unresolved issues and concerns secondary and tertiary effects these will be addr essed in the subsequent sections 2 3 4 and 5 two members of the goe question if the wave action in the region is properly addressed by the studies carried out todate the other members are of the opinion that the wave heights in the area are very small and hence that correct or m ore complete modelling will only adjust already very small values following receipt of the preliminary draft final re port the goe had concerns about the model used for the wave studies in the report it was cit ed that the studies were undertaken using mike

channel width to r educe the current velocities as far as waves are concerned the goe agrees that replacement of the temporary sheet pile wall of case 1 by the permanent revetment of case 2 will

bounded by perimeter sand bund with sloping side section which is built up t 2m below chart datum ie about 2m below the lowest water level steel sheet piles have been installed along the perimeter sand bund as an envir onmental protection measure to prevent the dispersion of silt into the surrounding waters the top of the steel sheet piles is 5m above chart datu m the steel sheet piles are

geometry as it relates to the itlos order the goe agreed to tak out these cases strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 106 goe notes that swell and locally generated wind wav at the sheetpile wall are small and that the sheetpile is temporary therefore it find s that the analysis with two models proposed by dhi is excessive goe considers it improbable t hat these small waves will affect either shore erosion of the malaysian shoreline or manoeuv rability of small craft near pularek jetty nevertheless goe is prepared to support w ave study in order to eliminate any concerns about wave action goe suggest that dhis wave modelling be validated against actual wave measurements at pularek and close to th area d sheetpile wall the goe considers shipgenerated waves to be of gre ater importance here and should be carefully analysed navigation proposal the proposal is much too broad and the work propose d in the section on ship navigation and berthing should be significantly reduced goe reco mmends that only fast time simulation of manoeuvrability of generic large and small vessel s should be used although goe believes that differences in navigatio n conditions only exist in the immediate vicinity of p tekong the goe is prepared to suppo rt fast time simulation study further upstream to pasir gudang to eliminate any concerns about effects of the p tekong reclamation on navigation that would exclude any further work on the tuas sid goe notes that vesselinduced drawdown is not mentioned which is an important in gredient in calculations of forces on moored vessels and of shore erosion any economic impact analysis should be clearly focused on sailing times and fuel costs for small b oat owners and fishers coastal structures goe recommends that dhi does not carry out an inven tory of coastal structures that could be damaged by changed conditions according to the to r section 523 the two governments have identified the key structures to be studied by dhi sediment transport the goe is satisfied with the proposed level of eff ort in modelling sediment transport it is concerned that the proposed mike 21 mst model does not simulate local mass erosion and requests further clarification on how dhi intends t estimate mass erosion depths the goe also recommends that dhi asses the signific ance of sediment released from the containment area of p tekong area d using avail able monitoring data water quality the goe is satisfied with the proposed level of eff ort in water quality modelling strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 107 ecology the goe is satisfied that the proposed ecological pproach is in accordance with the tor however the ecological modelling studies should be restricted to those parameters which are deemed by dhi in consultation with the goe to be quantifiable in addition the goe welcomes any evaluations from dhi which will resul t in properly founded qualitative inferences the goe notes that the proposed ecolab model has not previously been used in tropical waters and points out that the results wil l need to be treated with caution water level modelling the goe sees this as an integral part of the hydrod ynamic modelling the goe deems it necessary to investigate extreme events for the tve pre and postreclamation cases and for tekong case 0 and case 2 only the peak discharges for the main rivers will be provided by the government of malaysia field survey goe finds that the field survey as cited to be nece ssary except for the water level and geodetic measurements for which it would need furth er justification the goe recommends that additional data are required to determine the erodibility of the bottom sediments in the calder channel region dhi should take this into ccount in their revised cost estimates general questions the goe notes that setup costs are included in each subsection of the proposal and this leads to an accumulated setup cost that seems to be exces sive it is not clear to the goe what modelling tools the governments of malaysia and singapore receive at the end of the day the goe regards the comparisons between the fem and fdm as an academic exercise that should not be part of the hydrodynamic study dhi should use whichever model it deems most appropriate the goe wishes dhi to advise in the inception repor t how they propose to undertake simulations for case 0 and case 2 for high and low sediment loads inputs from the rivers strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 108 group of experts minutes of meeting 2 johor bahru april 22 to 29 2004 the

or malaysia by 1500 so we cannot discuss their comments at th is time ecology 4 malaysia thinks there is much more information in t he reports they have provided than is used by dhi 5 tolerance limits tables need to be used carefully for example they do not incorporate cumulative effects and hence background activity ma bring parameter close to its tolerance and the reclamation may just push it over the limit tolerance does this constitute significant impact 6 malaysia alleges that part of the ecosystem mud fl ats is removed by burial 7 is the methodology standard of practice of care w think it is within time frame of less than decade 8 dhi needs to determine confidence limits 9 dhi needs to separate out the effects of the reclam ations from all other effects 10 dhi needs to ask for port construction and maintena nce dredgedump data such as for ptp and lansat 11 dhi states that their proposed study cannot provide quantitative results in many instances nevertheless goe recommends that the whole program proposed by dhi be accepted the technical basis for this recommendation is that the data and analysis so purchased will be necessary in any future studies unless the pre sent impulse is used to produce the best database possible any future studies will need to start from virtually zero information base navigation 12 we need to instruct dhi clearly with respect to nav igation 13 johor port anchorage is considered to be one anchor age now by malaysia there is longer distinction between the four functions i t is therefore realistic to remove the northwest corner of the anchorage to make more room for navigation into calder harbour widening the anchorage further to the south or addi ng to the southeast of the anchorage can easily recover the lost anchorage space strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 117 14 with respect to vessels shortcutting across the pre sent area d vessels have always been impeded from sailing through this area before recla mation by keelongs which were removed shortly before the reclamation works were s tarted 15 with respect to manoeuvring tugassisted tanker before any simulation takes place dhi should first determine any change in tidal window resulting from the reclamation activities goe must also verify if bmt can model tugassisted vessel in fast time mode 16 50000 tdwt tanker and 60000 tdwt bulk carrier d not handle much differently at very slow mooring speeds we should model the worst cas of the two not both mitigative measures 17 cases 3 and 4 are sensitivity tests and not mitigat ive

temperature and salinity made without reference concerns about 3d effects all such statements with require substantiations 26 on p30 1st explanation required as to how the adjustment s are made with respect to mean sea level given to 4 significant figures als see tables 43 and 44 27 section 44 p32 and table 45 variation in mannin gs number is not consistent with physical sense do not agree with statement about higher accuracy requirements requiring an artificial calibration of this factor evaluation of k values based on table 45 shows friction increasing in the deepest water reason seems to be calibrati on to replicate high land boundary flows and lower midchannel flow s in area of constriction see figures from p52 onwards 28 question the use of smargorinski formulation see p 32 and p34 which is equivalent to using constant eddy viscosity and is not likely t properly simulate large scale eddy formations our experience is that in these narrow channels such as calder harbour there are gradients in both velocity and depth resulting in gradients in the eddy viscosity an important mechanism for vorticity generation we be lieve that simulations using other strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 118 formulations would be more effective and we questio n why the kappaepsilom model cannot be used goe suggest that simulation run u sing kappaepsilom model to compare to

column 3 and 5 should be cm s 30 p47 figure 66 shows poor correlation at neap tide s thought to be on the edge of an eddy also current speeds at springs to not correlate wit h zero values this reinforces view that this is not good representation of the eddy and c omparison with different eddy viscosity simulation 31 p50 figure 611 scale on xaxis appears to be inc orrect also why has transect t3 not been used 32 p52 et seq require xy plot of measured and predic ted currents across line of the transect see figures 612 to 616 33 p59 figure 73 overestimation of maximum currents not explained 34 p60 figure 74 many gross discrepancies in both c urrent magnitude and directions also last two sentences of section 72 are questionable and there are concerns as to whether there will be any improvement on the basis of the r elatively poor correlation shown in figures 75 through to 77 35 chapter 8 in general is premature as we do have f ully calibrated model however there is need to elaborate on the way in which results of the modelling are to be presented the concept of showing maxima that are not linked in is not considered to be useful with respect to appreciating all of the impacts further more there appear to be considerable inconsistencies between the difference plots presen ted that need further explanation it would also be most useful to present the results in animation form showing all time steps through spring and neap tidal cycle the goe requ est that dhi submit description of the complete suite of output representations that t hey intend to use in their

is attached in appendix 1 the goe understands that the meeting will include the t wo government leaders and 6 additional members from each country mitigating measures 4 the goe considered the comments from both governmen ts with regard to the draft recommendations for mitigating measures the versio n circulated in appendix h4 of the record of discussion of the third meeting differs s lightly from that agreed by the goe representatives kda and raf and the governments on 12th may 2004 and the version agreed on that date is now accepted by the goe as t he final version of recommendations for mitigating measures see appendix 2 dhi draft progress report 2 5 the goe were satisfied that the water levels are ge nerally being well predicted 6 the goe is concerned about the level of accuracy of the model in predicting the current speed and direction at several key calibration and verification sites as shown in figures 510 to 525 the goe appreciates the difficulties in comparing simulated currents with previously measured data but is not in agreement w ith dhis observation on page 41 that comparisons show reasonably close match and sa tisfactory agreement the goe expects these comparisons to be much improved when dhi have had the opportunity of comparing their simulations against their own measu red data to be reported in progress report 3 7 the goe notes that many of the instructions in anne x f3 to the record of the third meeting have been met however the goe also notes that number of key issues have not been addressed by dhi the goe is concerned tha t postponing

comparisons between the 25 m fine grid predictions as cited on page 23 of the inception report revision 2 and the adcp transects in the calder harbour region will be completed in time for the pr ogress report due on 2nd july 2004 enabling the goe to have time to consider the confi gurations for the sensitivity test studies ie cases 3 and 4 11 the goe considered the comments from the

only provisionally however the go also notes that number of key issues have been deferred by dhi to future reports the goe remains concerned that postponing discussions of these items may endanger implementation of corrective measures in the final stages of the study instruct ions given in this respect have not been met by dhi the goe stresses once again that dhi sh ould expedite finalizing reports on sections of the work that have been completed 5 it appears that there is uncertainty between dhi an d the two countries about the data requested the data provided and the data still ssing dhi agreed to include full overview of this subject in progress report 4 6 the goe discussed the calibration and validation of the model in great depth although some questions are still to be answered by dhi the goe is of the opinion that the present model results can not be improved significantly giv the lack of field data and the complexity of the area under consideration 7 the goe also had long discussion with dhi about t he wave observations it was concluded that continuation of the measurements wou ld probably not lead to better results the envisaged hindcasting proves to be not feasible instead dhi will perform an engineering approach on the basis of the few data c ollected in june 2004 8 during the meeting recommendations were made to urg ently resurvey calder harbour and an area in the mouth of k johor introduction of better bathymetric data will hopefully improve the quality of the 25m grid model with respect to the eddy of tg pengelih timely completion of this resurvey is

to complete their tor and determined them to be goe assesses and approves the work of dhi goe identifies areas of technical common ground and unresolved issues goe determines the significance of any impacts disc overed in the dhi study goe proposes general principles and approaches to m itigation detailed design of mitigation measures can only be based on considerable additional work which must necessarily be performed after the goe r eport has been completed design of any mitigation measures will be done according to ppendix 2 of the goe meeting of 4 to 7 june 2004 which was formulated in consultation wit h both governments 2 determination of sensitivity tests on the basis of information provided by dhi to date goe confirms that both sensitivity tests should address the p tekong reclamation goe regrets that it has to decide on sensitivity sts without having results for navigation morphological water quality and ecological impact assessment studies goe considered wide range of possible alternative sensitivity tests for the p tekong area among these were increasing the depth in calder harbour to reduce cu rrent velocities reducing eddy formation by currentdeflecting walls redesigning the changi finger to reduce current flu ctuations in the kuala johor increasing the depth between p ubin and p tekong kechil to influence distribution of flow between the two branches goe recognises that the hydrodynamics around p tek ong consist of complex interactions between the flows through several interconnected c hannels any changes to one of the channels will affect the flow through the others after extensive discussion goe considers that the most important apparent potential impacts at this time are related to the hydrodynamics of calder harbour and adjacent waters in that connection goe notes that strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 136 the east shore of area d west shore of calder harb our has not been designed to be hydraulically efficient resulting in constriction of the calder harbour channel and an increase in current velocities in the region also goe note s that the separation of flow into the calder and johor channels has not been optimised to this end goe has defined the following two sens itivity tests case 3 in order to understand the sensitivity of the hydro dynamic characteristics to change in the shape of the eastern boundary of area d goe proposes to streamline the calder harbour flow channel as indicated in figure 16 the change to the area d geometry needs to be substantial in order to determ ine the sensitivity of the flow conditions around the whole island to such change case 4 in order to understand the sensitivity of the hydro dynamic characteristics to change in the shape of the southerly point of the reclamat ion goe proposes to add tail to the reclamation in the southwesterly direction as indicated in figure 2 to direct the flow from and into the channels on either side of p tekong goe stresses that these two sensitivity simulations are scientific in nature they are performed to add to the understanding of the basic hydrodynamics around the island goe further stresses that if mitigating measures sh ould prove to be necessary in the end much additional work will be required to investigat potential solutions identified by the goe such additional work would necessarily follow the

not received any dredging data nd malaysia is urged to produce these data for goe 8 goe notes that it will be very difficult to make decisions about real time simulations if it does not receive the results of the fast time simulations until aug 30 10 goe notes that the difference between the rating curves has not been resolved that dhi take up discussions with malaysia on this matte r 12 dhi has only addressed the outliers in the hydro logical data and not the remark in general 18 dhi should address goe comments 1 and 2 19 item 1 is dhis experience based on data from the malaysiasingapore area if so what are the references 32 please furnish an answer 44 goe want to express that the approach by dhi is only valid if the absolute values of the pollution load are realistic and representative of existing conditions this also applies to item 46 46 document the confidence band of factor 2 what d oes factor 2 mean 05x to 2x 53 rather than using nd goe suggests to use x where x is the numerical value of the actual detection limit eg 01 mgl 5761 6263 6465 goe notes there are inconsistencies between differe nt data sets and some results appear unrealistic such as higher

the evenin g of wednesday 1st september 2004 this was an informal dinner meeting where the goe discussed their general impressions of the dhi draft final report in particular the g oe expressed their reservations about the navigation volume vol 5 and it was felt that number of key items requested from dhi following previous goe meetings had still not been addressed in the report and that this draft final report ie vols 2 to 9 could t herefore only be regarded as first draft at this stage this opinion was strengthened by the ab sence of volume 1 containing conclusions and recommendations meetings of goe sep 2 2 on the morning of thursday 2nd september the goe members met with their respectiv government experts this meeting was followed in th afternoon by presentation given by dhi to the respective governments and the goe w ith the meeting being chaired by the goe the meeting was cordial and at the end of the presentation both governments were invited to ask points of clarification after the m eeting the goe had an informal dinner meeting 3 the goe met informally over dinner and had further discussions on their comments on the first draft of the final report and in particu lar issues relating to navigation meetings of goe sep 3 4 the goe met early on friday 3rd september to prepare their joint key questions for dhi these general questions are summarised in appendix 1 the goe firstly expressed its concerns about number of issues regarding the nav igation volume vol 5 the navigation report was regarded as unacceptable and in particular the goe expressed their concerns about compliance with the tor inception r eport 2 dhi responded to number of the goes concerns and many of these conc erns were seen to be of reporting nature dhi stated that these concerns will be addr essed in the next draft volume on navigation in particular issues of noncompliance of parts of the tor were subsequently raised by dhi with bmt and the goe understands that these concerns are to be addressed as matter of urgency it was appreciated by the g oe that in order for them to complete their assessment of the project thoroughly then it was necessary to request an extension of the programme to complete the joint study strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 144 5 on the afternoon of friday 3rd september meeting was held between dhi the governments and the goe with the meeting again bei ng chaired by the goe the meeting focused on the dhi draft final report and d his response to the general questions raised previously by the goe this presentation was followed by questions invited from both governments to dhi the meeting was again cor dial and fruitful 6 on the evening of friday 3rd september the goe and dhi met informally to explor possible criteria for mitigation should mitigation be deemed necessary meetings of goe sep 4 7 the goe met on saturday 4th september to discuss the final stages of the progr amme for completing the project on the basis of the current status of the draft final report and the need to complete fully the navigation studies the goe decided to recommend to both governments that in order to complete the studies nd report fully on the final report the project should be extended by approximately one mon th the revised timetable for completion of the project was later presented to bo th governments and is attached herewith in appendix 2 8 this meeting was followed by meeting held by the goe and the two government representatives namely madam rosnani and mrs cheon g where mrs cheong presented satellite photographs acquired by singapore illust rating post and prereclamation conditions of the shoreline characteristics and pa rticularly the bed features along the shoreline to the south east of tg pengelih the go had previously been taken on site visit by malaysia to several sites along this coast line and at two of these sites reference was made to the deposition of mud along the beaches the satellite images were meant to provide the goe and malaysia with additional inform ation that may be relevant to the morphology studies information was also provided n the tracking of trailing suction hopper dredger from pasir gudang to the coastline j ust offshore of the deposits the goe were given the opportunity to view the satellite pi ctures later that afternoon after which the pictures were provided to dhi for assessment 9 on the afternoon of 4th september the goe presented its revised tentative schedule for the governments and the contractor to approve this was followed by meeting of the goe with navigation representatives from both countries to establish the ship simulations to be undertaken in real time by the subcontractor name ly bmt 10 the goe then had meeting with representatives fro m dhi and bmt where the tentative programme was discussed as well as the p rocedure for studying the satellite images provided by singapore singapore needed to t ake the pictures back after the meeting but they have been handed to dhi for asses sment by dhi and further viewing by malaysia if required as result instructions on the ship simulations to be undertaken were passed to bmt7 and dhi was asked to invite representatives from b oth governments to participate in the inspection of the satellite i mages 7 24 runs to be made in real time with the 60 000 d wt

section identifying the k ey uncertainties in modeling in all appropriate reports dhi to comment i missing goe expects executive summary max 9 pages and precise summary of the work max 40pages dhi to comment ii urgent remarks dhi to comment iii 61 general we need more clear definitions perhaps table of definitions would be good idea dhi to comment iii 61 6 for example define rms area average what area the whole 25 m grid n grid points in all directions of the poi nt of interest example define peak spring depth integrated tidal current instantaneous averaged over m time lines on either side of the instantaneous peak dhi to comment iii 62 6 example define peak spring flux is it instantane ous etc etc dhi to comment iii 77 1st bullet this bullet has always looked like an excuse it i s totally unnecessary if the stated reasons are correct th there is an easy way to incorporate this reasoning into the res ults we should compare measured values in these graphs with weight ed averages of the model values calculated in the vicinity whe re the weights are functions of distances of the individual model valu from the measured point if that does not work out then th excuses in this bullet are incorrect and the discrepancies have oth er origins than local quirks in bathymetry suggest one set of original results to indicate the differences at adjacent points and then present only the averages dhi to comment iii 79 fig 714 this demonstrates differences between results from adjacent cells but also demonstrates that none of the three simula tes the phases nor the peaks correctly so perhaps weighted aver ages dhi to comment iii 80 fig 715 again neither is very good use weighted averages dhi to comment iii 85 belungkor ebb maxima overestimated both in magnitud and dhi to comment strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 147 nr vol page section comments instructions goe response by dhi duration iii 103 824 where are the adcp transects goe asked for dhi to comment iii 138 92 smagorinski should not affect overall currents as shown we need to investigate sensitivity of the eddies eg chan gi and calder harbour exit to smagorinski coefficient thats why we want to see the adcp transects and some indication of sensitivi ty of eddy formations to smagorinski dhi to comment iii 147 conclusions to ch 9 would be helpful dhi to comment iv 76 123 etc these waves are short and they loose energy against the sheetpile wall since the shape of the sheetpile is of the ord er of the wave length the waves are also steep and loose energy on the way through wave breaking wavewave interaction the also occur on high current velocities none of these is taken int account and hence you should state somewhere that the results w ill be quite conservative dhi to comment iv 1415 major cause for uncertainty is surely k r for the sheetpile the difference on p 99 between the lines for 14 and 1 8 amplification factor for wind figs 141 and 142 is almost the same as between kr07 and 10 combining only these two causes of u ncertainty would result in the 1 wave of 028 to 036 m becom ing 033 to 06 m that is approximately wave of 032 04 m becomes 046 014 m or an increase of 4422 there are other sources of uncertainty even though this has little impact on the final results the limitations of the work should be clearly shown dhi to comment iv how have you incorporated the wave action from the south china sea dhi to comment v goe cannot accept this report as is it does not ddress several key issues in the tor many of the recommendations are not appropriately justified dhi to comment v how and what was transferred as wave input for the navigation simulations dhi to comment v 29 last bullet does any real ship leave in the worst current envi ronment how realistic are these answers going to be should w not involve local pilots and simulate best practice dhi to comment v 71 921 if there was not significant effect why does bmt have an opinion dhi to comment strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 148 nr vol page section comments instructions goe response by dhi that manual real time simulations should be conduct ed v 72 921 are there problems with the bulk carrier it does not sound like so why would it be useful to do real time simulation s dhi to comment v 75 1022 there are problems with the cruise ship obviou sly ship with less good maneuverability would have more problems in view of the above we should go and look for poorer vesse ls and do real time testing dhi to comment v 76 111 it is not clear what ship was used is it the full loaded bulk carrier in that case this is not what was asked for dhi to comment v 77 112 describe clearly the role of the master mariner in fast time simulations dhi to comment vi 46 fig 111 there still seems to be one band of high runoff fr om 1201 through singapore adjacent areas have of much lower runof f is this correct dhi to comment vii 54 71 fig 71 does not directly present change resulting from the reclamation it could be used as an indication of possible change dhi to comment vii 56 fig 71 fig 71 is not only morphological adjustment as in the title but rather the difference between 2004 survey and earli er bathymetric information and hydrographic charts the difference between the accuracy of the depths long the east side and west side of the calder channel should be clearly highlighted the fact that subtraction of the west side bathymetries singapore side gives good indication of general erosion over the two years between the two surveys and that subtract ion of the east side bathymetries does not should be expressed dhi to comment vii 57 fig 73 correct the time duration for this figure so it mat ches fig 71 state clearly what is involved here how does the hard b ottom fig 41 come into play in this diagram how is erosion lim ited by the hard layer surely fig 73 is only model result that needs to be related to sediment availability relate the erosion here to deposition at jpa do you do sediment balance between erosion and deposition dhi to comment vii 65 fig 79 and 711 nuance the erosion in the pits they do not simp ly erode to nn m down to the hard layer below the pit but velocitie s will decrease so that erosion will eventually balance out what hap pens when the annual erosion rate hits the hard layer after man years dhi to comment

29th september the goe met to discuss the criteria that could be adopted for considering reconfiguration of area d the go found it difficult to establish clear scientific criteria to define the basis for any pro posed reconfiguration in this complex waterway but after due consideration the goe explo red ways to achieve positive and justifiable compromise the goes proposed criteria to be adopted for establishing an optimal configuration of area d will aim at restori ng the original velocities as far as practically possible the resulting loss of reclaim able land will also be compensated for

5 and 6 it was agreed that professor dangremond would first check as to the contractual conditions regarding these strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 151 additional test if they do form part of the existi ng contract then the goe agreed that the following tests would be undertaken case 5 would investigate further the impact of reco nfiguring the eastern boundary of area d on the velocities in the calder channel the goe wish to consider modification to case 4 and on the basis of dhis c omments following the predictions obtained from their case 4 simulations the goe will ask dhi to advise on their proposed modification to case 4 and subje ct to the goes agreement this modification will form the basis for the case 5 sim ulation case 6 would investigate the impact of changi finge r on the complex eddy structure in the kuala johor channel the goe are of the opin ion that if the changi finger is extended and streamlined then this will significant ly reduce or remove the predicted eddies in the main channel with regard to contractual issues the goe strongly recommend that the two governments jointly carry out thorough check of the inception report version 2 to ensure that the consultant has fulfilled all of their contractual bligations for example the goe note that litpack modelling has not been carried out by the consultant and there is justification in their draft final report for the xclusion of this study the meetings of the goe concluded at 200 pm on 29th september with the next scheduled meeting being in europe either in the ne therlands or cardiff from 17th to 19th october 2004 strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 152 appendix 1 goe response to comments of governments of malaysia and singapore on goe interim report of august 2004 the goe agreed to send the following comments to bo th governments the goe stand by its original view minuted in its meeting of 7th june 2004 stating that the samples provided are within tolerable limits but is concerned about the limited data available for area d the preliminary view of the g oe is that further insitu sampling data are desirable and the goe intends to discuss t his through further correspondence this statement was subsequently quoted in the goe i nterim report of august 2004 since these original views expressed by the goe th consultant namely dhi has advised that although periods of slightly elevate d concentrations at the boundary of the sheetpile wall around area d do exist they have n significance for either the ecological processes in the area or for the sedimentation patt erns in the area in the light of this qualitative assessment of the sediment plume for th offshore containment site at area d pulau tekong by the consultant see appendix g of draft final report vol vii morphological impact assessment the goe do not cu rrently regard it as necessary to undertake further insitu sampling data for area d as matter of urgency the goe are of the opinion that such additional data would not change the findings of the current study the goe recommends that after the current study has been completed the governments of malaysia and singapore ideally also including indonesia set up working group to establish protocol for the disposal or placeme nt of potentially contaminated dredged and excavated material in the surrounding waters fo r both or all three countries the goe would like to draw attention to the existing co operation in the north atlantic region under the london convention further details of which can be obtained from the following pianc reports 1 marcom report 23 site investigations requiremen ts etc 2 envicomreport 05 environmental guidelines for d isposal facilities for dredged material 3 unnumbered dredged material

kees dangremond prof roger falconer pro f chris fleming and prof bill kamphuis by telephone and email 1 the goe met in cardiff and started work on sunday 1 7th october in the first instance the goe reviewed the comments from the gov ernments of malaysia and singapore on the draft final report version 2 by dhi the goe were generally impressed by the comments from both governments and the comments are for dhi to respond to directly dhi are expected to copy their responses to the members of the goe 2 the goe completed its own comments for dhi the co mments on this occasion were of more general nature and have been passed to dhi for action before finalising the goes final report 3 the goe spent the remaining two days of the meeting on discussing the issues for their final report and the form of further sensitiv ity tests to be undertaken by dhi and relating to possible mitigating measures the goe extensively discussed all 65 individual tables in their table of impacts and d debated for each table the individual views on the significance of impact so far as possible the goe tried to agree on the significance of the impact with there being encouragingly consistent level of agreement on most issues 4 with regard to the sensitivity tests two issues we re consider i streamlining the reclamation more in the calder harbour channel wit h the aim being to reduce the velocities in the area and ii extending and stre amlining the changi finger to provide smoother flow transition into the kuala johor cha nnel with the aim being to reduce the strength of the complex eddy structure predicte d to occur following completion of the reclamation following discussion with dhi th consultant kindly agreed to undertake four further sensitivity tests two more than contractually agreed these sensitivity tests all involved modifications to the reclamation in area d 5 finally the goe agreed on schedule of work and timetable for the completion of its report due for submission to the governments n 5th november 2004 it was agreed that the final report would be sent from pro fessor flemings office and would include electronic signatures at this stage num ber of hard copies would be

safety if any at these facilities as compared to the situation before the start of the land reclamation the approach navigational channels to be studied are as shown in the shaded reas on the maps in figure 51 and figure 52 the assessment should take into account the changin g hydrodynamic conditions 5 sediment transport and morphology based on the available information the study areas consist of tidal and shipping channels partly bordered on malaysian and singapor sides by mangrove coasts and aquaculture facilities the seabed and coastli ne is characterised by mixture of clay silt and sand with numerous rocky outcrop s b prior to the actual studies assessments should be made to provide an understanding of the t 0pt situation for the pulau tekong land reclamation an d the t0tve situation for the tve land reclamation with respec t to i the stability of the channels and coastline as deri ved from past and recent hydrographic charts and other relevant data to be provided by malaysia singapore ii the best possible representation of the coastline nd seabed bottom characteristic and properties based on seismic dat bore log data and seabed and coastline sediment analysis iii geological constraints eg rocky outcrops subsu rface stiff clay or other layers that are susceptible to different rates of rosion and iv the effects of waves taking into consideration act ual recorded wave measurements in the areas of interest c the consultant is required to address the following key issues in the sediment transport and morphology study in all the affected areas this may include

msjce b in particular the consultant is required to addres s the following key issues in the water quality study i establish the water quality of the straits of johor prior to the land reclamation by analyzing the data to be provided by both malays ia and singapore ii as far as possible identify trends over time in th water quality condition from significant discharge points visàvis the eff ects of the concurrent pulau tekong and tve land reclamation strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 161 iii establish the effects of the pulau tekong and tve l and reclamation on parameters such as salinities salinity gradients nutrients and dissolved oxygen and iv establish the changes in the flushing characteristi cs of the flow due to the hydrodynamics of the pulau tekong and tve land recl amation the resultant effects on the retention of pollutants and consequ ently their effects on dissolved oxygen and nutrient levels c the consultant after discussion with the goe shal l establish list of possible physical chemical and biological parameters to be modelled analysed and monitored d the consultant or its appointed agent shall carry out benthic measurements to check for particle size distribution heavy metals and organic pollutants in the benthic environment 7 water level changes one of the effects to be investigated is whether th land reclamation will result in significant changes in water levels and the tidal r ange in the johor straits and in the sungai johor and sungai pulai estuaries the fo llowing should be studied i the magnitude of changes in water level the phase lag the tidal range and tidal prism ii effects of the water level changes and phase lag on the outflows from the main rivers such as sungai johor and sungai tebrau and sungai pulai for various flow conditions including the 100year flood flow 8 ecology as far as possible the consultant shall assess whe ther changes in hydrodynamics water quality and morphology which are directly at tributable to the land reclamation have secondary effects on the ecology b the consultant shall in its first progress report assess the practicability of studying in quantifiable manner and within the t imeframe of the studies whether there are significant impacts on the follow ing environmental receptors which are directly attributable to the land reclama tion i marine ecology 1 key marine ecological resources and habitats ie benthic habitats coral deposits zooplankton phytoplankton algae sea g rasses fishery bivalves and dugongs 2 mangrove flora and fauna herpetofauna birds mamm als and invertebrates ii fishing community 1 livelihood of fishermen and fishing activities c for those receptors for which such study has been assessed to be practicable the consultant shall in the first progress report pro vide methodology and cost estimate for conducting such study if the metho dology and cost are acceptable to the governments the consultant will be instruct ed to proceed with the study strictly confidential goe final report 5 november 2004 162
