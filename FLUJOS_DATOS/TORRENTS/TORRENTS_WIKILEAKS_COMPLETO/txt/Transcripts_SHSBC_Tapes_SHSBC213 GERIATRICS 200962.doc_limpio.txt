geriatrics lecture given on 20 september 1962 lecture two 20 sept ad 12 geriatrics thats the title of the lecture geriatrics now you dont even know how to spell it geriat rics got it audience yeah got it its trick way of saying gerontology but actually gerontology never solved geriatrics but we have geriatrics is of some interest to you and has been floating around you all the time and you yourself have noticed it and youve kept your eye peeled on it and youve been curious about it and youve actually used it as method of measuring whether case was progressing or not but never really given it any further significance well it does have further significance you should understand that one of the longest searches man has ever indulged in has been that of longevity itself and the study of living longer is geriatrics i by the way was one time leading light in the american society of gerontology what do you feed men to make them live longer well there are many such preparations women theres equinprivine stilbestrol the female hormones somebody gets beyond forty or something like that why they ought to start shooting them with bit of equinprivine something like that that makes them look younger and feel friskier and make passes at the iceman anyway i had very astonishing experience one time i saw lady and this was right after the war i had just studied quite bit of endocrinology and found it very fascinating study but i was only studying it for one particular peculiar reason i wanted to find out if the mind monitored the body or the body monitored the mind and obviously the switchboard system between the body and the mind is the endocrine system or the glands all right could you feed somebody these marvelous preparations which had been biochemically developed and effect better frame of mind and i found out that you could do so occasionally on lots of people thats not good enough is it what was introducing the variable traumatic second dynamic occlusions and one thing or another prevented the hormones and other shots from operating i did this work at oak knoll naval hospital in oakland california all right line officer wears his badges of rank on both collars and staff officer wears them only on one collar see so i first got into their medical library simply by taking off one of my rank badges off one collar and hired marine to come by and say good afternoon doctor and that was very simple so anyway we entered the field of endocrinology for only that reason and i ruined great many cases i ruined them abundantly i there was doctor there by the name of i think his name one of the doctors on the thing was named yankewitz improbably and this guy was keeping records on this sort of thing and they the government at vast expense was importing carload lots of pills and shots and monkey glands and they had the problem of all the fellows who had been incarcerated in the japanese prison camps and these fellows were in very bad state they were too fat and they were too thin and they were too this and they were too that and they were trying to put them back to rights with hormones and this is very valid proposition you can do far more for somebodys ulcers by giving him shots of testosterone than any other known method the doctors of course are unable to operate so they dont favor it its out of favor entirely anyway they were bringing these pills in and capsules in carload lots and they were administering them to people and having bit of access to their records i knew what cases were being successfully affected and which werent and so i have done little bit of work in trying to ascertain whether or not the people who were being successfully affected were or were not aberrated and decided they were not very badly aberrated and the people on whom they were not being effective i found to have psychic traumas by the bucketload and Ã  freud with few frills from ron flipped few psychic traumas out of the road and made these endocrines operate on them very successfully and came to the conclusion that an endocrine the united states navy should be given rising vote of thanks for this because im sure the program cost them millions and millions and millions of dollars and they derived absolutely benefit from it of any kind whatsoever but we did i didnt ruin their whole program but i sure sent their figures little bit awry occasionally you see its how many what the dosage should be and on case or two it became none now this simply monitored this this was not very conclusive it was not very definite and i could have done far more along this line of course but i was only trying to establish one thing by using physical substances could you change persons mind you understand or by changing persons mind could you change the character of physical substances i found the latter to be the case and thereafter have spent time monkeying with physical substances do you follow this line of reasoning in other words the mind can change the body but the body only slightly alters the mind in other words function monitors structure structure does not monitor function see now of course structure can monitor function sufficiently and observably enough that somebodys liable to take this as keynote the obvious broad fact that you cut off somebodys legs he cant walk now structure certainly monitored function and medico being somewhat of this crude reasoning level of course takes that as the fait accompli and says thats it thats it therefore therefore function monitors structure i dont know how he ever got there you know its something like departing for the moon and finding yourself on wrigley field and saying well that proves it but were not quite sure what you know now heres heres the point they are wrong they are wrong because if the uniformity is that you can always get function or thought to monitor structure you can get thought to monitor structure but you cant always get structure to monitor thought and thats how i came to that basic conclusion why you never find paying any real attention to structure because if you dont flip out the psychic traumas youre not going to monitor anybodys thinking and if you do flip out the psychic traumas why youre going to monitor structure you follow that see this guy cant perform in some direction well you could feed him all the hormones and give him all the turkish baths and all the exercise and all the dumbbells in the world and he still wouldnt be able to do this dont you see but you change the psychic condition and hell make some progress in that direction now his structure might be inadequate to performing what he wants to perform but that again by extrapolation is an error in not enough thought do you see on it now these conclusions these conclusions are very valid in the field of geriatrics some girl when she gets to be forty or so and so forth would do very well i say so would do very well since ive seen lot of evidence in this line to go down and get herself fist full of stilbestrol or equinprivine or something you dont get fistful of equinprivine you get the gluteus maximus full of it that its shot anyway anyway man hitting around that age thatd be very good thing for him to do get ahold of some methyltestosterone and throw it down his gullet frankly though if either one has any slightest second dynamic aberration itll do minimal amount of good and if their second dynamic aberration is terrific it wont do any good whatsoever you might as well pour it down the drain do you see that all right this has lot to do with geriatrics not the second dynamic metchnikoff i think his name was ive forgotten my books on this to large degree and didnt bother to look them up because it wouldnt do you any good once i just remembered this as an anecdote he said sour milk would make somebody have greater longevity make them live forever and that was fine and he by the way was quite boy he added quite some number of medical substances to mans category amongst them compound calomel in the prevention of syphilis and other things of this character this guy was quite sharpie and he was getting on in years so he studied geriatrics they all come to studying geriatrics sooner or later and they feel those years creeping up on them you know and they start cracking the textbook on gerontology so he collected sour cream and more sour cream and sour milk and sour skimmed milk and sour watered milk and i almost said sour british milk and he collected all varieties all varieties and he had his basement full of them and his neighbors basements full of them you know and so forth and hed led his experiments and he had it made he just had it made he and his partner both had it made as matter of fact and they could extend life with these magic compounds based on sour milk indefinitely and they both died on the sunny side of seventy just like any other man usually this is the fate of gerontological hopes in the middle ages why people were always slipping bag of gold across to the aged witch to receive in return the amulet which would cause them to live forever dont you see and those fellows theyd still die in bed at the age of seventy and the soldiers were always getting amulets for not being shot in battle you know and that sort of thing and occasionally these things worked the bullet hits them and cant penetrate you know something like that theres all kinds of amulets and potions to save life continue life to make life longer and that sort of thing all of which is very odd because you cant kill thetan thats very peculiar when you come down to think about it that thered be all this tremendous interest in geriatrics what theyre interested in actually is the preservation of body and they are not interested actually in the prolongation of individual life because that does not need prolonging it may need better remembering but it prolongs itself you dont drop out of the race but the point is here that body being possession starts aging and caving in and limiting thetans activities and he or she gets upset about this and they want to look younger and they want to feel younger they want to act younger and so they would rather go in the direction of gerontology and almost anybody who comes along with magic amulet or potion or shot of pills of some kind or another is going to get considerable amount of interest on this exact line now you as an auditor have very often seen pc doing well and looking younger and doing badly and looking older have you ever noticed this do you have good reality on this have you ever seen people look younger and look older through processing have you ever seen this now some people look very much older and some people look very much younger and its quite mad how this thing will go now in the process of finding goal in dynamic assessment you see this roller coaster rather rapidly this person is all exhausted over lots of goals theyve been over and lots of this and that and they feel bad about it and theyve had bad goal found or something and you give them dynamic they look terrible you know they look like theyre about 180 and theyre just all caved in and then you do dynamic assessment on them and you get the dynamic and right away they look bit younger you know they look nice and younger and then you find an item you know and they look lots younger and you find goal and boy do they look young and spry everything is getting along fine they havent hit any ultimate yet but thats dandy and then the auditor arc breaks them and they look much older and then they will look younger and theyll look older and as the lines are listed out you can normally tell if the pc is having good progress by just this one point alone do they look younger for instance im looking at somebody that last june had line listed off to clear and i came in and thought we had new teenage student and couple of weeks later the goal had flubbed there werent enough lines nothing had been tiger drilled on the thing and so forth and she looked about ninetyfive you get this is this wild but youve seen this youve seen this with your own eyesight so im not telling you anything you havent observed youve seen this this is definitely allied to the science of aging you say well ron why are you mentioning this weve all seen this we know this well one thing is we dont know all there is to know about this see we dont know how long body will live in fivegoal clear you know fivegoal clear how long can that person make the body live we dont know we havent any data on what the longevity could be stacked up to but we can hazard few good solid guesses that lets say somebody who was about thirtyfive or something like this as raw meat would look what would be average thirtyfive and if cleared would undoubtedly drop few years in appearance this weve got some reality on somebody who was about fortyfive or fifty something like this well youd probably get much steeper drop dont you see theyd probably drop back to much younger appearance proportionately somebody whos around seventy of course is kicking the point of return or has already passed it but youd still expect them to look younger now also how much longer would you expect this person to live well thats almost in the lap of the gods you know but you could make some ragged guess at this thing that maybe youd put five ten fifteen twenty years onto their life now naturally if you clear somebody at the age of thirty youre probably going to stack thirty or forty years onto the end of their line you see at least and if you clear somebody at seventyfive why maybe youd stack another five or six dont you see so the older they are probably the less years you stack on or theres some rule of that character might apply now studying geriatrics youre in very very interesting field youre in field of data because none can happen for the next seventy years you see so never do you get geriatrics being studied in any one lifetime and nobody of course is ever able to keep any records on this because they get bored and theres series you see the guy who was interested in keeping records has kicked the bucket and nobody else has picked it up and so on so youre always challenged along this line in the field of gerontology on just this one fact well nobody has lived long enough to prove it well that is your usual blunt argument that is offered but that is not what youre trying to prove youre not trying to prove by the actual livingness but age is normally determinable relative physiological age is determinable by the condition and character of certain parts of the body certain functions of the body and cellular structures you see we are the first that could do this see theres been nobody else before us that could do anything about this you see but you would take and make physiological examination of the person their cellular structure you see and this and that and the other thing about them the springiness of their joints or something and youd take this person and then clear this person and then get an independent examination of the springiness of the joints and the cellular structure and that sort of thing all of these various things now thats going at it rather painfully but you would determine then that the person was physiologically younger which of course predetermines the fact that they will live longer you see how that works out in other words this is susceptible to proof now in scientology in period of less than six months whether you have added to longevity or not dont you see now thats the first time anybodys ever been able to do any conclusions on the subject of geriatrics and we probably should go ahead and do something with this because this is this is something that people are interested in people are interested in care of the body care of the body preservation of the body all that sort of thing and they would find that this is very very much to the good before person can carry out any of his personal ambitions he should have enough physical energy and enough resilience of body to be able to accomplish this and therefore it is important to people now you try to tell people about the mind the mind the mind the mind the mind and they very often dont know what youre talking about or they think youre apologizing or something and they say well i had brother once who was crazy you see i mean this sort of thing this sort of thing is completely beyond them but you start talking to them about geriatrics and longevity and this fellow says what is this thing scientology well youd say youd say well what do you suppose your life expectancy is this puts it where he lives see he might even collect some of these insurance tables theyre the lyingest things you ever had anything to do with but insurance men believe in them implicitly and people who do actuarial work thats the phony mathematics that determine how much you pay for your policy this kind of stuff gives you all kinds of tables and theres one over in rockefeller center thats the most alarming thing i ever had anything to do with and you go up to it and you set on dial and how old you are and then you go around the corner and look at this other thing and that tells you when youre going to die sort of blunt and not at all accurate but they figure it out this way baby who lives to the age of six months has got chance of living to one year because most babies who are going to kick the bucket of course do so within the first six months dont you see but the baby who lives to the age of one year has life expectancy you see of maybe twoandahalf years or something like that but if somebody has lived to the good old age of fifteen then hes got good chance of living according to the averages to the age of thirty eight and somebody who has lived to the age of thirtyeight has good chance of living until hes eightynine or something you know this is totally mad series of scales but everybody believes in them its sort of the magic charm whats your life expectancy its quite game and one time i went up there many years ago rockefeller center it was before the war it didnt say any war was coming up on the thing so it was not very good swami it didnt predict that and i remember i think i was something like twentyseven or i was twentysix and i turned up twentysix on the dial you see went around the corner and took look and my god you know id been dead for years according to what it said so anyway regardless of what these expectancies are the insurance policy situation is very easily overridden by changing somebodys life expectancy now youd think insurance companies were interested in this but actually theyre not you cant sell these things to an insurance company for the good reason that they dont deal in anything but figures and their figures are based upon expectancies of claim payments and its all mathematics actually an automobile insurance company doesnt care how many wrecks you have doesnt care for minute how many wrecks you have because its all going to be figured out actuarially and averaged dont you see its some of the fellows up at lloyds worry because one or two of the syndicates may have the queen elizabeth or something you see under total insurance huhhuh you know and thats just one ship you know and its worth skillions and if it ever went thud why that would be the end of that syndicate dont you see all their all their eggs are in one funnel you know and anyway where we have spread out risk though like in life insurance and that sort of thing or automobile accidents or something its just matter of who cares they just charge as much for the policy as theyre going to pay out in claims i mean thats the blunt thing theyre not in the business of making people live longer as matter of fact most insurance companies would scream with terror if you proposed to them that you could make every one of their retirement policy holders live an additional hundred years also socialist state is liable to get rather queasy on this subject you finally break it down to the fact that theres one three months old baby left in the entire place who is able to work and isnt on pension dont you see its just too ghastly to contemplate so you get reverse philosophy going that you will occasionally run into in geriatrics which goes as follows if people werent kicking the bucket all the time we would be in terrible state and its very good thing everybody is dying off the way they are see and you get all kinds of reasons why death is marvelous thing and so forth and theyre actually thinking about their aunt tilde who if she lived forever would never let them come into their inheritance or something of the sort but now with inheritance tax they dont even think that anymore the upshot of this condition in geriatrics is youve got people who want people to live longer and youve got people who hope to hell they dont see and would do anything they could to shorten it down just little bit but insurance companies have an open mind and others dont care im just telling you this so that you wont bother to approach these people with this subject and but im also telling you what arguments you will get into in this and theyre quite funny but when you say to somebody that you could increase his longevity hes liable to be much more interested than if you said you could make him healthy he well im only talking about small section of people would be far more interested guys gimping along on crutches you know and hes all caved in both ears are bent and he says you say well i could make you healthy i could cure you well hes not sure hes not sure about that hes got his service facsimile right there in his pocket and he knows its various uses and if you cured him up he wouldnt get his pension anymore from the railroad and youve threatened his survival but if you told him you could make him live longer oh now we have another entrance point on the same joe see hoho youre not only taking his pension not taking his pension away from him see you are actually so therefore in actual fact scientologist needs this other string to his bow in the case of an argument along these lines and you see somebody gimping on crutches you say i could take you off the crutches and youve made an enemy and you say i could make you live longer and youve made friend people of course really dont believe that they can live longer they just wish they could and you have greek plays for instance which convince you utterly of the folly of immortality theres one of them there who at the end of thousand years of age why hes just begging the gods to kill him off because hes lost all his friends and everything else like that i think he was dope but anyhow thats beside the point if he had that much influence with the gods in the first place why didnt he get his friends living longer too the guy was merely selfish so the point here is that you have reverse argument and there is use for this argument and this action now how much longer you can make the person live by the process of just doing problems intensive i dont know but it must be considerable you can make haphazard guess at it and your guess would be as good as anybody elses this person is let us say thirtyfive years old and they feel like theyre going to die any minute and you give them problems intensive well youve increased their life expectancy that is how long they expect to live regardless of how long you have increased their actual livingness do you see and most people are fighting living any longer now lets go into this little more searchingly what exactly leads one off into any conclusions on this subject at all that have any validity well right there in that pavilion youre using these days i conducted bunch of plant experiments just vegetable matter true but it had something binging in it and thetabopping and i conducted series of experiments and in the far end of that thats furthest from the chapel here there were bunch of tomato plants which were championship tomato plants nobody has ever heard their like ive got photographs of them and records of them to this day but they were growing as far as many as fortyseven tomatoes to the truss this is unheard of its absolutely impossible see and they were growing up in height higher than sixteen feet and nothing was killing them off they hadnt heard of seasons their temperature was being held constant their moisture was being held constant and i developed quite little bit of stuff in order to get something to do this everybody thought i was interested in horticulture i really wasnt i was interested in several other things namely disease and things of that character but very carefully none of these tomato plants were given any injuries now the normal way of raising tomatoes is you punish them until they yield tomatoes you snip them every time they try to put out new little branch or something like that that you dont want you snip them and you top them and you do this to them and you do that to them you do other things to them and youre always at them you know always at them at them at them at them you know and they finally will grow lot of tomatoes for you yeah theyll grow some big tomatoes and so forth but oddly enough they are very fragile and hothouse tomatoes growing is an adventurous activity you have the banker on one hand and on the other side why you have every disease known to tomatoes all manner of blights and fungus and this and that and the other thing you never saw anything as sick as tomato plant when its been got at at at at at more snip snip snip snip see it all comes under the heading of care for it care for it you know look after your tomatoes care for it torture them and when you finally get this going real good why theyll bear you few tomatoes but it actually establishes short cycle of life in other words the life term of tomato and the amount of punishment that tomato plant is given have something in common thats something to remember there theyre both the same similar curve now tomato plant which is abused will become ill tomato plant standing right next to it wide open for infection that hasnt become abused hasnt been abused doesnt become ill readily or if it does it can be cured in other words abuse has something to do with incidence of illness and has great deal to do with longevity how longs this plant going to live so i raised half of that pavilion over there full of tomato plants that you had we finally had to shoot them down thats all i dont know where they would have gone but they were filling up the whole house and they were the most cheerful tomatoes that anybody ever had anything to do with and they were just getting bigger and producing more tomatoes and theyd already gone through two seasons and they were preparing happily to go into third season i said the devil with it we have concluded all i want to conclude cut them down and we did and thats the only reason that house isnt well thats the only reason the whole pleasure garden out there isnt full of tomatoes to this day now stationed around these tomatoes and amongst this under exactly the same climatic conditions were tomatoes which were abused and which did not follow this curve of action they were the same tomatoes under the same environmental action and they became quote sick unquote and their longevity was very short now they were not badly abused they were simply brushed against rather regularly and they were snipped the way tomatoes are supposed to be snipped you know and so forth but they never even managed to pass their diseases over onto these other tomatoes now im telling you as much as one could observe within the crude limits of experimentation which can be accomplished on this planet in any case these were as well done as you can do such experiments but experiment is perfectly done ever the fellow who perfectly does an experiment he hasnt been found yet so within those limits these facts are very factual but certainly i can show you the photographs of these tomatoes and my god you never saw tomatoes grow and grow and grow and trusses would come out and tomatoes would grow on the trusses and so on i think the record one for england is something rather low like thirtyfour tomatoes to the truss something like that and these were going we didnt even bother to count all of them because you couldnt reach them all you know but many of these were forty seven tomatoes to the truss see here you had longevity you also had reproductiveness and creativity you had these various things so some of the fondest theories were upset in handling those tomatoes all of which has to do had lot to do with the human being if you consider human being mainly body because body follows apparently these same physiological lines and ive seen nothing to disprove this fact that body and plant life and so forth these things are all cousins what laws apply to one tend to apply to another and i learned enough out of this to learn that abuse determines longevity and that was the datum that came out of that and once i had stared this in the face i looked around in amongst human beings to see if this continued and to marked degree it did and all of our experience in dianetics and so forth tended to conclude that anyway even long before these experiments now the other thing was that abuse determined incidence of illness thing was as sick as it was abused and its life was as short as it was abused see these two things emerged as parallel conclusions as result of these plant experiments now that means that there are two levels or two lines of approach here as far as dissemination of scientology is concerned you can talk about incidence of illness or illness or you can talk about longevity now these of course are quite inferior to talking about thetan and clearing and beingness of person his individuality and that sort of thing but remember when youre talking about individuality or an individual or an individual being youre not talking about body see and so therefore these things are true when you mean body and on planet which is terribly fixated on bodies and so forth these two things are very strong and powerful dissemination media if everybodys interested in the body and their minds are all busy being interested in the body you can give them couple of data about the body which is quite interesting and one of those is that the longevity of body can be increased or decreased in livingness and the other that incidence to illness and being well can also be monitored you see these two things can occur person can be made weller or person can be made sicker or person can be made to live longer or look less old or can be made to live less long and look older you see these things can all be concluded from these things and they are not such foreign statements that people people can misunderstand them and theyre all quite factual and so forth now the abuse of the tomato plant and the deletion of abuse from the life of human being have parallel in other words if you delete the abuse you have done something like not abuse and that was how i crosstranslated the experiment rightly or wrongly in other words if you could pick up the abuses out of persons lifetime or pick up those factors which made the person believe he was abused you then picked up of course the characteristics of not having been abused do you follow that and sure enough thats how longevity follows so these tomato experiments were important to that degree but you couldnt very easily process tomato at least i havent been able to yet turn on theta bops on them and rock slams and things like that but i never got into good communication with them im sure they were ready to go into session but i didnt know the language anyway the point im talking about here is when youre talking to world that is terribly fixated on bodies that world will listen on the subject of bodies and there are two things which utterly bypass the laws against healing and the laws against helping people and so forth and those things are longevity geriatrics i mean thats wide open man make them live longer its wide open it has medical connotations connected with it whatsoever youre not giving them drugs to live longer and the other one on the other side of the fence of course is maybe youre not sick maybe youre just suppressed see now lets look at this other one for moment which is aside from geriatrics this dissemination mechanism is of great interest to us because you can say this particularly in england you can say this if youve been depressed we use that word instead of suppressed and its not too good to continue to use this button suppress because you have to tiger drill it hard because people have kidded about it you know and done other things with it but if youve been depressed you can develop symptoms which look exactly like illness then you go up to somebody and you say to them like this you say hello joe joe have you ever you ever been sick and he says you kidding and you say well you ever go to the doctor and he says sure oh did he cure you and he says of course not well you follow your line in well maybe you werent sick maybe youre just depressed and he says huh his interest will be caught at that point maybe you werent sick maybe youre just depressed what do you mean well lot of people you know they feel depressed and they are depressed for long time and life depresses them you know it pushes in on them depresses them one way or the other and they will eventually develop feeling or belief that they are sick and theyll actually develop symptoms of sickness when theyre not sick and this guyll say maybe im not sick hm hm what are you talking about yeah maybe im not sick all right what do i do about it well you say get processed and thats all see you give that person problems intensive and let guarantee the data which has come rolling in on here in the last i dont know how many well i guess the last two or three months have been demonstrating some of the wildest recoveries you ever wanted to hear perfectly illegal diseases they must not be treated i think there are twentyfive diseases that you better not have in california because its illegal to treat them by law its illegal to treat them cancer arthritis theres whole bunch of them you mustnt treat them you can go to jail for it i think that even applies to medical doctors but of course it safely applies to them anyhow oh and you talk about you talk about fancy treatments i dont know how much treatment for arthritis costs on gold shots theyre called gold shots with reason man youd have to be one of the biggest directors in the bank of england able to sign those five pound notes in your own fair hand in order to get enough gold shots to make you well and furthermore cortisone and other such things are only relief as long as theyre administered they cure nothing they just relieve so youve got tremendous numbers of relieving medicines for this vast number of diseases now if you came up and said correctly it so happens well i dont care whether the fellow has cancer or arthritis or hangnails nothing to do with hes depressed hes not sick im not practicing medicine sure ive cured him of being depressed and very often when people are depressed they exhibit symptoms of illness all right hes well so he recovered from his hangnails who cares i havent told him id and you must do this you ive never treated him for hangnails i never had anything to do with hangnails i never recommended it never even diagnosed he had them he said he had them but thats nothing to do with all i did was treat his depressed or suppressed condition whichever word you want to use i treated his suppression life had suppressed him very badly and hed answered by telling people he was sick oh youre treating hypochondria he didnt even believe he was sick he just felt sick this is the peculiarity that you can drive home you could get into one of the most circuitous and people could run it out on you in sessions on the halftruth rudiment get into one of the most circuitous arguments you ever wanted to get into in your life either one of these geriatrics or not sick suppressed see either one of those things gives you an absolute wealth of material that you can embroider back and forth and work one way or the other and talk about you can generate tons of ideas it just starts an automaticity of generating ideas youre talking to some bird and he says well i dont know ill never be the same again i know that ever since my first marriage ive been pretty well caved in and ill never be the same again i know ill just go on being ill like this and so forth and you say well you know youre on the wrong button you see thats the wrong button to play on that case so you just go into geriatrics see and you say well actually actually i realize that some people are practically incurable i realize that there are some things that are practically incurable and somebody can run it out of you in session you see because what you mean of course is his fixed idea on the subject of he has to be sick he thinks its sickness youre talking about and you just simply tell him well theres another thing scientology can make you do and thats live longer that has an apparency there are some indications that processing makes one live longer well youre not being dishonest there youre not being dishonest there at all you can certainly tell him it makes you look younger you can tell him that with some truth theyll go consulting the mirror every time they turn around to see if they live younger this is in world of course which is totally fixated on body and youre trying to disseminate to people who havent heard of anything who dont know anything about clearing dont know anything about releasing dont know anything about anything and there you go it opens up door now the reason why im addressing this has nothing to do with whether or not i want to sell people an idea weve got to have bridge weve got to have bridge from raw meat to clearing well that bridge has got to contain reality for the person its happening to and unless we have bridge well simply clear up all those people who are already interested in scientology and thatll be the end of the line theres got to be some bridge that brings the person into contact with reality on the mind and life i know nothing better than problems intensive or series of problems intensives now let us suppose you are running clinic it was you were talking about making people live longer or you were talking about making people feel better we dont care what youre doing as long as its either one of another or these particular activities you have well lets say its clinical type coaudit youre using interns or anything you can lay your hands on you know and youre giving people problems intensives and theyre walking in and the problems intensives are given at two hours week or nine hours week or thirtyeight hours week we dont care how these things are given and theyre getting processed and theyre walking in and all youre doing is running just straight problems intensive thats all and youre just getting the buttons repetitively and its all right because youre running prepcheck repetitive style doesnt matter whether the button is clean or not if the fellow cant think of any more answers why you just say well all right and shift to another button all of this is perfectly fine and that fellows going to come out the other end if any kind of job of auditing was done at all looking and feeling younger geriatrics and well of something he has been sick of both are going to happen to him if anything was run at all im getting some amazing reports on what problems intensive is doing you know its sort of like you climb this arduous mountain to find nugget you see and you get up to the top of this mountain and somebody down in the valley down below there you are mopping the sweat off your brow and he says hey he says theres one here thats two feet in diameter he says would that do well we just bypassed it because the whole top of the mountain is gold dont you see there still is that nugget in the valley weve evidently bypassed the problems intensive weve bypassed the potentialities of suppressed not sick see weve bypassed geriatrics completely havent paid any attention to it until tonight you probably havent even heard the name all of these things you see weve just thrown them away we arent paying any attention to them at all now i dare say we have people right here their hidden standard is whether they look younger you know they go to the mirror every morning and see if they look and some of them who want to look older you see its theyre using age or appearance of age as hidden standard to find out how theyre doing are they looking younger are they looking older you know well this is very very standard hidden standard this runs all through the human race and if its that general well youd certainly better have use for the generality of the button and the generality of the button is this im not trying to teach you how to be men or something like that im just trying to teach you how to talk to people within their sphere of interest now in book three of book one that is the third book of that first volume book one dianetics the modern science of mental health it says that if you can parallel thats right at the beginning of it if you can parallel what the mind is doing you see you can reach it and do something for it well im trying to teach you trick here to take raw meat and get their to parallel and for you to be able to parallel what their mind is doing you see that starts session before the session happens and ive all been always been looking for these little buttons one way or the other and have accumulated lot of information about it information which im sure you can use so youve got these two buttons and with superfixation on the body the fellow is thinking how well am i and how young or old am i see how well or sick am i how young or old am i hes asking these questions all the time and on superfixation on the body you can always get him into communication on this subject because his attention is fixed on it how do people greet each other on this planet they say how are you meaning how sick are you today and the other fellow brags up and says well ive had cold lately but uh so forth just read letter that emanates from one farm district to another farm district just catch the mail on censorship and it all has to do with health and aunt lizzies kidney stones you know these are the milestones of time you see and this sort of thing well those minds are definitely stuck on state of the body and of course state of the body is young or old sick or well now the reason ive called this lecture geriatrics is because its brandnew brandnew sphere its brandnew look its brandnew communication line and its very old hidden standard i imagine trillions of years ago when you wanted to know if you were getting along all right you stuck your doll body up in front of mirror to see how its dents were you know and youd say well im getting on now im getting pretty dented you know paints getting kind of worn off face is longer shiny now youve come on down the track trillennia you have meat body and you go up to the mirror and you say well im doing very badly because my nose is shiny you know theres all kinds of changed considerations on this thing but thetans have always been going on these two views how young or old do i look how sick or well am i therefore these are very very good dissemination media theyre good media for conversation and i give them to you simply because you have pat solution in the problems intensive now what clearing does for this is fantastic we havent even talked about what clearing would do for this to any degree at all i havent clue because it is just too much its beyond ready embrace of the mind age is hooked on to the body normally by the thetan himself as self expression and it is held in place in terms of engrams and secondaries its held right there man anything that is wrong with body is held into it and on it by the thetan who has that body thats it as long as he believes he cant grow new leg he wont have one either and this is very observably the place there is frankly limitation on what thought can do to structure there is limitation on that there is fantastic short look on what structure can do for function or thought but nevertheless this is ready tool this is something that you need youre sitting there somebody says to you what is scientology you look them over you can tell them its something that makes you well or something that makes you younger you can tell them not in dictionary definition of this or that which they wont understand anyhow because they wont have any comparable datum the reason you have trouble defining scientology to people is because there is datum of comparable magnitude in this universe so they always put up datum of comparable magnitude and hang you right away into suppression and disagreement so you have hard time because they say oh its like christian science you say youre hung right away with suppression you say it is not like christian science and that puts you into disagreement and you havent got the thing insession dont you see there it isnt flying now but they say well what is scientology and you say well scientology is study of livingness study of livingness now do you often wish you were younger the fellow says oh yeah yeah i do that and you say well good scientology processing and so forth would possibly permit you to achieve that desire now theyve got datum of comparable magnitude themselves so never let them find datum of comparable magnitude you give them one now your datum of comparable magnitude may be to baseball manager his baseball team you see but always give them the datum of comparable magnitude its themselves or its what they own or its their family or its their aging or sick mother or their ailing wife it is something like that dont you see its datum of comparable magnitude and you can say its almost short circuit on the thing they say what is scientology take look at them do you feel do you often wish you were younger have you been sick lately the fellow says well ive never been sick day in my life well do you wish you felt younger uh i i never did i i dont dont ever wish i felt any younger do you have any ailing members of your family oh yes theres my dear old mother well good scientology would be something that would make her well oh uh its medicine its youre off on the wrong line so youd better amplify completely your statement youd say well scientology is system of processing which does certain things for the individual and straightens them out and some people are not sick theyre just suppressed and so forth now and he says your mother uh my mother he says my mother she always was kind of suppressed by my father oh god i hated him you know he was good at all and you say well there you are shes pretty suppressed huh well you could take something like scientology to pick up that suppression and straighten her out and he says well now thats good thing see thats his immediate conclusion see how youd do it but hes going to reach for datum of comparable magnitude youre not going to be able to stop him from doing that because understanding comes by comparison dont you see and hes going to reach for datum of comparable magnitude so you better reach for him first now naturally we take this society lady and she has powder on her face quarter of an inch thick were left in illusions about it but we also have to be very tactful were going to use geriatrics on this case but we have to be very tactful about it like some people even when they look young can be made to look even younger youll find many people cannot confront illness have nothing to do with illness and illness is very forbidden field to them illness is zone and area for specialists illness is place where you must not tread this prejudice and superstition is fantastic and yet to get an entrance in the case youve got to talk about something about the body because theyll never envision the mind all right then you have geriatrics you can get into the most endless discussions on people about whether people are older or younger or as old as they feel or younger than they feel and what if you just kept processing somebody and processing them and they went down and became baby and you know and could you process person the wrong way and make them look older and older and all kinds of things like this but youd find interest would quicken you see well youve got maybe youre not sick maybe youre just suppressed as dissemination medium i thought id better tell you about geriatrics because theres large section of the society that cant confront illness and wont even talk about it now youve got geriatrics an interesting very interesting field and one which we have incidentally wrapped up passant and havent even noticed so i thought id better call it to our attention before we passed by it utterly but you would be amazed how many billions of dollars are spent every year trying to discover the route to eternal youth we are the only ones who have that map at the present time and naturally weve got maps to so many more worthwhile goals and actions that weve paid attention to it at all so i thought id better call it to your attention thank you very much female voice thank you
