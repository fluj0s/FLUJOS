than law president george washington found the cabinet concept meeting of departmental secretaries to be useful and all subsequent presidents have followed this precedent presidents have differed in their opinions as to the utility of the cabinet but all have found some political and administrative strengths in its continuance this report discusses how membership in the cabinet has changed over the decades the selection and removal processes are examined as well as commentary on the cabinet by persons who have been participants in this century whole host of subcabinet groups have been created as substitutes for full cabinet sessions the authority and configuration of these sub cabinet groups eg council on economic policy vary from administration to administration and few institutions and sets of relationships have acquired permanent status number of subcabinet groups have staffs eg national security council and it is these staffs that help provide some measure of institutional depth to the presidency despite two centuries of criticism the cabinet remains fixture in the presidents political world this report reviews criticisms directed at the cabinet and the reforms offered to correct alleged deficiencies and provides an assessment of the utility of the cabinet to successive presidents the cabinet is retained because it provides to the president 1 political and managerial advice 2 forum for interdepartmental conflict resolution 3 location where he can address most of the executive branch and thereby enhance administrative coherence and 4 source of political support for his programs and policies this report concludes with several observations on the nature of the cabinet the cabinet is not now and is not likely to become body with collective responsibility presidents cannot appropriately share their legal authority or responsibilities with the cabinet thus there are inherent limitations to the cabinet that reforms can alter or overcome

1959 p 29the presidents cabinet evolution alternatives and proposals for change origin and evolution the presidents cabinet is an institution whose existence rests upon custom rather than law1 while the wording of article ii section 2 of the constitution that the president may require the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the executive departments clearly indicates the intention of the framers that the president was expected to seek the advice of his department heads there was constitutional requirement that he meet with them either individually or collectively the cabinet came into being because president george washington found it useful he began meeting with his three departmental secretaries and the attorney general in 1791 although it was not until 1793 during crisis with france that this group acquired the popular name of cabinet2 while all subsequent presiden ts have considered it necessary to meet with the cabinet their attitudes toward the institution and its members have varied greatly some presidents have convened their cabinet only for the most formal and routine matters while others have relied heavily upon it for advice and support richard fenno has noted the absolute dependence of the cabinet upon the president the presidents power to use or not use it is complete and final the cabinet is his to use when and if he wishes and he cannot be forced into either alternative he has the power of life or death over it at this point3 the composition of the cabinet from the beginning has reflected two critical concepts promoted by the

executive is leading character of good government feeble executive implies feeble execution of government feeble execution is but another phrase for bad execution all men of sense will agree in the necessity of an energetic executive president washington was not in any doubt that the heads of departments were his agents when he wrote to the comte moustier in may 1789 the impossibility that one man should be able to perform all the great business of the state i take to have been the reason for instituting the great departments and appointing officers therein to assist the supreme magistrate in discharging the duties of his trust5 the issue took the form of challenge to the president by congress that he could not dismiss anyone confirmed by the senate from office without first obtaining senate approval in what has come down to us as the decision of 17896 congress under madisons leadership retreated from this position and indicated to the president that from the outset he could dismiss any officer thus cementing the position of the president as chief of an integrated executive branch7 second the cabinet reflects the framers belief in the superiority of single executives to manage departments over plural executive arrangement the framers turned away from grand theory and reflected instead upon their own experience in waging the revolutionary war against global power and

single man9 one of the first orders of business for the new congress in 1789 was the establishment of executive departments three organic statutes were passed creating three great departments treasury state and war10 fourth department department of home affairs was considered and abandoned the functions likely to have resided in that department were assigned to the other three departments all the particular functions of the newly created executive branch save that of prosecuting the laws and delivering the mails were assigned these departments11 as noted above president washington assembled his department secretaries for advice and counsel and in 1793 this informal group became popularly referred to as the cabinet in addition to the three secretaries after 1798 there was fourth secretary representing the new department of the navy the president received legal advice from an attorney general the attorney general was private lawyer on retainer 1500 annually to the federal government the attorney general subsequently became fulltime officer of the united states and finally the head of the newly created department of justice in 187012 as for the postmaster general he was the head of

congress as an independent establishment of the executive branch13 the position of postmaster general was consequently removed from the cabinet the first major addition to the list of executive departments was the department of the interior in 184914 the point to be recognized however is that as functions were assumed by the federal government they were assigned to new or existing departments thereby retaining the essential unitary basis for the executive branch prior to 1860 only four permanent detached agencies were created the library of congress the smithsonian institution the botanic garden and the government printing office15 for the first century of the republic therefore the executive branch with few exceptions consisted of departments headed by single administrators under the authority of the president there are presently 2000 some 14 departments in the executive branch the most recent department to be established being the department of veterans

realists say that the cabinet both collectively and as shorthand way of referring to the 14 departmental secretaries individually is an institution of limited utility and not likely to change selfdescribed reformers on the other hand still seek formula that will elevate the cabinet both collectively and individually to primary role as advisor to the president the debate over the proper role for the cabinet is now more than two centuries old and shows signs of being resolved for most presidents at least it is more problem to be lived with than solved membership on the cabinet traditionally membership on the cabinet has consisted of the secretaries of the several executive departments the present number being 14 from the beginning however presidents have accorded to others the privilege of attending and participating in cabinet meetings although vice presidents were from time to time invited to attend it was not until president warren harding invited vice president calvin coolidge in 1921 to be regular attendee and to preside in his absence that the vice president has been recognized as member of the cabinet20 president dwight d eisenhower initiated the practice of designating certain positions as having cabinet rank this special status is not recognized in law and is purely presidential distinction that can be given and later withdrawn the number of positions assigned cabinet rank has varied over time but has included among others the ambassador of the united states to the united nations the director of the office of management and budget omb and the special trade representative in the case of the director of omb and the special trade representative both have been given the rank for pay purposes of executive level i the rank assigned department secretaries21 cabinet rank may be assigned to individuals as well as to positions thus recent presidents beginning with richard nixon have designated individuals as counselor to the

staff members may have been invited to the meeting but occupied chairs located at the side of the cabinet room the president may invite others from time to time eg under secretary of the treasury for monetary affairs if the subject to be discussed warrants their inclusion the cabinet remains however ultimately what it has always been creation of the presidents will and style while presidents enjoy degree of deference in the appointmen t process for departmental secretaries it has become increasingly difficult for nominees to be confirmed without controversy the federal bureau of investigation conducts rigorous character and security checks prior to the submission of names standards and expectations for public officials are higher than in the past and large numbers of wouldbe appointees never make it through the white house personnel office to the nominee stage22 if they successfully navigate the white house political and security minefields they are then subject to confirmation by the senate which has its own capabilities to generate additional information and perspective on appointees23 notwithstanding these recent developments only 19 cabinet nominations have failed to be confirmed since 1789 nine were rejected on the floor of the senate seven withdrawn by the president and three died in committee in addition two cabinet nominations were announced but never submitted to the senate of the cabinet nominations rejected on the floor of the senate one nominee caleb cushing was rejected three times in 1843 to be secretary of the treasury while second nominee charles warren was rejected twice in 1925 to be attorney general24 in one instance nominee former vice president henry wallace was rejected by committee to be secretary of commerce but later confirmed by vote of the full senate at least seven cabinet nominations have been withdrawn by presidents the most recent occurrence being in october 1997 president clinton withdrew the name of his nominee herschel

declined to hold hearings in addition two cabinet nominees had their nomination withheld by the president prior to formal submission to the senate in one instance disclosure of the name of kimba wood to be attorney general generated media controversy sufficient to induce the president to issue statement withdrawing woods name from consideration25 similarly the president had announced his intention in 1993 to nominate bobby r inman to be secretary of defense replacing aspin the adverse political reaction was such that the president determined that submitting his name formally was futile gesture traditionally when president wanted to maximize the likelihood that nominee would be confirmed he would select member of congress even this strategy is longer sure route to success however as the 1989 rejection of former senator john tower to be secretary of defense attests26 members of the cabinet like most other presidential appointees serve at the pleasure of the president presidents can and have fired cabinet secretaries the most striking recent instance being in 1979 when president carter required that all 12 cabinet secretaries plus 21 other officials submit their resignations he accepted the resignations of secretaries joseph califano health education and welfare michael blumenthal treasury and brock adams transportation all generally viewed as effective administrators but all also viewed by the white house staff as failing to be team players27 historically membership in the cabinet has been diverse within the cultural context of the period the single most constant factor in the selection process over the years has been partisan affiliation28 presidents generally confine their list of potential cabinet members to persons affiliated with their own party republican president will occasionally select democrat to head an executive department but this is an exceptional event and the situation is the same with democratic presidents the most recent instance of president reaching to the opposing party for departmental secretary occurred in january 1997 when president clinton nominated former republican senator william cohen of maine to be his secretary of defense the political considerations present in selecting members of the cabinet tend to reflect the two basic approaches to the cabinet as an institution first there are factors that influence president when viewing the cabinet collectively presidentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30673crs8 29 president wilson found his first secretary of state william jennings bryan to be incompetent

priorities lie the factors playing role in the selection process include but are not limited to partisan affiliation ideology gender geography friendship ethnicity interest group support and professional reputation the managerial competency factor appears to play relatively minor role when the cabinet is not viewed as simply collectivity tied to the presidents political interests however but as the sum total of individual department secretaries who have as part of their job descriptions periodic meetings in the white house the factors influencing the selection process differ in emphasis if not in kind experience and managerial competence will often be considered as factor in the selection process if the discussion centers on the needs of the departme nt and its programs rather than on the aggregate political fortunes of the president the more prestigious the department the more likely that some measure of demonstrated competence will be expected thus the secretary of state is generally expected to be person with considerable internati onal experience as with all generalizations however there have been notable exceptions as when woodrow wilson selected william jennings bryan to be his secretary of state in 191329 while presidents have generally been involved in the selection process for cabinet officers president clinton stood apart by his very public pledge to commit his time and prestige to the process the goal in this instance was to appoint cabinet that reflected his definition of ethnic and gender diversity30 the process and the nominations submitted were not without their problems and political risks however as evidenced by the withdrawal of two nominees for attorney general president clinton found as had most of his predecessors that they personally knew relatively few persons fully capable of performing the responsibilities of department secretaries and whose past could withstand close public scrutiny cabinet appointments in short rarely add substantively to presidents political capital and may inflict considerable harm the first set of cabinet appointments in new administration tends to favor interests that were instrumental in the candidates electoral success often these appointments are disappointments to the president particularly if they appear to be more responsive to the interests from whence they came than to the president also initial appointments are more likely to become ambassadors to the president from the departments rather than the reverse all in all experience suggests that as an

relatively unknown but competent and politically safe administrators to serve as cabinet members until the administration completes its term the cabinet meeting the very name cabinet suggests collective concept this title however is misleading the cabinet in the united states is simply gathering of individuals selected by the president to perform specified responsibilities who exhibit collective responsibility and little collective consciousness32 the cabinet never resigns masse simply because congress has rejected one of the presidents proposals nor do they feel an obligation to come to the aid of one of their number when that individual may be political trouble the single common thread to the members of the cabinet is their loyalty to the president who appointed them since the cabinet is not statutory body its use has varied greatly over time depending upon the practices and philosophy of the particular president we know that president washington placed great reliance upon his cabinet members both individually and collectively33 in the 19th century number of presidents in the absence of white house staff came to rely upon individual executive department secretaries for policy advice administrative assistance and political support some presidents went outside their official cabinet and formed kitchen cabinets as sources of advice and support in the 20th century the cabinet has experienced notsogradual decline in its political and administrative relevance to the president this decline has not been straight line however as several presidents eg jimmy carter have attempted to resurrect the cabinet and particularly the cabinet meeting as forum for serious policy discussion34 regardless of good intentions however the institutional

303has simply not responded to most efforts to reform its character the truth is that matters of high government policy are rarely raised at cabinet meetings by the president or any of those present even with respect to questions of high politics to which presumably the collective wisdom of the cabinet might be properly directed presidents rarely avail themselves of this opportunity president franklin roosevelt for instance never raised the issue of the soundness and political viability of his courtpacking bill with the cabinet although such body might have given him useful advice nor were issues connected with world war i discussed at wilson cabinet meetings the cabinet meeting belongs to the president the president sets the agenda for the meeting individual cabinet members may be asked to present reports of general interest and not so general interest concerning their respective fields of responsibility members tend to be reluctant to raise problems concerning their own departments for general discussion according to memoirs of some attendees at these meetings all too often the meetings become fora for the weakest members to expound their views35 what usually happens is that the cabinet meeting is prelude to line up of individual department secretaries who want to see the president alone jesse jones one of the more colorful cabinet members of the roosevelt years said my principal reason for not having great deal to say at cabinet meetings was that there was one at the table who could be of help to except the president and when i needed to consult him i did not choose cabinet meeting to do so36 president dwight eisenhower determined upon taking office to bring some structure to cabinet meetings and white house staff work generally cabinet meetings were

recordtaking and systematic followup actions to critics however it was unproductive procedure amounting to tidiness for its own sake after eisenhowers 1958 heart attack and the departure of maxwell rabb the first cabinet secretary there was some movement away from the highly structured cabinet meetings eisenhowers successors presidents kennedy and johnson lost little time in dismantling the institutionalized cabinet even eliminating the position of cabinet secretary president kennedy reputedly commented cabinet meetings are simply useless why should the postmaster general sit there and listen to discussion of the problems of laos38 not surprisingly kennedy held cabinet meetings as seldom as possible he was openly critical of his predecessors structured approach to decisionmaking preferring instead to rely on individualsstaff and otherwise whom he trusted most irrespective of their responsibilities or position under kenned the white house staff began to grow with individual staff members increasingly becoming political personalities and powers in their own right president johnson tended to use cabinet meetings as opportunities for oneway conversations and to promote the appearance of political consensus within his administration president richard nixon was marginally more concerned with building structured decisionmaking than kennedy and johnson but his views on the value of cabinet meetings still remained closer to his immediate predecessors than to eisenhower president gerald ford however discerned value in providing some structure to his management decisionmaking and reinstituted the cabinet secretariat which has remained in operation in some form since that time ford also determined that at least part of the cause for the watergate debacle lay with nixons overreliance upon personal staff whose only formal responsibility was to serve the presidents political interests this narrow focus tended to distort the type of advice given the president and was easily corrupted the departmental secretaries meeting individually with the president or in cabinet provided useful antidote to any arrogant attitudes that might be assumed by white house staffers presiden ts work today within rigid time constraints on complex subjects that need to be translated into relatively simple political terms such problems do not lend themselves to long discussions by generalists in cabinet setting additionally cabinet meeting s involve relatively large number of people so that the ability to control leaks to the press is limited the white house staff on the other hand is in close physical proximity to the oval office and tends to share the presidential perspective which rarely goes beyond the next congressional or presidential election the

available to president in seeking advice in providing administrative direction to the executive branch and in developing political support for policy initiatives cabinet alternatives informal and

presidents had substantial white house office staffs they frequently turned to informal groups for advice the first and most famous informal cabinet was andrew jacksons kitchen cabinet group of friends and newspapermen with whom he felt comfortable39 jackson reportedly met with his cabinet only 16 times in eight years40 later presidents had their informal advisers given names such as grover

side of presidential responsibilities in april 1969 the president established the presidents advisory council on executive organization known popularly as the ash council after its chairman roy l ash to recommend changes in executive office organization and in the organization of the executive branch generally44 during the period when the ash council was meeting in 1969 and 1970 the white house staff emerged as the dominant force within the presidential advisory orbit aware of this trend and in general agreement the ash council recommended to the president that he submit reorganization plan to congress that would establish domestic council and reconstitute the bureau of the budget changing its name to the office of management and budget in his message to congress accompanying the plan the president noted that the reorganization plan established domestic council with an institutional staff to coordinate policy formulation in the domestic arena to considerable degree it was intended to be the domestic counterpart to the national security council45 formally the domestic council was composed of the president the vice president the attorney general and the secretaries of the treasury interior agriculture commerce labor health education and welfare and transportation the president could also designate persons to serve on the council relevant to the issue at hand the key to the council was its staff located in the executive office and headed by an assistant to the president the expectation was that ad hoc groups of departmental representatives would meet and formulate

the council and its staff however there were fewer and fewer meetings and less longerterm planning peri arnold concluded the domestic council never quite fulfilled the expectations of the ash council far from being mechanism for policy formulation the domestic council became large staff for presidential errands admittedly increasing presidential reach but often providing little analytic or formulative capacity over policy46 the presidents shortterm political needs simply displaced any efforts to develop an institutionalized policy process within the white house in 1974 the ford transition team concluded that there was useful role for the domestic council and its staff and ford named his new vice president nelson rockefeller to be the vice chairman of the domestic council and to head the staff this decision however quickly drew opposition from the presidents chief of staff donald rumsfeld because in effect there would now be twotrack system for political and policy advice for to the president this arrangement lasted but short time with vice president rockefeller opting to forego his role as chief of the domestic council staff47 president jimmy carter ended the domestic

initiating and coordinating broad policy initiatives that cut across departmental lines each counselor was to have small staff under the oversight of an assistant to the president 50 the other domestic departmental secretaries would definitely be relegated to an outer cabinet this experiment with super cabinet was abandoned almost as soon as it was announced the first casualty of the watergate debacle that would soon consume the president and his white house staff presidents reagan and bush made little pretense of promoting cabinet government what president reagan did do however at the urging of one of his top aides edwin meese was to create set of seven cabinet councils as working groups each council was assigned specific substantive area to cover eg economic affairs agriculture51 the idea was to have cabinet members and their deputies concentrate on those areas of special concern to themselves or to their department each council was provided some modest staff assistance the cabinet council system worked reasonably well in reagans first term but gradually lost steam once meese left the white house to become attorney general the seven councils became two councils council on domestic policy and economic policy council with few meetings and relatively little impact on presidential decisionmaking under president george bush the two policy councils remained and were the forum for issues that cut across departmental lines both councils as well as the full cabinet were supported by staff from small office of cabinet affairs which viewed its task as being that of an honest broker between cabinet secretaries and between the cabinet and the white house staff inother words to make certain that the president understood without prejudice or bias or distortion what it was the cabinet was doing what they were concerned about what proposals they wanted made52 the bush administration experience tended to reinforce the view that the cabinet itself was ill suited for substantive policy development and that insofar as cabinet level input to the president was useful it was best provided in the setting of cabinet subgroups or councils53 president clinton meets with his cabinet infrequently just twice in 1998 and five times in 1999 like his recent predecessors clinton relies more on his white house staff than on cabinet secretaries for both

council and the national economic policy councildominate the process for establishing administration policy what makes these subcabinet councils different is that the presiden t has ended the practice of viewing the departmental secretaries as superior in status to white house staff with respect to the domestic policy council it is officially composed of departmental secretaries several independent agency directors and white house staff officials unlike the reagan and bush administrations reports shirley anne warshaw which placed one cabinet officer in charge of cabinet council the clinton approach was to place presidential assistants directly in charge white housecabinet interaction for policy development was purposely structured to ensure that the white house staff controlled the process54 apparently it is the belief and practice of president clinton to view cabinet secretaries and top white house officers as equal in status and members of team white house staff the more serious contemporary alternative to the cabinet as source of political and policy assistance to the president is the white house staff presidents generally enter office with the view that the white house staff should be tamed in power and reduced in numbers55 they often issue statement suggesting that the department secretaries will be viewed as superior to white house staff thus president carter laid down the law early in his administration there will never be an instance while i am in office where the members of the white house staff dominate or act in superior position to the members of the cabinet56 this pledge was soon broken while presidents have always had assistance of one sort or another complaints throughout the 19th century were that it was insufficient57 as late as 1922

works and social welfarewould be additions to the cabinet the principal thesis of the report was that the executive branch should be reorganized to create an integrated hierarchical structure with the president as an active manager in short it became the foremost contemporary statement favoring departmentalism58 in terms of legislative accomplishment relatively little was directly forthcoming from the brownlow committee work the two most important results were the passage of the reorganization act of 1939 53 stat 561 with its provision for the legislative veto of presidential initiatives to effectuate reorganizations59 and the establishment by way of reorganization plan 1 of 1939 53 stat 1423 of the executive office of the president eop60 the eop initially consisted of five presidential

staffers as holding less responsible positions with little to statutory basis and thus tend to resent or resist white house staff directives or initiatives in their view the departments have the

programs within departments particu larly through the reorganization plan process an authority allowed to lapse in 1984 have been characterized as flawed in concept and implementation63 if an early enthusiasm for reorganizing departments wanes in first term it may be replaced by presidential desire to further politicize the departments and agencies through loyalist political appointees and to centralize critical decisionmaking in the white house these twin objectivespoliticization and centralizationare often pursued by presidents pledged to fulfill the opposite or at least different goals

there has been general shift away from reliance upon central management agencies such as the office of personnel management opm to support and hold executive agencies accountable to meet governmentwide standards the thrust of the npr approach has been to assign wherever possible management responsibilities to the specific department and agencies and more directly to front line personnel because in their view that is where accountabi lity properly resides68 second there is increasing emphasis on devolving authority within departments and the assignment of functions to third

continued general management laws is term of art that refers to those crosscutting laws regulating the activities procedures and administra tion of all agencies of government except where exempted either as class of agency or on an agency specific basis70 such laws eg administrative procedure act and title v personnel acts have historically been viewed as crucial to maintaining the integrity of the executive branch through departmental secretaries to the president and ultimately to congress the npr view of government management based as it is on the private sector corporate model moves away from the public law hierarchical basis for management and in its place seeks to reorganize the executiv branch into many essentially autonomous government agencies eg performance based organizations competing both internally with other agencies and with nongovernmental entities in the private sector71 second the npr and much of the current management philosophy addressed to the governmental sector seeks to decrease the role of the presidents central management agencies office of management and budget office of personnel management and general services administration and also that of departmental secretaries as devolution of authority within departments to lower levels accelerates and as departments are disaggregated eg social security administration made independent of the department of health and human services national nuclear security administration being made administrativel autonomous of the department of energy the role of cabinet secretaries is correspondingly diminished possibly of greatest import to the current administrative management governmentwide however is the increasing reliance of departments and agencies upon contracted third parties for the performance of their statutory mission whole programs and even agencies could find themselves being held accountable for program management and administration while the actual program resources rest

press 1997the point to recognize is that in recent decades and especially with the implementation of the npr proposals after 1993 the basic functions of departments and of departmental secretaries have been altered in some measure strengthening the department and its secretary in other cases reducing their authority and leverage over operations when the latter is the case it is not unreasonable to assume that the role and importance of the cabinet has undergone similar diminution73 utility of the cabinet most presidents have complained about the cabinet as political institution it rarely has met their expectations nearly all memoirs written by persons who have served in the cabinet are equally or more critical in their appraisals and are skeptical of its utility to either the president or to the department secretaries outsiders writing of the cabinet often are cynical concernin g its proceedings and contribution to the management of the executive branch few of the outsiders and an occasional insider have proposed reforms for the cabinet but these proposals have generally come to naught if there are so many people who find fault with the institutional cabinet why has it survived for two centuries and why are there serious proposals to abandon the cabinet the answer appears to be that notwithstanding the continuing criticism the cabinet has utility to presidents and to department secretaries in meeting their respective managerial responsibilities if the cabinet is expected to provide the president with collective or even individual policy advice the expectations are not likely to be fulfilled once the cabinet is considered as vehicle for management however its utility becomes both substantial and visible there are at least four areas where the utility of the

is defined in terms of persuading the public and elected officials to follow the presidents policy preferences providing initiatives in international affairs and being public symbol for worthwhile national causes but another less visible aspect of presidential leadership relates to providing political and managerial leadership for the executive branch it is in this latter field of leadership where the cabinet can play highly useful role information and analytic judgments can flow in both directions at cabinet meeting the president can raise the general question say of how best might the federal government encourage greater technology research and development and then let the cabinet secretaries exchange ideas before him in so doing certain themes may develop and need further fleshing out by selected secretaries here the ideas are coming from below to the president subsequently the president considering the advice given may assign to particular secretary responsibility for developing options for his consideration and for developing consensus on what may become the administrations policy cabinet meetings can facilitate the raising of critical issues and the resolution of those issues within an executive branch context finally the cabinet may serve as the basis for building political consensus sufficiently strong to put these ideas such as vocational education and retraining into practice cabinet meetings can help president to get feel for the management problems afflicting the federal government presidents generally familiar and experienced in legislative politics feel comfortable with the process of getting law passed by congress but laws are not selfexecuting they must be implemented and implementation is managerial function recent presidents have been discouraged by both advisers and scholars from investing time and political capital in executive branch management74 their argument is that presidents should concentrate on political leadership not managerial leadership the latter being described by some as mere clerkship function75 this attitude has arguably been costly both to presidents and to departmental secretaries today some government offices and even departments appear to be hollow76 that is they have become dependent usually because of personnel ceilings upon contract workforce this government by proxy77 poses major

department secretaries in cabinet meetings to bring to the presidents attention managerial problems associated with the current organizational and personnel structures policy decisions should be informed by resource availability and public law considerations both subjects on which department secretaries collectively and individually are conversant the cabinet therefore has utility in that it provides forum where most of the executive branch is represented and where general managerial concerns can be raised and discussed but the management value of the cabinet is once again solely at the discretion of the president interdepartmental conflict resolution our government is government managed by laws78 for the most part congress passes law establishing program or directing the writing of regulations and assigns this responsibility to departmental secretary while this system has the virtue of creating clear lines of authority and accountability it also has limitations different laws may assign different department secretaries responsibility for administering what are in effect similar programs but are intended to achieve conflicting objectives the secretary of health and human services for instance through the administrator of the food and drug administration is charged with protecting the health of the citizenryatlarge there is specific provision in law forbidding the use of any food additive that is deemed to induce cancer in man or animal but what standards shall apply to this prohibition if any trace of such an additive is sufficient to ban the product what impact will this have on farmersgrowers who consider traceable doses of this additive to be essential to their productivity and international competitiveness clearly there is the potential in this situation for conflict between the secretaries of health and human services and of agriculture the cabinet is itself not useful forum for resolving this conflict but the fact that two equalranked secretaries can meet on neutral territory possibly with presidential prodding makes resolution of this problem more likely cabinet meetings permit secretaries to meet each other socially situation which is conducive to subsequent phone calls and personal meetings on most issues two or more secretaries can agree to have their principal deputies meet to work out agreements interdepartmental conflicts are inevitable and even healthy they are likely to increase simply because the government is concerned with more issues than in the past and the issues are becoming more complex oftentimes problems between bureaus within different departments resist resolution until they can be considered at the secretarial level while the cabinet setting does not guarantee resolution of these conflicts it is reasonable to assume that it facilitates agreements between partieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30673crs24 79 paul c light thickening government federal hierarchy and the diffusion of accountability

federal communications commission most government corporations eg federal deposit insurance corporation tennessee valley authority postal service and quasigovernmental bodies eg federal reserve system and smithsonian institution are not represented when the cabinet meets similarly decreasing percentage of the budget remains discretionary and represented by the cabinet officers these caveats aside the cabinet still provides the president an audience where most of his responsibilities as the nations chief executive reside the cabinet collectively in small groups and individually is the institution where president if so inclined can give managerial direction in the broadest sense to the executive establishment when the cabinet meets there is visible reminder that each person present is part of team and that this team is supposed to be moving in the same direction the presidents direction presidents differ on how they use this opportunity for leadership more often than not the cabinet meetings are used to send hortatory messages or to invoke acrosstheboard directives typical of the latter is where presidents instruct all secretaries to submit to the white house staff prior to the next meeting their recommendations for cutting costs within their departments experience suggests that few secretari are interested in managing their departments in any handson manner many are selected solely for political reasons and see their role in political terms in support of this view of their job secretaries have substantial political staffs and other political appointees upon whom they rely upon for policy advice and administrative loyalty79 departmental management as that term is generally understood usually falls under the purview of the deputy secretary deputy secretaries tend to view their subordinate agencies with ambivalence for those departments that are holding companies eg department of commerce for agencies with longstanding missions and independent bases of support the secretary and deputy secretary may see their internal managerial role as more that of mediator between the agencies rather than that of policy initiator political assistance arguably the most useful role of the cabinet to the president is in the political realm as noted the highest patronage the president has at his disposal are cabinet appointments in return for these appointments

agency out department eg the social security administration out of the department of health and human services harold seidman reminds us of the cabinet officers role as far as the president is concerned while the white house may not consider cabinet members participation in the development of legislative proposal essential the president will hold him to account for assuring its enactment by the congress so far as the president is concerned cabinet members primary responsibility is to mobilize support both within and outside the congress for presidential measures and to act as legislative tactician major questions of policy and legislative strategy are reserved however for decision by the white house staff80 finally presidents expect that secretaries will keep their subordinate political officers in line this is not an easy task today because there are so many subcabinet officers testifying before the myriad of congressional committees and subcommittees that the voice of the administration can sound cacophonous in sum presidents even those most critical of the institutional cabinet find ways in which it can serve their needs and thus its utility insures its continuance reforming the cabinet it is evident that the cabinet has rarely pleased those seeking greater political and managerial effectiveness for the president it has also been disappointment for many in

columbia continuedcabinet is seen by these reformers as critical element in successful institutional and philosophical transformation81 the young woodrow wilson like so many political and social activists in the postcivil war period despaired of the american government with its spoils system and looked longingly across the atlantic to the emerging parliamentary system in england where responsible parties appeared to provide the basis for clear and effective government wilson was particularly incensed at congress and its committee structure which he believed was corrupt and dominated the presidency he initially advocated fullblown parliamentary system82 in wilsons early schema the cabinet was to be selected by the president but only from representatives in congress thus members of the cabinet would not only hold executive department portfolios they would also sit in congress and answer questions regarding their policies and administra tion83 wilson believed that the dominance of congress and particularly its committees over the president and the executive branch was permanent condition and therefore constitutional amendment was necessary like many reformers then and now there was concern that the branches were too separate that they functioned at crosspurposes and indulged themselves in corrosive competition furthermore congress was seen as the captive of local parochial interests what was needed was cabinet which served as bridge between the branches as the years passed and congress changed the views of the young wilson changed as well84 he was still opposed to what he called committee government but was not as vocal in his support of drawing cabinet members from the congress when wilson assumed executive positions later on he began to see hope for leadership in the presidency85httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30673crs27 85 continued university press 1908 86 for discussion of the historical proposals and debates to assign cabinet members some role

follette and william howard taft the latter in his post presidential exegesis our chief magistrate and his powers noted i am strongly in favor of change in our existing system by which the importance and influence of cabinet officers shall be increased without any change in the constitution congress might well provide that heads of departments members of the presidents cabinet should be given access to the floor of each house to introduce measures to advocate their passage to answer questions and to enter into the debate as if they were members without of course the right to vote without any express constitutional authority congress has done this in the case of delegates from the territories why may it not do it with respect to the heads of departments87 in the 1920s warren harding and his secretary of state charles evans hughes were ardent supporters of having the cabinet sit in congress and answer questions88 there had been instances in the thenrecent past when members of the cabinet had appeared individually on the floor and the reformers saw this as salutary sign the underlying assumption behind the varied support for this idea was tremendous faith in the efficacy of debate to change rational minds for the better process leading ultimately to consensus of course both the liberals and conservatives of the period were convinced that discussion and debate would ultimately favor their views where were the opponents of the idea of having the cabinet sit in the congress given the fact that action was forthcoming on the various proposals it is reasonable to assume that the opponents were in the majority but the opponents for whatever reason rarely published their views or had access to the major newspapers or journals the reformers were never quite able to convince the majority of members of congress or presidents since warren harding of the wisdom of their proposals indeed proposals to put the cabinet in congress were increasingly viewed as either utopian naive or simply wrongheaded89httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30673crs28 90 committee on the constitutional system bicentennial analysis of the american political structure washington committee on the

however that reformers have given up the struggle in addition to the lingering appeal of parliamentary government over presidential government in recent years the impetus for much reform activity has been the spectre and practice of divided government term referring to those periods when the white house is occupied by one political party and one or both houses of congress are dominated by the other todays reformers still tend to place faith in the related proposals to have cabinet members sit in congress or to have members of congress simultaneously hold executive branch offices but see these proposals as simply one small part of major constitutional reorganization of the national political system90 for the most part reformers such as james macgregor burns91 lloyd cutler92 and james sundquist are generally considered to be liberal in their political orientation and believe that the natural majority consensus behind their political views is frustrated by antiquated and antimajoritarian institutions93 they generally favor presidency that is dominant over congress and see the cabinet as an instrument towards this end second set of reformers also has long history of offering unrealized recommendations on how to make the cabinet more effective for the president they want the cabinet to undergo alteration but are less comprehensive in their vision their proposals stress modification and changes in emphasis to increase the policy advising role of the cabinet earlier proposals to alter the cabinet eg nixons 1973 proposal to create three super counselors or super cabinet members have been discussed in other contexts cabinet reorganization proposals tend either to emphasize altered use of existing departmental secretaries or recommend rather different cast of

praeger 1980 p 120 95 elliot l richardson and james p pfiffner our cabinet system is charade new york times may 28 1989 p e14a typical proposal is that of graham allison in 1980 who called for presidential executive cabinet excab presidents need stronger and more responsive performance from key cabinet departments strength and responsiveness are not easy to combine but making key cabinet officers the primary substantive counselors to the president and insuring steady facetoface relations between them and the president will tend to induce both the recognized participation of secretaries in presidential decisionmaking would also sensitize them to presidential perspectives and to interests other than those of their own departments94 the excab would consist of key secretaries such as state defense treasury and health and human services plus rotating mix of other cabinet officers agency heads and white house staff the point would be that those permanent excab members would have offices in the white house and develop permanent staff in this way allison believes the president would acquire collective advisory body with knowledge and political clout critics suggest on the other hand that departmental secretary physically removed from his or her department will tend to lose whatever uniqueness of perspect ive that made the secretary seem valuable in the first place spending substanti time in the white house it is feared will transform the secretaries into adjuncts of the white house staff among the more recent reform proposals for the cabinet is that offered by threetime cabinet member the late elliot richardson richardson proposed that the cabinet be radically reconstituted to include those positions with crosscutting responsibilities rather than operating responsibilities for departments he suggested that the cabinet should consist of the presidents chief of staff the director of omb the national security advisor the us trade representative plus some advisers on economic domestic policy and science this inner circle augmented by the three department heads whose spheres of responsibility are most inclusivethe secretaries of state defense and treasurywould constitute wellbalanced policy council95 there is reason to believe that the reformers will cease in their quest for the holy grail cabinet that wisely advises receptive president there is also reason to believe that presidents will suddenly find the cabinet however it may be organized to be useful collective source for policy advice concluding comments the presidents cabinet in the american political context is the source of considerable debate and frustration few are satisfied with the cabinet as an institution particularly critical are those who have served in the cabinet presidents seek to find uses for their cabinetas collectivity in subcabinet groups and individuallybut generally retreat from this quest as experience overshadows hopehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30673crs30 rather than succumb to the subtle political agenda of reformers with their penchant for institutional tinkering defenders argue that the cabinet should be appreciated for its flexibility and nuances they believe that the cabinet under the right conditions can be source of political and managerial strength to the president even compensati ng on occasion for presidential weakness under other circumstances however it can become political negative as when presidents are forced to fire some departmental secretary or find the person facesaving job the critical point is however that while the cabinet may be useful to the president the cabinet itself never governs the president remains the critical center of the executive establishment informed persons may debate endlessly respecting the characteristics of best cabinet and staff system for supporting the president in his decisionmaking capacity should presidents for instance appoint chief of staff to run the white house staff or should they rely on several coequal assistants to manage their office staff and resources the truth is that there is single or accepted theoretical model to which presidents can repair structure and systems are ultimately substitute for coherent ideas and presentations and for access to the president certain secretaries as well as certain staff aides will always be more equal than others it is an unavoidable responsibility for presidents to determine their own personal needs and managerial style and to shape their office and their cabinet accordingly final comment that may help to explain the ambiguous and controversial nature of the cabinet the president of the united states is both the head of state and the head of governmenttwo responsi bilities almost invariably split between two persons in parliamentary system if the president were only the head of government and if governments could fall without affecting the incumbency of the head of state the cabinet might be assigned and fill more collective responsibility presidents cannot however share their power officially or they place at risk their prestige and authority as chief of state the symbol of national sovereignty thus proposals to modify strengthen or collectivize the cabinet that neglect to take into consideration the inherent dual nature of the presidency are bound to be deficient the experience of recent presidents illustrates both the potential and limitations of the institutional cabinet as collective body the cabinet is but one of the institutional resources available to the president for advice and administrative leadership of the executive establishment the range of attitudes toward the cabinet evidenced by recent presidents suggests that the life of the institutional cabinet shall continue to be uneven and unpredictable however few institutions in the world have longer uninterrupted history than the american presidents cabinet which should suggest to the inquiring observer that there must be some intrinsic and deepseated value to the cabinet and that in its very adaptability and unthreatening nature to succeeding presidents lies its strength
