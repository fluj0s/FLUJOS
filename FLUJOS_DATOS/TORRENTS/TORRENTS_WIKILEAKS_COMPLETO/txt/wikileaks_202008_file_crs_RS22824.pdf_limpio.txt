recent months seve ral other factors including reluctance of traditional exporters to make further supplies available to international markets strong international demand the ra pid growth in the demand for grains and oilseeds as feedstock for biofuels production and usda s announcement that last falls winter wheat plantings were less than expected have contributed to sharp rise in cash and futures contract prices particularly for higherprotein wheat varieties this report will be updated as events warrant background wheat is grown in almost every temperate zone country of north america europe asia and south america the largest wheatproducing count ries are china india the united states russia canada and austra lia us wheat production accounts for about 910 of world production but the united st ates is the worlds leading wheat exporter with roughly 25 share of annual world trad however the international wheat market is very competitive and foreign sales often hinge on wheat

to its nearby supply will determine local prices traditional higherprotein wheats command premium over lowerprotein varieties often referred to as the protein premium figure 1 however linkages to national and global markets bring additional factors such as transportation costs competitors supplies and foreign dema nd into play in determining the price of particular wheat type and quality wheat is the principal food grain grown in the united states however substantial portion 810 of the annual us wheat crop is used as feed grain as result wheat must compete with other cereals for place at the consumers dinner table while also vying with coarse grains and other feedstuffs in livestock feed markets almost half of the us wheat crop is exported annually although the importance of exports varies by class of wheat white wheat and hrs wheat rely more than other wheat classes on sales into export markets the larger the share of exports to production the greater the vulnerability to

former soviet union drought in southeastern europe redu ced that areas wheat and corn crops forcing livestock producers in the european union eu to import wheat and feed grains for feed rations by midsummer it became apparent that canada and the ukraine would reap smaller wheat crops because of poor weather conditions limited export supplies the production shortfalls curtailed exports from most traditional wheat exporters in the spring of 2007 both ukraine and argentina initiated export restrictions in efforts to control f ood price inflation the ukraine imposed ban on wheat exports and argentina stopped issuin g export registrations which significantly slowed export sales during the rest of the ear although the eu was able to export wheat without export subsidies shipments out of the eu slowed sharply by late summer as wheat increasingly replaced corn used for feed by early fall only the united states russia and kazakhstan had large volumes of wheat available for export recently kazakhstan officials have said that they also intend on slowing their countrys wheat export pace via higher custom du ties due to declining supplies5 strong international demand projected tight us supplies combined with reduced export competition caused importers to buy us wheat in late 2007 at pace not seen since the 1970s us wheat export sale s were very strong despite higher prices and recordhigh ocean freight rates imports by highincome countries which are not very price sensitive followed normal seasonal purchase patterns however number of low and middleincome countries generally expect ed to be more sensitive to price changes continued to purchase wheat ev while prices were rising some importers even bought larger amounts at record high prices apparently out of fear that less wheat would be available in the future and prices would be even higher in most years us wheat export shipments decline seasonally during the wint er spring and summer months but in 2007 shipments generally rose durin g this period significantly exceeding expectations almost every month in august and september u s wheat export volume spiked rising from monthly averages of less than 25 million metr ic tons to more than 4 million tons this occurred as wheat prices climbed to record highs record high outstanding export sales ie wheat that has been purchased but not yet exported suggest that many importers have already purchased their future needs far in advance of nor mal purchasing patterns and that large monthly us wheat shipments can be expected to continue for some months to come regardless of future price movementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22824crs4 6 wasde usda world agricultural ou tlook board february 8 2008 7 winter wheat seedings national agricultural

runup at the mge outlook nearterm outlook9 h i g h commodity prices are expected to encourage farmers to expand plantings this spring however since the land base is constant the question is which crops will get more area and which will lose for 2008 us da projects that us planted acreage will expand significantly for both wheat up 6 and soybeans up nearly 12 while corn plantings will decline slightly by about 4 as result assuming normal weather and average yields us wheat pr oduction is expected to rise by nearly 13 in addition usda projects that global wheat plantings nd output will rise substantially although official estimate for 2008 global production is released until may larger global wheat supplies are expected to significantly reduce international demand for us wheat in the latter half of 2008 thus the combination of higher production and lower exports is expected to allow us domestic wheat stocks to rebuild and wheat prices to decline from their early 2007 peaks while remaining high re lative to past years markets are likely to exhibit substantial price variability until global stock levels can be rebuilt longterm outlook10 as the global supply rebounds from the shortfalls of 2007 higher projected production is ex pected to facilitate the rebuild ing of stocks and the return of prices to the 4 to 5 per bushel rang over the next five to tenyear period food price effects domestic food price inflation the rise in agricultural prices combined with high oil prices have contributed to higher food inflation in the united states and around the world us food

charles hanrahanmonth of january 2008 the biggest monthly increase in three years12 despite the sharp increases in commodity prices in 2007 most ec onomists agree that fu costs have played larger role in food price infla tion than have commodity prices13 in general retail food prices are much less volatile than farmlevel prices and tend to rise by fraction of the change in farm prices this is because th actual farm product represents only small share of the eventual retail price wher eas transportation processing packaging advertising handling and othe r costs all vulnerable to hi gher fuel prices comprise the majority of the final sales price international food prices and aid due to trade linkages high commodity prices ripple through international market s where impacts vary widely based on grain import dependence and the ability to respond to higher commodity prices import dependent developing country markets are put at greater food secur ity risk due to the higher cost of imported commodities the overall impact to consumers from high er food prices depends on the proportion of income that is spent on food since f ood costs represent relatively small share of consumer spending for most us house holds about 10 f ood price in creases from whatever source are absorbed relatively easily in the shor t run however lowincome consumers spend much greater proportion of their income on food than do highincome consumers their larger share combined with less flexibility to adjust expenditures in other budget areas means that an increase in food prices pote ntially could cause hardship in particular lowerincome hous eholds in many foreign ma rkets where food imports are an important share of nationa l consumption and where food expenses represent larger portion of the household budget may be affected by higher food prices14 humanitarian groups have expressed concern for the potentia l difficulties that higher grain prices imply for developing countries th at are net food importers15 international food aid is the united st ates major response to reducing global hunger16 because most us food aid activ ities are fixed in value by annual appropriations the amount of commodities that can be purchased declines with rising food prices in 2006 the united states provi ded 21 billion of such assistance which paid for the delivery and distribution of more than 3 million metric tons of us agricultural commodities the united states provided food aid to 65 countries in 2006 more than half of them in subsaharan africa
