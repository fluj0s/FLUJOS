message to the congress proposing establishment of legal services corporation may 5 1971 httpwwwpresidencyucsbeduwsprintphppid2998 crs2 program mechanics the lsc does not provide legal services directly rather it funds local legal services providers referred to by the lsc as grantees grantees may include nonprofit organizations that have as purpose the provision of legal assistance to eligible clients private attorneys groups of private attorneys or law firms state or local governments and certain substate regional planning and coordination agencies during 2007 the lsc funded 138 local programs in 923 offices employing about 3900 attorneys these numbers are reduced from 1994 when 320 local programs employed about 4500 attorneys each local program is governed by its own board of directors of which majority are attorneys and onethird are eligible clients local programs establish their own eligibility criteria under which clients household income may not exceed 125 of the federal poverty guidelines2 each local program must spend an amount equal to at least 125 of its basic grant to encourage private attorneys to provide pro bono legal aid to the poor since april 1996 pl 104134 lsc grantees ie legal services agenciesprovidersprograms have been selected on competitive basis3 under the lscs competitive process legal services providers in every jurisdiction bid to become the lsc grantee for designated service area in state pursuant to its 1998 state planning initiative the lsc has sought to streamline its delivery system during the competition process the lsc evaluates applications according to established quality standards and awards grants to those providers judged best qualified to provide highquality legal services in accordance with applicable legal requirements federal regulations title 45 cfr part 1634 stipulate the procedures to be followed in awarding lsc grants grants are made for one to three years multiyear awardees must submit reports and grant renewal forms as part of the annual grant renewal process before the implementation of the 1998 state planning initiative lsc grantees often were unaware of other lsc grantees in the state work and training collaborations and other cooperative endeavors were rare among lsc grantees in the same state and practically nonexistent among lsc grantees in other states further most legal services programs only had superficial relationships and minimal contact with law firms and local judges in anticipation of reduced federal funding the lsc first encouraged and later directed grantees to form partnerships with the judiciary private bar associations and with each other the 1998 state planning initiative was the means by which the lsc sought to ensure that lsc funds were efficiently and effectively used to provide legal services to poor persons in all areas of the states and 2 in 2007 125 of the federal poverty guidelines was 25813 for household of four higher in alaska and hawaii 3 this system supplanted the previous system of presumptive refunding for lsc grantees the lsc is prohibited from granting any preference to current or previous grantees of lsc funds section 503e of pl 104134 enacted april 26 1996 crs3 jurisdictions pursuant to the 1998 initiative the lsc made participation in statewide civil legal services delivery systems condition of receipt of lsc funding4 it is generally agreed that poor persons in need of legal assistance have benefitted from the lscs statewide delivery system approach the lsc has done this by requiring federally funded legal services providers to coordinate their work with other persons and organizations within state including groups historically considered funding competitors other nonprofit organizations and nonlsc legal services programs or unlikely partners judges legislators bar leaders5 restrictions on activities since its inception the legal services program has been controversial and congress has imposed restrictions on activities of local attorneys the authorizing statute contains restrictions against lobbying political activities class actions except under certain conditions and cases involving abortion school desegregation and draft registration or desertion from the military additional restrictions have been included in appropriations laws each year under the current appropriations law lsc grantees may not engage in partisan litigation related to redistricting attempt to influence regulatory legislative or adjudicative action at the federal state or local level attempt to influence oversight proceedings of the lsc initiate or participate in any class action suit represent certain categories of aliens except that both lsc and non lsc funds may be used to represent aliens who have been victims of domestic violence or child abuse conduct advocacy training on public policy issue or encourage political activities strikes or demonstrations claim or collect attorneys fees engage in litigation related to abortion represent clients in eviction proceedings if the eviction was based on drugrelated activities represent federal state or local prisoners participate in efforts to reform

prohibits the lsc from receiving nonfederal funds and grantees are prohibited from receiving nonlsc funds unless the source of funds is told in writing that these funds may not be used for any activities prohibited by the lsc act or the appropriations law clients and cases legal services provided through lsc funds are available only in civil matters to individuals with household incomes of

13 were native american 23 asian or pacific islander 24 age 60 or older and 2 were under age 18 other 34 in 2005 lsc staff were directed by the lsc to document the extent to which the civil legal needs of lowincome persons were not being met based on three methodologies the lsc found that 1 50 of potential clients requesting legal assistance were denied assistance because the lsc did not have the resources to help them 2 eight of nine state studies conducted in the last five years indicated that at least 80 of persons who were eligible for lsc services do not have access to such services when they need them and 3 there is one legal services attorney for every 6861 lowincome persons the comparable number for the general population is one attorney for every 525 persons difference of 13

httpwwwlscgovpressdocumentslscjusticegap_final_1001pdf crs6 funding history when the lsc was first established its initial goal was to provide all low income people with at least minimum access to legal services defined as the equivalent of one legal services attorney for every 5000 poor persons this goal was briefly achieved in fy1980 but not maintained due to inflation and subsequent budget cuts for example in fy2004 the lsc estimated an appropriation of 683 million would have been needed for minimum access however the lsc received 335 million in appropriations that year according to 2005 lsc study cited above there is one legal services attorney for every 6861 poor persons funds for the lsc are included in the annual appropriation for science the departments of state justice and commerce and related agencies house and commerce justice science and related agencies senate table 1 shows lsc appropriations for selected years from fy1976 the first full year of lsc operations to

service fy1996 from its inception through fy1995 lsc appropriations gradually increased however for fy1996 congress funded the lsc at 278 million for reduction of almost 31 from the previous year in its fy1996 budget resolution the house assumed threeyear phaseout of the lsc recommending appropriations of 278 million in fy1996 141 million in fy1997 and elimination by fy1998 the house budget committee stated in its report hrept 104120 too often lawyers funded through federal lsc grants have focused on political causes and class action lawsuits rather than helping poor americans solve their legal problems phase out of federal funding for the lsc will not eliminate free legal aid to the poor state and local governments bar associations and other organizations already provide substantial legal aid to the poor crs7 the fy1996 appropriation for the lsc entirely eliminated funding for supplemental legal assistance programs including native american and migrant farm worker support national and state support centers regional training centers and other national activities fy1997fy2001 the phaseout of the lsc envisioned by the house budget resolution did not occur instead
