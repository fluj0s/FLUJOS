eligibility for the aged and disabled summary medicaid is meanstested federalst ate matching program that provides medical assistance for persons who are unable to afford needed medical and health related services since the programs establishment in 1965 it has become the largest single source of financing both private and public for longterm care for those elderly and disabled who are lowin come or who have depleted their income and assets on medical and longterm care ex penses in order to be eligible for medicaid individuals must meet certain eligibility criteria these criteria are determined by broad federa l requirements and state deci sions about whom they want to cover under their medicaid programs the financial eligibility st andards that states do use are shaped in large part by estimates of spending that will occur with these standards the elderly and disabled are the most expens ive groups that are covered under medicaid largely because medicai d covers nursing home and other institutional longterm care and b ecause this care is expensive eligibility for the programs benefits has traditionally been linked to eligibility for cash welfare assistance that is person receivi ng welfare assistance under certain programs can also become eligible for medicaid for the elderly and disabled groups the cash welfare program linked to medicaid eligibility is the supplemental security income ssi program it provi des federal cash welfare assistance to needy aged disabled and blind individuals who have little or income and resources medicaid law generally requires that states cover persons receiving ssi medicaid however also covers elderly and disabled persons who are not poor and who may have income in excess of ssi welfare standa rds it does so through options in medicaid law that allow states to cover persons who need help with medical expenses one of these options is medically needy program by which states may cover persons regardless of income who incur medical expenses that deplete their income to levels that make them needy medicaid also allows states to use higher income standard up to 300 of basic ssi payment for those who reside in nursing homes or other medical care institutions or who are eligible for certain longterm care services offered in the community it is through these two options that medicaid ends up covering longter m care expenses for many nonpoor elderly persons to make sure that persons with income and assets exceeding the welfare standards apply their resources toward the cost of their care medicaid eligibility rules include additional provisions that impose penalties on individuals who give their assets away in order to gain medicaid ligibility sooner than they otherwise would and require states to recove r assets from beneficiarys tates up to amounts paid for longterm care services after their death medicaid eligibility rules also result in diverse disabled population receiving coverage many disabled pe rsons become eligible because they cannot work and are dependent on welfare assistance from ssi however medicaid provides incentives for other disabled persons to work and retain medicaid coverage the disabled population also includes children who need broad range of home and community based care as well as some who need nursing home care httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31413contents

medicaid is federalstate matching entitlement program that provides medical assistance for certain groups of lowin come individuals the program was established in 1965 under title xix of the so cial

and 69 million 172 qualified on the basis of disability3 although the elderly and individuals with disabilities comprise only 273 of medicaid enrollees they command dispr oportionate share of program spending in 1998 they accounted for 71 of the total medicaid spending this can be largely attributed to medicaids coverage of longt erm care benefits that provide widearray of institutional and communitybased services not generally covered or in some instances only partly covered by othe r public programs such as medicare or private insurance plans of the appr oximately 101 billion spent by medicaid on elderly and disabled individuals in 1998 mo re than 60 618 billion was for long term care of those dollars 71 442 billion was for institutional care including nursing facilities intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded and mental health facilities nd the remaining spending 29 176 billion was paid for home and communitybased services includi ng range of services

program in tended to provide assistance to persons who are unable to afford needed medical nd healthrelated services within broad federal guidelines states have flexibility to determine eligibility criteria in general the federal government mandates states to meet minimum eligibility standards but states also have great deal of flexibility in using standards that are more generous or more restrictive the financial eligibility standards that states do use are shaped in large part by estimates of spending that will occur with these standards the elderly and disabled are the most expens ive groups that are covered under medicaid in 1998 spending averaged 9058 per di sabled medicaid beneficiary and 10193 per elderly medicaid beneficiary as compared to 1442 for children under age 21 and 2292 for nondisabled adults5 eligibility for the programs benefits has traditionally been linked to eligibility for cash welfare program assistance that is person receiving welfare assistance under certain programs can also become auto matically eligible for medicaid for the elderly and disabled groups the cash welf are program linked to medicaid eligibility is the supplemental security income ssi it provides federal cash welfare assistance to needy aged disabled and blind individuals who have little or income and resources medicaid law generally requi res that states cover persons receiving ssi in addition to the ssi eligibility pathway into medicaid the statute includes other provisions that allow states to extend medicaid eligibility to other elderly and disabled individuals these individuals must also meet financial standards to become eligible financial standa rds are defined as the maximum amount of income and resources such as cars savings accounts bonds stocks and real estate an individual is allowed to have and still qualify for medicaid not only do states have flexibility within broad federal guidelines to use specific financial standards for different eligibility groups but they also have flexibility in the rules they use to define income and resources for example when counting an individuals income to dete rmine whether an individual is medicaid eligible some states may c ount all pensions social secu rity payments and annuities but disregard 20 dollars for miscellane ous costs and 200 dollars for housing expenses other states may not have such income disregards state flexibility has led to variation in income and resources requirements as well as the means by which income and resources are counted across states in general individuals in similar circumstances of need for medical or longterm care may be automatically eligible for coverage in one state but may be required to assume certain portion of their medical expenses before they can obtain coverage in second state and not eligible at ll in third state statewide variation concerning income and asse t requirements makes gene ralizations about eligibility as it applies to

given size could still not exceed 133 of the maximum payment for similar family under the states maximum afdc payment described above states could in effect enable applicants to keep more income to spend on housing food transportation etc 18 the mnil standard varies by geographic region in louisianaspenddown refers to process by wh ich persons with income above the applicable limit may reduce their income to the state limit by spending on medical care16 this process is similar to the spend down process used in 209b states for example if an individual has monthly income of 600 and the states medically needy income standard is 300 the app licant would be required to incur 300 in medical expenses ie spend down before he or she woul d be eligible for medicaid once medicaid eligibility is triggered beneficiaries must still apply their income toward the cost of their medical care the state may set its medically needy monthly income limits mnil for family of given size at any level up to 133 of the maximum payment for similar family under the states afdc program in place on july 16 199617 often these levels are lower than the income standard for ssi benefits in 11 states the spend down limits are less than 50 of the federa l poverty level fpl for an individual the spenddown limits range from 92 in louisiana18 to 708 in vermont this in effect is an income threshold for medicaid eligibility it also represents for persons living in the community the amount of m onthly income individuals may retain for their needs after incurring medical expenses that deplete their income to the state standard although there is some varia tion across states most states use the ssi resources limit of 2000 for an individual as the medically needy resources standard state monthly income and resources limits for medically needy programs are shown in table 4 note that some 209b states have medically needy programs states that choose to have medically needy eligibility pathway are required under federal law to cover at minimum certain children under age 18 and pregnant women who except for income and resource s would be eligible as categorically needy they are not however required to cover the aged blind and disabled nor to cover longterm care services under their medically needy programs but most do as of november 2000 34 states and the dist rict of columbia had medically needy

responses via email telephone and fax the medically needy pathway enable s many elderly and disabled persons needing nursing home care to qualify for dicaid at an average cost of about 56000 per year nursing home costs can quickly deplete the resour ces of an elderly individual especially after prolonged st ays states however are not required to include nursing facility care among the serv ices covered under their medically needy programs as result not all states w ith medically needy programs covering the elderly provide coverage to persons in nursing homes five among the total 34 states and the district of columbia that re ported having medica lly needy spenddown programs did not cover nursing facility services states not covering nursing facility care are arkansas florida iowa oklahoma and oregon other aspects of spenddown states use specific time period for calculating persons medical expenses ranging from 1 month to 6 months as of november 200019 the calculation becomes the basis for determining th amount of persons spenddown requirement generally shorter time period is more beneficial to the applicant for example if the state has 1 month sp enddown calculation period the individual would be required to incur 300 in medical expenses in month after which services would be covered by medicaid on the other hand if the state had 6 month calculation period the individual would ve to incur projected amount of 1800 300 times 6 in medical expenses before medicaid would begin coverage the length of the spenddown period does not significantly affect total outofpocket expenditures for persons with predictable and recurring medical expenses such as persons with chronic illnesse s or disabling conditions however individuals faced with acute nonrecurring problems generally benefit more from shorter calculation period states that do cover nursing facility care under their medically needy programs have the option of using either the medicai d or private pay eg private insurance or outofpocket nursing facility rates as standard for determining an applicants eligibility this means that states compare persons monthly income to the cost of nursing home care in that state either in terms of the total amount that would be paid by medicaid for month medi caid rate or the total amount that would be paid out ofpocket private pay rate often the medicaid monthly rates are lower than the rates paid by private insurance or outofpoc ket when the medicaid rate is lower it is harder for applicants to spenddown to the required level and thus may result in fewer applicants gaining medicaid eligibility in general if an applicants income minus the cost of the medicaid reimbursement or private pay rate whichever is used by the state exceeds the state income limit then the applicant cannot qualify for medicaid coverage of institu tional care under medically needy option states policies on using either medicaid or private pay rate are shown in table

care facility for the mentally retarded the divers ity of conditions that creates need for long term care makes designing measures to adequately and uniformly assess applicants physical cognitive and mental conditions difficult the measures used by states to determine an applicants eligibility for longterm care services vary survey of 42 states conducted by the american association of retired persons aarp in 1996 found the fo llowing three types of measures to be those most commonly used 1 states that score specific factors and require minimum score for eligibility 2 states that require minimum number of specific impairments or needs for eligibility and 3 states that use level of care definitions and guidelines to determine eligibility this study found that those states requiring minimum score and those states that c ounted number of impairments considered medical and nursing needs mental and physical impairments activities of daily living adls and instrumental activities of daily living iadls when determining an applicants eligibility24 the survey also found that those states using criteria based on definitions and guidelines to determine eligibility provided the assessor with greater amount of discretion than those applying the other two assessments in general rather than requiring an assessor to determine whether an applicant has three out of five adl impairments an assessor in state using the third approach may be required to determine whether an pplicant meets one of number of general criteria including need for nursing

ehold and only the childs ow n financial resources are considered available for care this policy had resulted in some children remaining in institutions even while their medical needs could be met at home this situation was dramatized in 1982 by the case of katie beckett child who was dependent on ventilator and was unable to go home not because of medical reasons but because she would longer have

longterm care services sooner than they w ould if they had spent their income on the cost of care such practices included 1 converting countable assets into exempt assets 2 sheltering assets in trusts annuities and other financial instruments that are deemed not available to the medicaid applicant to pay for nursing home care or 3 transferring assets through joint ba nk accounts the goal of this

or 60 months if the transfer is ma through an irrevocable trust in other words transfers are prohibited during the 3y ear or 5year period prior to application for medicaid the law also prohibits s pouses of these persons from transferring assets during this same period if the stat has determined that transfer occurred then applicants may be subject to delay in eligibility certain transfers are permitted to spouses to minor or disabled children or to trusts solely for the benefit of disabled persons under 65 the length of the period of ine ligibility for institutionalized and non institutionalized individuals is determined by dividing the total cumulative uncompensated value of all ssets transferred on or after the lookback date by the average monthly cost to private patient of nursing facility in the state or at the option of the state in the community in which the individual is institutionalized at the time of application for example transferred asset worth 60000

which the assets were transferred medicaid estate recovery congress also included other provisions in obra 93 to address concerns with estate planning since obra 93 medicaid statute has mandated ll 50

care nd seeks medicaid coverage for his care under states medically needy program fo r instance most states prior to spousal impoverishment protections considered the husbands income his for purposes of determining eligibility they also considered resources held in the husbands name as well as jointly held resources to be fully available to him and would require that these resources be spent down to the states resource standard before considering him medicaid eligible in most states this could mean that the community spouse would have been left with only 2000 in assets held for example in savings account following eligibility medicaids posteligibility rules considered the husbands income to be available for the cost of his care and allowed deduction to be made for his wifes living
