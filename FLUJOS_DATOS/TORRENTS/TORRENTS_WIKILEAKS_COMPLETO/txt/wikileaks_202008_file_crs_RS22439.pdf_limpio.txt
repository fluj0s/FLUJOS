annuity is contract made by an insurance company in exchange for sum of money to make regular payments usually monthly for the life of the annuitant annuities can be classified as follows immediate versus deferred under an immediate annuity an individual pays an insurance compan sum of money and the insurance company begins making regular monthly payments to the individual immediately under deferred annuity an individual pays the insurance company sum of money and the insurance company begins making regular monthly payments beginning at least year after purchase for example an individual at age 45 might buy 20year deferred annuity that would start making monthly payments when the individual reaches age 65 fixed versus variable fixed annuity pays flat monthly amount for the life of the annuitant whereas variable annuity pays monthly payment amount tied to the performance of an investment portfolio such as corporate stocks and bonds unde r variable annuity the annuitant bears the risk that the monthly annuity payment could go downhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22439crs2 2 susan kelly inventing the stretchable retirement dollar treasury and risk management oct 2005 3 lately deferred variable annuities have come under attack from several state insurance departments for alleged abusive sales practices such as selling annu ities with high surrender charges to individuals in their

primary annuitant and secondary annuitant typically the spouse of the primary annuitant there are other annuity variations life annuity with periodcertain makes monthly payments for the life of the annuitant or to beneficiary for the remaining specified period in the event that the annu itant dies before the end of the period beginning in 1995 some insurers have started offering hybrid type of annuity called the index annuity that combines some of the characteristics of fixed and variable annuities in an equity indexed annuity the annuity payment is based on the rate of return of stock index however there is minimum return provision often of 3 that eliminates the downside risk to the purchaser qualified annuity is one for which the source of cash is funds that have been qualified for exemption from federal income taxes until th time of purchase these could be payments from fined benefit db or define d contribution dc pension plan however few dc plan s make annuities ava ilable

individuals investing their aftertax savings to buy protection against outliving their assets to date deferred annuities sold have been mostly of the variable type typically they have been sold on the basis of their dvantages as tax shelte red investment products rather than as way to protect against outliving ones assets3 this report will focus on nonqualified immedi ate annuities increased need for annuitization on account of the shift from db pensions to dc pensions and the tendenc for retirees to take pension benefits in lump sum many retirees are facing the responsibility for maki ng

an annuity an individual can transfer the risk of managing assets to produce an adequate income stream through retirement over to the insurance company current marketplace for annuities as table 1

impaired lives under individual single premium immediate annuitiesannuity pricing the purchase price for an immediate annuity depends on the mortality assumptions used in pricing alt hough most insurers use sexdistinct mortality tables to price nonqualified imme diate annuities some states require the use of unisex mortality rates when sexdistinct rates are used the nnuity price for woman will typically be greater than the price for man at the same age because women live longer than men the annuity price will also depend on the interest rate assumed to be earned by underlying investments the interest ra used is typically the rate on longterm corporate bonds of good quality the annuity pr ice will be lower when interest rates are high in the us market the annuity price gene rally does not depend on the health of the applicant even though an individual in poor h ealth could be expected to live fewer years and therefore cost the insurer less the va st majority of immediat annuity policies are issued without underwriting the pricing of these annuities assumes that the applicants are very healthy and will live longer than the average population recently some progress has been made in the issuance of socalled impaired life annuities which are annuities sold to individuals in less than aver age health impaired life annuities were sold initially only in connection w ith structured settlements structured settlements are agreements to pay compensation in series of payments often as result of an award to an accident victim annuity prices for individuals in impaired

products many more are likely to enter the market if there is favorable legislation inflationindexed annuities an inflationindexed annuity graded annuity under which payments increase each year at th rate of inflation would likely be of interest to retirees if available at an attractive price for inflationindexed annuities to be priced attractively and for large market to develop the u s treasury may need to issue inflationindexed bonds in sufficient volume and of long enough duration this would allow an insurer that sells inflationinde xed annuities to invest underlying assets in inflationindexed treasury bonds in an inflationindexed annuity an insura nce company pays larger amounts at later durations than level payment annuity for example if the inflation rate turns out to be 3 per year an inflation indexed annuity purchased by retiree at age 65 for 1000 per month would be paying the retiree 2427 per m onth at age 95 this makes the financial risk of entire population

annuity market to develop it would be necessary for the government to issue mortality bonds to underwrite the risk of cohort of the population living much long er than expected the future coupons on mortality bond would depend on the percenta ge of population of retirement age on the issue date who are still alive on the future coupon payment dates although true inflationinde xed annuities are rare in the current marketplace there are some products that provide some infl ation protection vanguard through an arrangement with american international gr oup inc offers an annuity that provides inflation indexing up to maximum of 10 inflation7 an equity indexed annuity should provide higher return in the long run than fixed annuity because over the long run stocks can be expected to outperform bonds however stocks do not always move in tandem with inflation8 longevity insurance the deferred variable annuities sold in the past were designed to be investment vehicles rather than protection against outliving ones assets recently some insurance companies such as new york life and metlife have started offering deferred annuities designed to be true longevity insurance new york lifes core product consists of ferred annuity of the fixed payment type with payments beginning at age 759 whether an individual chooses to buy an immediate annuity or longevity insurance depends on the degree of inves tment management that the i ndividual wishes to take on an individual retiring at age 62 may decide th at he or she can have his or her assets managed to provide an income stream until age 75 and buy longevity insurance that will provide an income stream to begin at age 75 more risk averse individual might wish to buy an immediate annuity that would be gin income payments immediately at age 62 other emerging annuity products some annuity products allow an individual to buy series of deferred annuities at different points in time beginning at the retirement age this reduces the possibility of the investor investing large sum of money in what turns out to be period of hi storically low interest rates10 another product that is in the development stage is the combined annuity and longterm care product the price of combined annuity and longterm care produc t could be 35 lower than buying each product separately11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22439crs6
