specialist in science and technology knowledge services group summary methyl bromide mebr widely used pesticide in agriculture is regulated for its potential ozonedepleting effects in the earths stratosphere controls on production emissions and trade are mandated internationally under the 1987 montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer the protocol and domestically under title vi of the us clean air act ban on production for nonessential uses occurred on december 31 2004 but the protocol still regulates post2004 production for critical uses us agribusinesses have sought exemptions from the environmental protection agency epa to produce mebr for certain critical uses after the ban exemptions are resisted by some protocol parties and environmental advocates who seek rapid definitive ban on production and use chemical companies maintain that they cannot foresee development of effective chemical substitutes for all uses of mebr in the near term and agricultural producers indicate they may have to rely on less economical and less effective treatments production allowances for mebr for 20052008 have since been approved under the protocol and the epa has approved allocations for registered us users due to declining production of manufactured mebr the epa would permit commercial trade of pre2005 inventories this report will be updated as warranted introduction methyl bromide mebr plays an important role in international agriculture because of its effectiveness in killing insects and plant pathogens mebr is used extensively for preplanting and postharvest treatment of crops it also is used for quarantine and preshipping qps treatment of agricultural commodities and containers used in international importing and exporting of agricultural goods in the mid1980s group of atmospheric scientists discovered that when gaseous emissions of mebr rise into the upper atmosphere they are decomposed by sunlight bromine oxide bro powerful ozonedepleting substance ods is released as crs2 byproduct1 after bro rises to the stratosphere ozone layer between 922 miles above earths surface it is highly chemically reactive and causes the density of ambient ozone o3 to thin this thinning increases exposure to different wavelengths of ultraviolet uv radiation at the surface the ozone layer traps most harmful forms of shortwave uvb radiation from space biologists warn that exposure to uvb can be genetically damaging to life forms at the cellular level2 conversely uva radiated from the sun can penetrate the ozone layer and reach the earths surface although less harmful than uvb exposure uva can cause some forms of fatal skin cancers and blindness in humans3 mebr use and emissions as pesticide mebr is proven effective at killing molds other fungi insects and worm nematode infestations of crops in 1991 66000 metric tons mt of mebr were produced globally and predominantly for agricultural uses4 that tonnage became the baseline from which steppeddown phaseout was scheduled under the protocol and the 1990 caa amendments us production of mebr in 1991 was about 25500 mt figure 1 methyl bromide use by application and

agricultural uses typically about 80 of manufactured mebr is for fumigating soils prior to planting to prevent root damage another 20 is used as pesticide to treat postharvested commodities such as fruits vegetables dried foodstuffs stored grains cut flowers and timber it is also used in this capacity to treat wooden crates and shipping palettes and to fumigate crop storage facilities about 1 of total is used for quarantine and preshipment qps treatments in global agricultural trade the profile of emissions differs for various uses about 50 of mebr is emitted into the atmosphere during controlled preplanting applications5 postharvest and qps applications can result in up to 80 of emissions discharged if not conducted in contained environment emissions scenario contained uses may still account for 5 and 1 losses to the atmosphere respectively emissions scenario b critical use allowances cuas us agribusinesses and small farm owners alike are concerned about possible future ban of mebr production they anticipate higher costs of doing agricultural business because of diminishing supplies lack of viable or economically feasible alternatives for some uses and possible future restrictions on international trade of us agricultural products if treatment with mebr were to be prohibited in the spring of 2003 the united states was among 13 countries that petitioned the protocol parties for critical use allowances cuas to produce mebr after its post2004 ban of nonessential uses6 critical stock allowances csas csas were since approved under the protocol to supplement declining production and diminishing supplies of manufactured mebr for agricultural use the epa and similar agencies on behalf of industrialized countries petitioned protocol parties to allow trading inventories of prephaseout floor stocks of mebr only countries that are party to the protocol are permitted csas to acquire inventories from other parties with surpluses additionally parties acquiring mebr floor stocks have to remain beneath an overall annual cap that includes annual consumption ie cuas approved for new production of mebr for domestic use or mebr imported from other parties and csas the annual cap is percentage of 1991 global production approved for interested parties by the protocol on december 13 2005 the epa had issued notice of proposed rulemaking to permit trade of preexisting stocks of mebr and to allocate supplemental critical stock allowances csas7 in january 2006 the epa announced noticeandcomment period for us csas it also updated schedule of registered us

authorized epa to regulate mebr under schedule h of classi of ods in the caa and in 1993 us phaseout of mebr was scheduled under title vi protection of stratospheric ozone9 in early 2003 the agricultural community urged the epa to secure critical use exemptions cues of mebr for production in post2004 regulatory regimen they noted that this could be achieved in three ways 1 by us authority granted under the montreal protocol 2 deregulation of protocolapproved quantities by the epa and 3 congressional legislation to codify such actions in march 2003 the epa solicited comments on proposed rule to establish exemptions for farmers critical uses of mebr10 anticipating that congress might approve implementing legislation pressure was put on the epa by us and international environmental groups who sought ban on production of mebr for all us uses by december 31 2004 instead the epa filed notice of proposed rulemaking reiterating decision made at an interim meeting of protocol parties that the action sends clear market signal to us chemical industries and agribusinesses to pursue chemical substitutes or alternative treatments by 201511 in may 2003 the epa initiated nomination for critical use exemptions ncues to produce mebr after december 24 2004 it received 57 petitions from commercial growers who foresaw economically feasible substitutes or alternative treatments for certain agricultural applications in the near term the petitions were either approved returned for additional information or rejected outright the epa concluded that about 11500 mt of mebr would be needed for the 2005 growing season alone12 it submitted final ncues for 2005 and 2006 to the ozone secretariat requesting combined cuas of 17383 mt for those two years13 8 continued bromide for the

the 2005 growing season some protocol parties had challenged the epas submission for ncues because of uncertainty about future supplies of mebr for us agricultural businesses president bush and some members of congress considered withdrawal from the international treaty14 in the wake of us concerns and some compromises by dos negotiators it had appeared to some observers that the us position had gained greater support among protocol parties during negotiations for the 2006 growing season when submitting us nominations for critical use exemptions ncues for 2007 to the protocol secretariat the epa stated that future us demands for mebr would likely decline due to introduction of promising alternatives for some applications in the marketplace15 us negotiations under the montreal protocol at the 15th meeting of parties to the 1987 montreal protocol mop held in november 2003 in nairobi kenya the department of state dos had negotiated ncues approved by the epa for the 2005 2006 growing seasons to manufacture mebr for those ncues the epa recommended cuas of 39 of 1991 baseline production levels for 2005 and 37 for 2006 see table 1 below the us request was the largest among industrialized country parties16 during negotiations some delegates questioned whether for the united states what was being sought was truly essential17 decisions about final mebr production allowances for industrialized countries were deferred until the 16th mop held in prague the czech republic in november 2004 parties awaited needs analysis by the environmental program unep methyl

cuas for 2005 at 375 of 1991 tonnage level or 9562 mt this amount included supplemental cua of 25 or 638 mt and came closer to what the united states had originally sought for 2005 however us negotiators were warned that cuas could be reduced to 27 of 1991 baseline or 6900 mt for the 2006 growing season protocol parties at second meeting emop2 held in july 2005 in montreal canada approved

treaty doc 10632 decided oct 2 2002 which restricted international trade of mebr among montreal protocol parties except by exporting and importing licenses approved by protocol parties us withdrawal
