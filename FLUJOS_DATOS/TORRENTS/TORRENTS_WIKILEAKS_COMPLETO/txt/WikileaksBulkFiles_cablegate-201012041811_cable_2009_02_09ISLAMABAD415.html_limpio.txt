lahore 11 d lahore 9 2008 lahore 221 classified by charge daffaires gerald feierstein for reasons 14 b d 1 c summary and comment pakistans supreme court ruled february 25 that both nawaz and shahbaz sharif from the opposition pakistan muslim leaguen pmln party are ineligible to hold public office president zardari told charge that he had temporarily appointed ppp governor taseer as chief executive pending an election to replace shahbaz that the government would consider additional legal appeals and that he did not expect significant political fallout from the courts decision the street reaction will be in the hundreds not the millions claimed zardari nawaz and shahbaz sharif told principal officer lahore that the decision which they claimed was entirely zardaris was declaration of war they would not seek legal appeals and instead would take their battle to the streets in press conference nawaz revealed that zardari had offered to drop the case in exchange for pmln agreement to extend the tenure of the current chief justice of the supreme court he called on pakistanis to come out into the streets to protest 2 c even before the press conference there were sporadic demonstrations in punjab particularly lahore and islamabadrawalpindi we expect additional demonstrations tomorrow both embassy and consulate lahore held eac meetings and sent staff home early to avoid traffic problems following the decision pmln certainly will participate in the lawyers march planned to begin in karachi on march 12 and end on march 16 in islamabad with proposed sitin 3 c the decision comes as surprise as zardari has been telling us for weeks that he was going to move against nawaz this was controversial move within the pakistan peoples party ppp and one that pm gilani tried to forestall two days ago in talks with shahbaz that apparently were not blessed by zardari before moving zardari expanded the coalitions seats in the national assembly and worked out deals in three of four provinces to ensure the ppp will increase its seats in upcoming senate elections 4 c the ruling will open up the battle for control of the punjab provincial assembly and prompt renewed rounds of interparty negotiations if zardari is right and the street reaction remains modest we expect little real political change to emerge from this court decision if nawazs gamble pays off and he can bring significant crowds into the streets the army could possibly be called out to maintain law and order we expect renewed rush of predictions that this will prompt the army to replace zardari certainly the military will consider the court decision as unnecessary and illtimed but we still have indications the military would move to oust zardari or pave the way for pmln government with the ongoing debacle in swat and highlevel pakistani delegation in washington few will challenge the perception of the bad timing of this move it also demonstrates disappointingly that zardari continues to play politics while his country disintegrates end summary the decision 5 sbu on february 25 threejudge panel of pakistans supreme court effectively ruled that both opposition pakistan muslim leaguen pmln leaders nawaz and shahbaz sharif were disqualified from holding public office the judges issued an oral ruling from the bench dismissing all of the appeals by sharif proxies one antisharif petition was not struck down the sharifs themselves had refused to appeal the original rulings against them questioning the legitimacy of this court which took oath of office under musharrafs november 2007 provisional constitution order pco to settle ruffled political feathers when the lhc decision was announced the pakistan peoples party ppp government islamabad 00000415 002 of 004 decided to represent the sharifs in an appeal to the supreme court 6 sbu by dismissing the prosharif appeals those original adverse rulings stand attorney general latif khosa told poloff february 25 the lahore high court lhc ruled in june 2008 that nawaz was disqualified to run for national assembly seat because of his previous hijacking and corruption convictions the lhc held that nawaz had not proven the musharraf administration pardoned these convictions instead of simply commuting the prison sentence 7 c there is continuing confusion over shahbazs case the lahore elections ruling officer decided in december 2007 that shahbaz was disqualified to run for punjab provincial assembly seat because of previous loan default according to khosa todays decision automatically throws out the later decisions by the ruling officer as well as by the lahore election tribunal allowing shahbaz to run in june 2008 byelection pmln spokesman ahsan iqbal however told polcons that the disqualification was based on technical fault when shahbaz failed to announce which seat he would claim from his victories in the june byelection in any case shahbaz is disqualified from serving in the punjab provincial assembly and this is the prerequisite for being chief minister ppp reaction 8 c the decision was surprise zardari advised ambassador weeks ago that he felt he had to move to rein in nawaz ref however in phone call zardarijust back from his latest trip to chinatold charge february 25 that he had nothing to do with the decision and had been surprised by shahbazs disqualification he noted that the court had ruled against the government which had been representing the sharifs he said he had ordered ppp punjab governor taseer to temporarily take over the punjab government until new elections for chief minister could be held he expected the ppp would have candidate and thought the pakistan muslim league pml party would also be interested in running candidate 9 c asked about any further legal steps zardari indicated the government might consider going back to the lahore high court to appeal the decision he said he was not concerned about political fallout as the initial reaction had been for hundreds not millions of people in the streets interior minister malik told charge essentially the same thing and reiterated that the government had not anticipated that shahbaz would be disqualified 10 c after the ruling ag khosa today noted to poloff that the pmln could always negotiate with the ppp to amend the qualificationdisqualification provisions of pakistans constitution information minister sherry rehman told polcouns however that the decision was unsettling and the reaction would be volatile ppp parliamentarian farah ispahani zardari confidant and wife of pakistans ambassador to the us husain haqqani told polcouns february 25 that todays court decision is not the end of the story the gop might even appeal the decision note there is provision for review of supreme court decisions but only by the same bench 11 c ispahani confided that zardari would take further actions to ensure the march 1216 lawyers marchsitin would not cause problems she hinted at proposals affecting former chief justice iftikhar chaudhry and shahbaz sharif asked why zardari chose now to move on this longstalled decision ispahani said the pppled gop had choice because prime minister yousuf gilani had entered into discussions with shahbaz on february 23 we are very unhappy with the way gilani has gone off the reservation while zardari was in china she said according to unconfirmed press reports gilani had assured shahbaz that the ppp would not try to remove the sharifs from power in punjab and suggested chaudhry might lead new constitutional court proposed by the 2006 ppppmln charter of democracy ppp moves in on the punjab islamabad 00000415 003 of 004 12c despite gilanis assurance to shahbaz earlier in the week zardari is already moving in on the punjab government in addition to temporarily for two months appointing governor taseer as chief executive pending an election to replace shahbaz he has fired the punjab chief secretary and replaced him with kamran lashari longtime ppp supporter moi malik told charge that the punjab inspector general of the police technically was not fired but since he was so close to the sharifs he has voluntarily vacated the office both the chief secretary and ig police are federal appointees opposition reaction 13 c principal officer lahore met february 25 with shahbaz and nawaz sharif septel to hear their reaction the sharifs prebriefed what nawaz said in his press conference namely that they laid the decision at zardaris door and it was not in the interests of pakistans democracy as proof of zardaris complicity nawaz revealed to po and later in his press conference that zardari had offered shahbaz business deal if the pmln would agree to extend supreme court justice dogars tenure and agreed to stop attacks on the ppp then zardari would drop the supreme court cases against the sharifs 14 c shahbaz told the po that this was now war with the ppp and the pmln would take their battle directly to the streets the sharifs would not appeal the decision in musharrafs pco courts pmln would not resign from the punjab assembly and might run its own candidate for chief minister if they did pmln could succeed without the support of the pml 15 c in nawazs press conference he carefully tried to create friction against zardari on several levels he said the pmln did not blame the ppp rank and file for this decision expressed concern that it was slap in the face to punjabis and declared there was chance of rapprochement with zardari he suggested that zardari was obsessed with concern that reinstated chief justice chaudhry would declare invalid the national reconciliation order that absolved zardari of corruption charges he said it would be catastrophic if pakistanis did not take to the streets to protest this decision and he affirmed that the pmln would fully participate in the march 1216 lawyers long march 16 c pmln spokespersons ahsan iqbal and siddiqulfarooq declared we do not recognize this court iqbal went even further charging zardari with assuming the mantle of musharraf theme we expect the pmln to press in the coming days religious jamaateislami ji party leader qazi hussain disavowed the musharraf court the leader of musharrafs pakistan muslim league pml party chaudhry shujaat hussain declared the courts decision was nothing to be happy about but noted that the pml would respect the decision the pakistan institute of legislative development and transparency pildat had named an independent observer to watch the case pildat issued statement questioning whether justice had been served with this verdict public reaction 17 c the publics reaction was swift sporadic demonstrations began in lahore and other cities throughout punjab saw large crowds in lahore streets were blocked with tire fires and ppp posters were torn down po lahore reported tense mood as well as limitations on movements around the city the islamabad police briefly shut down constitution avenue around official buildings to warn against spontaneous demonstrations the capitals abpara market did attract about one thousand according to rso and the airport road was shut down by crowds tearing down ppp posters and throwing rocks as of this writing the airport road remains closed and airport operations are uncertain both embassy islamabad and consulate lahore held eac meetings and allowed staff to depart early several bar associations have islamabad 00000415 004 of 004 called for strikes and we expect additional demonstrations in the coming days us reaction 18 c zardari asked charge for readout of po lahores meeting with nawaz charge said that the po had conveyed the us position that this was an internal matter for the pakistani government in his press conference nawaz characterized the visit as courtesy call pmln spokesman ahsan warned polcouns that pakistanis would assume the us as firm supporter of zardari had supported the decision and urged that we issue statement expressing concern 19 c comment the decision comes as surprise zardari has been telling us for weeks that it was coming and that he felt he could control the reaction before making this move he coaxed the muttahida quami movement party into the coalition to renew gilanis majority in the national assembly ref b he also successfully sealed power sharing deal in three of the four provinces over seats in the upcoming senate elections ref to ensure the ppp will have majority in the senate 20 c the game now will be controlling the street and zardari has about two weeks if he is to make any repairs to reduce the impact of the march 1216 lawyers march if zardari is correct and the street reaction is muted we expect the court ruling to have immediate impact on ppp rule if nawazs gamble to provoke enough protests to require the army to come out and restore order pays off we may see different dynamic so far we still have indication the army has any interest in ousting zardari or ushering in pmln government 21 c zardari may indeed win the shortterm tactical battle against nawaz in the longer term however nawaz is playing his cards well and now has grounds to compare what he will term zardaris highhanded rule to that of musharraf many in the ppp disagreed with the decision to challenge nawaz so zardari has further alienated party faithful this decision and promises of additional deals for the former chief justice or shahbaz demonstrate disappointingly that zardari remains focused on political machinations rather than the militant threat in swat and the tribal areas feierstein
