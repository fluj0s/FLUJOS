congressional action summary administrations have peri odically asked congress to give the department of defense flexibility in allocating funds to cover the costs of military operations most recently on may 12 2004 the white house requested 25 billion as contingent emergency reserve fund for fy2005 to cover the costs of operations in iraq and afghanistan for part of the fiscal year if enacted in its current form dod could transfer funds in any amounts to individual accounts as long as the office of management and budget agreed and congress received fiveday advance notification the issue for congress is perennial one to determine how much flexibility the defense department may need to carry out military operations congress intends to support while also ensuri ng that funds are used for purposes and in amounts that congress endorses faced with the challenge of balancin g dods need for some funding flexibility for operations with congressional oversight responsibilities c ongress has responded in various ways to dod requests in gene ral congress has rejected administration requests to provide broad authority to finance military operations in advance in the runup to the first persian gulf war in 1990 for example congress rejected an administration request for blanket authority to spend money contributed by allies congress has however periodically appropriated money for ongoing or anticipated military operations into flexib transfer accounts where dod can then move funds into regular accounts to meet evolving requirements at the same time congress has generally imposed various re strictions and repor ting requirements the least restrictive requirements congre ss has imposed in recent years applied to 20 billion that congress ppropriated in the immediate af termath of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 although the administration requested similar flexibility in later supplementals congre ss gradually reverted to normal practices by limiting the amount of funding in flex ible accounts and by requiring advance notification if dod decides to spend monies in ways that diffe r from those specified in statutory or report language by the standards of earlier congressi onal action the administrations current request for contingency reserve woul d allow the defense department broad flexibility comparable to that granted by congress immediately after september 11 in congressional action on the fy2005 dod authorization hr 4200 and s 2400 and appropriations bills hr 4613 both houses limited dods flexibility by allocating most of the 25 billion

operations in iraq and afghanistan precedents options and congressional action balancing flexibility with oversight administrations have freque ntly asked congress to give the department of defense flexibility in allocating funds to cover costs of military operations most recently on may 12 2004 the white house requested 25 billion in contingent emergency reserve fund for fy2005 to c over costs of operations in iraq and afghanistan during part of the fiscal ear although the reque st sets illustrative ceilings by appropriation acc ounts within the total as written dod could transfer the 25 billion for dods expenses for iraq and afghanistan to any appropriation account and in any amount after notifying cong ress five days in advance the issue for congress is to determine how much flexibility the defense department may need to carry out operations congress intends to support while also ensuring that funds are used in amounts and for purpos that congress has approved faced with the challenge of balancin g dods need for flexibility to respond to the uncertainties of military operations with congressiona l oversight responsibilities congress has responded to s imilar requests for dod in different ways in recent years before the september 11 2001 terro rist attacks congress generally balked at proposals to provide blanket authority for the defense department to finance military operations without specific adva nce congressional approval since 911 however congress has been more willing to provide the administration with considerable flexibility to allocate funds for the global war on terrorism without detailed congressiona l oversight since then congre ss has continued to provide the administration with funding flexibility but it has gradually pared back the amount of funding placed in flexible accounts and it has also imposed variety of reporting requirements this report 1 briefly reviews the administrations request for flexibility in the 25 billion contingent emergency reserv fund that it has requested for fy2005 2 discusses options congress has to provide flexible funding for military operations based on precedents discussed in more detail

congressional responses to administration requests for funding flexibility from the first persian gulf war in 1990 through post911 wartime appropriations to date and 5 analyzes congressional action and current issues although congress has provided most of the dod funding requested by the administration for the global war on rrorism congress has not provided most of that funding in flexible accounts desp ite administration requests of the 173 billion that the administration has requested for iraq afghanistan and enhanced security for defense installations since the 911 terrorist attacks the administration requested 104 billion in flexible funds and the remaining 69 billion in regular appropriation accounts in response c ongress appropriated total of about 165 billion including 40 billion in flexible accounts and 124 billion in regular accounts see appendix the current request for 25 billion in flexible account is larger than any amount that dod has received thus far since 1990 dod has received between 2 billion and 14 billion in monies in any individual bill that can be moved after enactment for war and warrela ted funding with the remainder of the funding placed in regular appropriation accounts1 in the most recent fy2004 emergency supplemental congress provided 2 billion in flexible funding requested by dod or about 3 of the total in the bill see appendix appendix

house sent congress an amendment to its fy2005 budget request asking congress to appropr iate 25 billion as contingent emergency funds in the iraq freedom fund iff tr ansfer account that congress established in the fy2003 emergency supplemental to be available until expended see text in next section2 within the total in the iff the administration proposed the following illustrative ceilings by appropriation account 14 billion for operation nd maintenance army 1 billion for operation and maintenance navy 2 billion for operation and maintenance marine corps 1 billion for operation and maintenance air force 2 billion for operation and maintenance defensewide and 5 billion for other appropriati ons or dod funds or classified programs after consultation with the director of the office of management and budget omb however the secretary of defense could transfer funds to other accounts or to classified programs as long as th defense authorizing and appropriations committees were notified five days in advance if enacted this language would give the secretary of defense complete discretion to transfer 25 billion among appropriation accounts to fund operations in iraq and afghanistan or related activities alt hough the language sets illustrative ceilings by appropriations account within the 25 billion total the secretary of defense could alter those ceilings with the approval of omb and five days after notifying the defense committees the language also provides that up to 5 billion of appropriations could be transferred to any appropr iation account or classified activity presumably including intelligence agencies the language also permits the secretary of defense to transfer any funds not needed back to the iff to be available for subsequent retransfer there is time limit on the availability of the funds once transferred funds would be available for the same purposes and for the same periods of time as the accounts to which they were transferred and these transfers would not count against dod s overall annual limits on general transfer authority standard language for transf er accounts the request requires the white house to submit an official budget request to congress for the funds and designate the funds as emergency other than the fi veday notification to congressional defense committees before transferring funds reports to congress are required either before or after transfers take place see be low the administration does not plan to submit any justification materials for the 25 billion until that official budget request is

congressional concerns before submission of the request congre ssional concerns about funding for iraq and afghanistan centered on dods initial plan to wait until january 2005 to submit supplemental request and rely on peace time funding to finance or cash flow occupation costs for the first six months of fy2005 during hearings members have also asked about the full amount of funding likely to be needed in fy2005 while submission of the amendment res ponds to that initial concern members have continued to ask about the total funding likely to be needed in fy2005 in its transmittal letter the administration states that the contingent emergency reserve fund is requested at time when we do not know the precise costs for operations next year but that developments on the gr ound in iraq

for 25 billion to ensure theres disruption in the resources for the troops6 in hearing on may 13 2004 about the reque st itself both majority and minority members of the senate armed services committee voiced considerable concern about the amount of discretion in the request some legislators characterized it as blank check7 in response to questions from members deputy director of omb joel kaplan stated that the intent of the request was to identify those areas where we think therell be the greatest pressure point s in particular the army om operation nd maintenance accounts but he acknowledged that the language of the request was also desi gned to make sure that commanders and the secretary and the president have the flexibility after notification to the congress to direct those resources to the needs and the requirements8 in recent months congressional concern about flexible funding available to dod for war and occupationrelated funding has mounted such concerns have grown with allegations of abuses in larg support contracts and recent allegation by author bob woodward that the administra tion spent funds appropriated in 2001 and 2002 for afghanistan to prepare for the war in iraq9 administration spokesman deputy secretary of defense wolfowitz nied the charge saying that the funds were to strengthen our us capabilities in the region rather than strictly to prepare for war with iraq10 members have also stioned dods spending priorities for war and occupation spending because of initial s hortages of force protection equipment particularly body armor for

sometimes required advance notification for transfers ranging from 5 days to 15 days for fundi ng in regular accounts congress generally requires that dod follow standard repr ogramming practices under which dod must receive prior approval for transf ers above specified thresholds based on precedents since 1990 and going from least restrictive to most restrictive congress could apply the following options to the fy2005 25 billion budget amendment for iraq that is currently under consideration option 1 provide extensive flexibility as after 911 this option parallels the provisions governing the in itial 20 billion provided in the emergency terrorism response supplemental passe d on september 18 2001 in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist ttacks pl 10738 that m easure required only that the president consult with the chairmen and ranking minority members of the appropriations committees befo re transferring funds that 10 billion of the amount could not be transferred until 15 days after notifying the appropriations committees and that the office of management and budget omb report on funding allocations quarterly to the appropriations committees option 2 split funding between transfer account and regular appropriations with br ief notification period this approach was followed with some variations in the fy2003 ir aq emergency supplemental pl 10811httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32422crs15 and in the main appropriation of supplemental funding for the first gulf war pl 10228 both measures provided funding in regular appropriations accounts for those expenses that could be predicte d but provided relatively large amounts 100 billion to 110 billion in the fy2003 supplemental and 8 billion in the fy1991 desert storm supplemental in flexible transfer account for less predictable expenses both also required 5 or 7da advance notification to the congressional defense committees for transfers from the fl exible account and quarterly afterthefact reporting to the four defense committees option 3 put most funds in re gular accounts with longer notification and more extensive reporting this approach parallels some features of the persian gulf conflict supplemental authoriz ation and personnel benefits act of fy1991 pl 10225 and the fy2004 emergency supplemental pl 108106 the fy2004 supplemental provided just 2 billion of the 65 billion for the defense department in flexible transfer account with the remainder in regular appropriations account s both measures on the first persian gulf war required extensive reports on strategy force levels time lines and monthly reporting on transfers and allied contri butions recent supplementa ls have required quarterly reporting to the four congressional defense committees option 4 provide all funds in regular accounts with some flexibility longer notification nd require planning assumptions congress could provide additi onal general transfer authority and could create special higher reprogramming thresholds that w ould allow dod to make changes to funding after enactment more easily funding cat egories could reflect current reporting on the costs of iraq afghanistan and enha nced security for defense installations operation noble eagle this also refl ects some features of the fy2004 emergency supplemental pl 108106 which provided most funds in re gular appropriations accounts and provided 3 billion in general transfer authority legislative measures for the first gulf war and recent legislation on contingencies required that dod provide its planning assump tions reporting could be provi ded to the congress as whole option 5 provide all funds in regular accounts with some flexibility require longer notificat ion planning assumptions and

restrictive because the thresholds apply to individual line items or program elemen ts that are defined very narrowly both in department of defens budget justification mate rial and in congressional

each of which includes billions of dollars operating forces mobilization training and recruiting and administrative and servicewide44 within these limits the services have di scretion to move f unds

level alternative thresholds for warrelated reprogramming in order to give dod greater flexibility to adjust appropriations in response to changing circumstances congress could choose to establish new reprogramming rules specifically for war and warrelated spending for ex ample the criteria for war related spending could requir that funding must be dir ectly related to combat or occupation costs be

be more problematic49 while transfer accounts have th advantage that dod can respond to unanticipated changes in circumstances they may have the disadvantage that congress may be unaware of or disapprove of particular uses of the funds provided in the accounts for example controve rsy recently erupted when investigative reporter bob woodward alleged that dod used funds provided in the first

billion appropriated to the derf from the second 20 billion congress required in statutory language that dod provide congress with report specifying the projects and accounts to whic h funds provided

other activities due to individual and unit activations or deployments in the war on terrorism83 again although dod provided periodic re porting dod did not submit any prior approval reprogramming reque sts because funds were transferred between dod accounts congressional dissatisfaction with dod reporting although dod did give periodic briefings to the appropriations committees using the ten broad functional categories adopted immediately after the terrori st attacks considerable dissatisfaction was voiced about the quality of dods reporting in the house report issued in november 2001 two months afte r the terrorist attacks dod reporting was characterized as at best intermittent and scattershot and both the house report and the conference report called on dod to return to reliance on trad itional appropriation accounts in future requests and provide similarly conf igured deta iled supporting materials in order to ensure proper prog ram review fiscal discipline and controls and oversight by both the executive and legislative branches84 although dods decision to spend funds directly from the derf and use ten new functional categories was an untraditi onal approach it may have also given dod more visibility on war nd warrelated funds than is the case when dod uses traditional appropriation accounts in th at traditional approach the services sometimes have difficulty in segregating peacetime from war time costs making it all the more difficult to see trends in ither peacetime or wa rtime costs over time assessing dod spending for war and ccupationrelated sp ending has also become problematic not only because of inconsistent reporting categories but also because dod has not provided information on the its planning factors for this spending for example operating
