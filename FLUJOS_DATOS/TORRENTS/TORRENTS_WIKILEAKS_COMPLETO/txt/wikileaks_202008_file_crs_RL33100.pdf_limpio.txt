walshhealey act of 1936 and the mcnamaraohara service contract act of 1965 enacted in 1931 davisbacon requires inter alia that not less than the locally prevailing wage be paid to workers engaged in federal contract construction the act does not deal directly with non federal construction in addition to the act per the prevailing wage principle has been incorporated within series of federal program statutes through the years and many states have enacted little davisbacon acts of their own the act of 1931 as amended provides th at the president may suspend the provisions of this subchapter during na tional emergency with slight variation that provision has been part of the statute since it was enacted the act has been suspended explicitly on four separate occasions in 1934 president franklin roosevelt suspended the act in what appears to have been for administrative convenience associated with ne w deal legislation it was restored to full strength in less than 30 days with few people seemingly aware of the suspension b in 1971 president richar d nixon suspended the act as part of campaign intended to quell inflationary pressures that affected the construction industry in just over four weeks the act was reinstated the president moving on to different approaches to the problem c in 1992 in the wake of hurricanes andrew and iniki president george h w bush suspended the act in order to render reconstruction and cleanup in florida and the gulf coast and in hawaii more efficient the impact of the suspension is unclear for the act was suspended on october 14 1992 just days prior to the 1992 election president william clinton restored the act on march 6 1993 and d on september 8 2005 president george w bush suspended the act in order to re nder more efficient r econstruction and clean up of florida and the gulf coast in the wake of hurricane katrina the act was reinstated on november 8 2005 in the suspensions of 1934 and 1971 th suspension applied to the entire country possibly with the understanding that it would be restored once the immediate emergency was over in 1992 and in 2005 only portions of the country were involved in 1992 it remains unclear how long the suspension might have lasted if george h w bush had been reelected similarly the suspension under george w bush was intended to be openended ie until otherwise provided but in fact it lasted for about two months the suspensions are also separated by the definition of national emergency used to invoke them administrative convenience in 1934 inflationary pressures in the construction industry in 1971 and issues associated with hurricane damages in 1992 and in 2005 this report reviews the several cases during which the davisbacon act was suspended and will likely

months prior to reinstatement this report reviews the several instances in which the davisbacon act was suspende d and in some measure di scusses their implications1 the davisbacon act the davisbacon act of 1931 as amended requires inter alia that construction contracts ente red into by the federal government specify minimum wages to be paid to the various classes of laborers employed under those contracts2 minimum wages are defined as those determined by the secretary of labor to be prevailing b in the locality of the project c for similar crafts and skills d on comparable construction work the c oncept of wage was expanded in 1964 to include fringe benefit component the act has coverage threshold of 2000 and above in addition to direct federal construction contracts the davisbacon prevailing wage principle has been written into series of federal program statutes the act is supplemented by the 1934 copeland anti kickback act which requires weekly reporting of wages actually paid and an affirmation from employers that any deductions from wages due to employees have been proper and by federal overtime pay and health and safety standards statues further some states have enacted little davisbacon acts within their respective jurisdictions the issues surrounding the act have chan ged little through the years does the act protect workers help stabilize the c onstruction industry nd serve the federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33100crs2 3 alongside the davisbacon act are two other statutes governing labor standards on federal contracts the walshhealey act 1936 41 usc 3545 dealing with goods made under contract for the federal government and the mcnamaraohara act 1965 41 usc 351 358 otherwise known as the service ct act which deals with contracts for services entered into by the federal governmentcontracting community or is it antico mpetitive preventing flexible workforce utilization has it been administered effectively and if not can it be administered in an equitable fashion is there sufficient objective information concerning the act to allow for fair assessment of the statute and its impact the davisbacon act is federal statute it does not have any direct impact upon nonfederal constructi on or wage rates in so far as it ensures that persons employed on federal contract work receive not less than the prevailing wage the act could have ripple effect upon nonfede ral construction ndor other work3 is the davisbacon wage union wage and does the act mandate that union wages be paid on fede ral contract construction project s it may be union wage where the union rate is determined to be the locally prevailing wage but it need not be the union rate it depends upon the rate that the depa rtment of labor dol finds to be prevailing in an area if the union rate prevails then the union rate becomes the davisbacon wage if another rate nonunion wage prevails then that rate becomes the davisbacon rate great deal depends upon the processes and procedures of the department of labor which administers the act does the davisbacon act inflate the cost of federal contracts theoretically it should not the department of labor reviews the conditions under which public federal construction occurs determines the locally prevailing wage and then applies that wage to federal projects but the davisbacon rate need not be the actual rate paid since the market may require hi gher rate in order to recruit employees thus the davisbacon wage may be floor and not necessarily the wage paid what is meant by locality traditionally the depa rtment observes the wage rates paid on several classes of constructi on ie residential public buildings highways and heavy construction for each jurisdiction normally county unit across the united states it is usually upon that unit that locality is based perhaps the most frequently asked ques tion concerning the davisbacon act is the following how much money could we save the taxpayer and the government contractor if the davisbacon act were re pealed or modified to narrow its scope many have claimed to have an answer but there is little empirical evidence available the short answer would seem to be that one really knows does the davisbacon act in fact save money for the federal construction consumer it may but that question is similarly open after nearly threequarters of century why is the literature on davisbacon of such dubious value first given the numbe r of projects covered by the act and their diversity it is nearly impossible for an independent scholar to review the acts administration and to assess its impact second there is the availability of basichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33100crs3 4 there is an extensive literature on the davisbacon act pro and see crs report 94 908 davisbacon the act and the literature by william g whittakerdocumentation how much information s actually been preserved third assuming that the data are available securing such documentation and access to administrative personnel may be problematic if one assumes that documentation exists that the analyst is granted access to it that all of the parties ar cooperative and that the mean s financial and other are available for such an undertak ing the analyst is left with fourth complication he or she is comparing something that did happen with something that in fact for whatever reasons did not happen in th absence of davisbacon requirement would the contract have gone to the same c ontractor if so or if not would it have been managed in the same way di d the act have any impact upon the wages actually paid or upon workforce utilization without davisbacon would different workers have been employed and would they have been paid different rates these same questions confront public agency in its efforts to investigate davisbacons impact for public agency the task is less massive than it would have been for private scholar and in the public sector there may be other constraints simply put how much f unding and staff time could or should be devoted to an investigation of the davis bacon impact on construction that is already in place what political or polic concerns may come into play one might like to be able to say forthrightly that change in the statute could have positive or negative impact however the state of current exploratory research would probably be insuffici ent to justify just an assertion4 davisbacon suspended historically it is not entirely clear why it was necessary for the franklin roosevelt administration to have suspended the act only very limited documentation concerning the suspension ppears to be available for the more recent administrations those of richard nixon and george w h bush it is also difficult to define precisely their rationa though the bush administration acted in response to particular events the cas of george w bus h of course is still unfolding the materials here are presented as something of an historical sketch franklin d roosevelt as noted above the original version of the davisbacon act march 3 1931 as in effect during the roosevelt administr ation included the provision that in case of national emergency the president is aut horized to suspend the provisions of this act by the early summer of 1934 with the enac tment of various ne w deal statutes there was some confusion as to which

administrator of public works roosevelt declared simply i find that national emergency exists and under date of june 5 1934 suspended the provisions of the davisbacon act for an indefinite period he did not define national emergency in his proclamation of suspension beyond noting that concurrent operation of the two laws davisbacon and the nira caused administrative confus ion and delay which could be avoided by suspension of the provisions of the davisbacon act6 the impact of the suspension of 1934 seem s not to have been immediately felt chester m wright former american fede ration of labor staffer and at that time washington journalist observed the suspension order did not become publicly known for week or ten days even then it was necessary to go to the state department for copy when the pres idents action did become public building trades unions protested charging that the suspension was the beginning of national wagecut campaign7 on june 30 1934 as quietly as it had been suspended just 25 days earlier the act was restored to full force the president simply remarking of the suspension proclamation that it appears that revoca tion of the said proc lamation would be in the public interest8 as in the case of the first pr oclamation the latter seems to have been little noticed the first press account appearing on july 4 1934 wright viewed the second proclamation as tantamount to an acknowledgment that the president had been badly advised9 other formal suspensi on of the act appears to have occurred until 1971 richard m nixon during february 1525 1971 the aflcio executive council and associated groups met at bal harbour florida the davisbacon act was considered indirectly and directly in two contexts first there was demand that general revenue sharing legislation then pending before congress and which the aflcio opposed provide inter alia for labor sta ndards comparable to those in the davis bacon act second the 40th anniversary of the enactme nt of the davisbacon act was at handhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33100crs5 10 the administrations general revenue sharing legislation was cosponsored by senator howard baker rtn and rep jack betts roh among

been created by president nixon under executive order 11482 sept 22 1969setting the stage in resolution dealing with revenue sharing the council affirmed there is widespread agreem ent on the responsibility of the federal government to provide financ ial aid to the state and local governments particularly in this time of rapid social and economic ch ange however the council rejected the administrations approach urging in its pl ace diversified program of its own the aflcio resolution noted of the thencurrent system for distribution of federal funds to local jurisdictions that it provided for both labor standards and civil rights standards and has served the nation well then turning specifically to the nixon administration proposals enco mpassed in the bakerbetts bills10 the council explained under the general revenue sharing proposal the federal government would dispense about 5 billion year to the states on nostrings basis with formulas that would require passthrough to the local governments without specific and enforceable fede ral performance standards there is assurance that federal civil rights guarantees and fair labor practices will be applied to projects supported by nostrings federal grants11 although the aflcio council made speci fic reference to davisbacon it was clear that it had that stat ute among others in mind in separate statement the council took note that 1971 was the 40th anniversary of enactment of the davisbacon act this principle of prevailing wages is essential the council stated to assure that work for th federal government is not based upon exploitation of workers wit hout such requirement bidding on federal contracts by unscrupulous employers coul d result in competitive undermining of fair wage and labor standard s and the council conclude d the davisbacon act is as important today as it was 40 years ago its basic principle as well as effective enforcement must be maintained the aflcio will not settle for less12 davisbacon suspended with the dawning of the 1970s president nixon had become concerned about the wagepri ce structure of the construction industry on january 18 1971 he met with the tr ipartite construction industry collective bargaining commission at the white house to express his concerns13 the purpose of the meeting labor s ecretary james hodgson said was for the president to urge action on the part of these leaders to do something about curbing the wageprice spiral in construc tion various opti ons were discussed including suspension of the davisbac on act proposal re portedly

presidential deadline drawing near14 at february 17 presidential press conference while the aflcio executive council was in session at bal harbour the issue surfaced again president nixon was asked what action he w ould take to hold down wages and prices in construction he responded that secretary hodgson was then meeting with industry leaders and that he would await the secretarys report but he promised there will be action and he noted the constructi on industry is sick industry it is sick industry not because of the quality of c onstruction in the united states it is the highest quality construction in the world but because it has had too rich diet he noted that construction wage increases then averaging 16 while unemployment in construction was double the national average were too high for the good of the general economy but he made mention of davisbacon per however he did note that 14 billion of the federal budget the next fiscal year would be devoted to construction now with this kind of financial interest in construction he suggested it is essential that the federal government use its power to the extent that it can to bring about more reasonable ttlements within that industry and to promote wage and price stability15 the aflcio executive council meeting was marked by rumors and speculation secretary hodgson moved be tween washington and bal harbour while trade union representatives met with dunlop16 discussion between hodgson and aflcio president george meany on february 4 had been less than definitive but meany expressed his hope that the pa rties will come up with something17 following conferences with the president omb director george shultz and others in washington hodgson returned to flor ida for additional talks with meany on february 1920 1971 saturday evening feb ruary 20 the secretary and his staff returned to washington in statement on february 23 1971 pres ident nixon announced decision i am today suspending the provisions of the davisbacon act which requires contractors working on federa l construction projects to pa certain prescribed wage rates to their workers he declared in my judgment the operation of this w at time when construction wages and prices are skyrocketing only gives federal endorsement and encouragement to severe inflationary pressureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33100crs7 18 the nixon papers 1971 pp 199200the action i have taken today is based on the principle that government programs which contribute to excessive wage and price increases must be modified or rescinded in periods of infl ation this was the principle i applied to industry in the case of recent excessive increases in steel and oil prices this is the principle i am applying to organi zed labor in the construction emergency the period in president nixons view was marked by very high wages in construction were the davis bacon act to apply those excessively high wages would have to be paid by fe deral construction cont ractors he noted that the act had been adopted in 1931 during period marked by very different circumstances in 1971 the act meant something else entirely he affirmed i believe that this preferential arrangement does not serve the interests of either the construction industry or the american public at time when wages are under severe upward pressures nixon continued the proclamation 4031 i am issuin g today also suspends the wage determination provision of more than 50 other federal laws relating to federally involved construction which incorporate the davisbacon act i am calling upon states and other governmental bodies with similar statutes to take similar action italics added suspension of davisbacon may have been less an attack upon the act per than an effort to twist the arms of labor and management and to encourage from the presidents perspective more responsib wageprice policy he closed his statement of suspension not with an objec tion to davisbacon but rather with word of advice presumably both to industry and to labor i have suspended the davisbacon act because of emergency conditions in the construction industry the purposes of the davisbacon act can once again be realized when construction contractors nd labor unions work out solutions to the problems which have created the emergency in the final analysis those who are directly involved in the construction industry must assume the leadership in finding answers to these complex problems then mr nixon added construction contractors and labor leaders will have the full cooperation of this admin istration as they strive to carry out this crucial responsibility18 the davisbacon act reinstated secretary hodgson explained the action of the president in suspending the davisbacon act the suspension occurring several hours after the adjournment of the aflcio council meeting in florida the secretary noted with respect to plans for wage and price control in miami i met with courteous reception and sensed

releva nt provisions of the davisbacon act hodgson continued you may wonder how effective this action will be we believe that it w ill be quite effective it has long been thought that these provisions of the act that prescribe that wages in federal construction must be based on those prevailing in the area have often operated to s upport labor costs at an artificially high level and to give an upward thrust to thos rates not only in contract construction but throughout the industry then the secretary concluded on an optimistic note following the lead of president nixon we believe suspension should help produce more reasonable settlements throughout the industry and restore bette r balance to the bargaining process19 italics added organized labor was less thusiastic george mean branded the suspension as punitive against workers without real effect on halting infla tion and added that it presents an open invitation to unscrupulous employers to exploit workers by competitive undermining of fair wage and labor standards iron workers president john h lyons suggested that the suspen sion really constitute d windfall for open shop contractors since the nonunion firms could bid competitively upon the basis of union wage scales and then in the absen ce of davisbacon sanctions pay whatever wages they might wish20 meanwhile labor reporter j ohn herling observed that the presidents action has certainly brought cheer to the us chamber of commerce for decades he pointed out the chamber has battled to remove davisbacon and the related walshhealey act from the statute books21 of greater importance however both in the context of gene ral revenue sharing and the dispute over davisbacon was the in terrelationship between state and federal laws dealing with the prevailing wage issue some states had taken action to provide prevailing wage protection in public construction severa l decades before enactment of the davisbacon act and many states still have such statutes22 by the early 1970s only about nine states had failed to enact little da visbacon acts23 in suspending the davisbacon act pr ovisions president nixon had called upon the states and other

we guarantee the payment of prevailing area wages in the construction industry we had the question arise immediately after mr nixons statemen t that under emergency powers still not defined so far as i know he suspended that federal law we have the proposition presented to us we had dozen road contracts coming up some of them joint federa lstate road contracts with federal funding in them amounting to several millions of dollars what were we to do had mr nixon set aside our state law as well or was it to suspend it and then what and then throw the contract s open to bidding by any contractor who came down the pike who would hire labor at any price what then would be the floor 160 an hour the federal nimum or what would apply the whole construction indus try would have been th

toward the administration but it allowed assistant secretary of labor arthur fletcher former city councilman from pasco washington an opportunity to predic t before conference of the associated builders and contractors generally an antidavisbacon industry group that the era of union domination of the employ ment pattern in the construction industry is over further fletcher reportedly denounced the act as both inflationary and discriminatory28 suspending the davisbacon act was more complicated than it may have appeared at first the fact is her ling reported that the davisbacon suspension had not been operative in the month ce it was ordered but in that time he added the administration was made to comprehend the legal quagmire into which it might sink as result of the suspension while building trades attorneys began to explore the options open to labor the tangled web of interapplicability of federal and state statutes the little davisbacon laws began to emerge29

shifted to the broader question of wage and pr ice restraintscontrols some implications of the nixon suspension the nixon suspension of the davisbacon act together with its subsequent reinstatement had several implications but perhaps these ma not have been entirely expected in 1931 davisbacon had been enacted as an emergency measure at the urging of the herbert hoover administration it was subsequently amended in 1935 and thereafter with some minor tinkering remained generally accepted although not universally accepted part of the federal labor scene then suddenly the very existence of the statute was called into ques tion labor of course reacted but so did critics of davisbacon at least until th mid1990s repeal of davisbacon had become cause célèbre for each side of the dispute32 given the interconnectedness of state and federal statutes suspension of davis bacon was more complicated than it might have appeared president nixon though he called upon the states to act similarly could not enforce such commitment from the states nor did the president seem to imply that he had that authority i am calling upon states and other governmental bodies with similar statutes to take similar action33 the pronouncement of solicito r nash cited above would seem to have dubious value either as an interp retation of law or perhaps as policy in retrospect it appears the nixon susp ension of the act was never intended to be of long duration it was it would seem to have been an exercise in armtwisting aiming to make the several parties but in effect organized labor take seriously the administrations wageprice control policy if so it did not appear to have served this purpose well but rather it tended to cr eate confusion within the industry bidding would move forward projects

election criticism from his own party included representative newt gingrich rga reportedly calling the current situation unacceptable and urging that the president must define for his team which vision and system he needs to govern effectively and win decisively34 suspension of the davisbacon act app ears to have been under consideration by the bush administration at least through the early months of 1992 senior officials suggested that number of items were on the presidential agenda including suspending the davisbacon act35 the washington times editorially confirmed the notion on march 1536 and again on march 19 the washington times reported that the president would likely rely on proposals prepared by richard darman omb director one of which would be to lift the davisbacon act37 on march 20 the washington post reported that among other items that the president was contemplating would be limiting the davisbacon wage law38 but nothing occurred just then the president acts on davisbacon the issue of davisbacon continued to appear through the next several m onths on april 21 1992 white house deputy press secretary judy smith confirmed that suspension of davisbacon was still under consideration but that ther was closure on it yet39 day later the daily labor report stated that the president will not seek to suspend the davisbacon act by declaring an economic emergency believing that it would establish precedent he does not want to set40 but then on june 5 it was reported that the white house was again giving serious consideration to ordering nationwide suspension of the act and according to one white house s ource the decision to suspend the act is now more likely than not41 critics of davisbacon continued to press the presid ent to take action as the summer passed however the davisbacon issue seemed to disappear from public view it is also possible that identif iable emergency had as yet occurred behind the scenes the issue seems still to have been under

hawaii44 suspension of davisbacon draws fire praise the action by president bush raised number of questions first what constitutes national emergency for davisbacon purposes th answer may not have been beyond dispute second if the concept of na tional emergency under davisbacon can be made to include such disasters as hurrican and perhaps earthquakes floods riots etc did the act then empower the president to enter into selective suspension of the act third is the presidential suspension authority limited to the davisbacon act per or could it be extended to the vari ous program statutes into which the davisbacon principle has been incorpor ated fourth in areas where there are state and local prevailing wage requirements how might these be affected if at all by presidential suspension of davisbac on fifth what was the impact likely to be upon the entire contracting proce ss in the several affected areas some questioned the presidents authority to selectively suspend the act it is clear that congress delegated to the president authority to suspend application of the davisbacon act in national emergenc stated robert georgine president of the aflcio building and construction
