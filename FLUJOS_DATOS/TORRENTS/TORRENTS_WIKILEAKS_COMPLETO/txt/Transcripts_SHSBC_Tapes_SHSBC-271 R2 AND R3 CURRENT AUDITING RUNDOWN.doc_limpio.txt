r2 and r3 current auditing rundown lecture given on 21 february 1963 okay here we are this is the what twentyone february ad 13 1 know the year anyway and here we are with saint hill special briefing course lecture now frankly youre here to make it we expect you to make it and youre not going to make it without data andeven though some of you are trying youve got to keep up on your bulletins and keep up on your tapes and get your checksheets done and do good job of auditing because the better job of auditing you do the better auditing youre going to get thats for sure in auditor assignments we have very nasty habit of pairing off the poorer auditors against each other and the better auditors against each other so the better job of auditing you do the better auditor you get its all these little persuasions and while youre still in the universe why we have to use some of the laws of the universe to get you going and push you along we dont like to use these laws but that is persuasion and duress and other things of that character are definitely indicated in some of these cases in other words wewere not against you were just against the bank and if you get along why its because youve overcome your bank first thing i want to tell you in this lecture tonight is ive received quite few congratulations on being clear and so forth actually im just firstgoal clear but and almost secondgoal clear ive got so many items left on the second goal but ive received quite few congratulations and all of them very warm but im also receiving here and there in the minority some distinct shocks from people they aha what do you know well i thought you were seven times as clear as anybody else ever would be and so forth and theyre very shocked to find out that i have gone clear well for long time my needles been free sporadically and i very often use emeters or use my clear read thats been for years to check out an emeter im sure there are people around here have seen do it id say that emeters not right because it isnt reading at 3 1 take hold of it and so forth but thats beside the point those that have have sort of missed the story theythe people are shocked about this they theyve missed the story this idea of somebody fullarmed from the brow of jove or something like that coming down and helping man and so on thats an old story that isnt even news but somebody by his own bootstraps even as you pulling himself up through this thing that is news and whatever you have done and been on the whole track or whatever i have done and been on the whole track it still amounts to the fact that guy just like you made this and has made it and also physician heal thyself has been broken all ways from the middle because it never happened before thats whats news i suppose my bank to large degrees been keyed out but over period of time has been keying in harder and harder and harder and about knocked my head off and i was working out technology by which you could get clear and i hadnt had any auditing to amount to anything for couple of years actually mary sue rolled up her sleeves and there we went and here we are and this is very satisfactory well i wont say an end to the story because the story is long way from ended but i will say its very satisfactory denouement on the question can one lift himself by his own bootstraps and beat all the laws of god and men in this whole universe from one corner to the other and the answer of course is yes now where you have will why you dont always have way but way can be worked out i was very interested to hear today from louise who left here some little time ago saint hill grad and she was telling what shed been doing and its the wildest story i think ive read in long time this girl without any training on 212 but having learned how to study and audit here has been banging into cases where she is at the present time and has apparently divined the fact that as long as pc is arc breaking and screaming and feeling bad and so forth it just must be that the list isnt complete and so shes gone on and on and on and on and nulled and looked and nulled and gone on and listed and shes not been abandoning lists and she finally turned on great big rock slamming items and so forth on each one of these pcs and theyve come up really smiling and shes having some resounding success with 212 and probably all shes equipped with is simply the original 212 bulletin and with what she already knows about auditing and 3d criss cross and the rest of it why shes been able to somehow or another sweat her way through this and she doesnt even know about the fourway package but shes been having some enormous success she isnt abandoning lists she says well this list is running and its making change on the pc and i can possibly see the tone arm moving and so somehow or another there is something on this list and i mean to find it and she has been going on in that fashion rather interesting approach sort of dogged persistent approach and shes been getting some rather fantastic changes in cases and it shows you that the school of well list half page and it didnt work and abandon that and list another half page on something else and it didnt work and abandon that and list half another page on something else and abandon that that school isnt succeeding thats definitely losing school i myself am up against this in auditing right now and i just mean to push on through on the list which gave us trouble originally and im going to finish up that list now when 212a came out i gave you some data that you should go back and repair some of these lists i should have said at that time on those cases which were having trouble go back and find the widest rock slam which has been seen on the pc and finish off set of packages with that and youll be far better off well thats true thats true on cases youre having trouble with but let tell you something now and this this lecture is mostly about r2 and r3 and current auditing on these and also im going to give you step by step of how you do r3m but lets take this now and lets observe something here that the more you monkey around with whats been done on the pc the worse luck youre going to have do you understand that youve got this pc up here to about his fourth list and hes getting someplace and its going along not too badly and you all of sudden decide to duck back to the first list that you did on the pc and examine that and redo that and do it some other way and start patching up case crashitycrashitycrash by going back going back now its true that the error always lies behind you but taking case that can be continued in the run and going back is very bad now that is something you should pay some attention to in other words if theres any way to keep the case running if theres any way to continue to get new items on the case if theres any way at all to continue the forward progress of the case then you continue the forward progress of the case you understand that because the more you go back and patch up yesterday the more items you invalidate for the pc lets say you have ten on line plot we saw one last night and i was commenting on this actually i owe that pc bit of an apology he may have gotten the idea i invalidated all of his items i didnt i merely said that somebody is putting the items down on the wrong side of the line plot and this is causing trouble and the pc was in trouble but i didnt mean then that that pc should scrap all those items now listen any item that reads is the pcs item i dont care whether you canwhether its matched or packaged or not if the item reads and continues to read its aand it isnt represent of rock slamming or rocket reading item if that item is reading it is the pcs item and you can find opposition to it and so forth thats true of all items now lets say that we listed something early on the case wrong way to and we listed the item willothewisp early on the thing and we treated it as terminal and we eventually find out its still banging like mad and we have to list it again but when we listed it as terminal when it was actually an oppterm why we got an item whippersnapper well now that is the pcs item and it does have something to do with willothewisp even though it was listed backwards do you understand this is excuse for listing it backwards but it just says just this and more dont throw away this item you found whippersnapper dont throw it away and saygive the pc the big idea that now because its been listed backwards hes got wrong reliable item he hasnt that belongs someplace on the line plot and you just put it there and keep on going so even those items found by something being listed backwards are valid theyre valid items and youll find out eventually theyll fit into the line plot so you dont scrub all of pcs items and go back and dodge around and patch up and this sort of thing the best patchup for routine 3mx or 3mrather the best patchup that you can do is when youve run out fresh out of rocket reading reliable items which produce rocket reading reliable item you know youve got itrocket reading reliable item it tells you that in the original r3m by the wayyou are fresh out you cant find one from this reliable item everything just evaporates and it doesnt matter what you do to it you go back and do another goal oppose and itll land you right where you should have been itll give you the item in sequence but just because its goal oppose doesnt mean it gives you an oppterm it doesnt it gives you terminal or an oppterm you have to test it out just the same dont go scrubbing everything you have found on pc because you find something is backwards thats the message here see if you found something off of it by doing it backwards inadvertently thats still an item and it still belongs to the pc and it still fits in on the line plot do you understand so it isnt matter of scrubbing everything but you shouldnt go into wild wingding of trying to make nothing out of the line plot by scrubbing it all just because you have to do something in reverse thats the whole message im giving you here and if you have cycle of action which is continuing and you can do something with it you continue that and you do something with it dont keep monkeying get something done its very discouraging to pc now i had an example of this last night we socked into one and did it wrong way to i notice by the way that basic case changesis something can be done wrong way to and upside down and my recovery level from this is very rapid its getting very rapid you could list backwards for well you could take one of these first saint hill v unit lists you know hundred and ninetyfive pages because they wanted to know if the original item that was coming from had ever rock slammed you know one of these arduous endless pieces of nonsense and so itll practically spin you in see and formerly why i just would have hung on with for days and now i notice oh few days ago i was noticing that bum steer or something like that i would be all over it the following morning when i woke up itd be gone and now im noticing that it evaporates in about half an hour after the session you see what i mean recovery is getting better resilience bounce back that sort of thing that is one of the most marked improvements which i have noticed some of you will be wondering what happens to weight weight goes down but it rather goes down relatively slowly on 3nm and may or may not go down at all on 212 you may get lowering of weight on 212 and you may not but you certainly get lowering of weight on r3m the more you do r3m the more of it you do why the more weight drops off but it starts dropping off very slowly at first and whenever you do one wrong way to on the pc he loses his weight ground you get the idea i mean youve gotten six items now andon the spiral staircase and the pc has lost something very small like three and half pounds something like that and then you take item seven and it is beautifula beautiful guardian angel who is pleasant and sweet and loved by everybody you know and the pc goes on one of these hard sells and says oh thats oh thats oh ho thats oh ho thats oh yeah and the auditor not being an auditor you see justyou see the auditors there because he can think see and if he doesnt figure this out for himself hes not being an auditor hes just being an automaton so he buys this hard sell and of course the thing is an oppterm so hell list this thing this beautiful angel that is loved by everybody you know andand you list this thing as terminal and the pcs getting blacker and blacker it helps to be observant as an auditor you know i just wanted to get that in get that in just as little tip and the pc goes blacker and blacker and blacker and blacker and blacker and then there he is there he is all the problems of racial consciousness and everything else on his head and by this time you say i wonder if that terminal is false see the needle tightened up mass pulled in on him he went black lets see now there was tone arm action from the beginning of the list to the end and i didnt get an item off of it and its still the item guardian angel who is beautiful and sweet and loved by everyoneis still rocket reading half dial do you suppose that it could possibly have been an oppterm well thats pretty good i mean even if the conclusion is that stupid and drawn out and so forth it stillthe guy came up with the right answer so you list it as an oppterm and this time youof course you kind of mucked it up so it doesnt behave just right you know the tone arm action isnt good and the needle frees up slowly actually for the first 15 or 20 items hehes having an awful time listing at all you know then all of sudden you get it listed out and you find your item well even though thats packaged up you put your pc on the scale you find out hes just lost that three and half pounds gain in other words he weighs three and half pounds more hes right back to where he started do you see that i mean hes lost three and half pounds by your earlier packages but when you got up to item seven you listed one in reverse well you cancelled out his win and hell go back up and weigh the same as he did before you found the first package but then he gets rather fast recovery and you go on down the line and he starts losing weight more rapidly than he did before in other words you dont ruin his ability to lose weight but you simply gain back by alterised mass the weight which you already had taken off the pc this is interesting very very thin people at this stage of course are going to worry very thin people are going to worry at this stage and i will tell them little fib i dont know this but i will tell them little fib and say i hope that an optimum amount of weight is put on by reducing the gpm very probably is but we have nothing onno test data on it at all but we do know about the more weighty side of it now in other words you make goof and you undo some of your gain but even then you dont completely ruin the pc in the area and zone of case repair one of the favorite actions that people undertake is to find pair of items and then decide to go back and patch up something and its all relatively unsuccessful and then they come back to the pair theyve just found and take the last one its still rocket reading more or less and then list that and they find out that all the time theyve been fooling around the pcs been sitting in the somatics of the pair that were last found you see that i mean finding pair of items number well lets be mathematical about it numbers 11 and 12 on the line plot term and oppterm and then going back and straightening out wrong way to number 3 and wrong way to number 5 and then coming back to 11 and 12 youll be rather struck to find that your big upsurge comes when you simply oppose what you should have opposed which is number 12 and get number 13 and all the somatics that you started looking for on 3 and 5 actually were sitting right there on 12 even though they were backwards opposed that doesnt say dont straighten out line plot but only straighten out line plot if you have to now what do you mean have to well if after youve found all of the whole gpm and all the packages in it it doesnt blow free and wont prepcheck out youd better go back and patch up all of the all of the misaligned items thats more or less the time to do it how do you patch up one of these 3m cases interesting technique here is february the 1st i think first one out this was about 26 january something like that hasnt been out any length of time at all and were talking about how you repair one some commentary isnt it actually the best way to repair one that isnt running right youve just run fresh out ofyouve just run out of items i mean youthe pc lists down what youve got and he cant find anything and he lists down what youve got i know i told you goal oppose but im talking now about severe case now you just cant seem to get your hands on anything and you dont know where you are or what youre doing and so forth you have choice here one method is just do another goal oppose and you will land there right side up with the next consecutive item always whether its term or an oppterm but maybe the pcs sort of arc breaky and maybe he doesnt take kindly to all this and so forth well your other method is to go over the line plot and read every one of them and give each one of themof the items on that thinga big mid ruds prepcheck very rapidand just give them big mid ruds prepcheck on each one of these items and youll find that one of these things is reading madly in other words the whole case is tied up in one of these items actually you have to continue to list every item that firesif you want to do patch up if you find that theres still dirty read on item number 7 whats the proper thing it doesnt mean that it was wrong way to listed it just means it can be listed again and another item found on it now how is that well every time you do wrong way to on the gpm it upsets the frequency of the gpm and loops the whole thing over and puts it down into good solid bingbang pack see in other words lets say thissay heres your lineal gpm see all right and you list one wrong way to and you get something like this and itll tie something up down here see and then you list another one wrong way to and you get something like this now now what happens well every time you list something you get something down here and then you could list the same item again and get something here and eventually youve got to undo the ballup that youve done well you havent worsened the case by doing this it just makes the frequency with which you get the items wrong so they dont appear in the right sequence on the line plot in other words after youve listed something wrong way to youve upset the frequency because you have jammed up the gpm see so that anything you get here now is getting something up here when actually it should have been getting something here dont you see so youyouve balled the thing up and you cant expect your frequencies to work so sometimes you list an item lets say number 7 you list number 7 and you get cat whisker or something like that and thats fine and you list that and thats fine and you oppose that and thats fine and then all of sudden youre out in thin air and you dont quite know what to do funny part of it is you go back and read number 7 again and it has an additional fire on it now youve got to list it the same way you listed it before it wasnt done backwards if its just got dirty read backwards gives you the full read back you understand so just your little dirty needle on number 7 you just do another list on number 7 and youll find upyoull come up with the consecutive one that you should have found by listing down number 11 see thats when youve already looped the gpm the thing to do is dont loop it but after you have why then you have little bit of picnic you have trouble and you just have to remember these things the rules actually arent upset the frequency of listing rules and all that sort of thing that isnt upset its the sequence by which they go on the line plot that is upset and you sometimes have to list one twice you know i mean you list number 7 it appears to be clean and everything is fine you get down here to number 11 and you all of sudden cant find an item the thing to do is to go back over the whole line plot and test each one of the items on the line plot and see which one is now firing now take your biggest read as the one you fix up you got big rocket read the probability is it was listed backwards in the first place so list it the other way to you understand thats just conditional you test it again its guarantee its backwards it may be frontwards but you understand you gotyou take your biggest rocket read that is on the list and if its as bigif its good big strong powerful rocket read the chances are the item was listed in reverse in the first place thats guarantee that it was but just the chances are it also may be listed the same way and pick up brand new item and behave exactly as though it had never been listed you understand well thats the first one that you take you make sure just apply all your tests again just treat it as though youve just found an ri you got the idea you just found new ri well whered you find it well i found it on the line plot yeah well hed just found an rl itd already been listed and everything else but there it is firing so well just treat it as though we just found an rl we have to find out if its terminal or its an oppterm and we list it again now these little little fellows the dirty reads that pick up as you go through there you can continue your biggest dirty read just as you did before itd be mistake to do it in reverse it isnt in reverse itit justbecause of this looped up character of the bank which i was showing you the thing now can be listed another step yet another list and itll go 25 items beyond the last rr and rs orplus the tone arm action and youyoull wind up with brandnew item and mysteriously this brandnew item fits right down here as opposing number 11 very mysterious now you can go back and run goal oppose list see that itll just avoid all that and go back and run goal oppose list and you will wind up with the item which opposes number 11 or you will wind up with the item that opposes that great big rocket read thats left on the list in other words im giving youtheres number of ways to enter this thing but if when youre entering it you have the idea or your pc gets the idea that youre just going to take his whole line plot and tear it up and all fifteen items which have already been found are all invalid and good any more and so forth because they were all from wrong way to list or something like that boy you want to get an upset or arc broke pc actually you can just take pc and saand tell him halfway through one of and i dont think this up here is very valid and im going to change all this and all you have to do is cross out the old gpm after you got the new gpm written and hell blow up just the action of invalidating his items by saying were writing new line plot is enough to knock pc off his base thats interesting isnt it well sometimes as we had to do today on one of the cases the first demonstration last night go over the line plot and look it over and find out what on the line plot is still firing and we found the first item found on this pc was still firing and i looked at the line plot and it didnt look right to and today why they went back and found the first item had never been opposed properly and they just handled that as though that was the ri which theyd found and proceeded from there and that case will be in good shape thats why you didnt see rocket read last night do you understand our rocket reads dont disappear like that theyyou should be able to see rocket read during tiger drilljust tiger drilling so youre tiger drilling and on suppress you know you say on the item happy schoolgirl has anything been suppressed pssww see you see those on real live item on an actual ri or something like that or goal you will see on the buttons you will see these fires and in 212 you will see the buttons do rock slam you see whats happened is the buttons have stolen the read and then you gradually get back and put it on once in blue moonnow its on another subject on 3myoull find that you get an rsing item and one of the items which rsed when it went down on the list is the item thats interesting and worth knowingonce in blue moon that will come from shattered up wrong way to listed gpm or something and by tigerits the only item on the list and it appears on the right place on the list and you read the rr and it didnt fire well for heaven sakes read the last rs see and if the last rs fired and nothing else fires then you start on that and put in your big mid ruds on that item and itll turn into rocket read thats quite interesting to know thats only after banks been clobbered and run backwards that it starts to misbehave you want perfectly behaving bank do everything perfectly and dont bust the rules anywhere along the line oppose everything right way to youll never have any trouble at all itll go off with perfect frequency but where youve done something wrong way to youve left one of the items rocket reading like mad and theres telling exactly whatswhats what it doesnt mean that the rules of listing are now disobeyed theyre not you do the same rules of listing but it means that you start finding terminals which have apparent oppterm and you start doing line plot that has holes in it and then you will come down from the top of line plot and all of sudden as youre finishing up the case you think youll find out youve been going backwards up the line plot to join what you had already found and then you are left out on limb because it all joins and you have nothing left to oppose well then you go over your line plot find something firing oppose that thing properly again and itll put you in business again and then you start down the line plot thats because somebody has got the line plot all jammed up the way to do it is to do it right in the first place now it is however easy to do wrong very easy all youve got to do is well aside from such crimes as faking read you know saying you saw something and didnt or losing an item which is actually on the list and you know i speak of these as corny errors see just corny aside from that im talking about proper and valid error the biggest stumbling block in r3 the one that youll have most trouble with now is differentiating between terminal and an oppterm and thats the most trouble youre going to have we used to have rule by which before we said the list was complete and stopped listing we read the source item do you remember that rule well youd better invoke that rule and every time you want to know if the list is complete you read the question of the list back to the pc and then read the item the list is proceeding from lets say were getting list who or what would oppose willothe wisp well before we hand the pc any items or consider our list complete or do anything else thataway we had better read the who or what would oppose willothewisp and willothewisp im not saying youve got to drill them and all that sort of thing if its got little dirty read on it you continue your list you understand and you will be in lots less trouble if you start that type of thing and if after youve listed it considerable distance and youve listed it to flat ta and you read it and it rocket reads that list is wrong way to so you just abandon it dont do thing with it because itll upset the frequency of the gpm if you throw the item into relief and quickly list it right way to and youll be much better off pc arc breaks go back on the other list and give him an item off of it but the point im making is is you should test the item that you are listing down and if it rocket reads itsafter youve more or less completed the listyou know very well that it was backwards so dont monkey with it just turn around and list it the other way quick and if it does little dirty read why you continue it now look that you get dirty read on an item is significant it means something very definite it means that the list is not complete you got that i mean thatthats the long and short of it but that it is clean is not test do you understand the reverse is not true just because you get clean needle you dontyou dont have test its not valid test just because you get clean needle doesnt mean in r2 or r3 today that your list is complete it simply means that the test of 50 items on source list for both r2 and r3 and 25 items on aan opposed ri list in r3 tone arm action tone arm action ceased and you listed 25 about 5 deep into the 25 you had rocket read so you promptly started in and counted 25 from that rocket read in other words you had to add 5 to your count make sure always that you have 25 beyond that rs the last rs or last rr or in r212 50 and read the item that youre listing from read that item and if thats got dirty read continue your list and start testing against that now you know very well that you will get complete list and if it rocket reads like crazy after you ostensibly have completed the list and before youve given the pc anything if the item youre proceeding from still rocket reads naw naw youve got wrong way to oppose so oppose it the other way quick like bunny and if it doesnt work the other way well i guess you better assume that the listthe item you got the list from or something crazy was all wrong but you will find out that one way or the other you will get the charge off of it now any item in the bank is the pcs item if you can get it to behave like an ri providing it doesnt come from the representation of rock slamming item let pound that home thats very important anyany item you find is the pcs item will fit someplace in his line plot i dont care how screwy the thing sounds the only thing that happens here occasionally is after youve listed out the whole gpm its all gone free its all gone clear and then you continue to oppose items youll go over into the second goal thats inevitable that happened to and the second gpm is much rougher than the first gpm thats much rougher probably has more items in it much tougher has more mass on it and of course youre much better able to to brush the tide and youll find out your pc by that time is behaving much better on the meter and so you can get through it easily actually its easier to audit but more formidable at glance than the first gpm thats worth knowing that after you get to be firstgoal clear why then you start up the mountains thats grim foresight actually its much easier done on the second gpm than it is on the first one now whatwhat are the steps what are the steps of 3m today well lets go into these very rapidly and im not taking these off of sheet or anything like that so ill just give it to you off the cuff as though i were auditing it first thing wed want to have straightened out on this pc is we want this pc capable of getting an rr and rs well we depend on 212 to hand us that we want to know if this pcs reading on the meter and so forth so that we can tell whether or not there is an rr or an rs capable on the thing thats probably more imporless important than im giving it stress that probably is not very important the thing about it is to find goal well the old 3ga methods of finding goal are quite valid except you dont have to represent the rock slamming item you can take any r2 material any oppterm and so forth and list goals against it as in 3g how do you mean that well what goal of yours would be an overt against whatever the oppterm was see you can list if you were whatever the oppterm is you choose thats been still reading like mad if you were oppterm what goal of yours would be impossible to achieve there are list of about ten ten goal categories well thats possible to find goal with those and using any of the 212 material which you have on 2 12 line plot and its also possible just to sit down and taking your meter in hand taking your meter in hand just go on and list goals just go on and list goals and go on and list goals and go on and list goals and goals and goals and goals watching for the rocket reads and very carefully putting down anything that rocket reads you see that you can just go on and list goals on some cases that is not tremendously successful but those will be cases that youyou cant get an rr on and cant get an rs on and so forth those cases however do respond to this other 3ga criss cross method with 3ga method of finding the goal you just do some 212 of some kind or another and you get rock slam turned on on the case and find one of those oppterms and then list goals against the oppterm and youll wind up with some goals that rocket read and so forth ive seen this by the way case after case ive seenwork out like this so its very good method of finding goals your easiest one is just to list goals its the least timemaybe more time consuming at first glance but you list all the ta action out and so forth and pc even if his goals been found before will eventually put it down on the list and itll 90 pow the worst goals to handle are the goals that have been found and been monkeyed up or been neglected and dont fire anymore and then you start doing this and that so always go over the pcs old goals use the beginning steps in other words of r321 go over the pcs old goals look these things over see what youve got but dont depend on big mid rud prepcheck to turn on goal dont depend on that to give you rocket read because frankly it wont always do it in fact thereive seen goals around that have been listed and so forth the big mid ruds are run on it like mad and what did we have left we had nofiring goal and then i have used method of finding some items that were now calling 212 and so forth and then having found some items on the thing all of sudden the old goal turns up and fires and weveweve done that several times so there it is you did the 3ga method of finding the goal the pc will put his goal old goal back on the list he always will and you get to it this time and it goes pssww and nothing else on the thing is firing now the liability is that there are some goals that will rocket read for about an hour and half as long as that there are some goals particularly after the pcs goal has been found you can get one of these confounded things and you start tiger drilling it and straightening it out or big prepchecking big mid rud prepchecking it and the thing fires and itll go on youll see several rocket reads on it and then it expires therefore dont so much worry about this happening with goal just be very very chary indeed of proceeding on goal channel be very very chary of proceeding down the line on your first goal opplist and if you dont see any rocket reads on that listtheres item can be found on that list and you see an rs and you oppose the rs along about this time you better start getting very very leery of whats going on if you dont get rocket read now well theres something wrong with this goal thats all id get very suspicious of the goal i wouldnt carry it too far id start treating it asdont abandon itstart treating it as 212 subject you understand and id go ahead and make fourway package out of the thing neat it all up tie the strings around it very neatly and go on with my business otherwise youre going to park the pc right on the track where you found it the chances are too that this can happenthis can happen you can take wrong goal that has sporadic rocket read you can list it down on goal oppose you can find rocket reading item and you move right in to the gpm but it isnt the goal see thats possibility that can happen well the thing to do with that dont interfere with it youre getting along youve got spiral staircase and so forth the pc will start nattering about is it his goal well let the pc give you few goals that it might be and youre liable to find thatnot just liable to find i mean i havent seen this happen im just saying its possibility the pc actually has different goal than the one he started in on in other words you just used this goal and you found an ri and you started down the spiral staircase and then the pc is nattery and unhappy about the goal and so forth let him give you short goals list of what he thinks the goal really is and youre liable to find that youreyou were offbeat with this goal thats possibility thats only when the pc starts nattering and says it isnt my goal and i dont know anything about it now you start running too many ris without the pcs goal and you get an unhappy pc he cant handle these things you always want to equate the rrri on 3m against the pcs goal you say well does this have anything to do with your goal to catch catfish you see you find milliner does this have anything to do with your goal to catch catfish and he says oh hm uhuh if that sort of thing keeps up youd better do little goals list and find out where the devil youre sitting because it might not be the pcs goal that youre running you see you might have something that led you into the gpm but isnt the pcs goal thats faint possibility your usual response is you get something like milliner and the pcs goal is to be bird you know and you say all right does this have anything you always ask him this about an ri and you say does this have anything to do with your goal oh i dont know oh well hell yes hell yes hell yes you look at these womens hats and these big peacock feathers and so forth yes yes definitely an oppterm oh theyre terrible people milliners terrible people they pull out your tail and so forth hell cognite see always give the pc the chance to orient that ri against this goal dont pester him with it just call it to his attention and then you always give pc chance by saying would the item youve just found terminal you see would an item game warden oppose the item weve just found fisherman and the pc says yes yes yes oh yes yes hmm in other words does the item have anything to do with his goal and does it oppose or couple up with the package that youre finding and you ask the pc to do this and hell blow lot of mass and so forth its coaxing pc to look at it dont you see sometimes pc doesnt pc says oh thats marvelous millinery yeah thats fine and you go on down the line and the pc is just not really in as high tone as he could be in so call his attention to the packaging ask him you know does it oppose or is it opposed by and call his attention does it have anything to do with the goal theres those theres are your provisos but as far as steps are concerned the ordinary step not looking for trouble we just take somebody in off the street and we list goals on the meter and list goals on the meter and goals on the meter and goals on the meter and goals on the meter and then we get rocket read every once in while and we mark down the rocket read and we keep listing goals listing goals and we mark these things down then we go back when weve got the tone arm action out and we check these rocket reads one after the other and were going to find out one of them fires like mad and we prove this thing out and were all set lets say weve done that see all right weve got goal now that rocket reads we get it checked out by somebody and everybody agrees that this thing rocket reads and so forth and we now list it on goal oppose now weve got to sort out with the pcis whether or not its who or what would somebody or something with the goal to catch catfish or is it who or what would the goal to catch catfish or who or what would to catch catfish oppose see weve got to sort that out one of these things youll find reading if you care to take little summary and the possibly there are other wordings such as catching catfish who or what would catching catfish oppose you take such readings and you check them off do little assessment on them you see and one of them reads nicely and the others dont well thats what you list and youve got to clear the command with the pc the pc sometimes will not be able to answer one and so therefore he will protest it and you get your read on protest and so forth and youre all messed up before you begin youve got to clear command with the pc please clear it intelligently but also clear it on the meter because pcs go on hard sell sometimes and give you bum steer now we list this thing and we list it down to still ta unless the pc is jumping around and so forth and if weve got too much jumparound and we cant tell what still ta is and we have large argument about whether or not there can be still ta and all of that well the thing to do with all of this is to take it beyond the last rr or rs whichever it is its the last rr or rs see its atheres the last read on the list big read is an rs we take it 50 beyond that rs see and it also must be 50 thats not in addition to that 50 but its also 50 from the stillness of the ta but if we cant even tell if the ta is still or not and its all kind of gluey and the pc is doing this and that and hes running havingness on himself while eating striped candy or something you know i mean there could be reasons why the ta isnt motionless we still only continue that far50 beyond and thats for r3m that also is totrue of r2 when were listing stuff fifty beyond that item listen dont you go on overlisting endlessly till the pc goes black purple green and pink you understand because thatsthats just being 11 see just knock that off because theres sense in it the time to extend the list is this next step now we go back and we test this thing we saywe got 50 beyond this now we dont do anything with the pc see we just say to the pc who or what would catching catfish oppose whatever it was see and it goes tick dirty read and were not sure so maybe we drill it for moment or two on this has anything been suppressed invalidated and so on rapidly though rapidly lightly you know not the rest of the day and next week and next month and next august you know i mean this is three minute operation see at the most absolute outside and we find out the confounded thing still has got dirty read on it all right thats fine lets continue our list and youll find out youre going to get new rs or youre going to get new rr see and then go 50 beyond that and test this thing again and this time youre beyond it the thing isnt reading everything is fine now the hell of it is the read can be any one of the rrs on that list you dont pay any attention to the rses if there were rrs on it mind you now you can have goal oppose list with perfectly valid goal which has rrs on it you know it has nothing but rses on it but you test that and you test every one of those rrs every one of those rses now if you dont find itbang then you go on this over and under see you read the next one above and the next one below each rs or rr and the next one above the next one below the next one above the next one below you understand and youre going to find that item and you get that item it could be an rs you put in the big mid ruds properly itll probably rr but you remember your goal is fresh your goal isnt firing well it hasnt been unburdened very much so dont expect too much of it if you cant get it to fire rr you still determine whether or not this item you have found off that source list is terminal or oppterm and you now oppose it accordingly you understand it can be an rs or an rr because there wont be two rses or an rs and an rr or two rrs firing on that list if there are the list is not complete simple so you complete the list now youve gotten this item that is the pcs first ri and dont keep mucking around with it and deciding its this and deciding its that and taking week to find it out it takes about five minutes so you better take longer than ten you hear im getting cross actually about this i really am im getting cross because i tell you man it doesnt take week it doesnt take session to find out if its somebodys item you know thats just corny because youre going to kill the item the pc gets so damned tired of this he goes on protest you actually cant get anything to read at all see thats just monkeying look if you were listing wellif you were listing well reading down across your meter with this alongside of your meter like i was showing you last night you know put that paper alongside of the meter and get your eye so it goes right straight down across the meter face to the paper and keep shoving the paper forward with your other paw as you write and with your sensitivity down here at about 4 youre going to see all the rrs and rses you want to see and those things should be clearly marked on your paper and they should be legible now youve got those things theyre clearly marked rrs or rses its very very fast job to go back over and just read off each one of those thats source list you do this with just read off each one of those things bangbang bang bang bang on down the line the chances are if you have any degree of accuracy in listing at all youre going to find it just now bang you say bang thats it youve read several more they didnt read so its the only one thats doing it on the list well bang thats it you understand i mean there isnt any reason now to fool with it what are you going to do with it paint wall with it or something all youre going to do is ask the pc ifwhat his goal would have to do with it or something like that and there it is you got your item now whatswhats the matter with you havent you got some new paper or something you can put new sheet of paper under there and get all ready with your ri listsee stop wasting time do you know that you can find in five and half hours of auditing do you know that you can find rnine ris off goal nine thats not one week thats not one every fifteen hours of auditing you understand and it is all in the speed with which you do it now look the more competence you have the more speed you operate with the more positive you are in what you do the better you know whats doing the less nonsense and time youre going to spend also on those sessions where youve made gruesome error youre going to waste the whole session so its worth time not to make gruesome errors but what do you mean by time well take time to test the thing in other words that doesnt mean drill forever some of you people are getting in tiger drill and then big mid ruds and then prepcheck and so forth all for what the thing is reading like crazy all of sudden it doesnt read any more why it wasnt the item that wore out it was the pc now you go right on down the line here and lets get going on this man you havent got forever it takes 31 hours to clear the first goal ill let you have 50 thatthats right it doesnt take any longer than that do you realize that if goal is found out here on monday the guy ought to be his firstgoal clear two weeks later well wheres thewheres the thing going i mean where are you losing your time youre losing your time by goofing and youre losing your time by just plain foolishness monkey business all the way along the line youve got the thing firing youve got everything going just keep on listing man keep on listing take those things get the next one get take that get the next one and just not get so sloppy lets not go this well the ta moved hundredth of an inch and so forth when the pc coughed so therefore we have to list 20 more pages who are you trying to prove wrong huh now you just adhere to this other rule and just get your 50 test the item to see if it still dirty reads and dont continue it if it doesnt read and youll get those items and get them and then start opposing them all right whats your next step here you just start opposing you have to decide whether the thing is terminal or oppterm well there are many tests by which you do this amongst these things and im not going to go over these tests because these things are very lengthy to list the number of ways you can tell but lookahere you read it you read the list question forget consider overts and commit overts and that sort of thing forget that just read the list question who or what would oppose catfish who or what would catfish oppose see and its going to read better one way than the other thats still not complete guarantee but it gives you an awful good indicator it reads like mad who or what would catfish oppose therefore the chances are the things terminal you see it justits just the chances are the thing is terminal now when you start listing when you start listing this thing who or what would catfish oppose the pc says hey mass is pulling in on take look at the pc you know the pcill show you where the pc is the pcs across the table from you and you can find him and you can look at his face see you can take your face up off the meter now the pcan auditor will sometimes say well im so busy writing im so busy writing i havent got any time to look at the pc i keep watching the meter well i dont know my pcs are usually in control and i say well thats good thank you thank you and the pguy sort of slows down and you can sometimes smell his brakes smoking but i say i want to take look at you and see how its all right hows it going well its going all right and so on anything happening there everythings going along fine take look at the shadows underneath his eyes are they darkening does the pc look worse and so forth all right so you say well youll interrupt the pc and youll interrupt his listing sure he kicks who cares about pc kicking yes aw i you just threw off i had some wonderful ideas you say all right im awful sorry yes yes actually id rather throw pc off than list him reverse way to what is the record around here eight hundred seventyfive pages beyond the last rs ibeyond doing something stupid and corny see i would rather stop the pc and actually put him insession and start and stop him in session you understand now thats the best thing to do is be careful now the fact that you had satisfactory answer still is test that it was absolutely right after youve gone down here page or so you ask the pc the question who or what would oppose catfish or catfish oppose and you see this thing it goes ppssww hahahaha whawhawhat the hell what the hell whats this whats this whats this you mean youve listed couple of pages and this thing is still firing wed better ask the pc some searching questions as to what this is all about and turn around and list it the other way for while and find out if that fire disappears it might you might have had it right the first time but dont take chances on these backwards lists you understand all right so we take that we go twentyfive items beyond our last rr or rs youll see theresits twentyfive tone arm action and so forth there it is read that item read the list question again who or what would catfish oppose dirty needle continue the list and then you read it again aw its dirty needle you say are you protesting this and the pc says im really not protesting this christalmighty i rrrrr well use your head hes probably protesting it so give it the big mid ruds now it doesnt read and you say fine thats all right thats the end of the list all right read him the last rsing item read him the next to the last rocket reading item and then read him the last rocket reading item on the list bang it should fire just like thatbang and you say all right that is your item now dont do anything else at that point just look at the pc but if it doesnt fire if it doesnt fire go the over and under read the one above and the one below and if they dont fire read the one above those and the one below those and i dont mean the one rr above it or the rr below it i mean exclusively and extensively just the item above it because you might not have got it on the same one the furthest away ive seen one is 3 below in other words the pc had it in mind all the time he was listing the other three see and its the furthest away ive seen one of these things occur all right theres yourtheres your item you say all right thats your item it fired well you know the others didnt fire you say thats your item that fires thats fine you say all right now dont do anything the pc sits there and he thinks so and so on bwa bwi gaa wuudrup he says yeah yeah well yeah yeah yeah yeah fishhook haha sure would oppose catfish you say all right thats good now whats that have to do with your goal oh uhhuh well whatyou kidding you kidding that one has lot to do with the goal and so on and you say all right thats good now would catfish oppose fishhook oh yes yes oh boy sure would oppose fishhook and you say well that is all fine all right now were going to take fishhook and here we go see were going to take fishhook were going to establish by test whether or not its terminal or oppterm to the best of our ability and then were going to write it down there and were going to find out that it happened to be oddly enough because we had the bank fairly straight itswas an oppterm who or what would oppose fishhook and so on and here we are right back in the run again does that sound like two or three hour next session we will take it up two or three days later well in this particular case i know youve got to get it checked up by an instructor thats all right but it isnt going to take him any time to all youve got to say is fishhook and it goes pssww and you say oh boy thatsthats right all right lets get back in there and get right to it again and lets find another item now actually the further you go these lists tend to get shorter the rocket reads appear earlier on them and they get shorter and shorter and shorter and the shortest theyll get however is about two and half column pages you wont see list get much shorter than that if they start getting shorter than that why you want to be kind of suspicious now the pc says oh well my item is something else i cognited on it because actually it wouldnt be fishhook youjust think to yourself well he wouldid hate to have to confront fishhook too it read on the meter its his item and thats it and he says well actually actually its fish market its fish market its fish market i know ive cognited on it and so forth and so on you say good im awfully glad of that im awfully glad of that but take this in point he starts protesting items and saying they arent it then youve done something on reverse oppose someplace or another and you say well all right all right catfish doesnt oppose fishhook in this particular way all right you still have this item ri for fishhook thats still valid item and there it is and well find out something else that opposes catfish some other time but weve still got this item and well come back and well adjust that on the line plot now thats very fine now who or what would oppose fishhook and here we go again you understand this is the way you do this thing now when the pc gets down along the line he sayshell startmay start telling you geez you know this is awful fundamental this is awful fundamental and you better keep check by reading that goal every once in while youll find out the goal goes through the cycle i described to you before youd better read that goal once in while thats the thing to do see if it fires and actually goal ought to fire better and better and better and items ought to fire better and better and better if youre just doing nothing but r3 you know mid ruds nothing it just fires better and better and better you know if it all is going well and all of sudden its fire firefirefire and boomboomboom and youthe goal sort of goes and so forth and you find an item or two more and all of sudden the pc says well gee thats it thats it to be catfish the first items catfish there it is and you know he opposes water and thats it and you check it up and you check it up and so forth and you do little prepcheck on the goal anda little oneand you all of sudden see youre sitting there with free needle go test all of your items make sure that they are all straight and youve got the line plotted and youve got firstgoal clear and it works the same way for the second goal theres difference in the operation well thats the way you do it thats the way you do it and the more nonsense you put into it and the more goofs you put into it and the more figurefigure you put into it and the more you try to be absolutely sure even though the pc is screaming and protesting and youve already gone 175 items beyond the last rr or rs and so forth and pc has turned black but youve got to be sure because somebody said the tone arm action is out and imagine your embarrassment when you find out that its because the knob is loose now thatstop trying to think yourself to death listen letsjust quit it quit it and then just sit down and do it huh thats the thing you know ievery time i turn around and see any trouble some auditors got it all figured outall figured out wrong and they say well it really couldnt be his item you see hes not really an indian and they just never let him have this item indian and so forth in other words they arent addressing the pure mechanics of the situation powpowpowpowpow well the mechanics will get you through now sometimes you can tell by certain indicators like all the baddies are oppterms and 11 the goodies are terms bull never happened to anybody in the history of the universe theyve been bad and theyve been good and you see some disproportionate thing like this occurring and you say somethings wrong with this line plot or supposing everything that he puts down ends in 99 pad well there isnt that much constancy on the line plot thats all burmapad catapad matapad bootapad so forth you say you know there must be something wrong with this line plot because i cant understand it well the thing to do with it when you cant understand it is read all these items back and see if one rocket reads one rocket reads like mad its been opposed wrong way to and there you are oppose it right way to and the case will get underway again youve always got the trick of goal oppose well now as rough as i sound as rough as i sound on that my insistence and my roughness is only in the direction of trying to pound through one simple set of facts they are mechanical facts this is very rapid technique this is rapid technique this is not one that you find rocket reading item once every two weeks and thats enough you understand thats becausei dont know how you do that its rapid and you get there fastest if you do it the mostest now if you really dont understand what youre doing dont go anyplace and most of your difficulties and the longevity of time that youre putting in on this is because youre doing when you should be sitting back wondering what the hell youre doing and you say now wait minute wait minute weve gone fifty weve gone seventyfive and this item up here is still reading as matter of fact it started out with quarter of an inch rocket read and its now got halfadial rocket read and weve opposed it and yet its still got its firing on it what do i do well let tell you the wrong thing to do is to go on auditing you hear thats the wrong thing trying to look good and that sort of thing give the pc break go on outside and lean against the wall and smoke cigarette or take chew of tobacco if youre lady and think of this thing what the hell now what the hell its still rocket reading and ive gone this far and so forth and all of sudden the lightning will strike my god ive done it backwards and you go back in and you say to the pcnow dont let the dont let the grass grow underneath your feet you see now lets do now we know lets do and lets keep on doing unless all of sudden this isnt working the thing to do then is to give the pc break and go on outside and lean up against the wall and take chew of tobacco and think it over again you understand now what the hells happened dont you sit in there trying to make do with the pc and trying to look interesting and interested to the pc and so on and reviling him and racking it up because you dont know what youre doing and so forth and what are these pieces of paper and nothing drives pc crazier man if youve got to shuffle paper send him someplace else youve got to redo his line plot because its all wrong dont sit across the table from him redoing lot of line plot and so on redoing all this line plot and crossing it all out and so forth and saying well lets see this item dharmapad i dont think that item ever existed lets see now this one was wrong oh god let him have break because the next thing you know he just becomes very very confused those are his items youre monkeying with and thats whats made him crazy for long time so there he is so give him give him break you figure it out you do it you do it accurately and if you all of sudden realize that its not going right dont keep on making good show of it but get rid of the pc or take break or something like that and figure out what the hell is going wrong and youll find out that youll be very speedy this is very fast this is very fast way to approach things the way to lose time is to go on and do something wrong because you dont know what youre doing and youre not sure and you keep on and make bluff and you keep on plunging and you keep on plunging and you keep on getting things wrong and the next thing you know well it just gets down to point of where its four five six seven eight nine ten weeks go by and youre still wrong all because you went on doing when you should have been out there taking chew of tobacco now theres how to handle this technique thats the kind of technique it is and thats going to make clears and theres sense in sitting around saying well it isnt going to make clears in my hands or it isnt the 99 and ron is wrong because youll never be able to convince you know so you might as well might as well just stop trying and succumb to the thing because i have you know ive said well thats it thats it and ive got awful good subjective reality on this ive got maybe about four items to go out of about i dont know there are about fifty items in this this second gpm and ive got about four to go this goals about ready to blow so i say youre never going to convince so you might as well stop making these mistakes because theyre not impressed at all so just go on and do it right make some clears get going because youre needed out in the field and youre needed clear and youre needed so that you can clear so lets justlets wind it up and put it on high whine and start flying huh okay thank you very much good night
