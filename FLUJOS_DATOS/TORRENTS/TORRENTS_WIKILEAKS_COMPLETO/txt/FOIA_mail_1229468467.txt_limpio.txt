tropical 20n20s results i urge you to give data for other zones as well viz sh nh gl 020n 2060n 6090n 020s 2060s 6090s plus 20n20s to have these numbers on line would be of great benefit to the community in other words although prompted by mcintyres request you will actually be giving something to everyone also if you can give n34 ssts and soi data this would be an additional huge boon to the community for the data what period will you cover although for our paper we only use data from 1979 onwards to give data for the full 20th century runs would be of great benefit to all this of course raises the issue of drift even over 1979 to 1999 some models show appreciable drift from memory we did not account for this in our paper but it is an important issue this is lot of work but the benefits to the community would be truly immense finally i think you need to formally get mcintyre to list the 47 models that he wants the data for the current request is ambiguous or at least ill defined i think it is crucial for mcintyre to state specifically what he wants even if we think we know what he wants this is not good enough foia requests must be clear complete and unambiguous this after all is legal issue and court of law would accept anything less tom ben santer wrote dear coauthors i just wanted to alert you to the fact that steven mcintyre has now made request to us doe headquarters under the freedom of information act foia mcintyre asked for monthly average t2lt values for the 47 climate models sic as used to test the h1 hypothesis in santer et consistency of modelled and observed temperature trends in the tropical troposphere i was made aware of the foia request earlier this morning mcintyres request eventually reached the us doe national nuclear security administration nnsa livermore site office the requested records are to be provided to the foia point of contact presumably at nnsa by dec 22 2008 mcintyres request is poorlyformulated and misleading as noted in the santer et paper cited by mcintyre we examined set of 49 simulations of twentieth century climate change performed with 19 different models mcintyre confuses the number of 20th century realizations analyzed in our paper 49 not 47 with the number of climate models used to generate those realizations 19 this very basic mistake does not inspire one with confidence about mcintyres understanding of climate models or his ability to undertake meaningful analysis of climate model results over the past several weeks ive had number of discussions about the foia issue with pcmdis director dave bader with other llnl colleagues and with colleagues outside of the lab based on these discussions i have decided to publish all of the climate model surface temperature time series and synthetic msu time series for the tropical lower troposphere t2lt and the tropical mid to uppertroposphere t2 that we used in our international journal of climatology ijoc paper this will involve putting these datasets through an internal review and release procedure and then placing the datasets on pcmdis publiclyaccessible website the website will also provide information on how synthetic microwave sounding unit msu temperatures were calculated anomaly definition analysis periods etc after publication of the model data we will inform the foia point of contact that the information requested by mcintyre is publicly available for bona fide scientific research unfortunately we cannot guard against intentional or unintentional misuse of these datasets by mcintyre or others by publishing the t2 t2lt and surface temperature data we will be providing far more than the monthly average t2lt values mentioned in mcintyres foia request to doe this will make it difficult for mcintyre to continue making the bogus claim that he is being denied access to the climate model data necessary to evaluate the validity of our findings all of the raw model output used in our ijoc paper are already available to mr mcintyre as i informed him several months ago as are the algorithms required to calculate synthetic msu temperatures from raw model temperature data i hope that publication of the synthetic msu temperatures resolves this matter to the satisfaction of nnsa doe headquarters and llnl with best regards ben benjamin d santer program for climate model diagnosis and
