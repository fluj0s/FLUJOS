provide d ietc adequate guidance and support for the definition and execution of its responsibilities b ietc m anagem ent had established adequate m echanism s to ensure that it understood and was

executive director unep in conjunction with the division of adm inistrative services unon division of technology industry and econom ics and the international environm ental technology centre ietc should review and issue statem ent of delegation of authority to ietc with respect to adm inistrative m atters rec 01 24 unep commented that the executive director granted the authority to director

inistrative services offered by unops to ietc with respect to the execution of the support for nvironm ent managem ent of the iraqi marshlands project the project are not sufficiently clarified recommendation to enable unep to hold the united nations office of project services unops accountable for adm inistrative work it does on its behalf the executive di rector of unep should review and revise the existing mou with unops to clarif the nature and type of adm inistrative services unops is required to provide for unep project activities rec 03 33 at the tim of issuing this report re

carried out on regular basis by ietc program managers via the inte grated monitoring and docum entation inform ation system imdis however at the ietc level there were tools or system s available for ietc program managers to m onitor and report against the activities carried out recommendation to im prove managem ent inform ation available at divisional level international environm ental technology centre ietc should liaise with office of deputy executive director unep and division of adm inistrative services unon to seek guidance of what system s could be developed to allow ietc

providing financial assistance and information to program managers with re spect to activities in the pow this was evidenced by ietc program managers experiencing dif ficulties in tracking the funds expended on ietc activities recommendation to ensure international environm ental technology centre ietc program managers are provided with adequate project 7 administration assistance ietc as part of the revitalisation exercise should prepare report for consideration by the executive director unep outlining the inade quacy of current staf fing to ensure there are adequate adm inistrative resources to cover both the administration for running the i etc office and the provision of financial assistance and inform ation to program managers for the activities within the program of work rec 06 39 unep disagreed with the recommendation and pointed out that three staff one professional and two general services were enough for the current workload in the office with imis implementation in osaka and shiga the programme managers have better easier and more accurate access to crystal reports which would allow them to get the necessary financial information on the pow oios appreciates the

voluntary contributions 51 review conducted by unep evaluati on and oversight unit in october 1998 expressed concerns that ietc was too heavily reliant on funding from the japanese governm ent consequently the previous audit aa1999557004 noted that ietc should form ulate strategy annually for seeking new funding oios observed that in the last two biennia ietc has received additional funding from the dutch governm ent which has been increasing gradually from approxim ately us91000 in 2003 to us110000 in 2005 ietc also received us11 m illion from the undg iraq trust fund earm arked by the
