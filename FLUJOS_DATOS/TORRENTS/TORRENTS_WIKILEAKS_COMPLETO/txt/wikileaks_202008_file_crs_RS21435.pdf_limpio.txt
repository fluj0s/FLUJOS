students and 2 to what extent do these students succe ssfully make the transition from high school completion to college enrollmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21435crs2 2 the number of high school

percent of the high school cla ss of 2000 were lowinco students however among those in this class who were enrolled in college in the fall only 14 were low income trends in first generation and lowincome enrollment the proportion of high school graduates whose parents do not have college degree has declined over the last three decades according to data collected by the us department of education nd the us census bureau3 over four out of five graduates in the class of 1972 would have been first ge neration college student s were they to have gone to college compared to two out of three graduates in the class of 20004 this decline of would be first generation college stude nts roughly coincides with the growth in educational attain ment that occurred during the same period in 1970 11 of the us population were college gr aduates and by 2000 this had increased to 245 the proportion of high school graduates from families w ith income below 150 of the official poverty level has remained relatively stable at around 21 over the last 30 years according to these data twenty per cent of the class of 1972 lived in lowincome families compared to 22 of the class of 2000 this parallels the rate of poverty for the us population as whole which has fluc tuated between 16 and 20 over the same period6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21435crs3 7 us department of education national postsecondary student aid study 19992000 npsas 2000 methodology report june 2002similar trends can be seen in the data on college students lthough the department has only begun to collect such data since 19877 these data indicate modest declines in the proportion of lowincome and first gene ration college students the proportion of students from lowincome families dropped from 16 to 12 between 1987 and 2000 the proportion who upon graduation would be th first in their family to get college degree declined from 65 in 1987 to 62 in 2000 second indication from these data is that the representation of first generation and lowincome students among those enrolled in college has been consistently lower than among those graduating from high school t hus it appears that high school graduates from lowincome families and those that lack parent with college degree are less likely than other graduates to move on to college closer look at the 2000 high school graduating class as stated above the overall rate of colle ge enrollment for the high school class of 2000 was 53 that is just over half of t hose who graduated in the spring of 2000 were enrolled in college in the fall of that year nd just under half were not the analysis that follows reveals that the rate of enrollment is strongly related to parental educational attainment and family income table 1 shows fall 2000 college enro llment for the high school class of 2000 by parents education the rates of enro llment for fall 2000 were 46 for those whose parents did not attain bachelors degr ee and 75 for those whose parents hold bachelors degree high school graduates w hose parents lack college degree were more than twice as likely not to be enrolled in college the fall after graduation as those whose parents have college degr ee 54 compared to 25 table 1 college enrollment in the fall of 2000 among spring 2000 high school graduates by parental educational attainment 2000 high school

additional analysis finds significant racialet hnic differences in college enrollment among first generation and nonpoor students but not among nonfirst generati on or poor students further analysis

including income occupation and educati onal attainment and that of thei r children since the late 1960s researchers have documented the various wa ys that class background is very important in determining who goes to college8 among the indicators of class background used in this research were direct measures like family income and parents education and more indirect measures like educational aspirati ons and college prepar edness all have been found to be positively associated with college attendance and completion combined effects of first generation and income status the final section of this re port takes brief look at the combined effects of first generation status and family income on rates of college enrollment table 3 shows rates of college enrollment in the fall of 2000 among those who graduated high school in the spring of 2000 by parental educati onal attainment nd family income table 3 indicates that the rate of college enrollment among students from low income families is not altered by parental education 69 of those whose parents did not attain bachelors degree were not enro lled compared to 66 of those whose parents have bachelors degree this difference is not statistically significant conversely table 3 reveals that parental educational attainment is strongly associated with college attendance among students above 150 of poverty at this income level 51 of the graduates whose parents lack bachelors degree went on to college compared to 75 of the graduates whose parent s have bachelors degree9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21435crs5 9

survey note columns may not sum to 100 due to rounding conclusion the findings presented here indicate that rates of college enrollment vary greatly by family income and parental educational attainment rates of college enrollment among lowincome and first generati on students were much lower than the overall rate for 2000 high school graduates in the final analysis of the combined effects of these factors first generation status was found to have little associati on with the rate of enrollment of low income students but was strongly associated with the rate of enrollment of students from families with greater income these results have particularly important implications for the trio programs since the legislation stipulates that not less than twothirds of program participants be both low income and first generation students the results which show that first generation status does not impact upon the enrollment rate of lowincome students might lead some to argue for removal of the first generation porti on of this requirement however since the findings do reveal lower college going rate s among first generation students from higher income families some might argue that the st atute should be amended to read or rather than and another possibility would be an amendment to the definition of lowincome to include students at greater income leve ls whose enrollment likelihood is impacted by first generation status
