randgold fireworks come tomorrow picbarry sergeant 08mar07 0300 johannesburg minewebcom good number of investors are anticipating proverbial firestorm at randgold exploration re shareholder meeting on friday in which investec an investment bank and allan gray money manager are likely to take center stage allan gray holds around 25 of re which holds potential claim of around r7bn against jci where investec is hoping to earn profit sharing fee now worth about r500m one big jci shareholder representative londonbased monty koppel has described the fee as unconscionable and sued both jci and investec allan gray which also holds about 25 of jci has indicated time and again that it is firmly in the investec camp another group of shareholders led by cape townbased trinity asset managements quinton george requisitioned fridays re shareholder meeting under specific legal relief provisions re had choice but to comply its likely that the tinder most fuelling growing investor dissent is the exact audit trail behind 2472m randgold resources rrl shares currently worth us544m about r4bn that were allegedly misappropriated from re some shareholders are effectively demanding full and transparent list of the recipients of cash raised from selling these shares rrl is listed on the nasdaq exchange in the us and also in london it owns and develops mines and deposits in mali that it purchased from australias bhp in 1996 re shareholders have previously been told that the 2472m rrl shares were allegedly misappropriated from re by network headed by the late brett kebble he was given the shove as ceo of re jci and western areas at the end of august 2005 and murdered month later so far investors have been told that re has claim for the majority of the missing rrl shares from jci the company that represented kebbles biggest personal investment but its now clear that wads of the cash went to some big counter parties beyond jci in august 2005 investec granted cashstarved jci bailout loan package mainly so that jci could follow rights issue underway by its biggest investment cashstarved western areas in which allan gray then held 25 there is little question that investecs motive in assisting jci was the need to protect the western areas hedge book probably the most toxic in the history of gold mining earlier this year gold fields new owner of western areas paid 528m in cash to kill the hedge book some 40 of the 528m in cash would have gone to investec which held the single biggest stake in the hedge book had western areas been liquidated the hedge book would have been worth zilch to counter parties back in august 2005 investec not only took control of the board of directors of jci and re it also took control of all of jcis worthwhile assets jci was forced to transfer all its assets into special purpose vehicle spv to secure loans from investec not that the loans were ever at risk shortly after kebble was given the boot david nurek walked in as jci nonexecutive chairman along with peter richard suter thomas donn edward jowell peter gray ceo and chris nissen last year jcis circular upon the sale of its stake in the letseng diamond mine in lesotho stated that the jci board nurek jowell and thomas have recused themselves as they are representatives of investec nissen may also be beholden to investec not least in his role as executive chairman of safco failing cape town fishing company hatched by kebble and one of the old school jci directors john stratton safco which engaged in number of fascinating offshore transactions was financed by investec chris lamprecht took up the role of new financial director at both jci and re but quit both jobs on may 17 2006 as in the case of jci nurek also strolled in at re as nonexecutive chairman shortly after kebble was ousted in august 2005 along with gray as ceo nissen is also director at re as is brenda madumise beyond nissens safco stains he was also director of phikoloso mining in which an infamous july 2003 transaction saw re issue 88m shares worth r260m the transaction was fictitious but the cash raised from the re shares was not as documented by res forensic auditors umbono madumises position as an independent nonexecutive director of re is tricky given that she was also director of phikoloso grays position is also challenging he retired as md of socgen johannesburg not paris branch around august 2000 and took up the position of ceo at tsec in november 2002 tsec was kebble entity created under black economic empowerment bee haze socgen has been named as handling and then selling on january 16 2006 4m of the missing rrl shares but the finer details have never been given there has never been any explanation beyond the risible as to why gray and nurek should continue as ceo and chairman of both debtor company jci and its major creditor re but allan gray seems trapped clause 25 of investecs term sheet back in august 2005 made loans to jci conditional on irrevocable undertakings from allan gray limited acting on behalf of its clients and the kebble consortium to vote in favour of the shareholders resolutions appointing andor maintaining the various reconstituted board of directors in terms of this term sheet while fridays re shareholder meeting has been forced re has also called one of its own at about the same time it appears to be as clear as day that the only two uncompromised re directors johann blersch and tom dale are going to be given the boot that would require motley collection of shareholders including investecs irrevocable commitment from allan gray
