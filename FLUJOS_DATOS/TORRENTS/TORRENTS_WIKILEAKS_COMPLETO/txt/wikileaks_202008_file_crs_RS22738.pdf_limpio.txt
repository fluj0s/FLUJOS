rico 402 f3d 45 1st cir 2005 emtalas statutory scheme has traditionally been deconstructed into two principal categories 1 provisions that ensure an ppropriate medical screen ing and 2 provisions that require stabilization before transfer or discharge5 emtala only requires stabilization of whatever emergency conditions hospital det ects and does not provide right to indefinite care for anyone who comes to an emergency room hospitals and physicians that fail to comply with th requirements may be fined 50000 andor excluded from participation in medicare and hospitals may additionally be civilly liable to persons who suffer personal injury6 emtalas sanctions ma be suspended by the secretary of health and human services during national emerge ncies and were most recently suspended in the gulf coast regi on during hurricane katrinas landfall in 20057 the screening requirement only hospitals that 1 participate in medicare and 2 maintain an emergency department are required to screen patients under emtala8 hospitals that do not have dedicated emergency department are not subject to the screening requirement of emtala9 similarly emergency care providers that are unaffiliated with hospital need not comply with emtala even where those providers are the only medical care facilities reasonably accessible10 for example in rodriguez v american intl ins co of puerto rico the first circuit declined to ex tend emtala protections to 24hourhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22738crs3 11 rodriguez v american intl ins co of puerto rico 263 f supp 2d 297 d puerto rico 2003 arguing that the nature of

emtala to rural clinics unaffiliated with hospitals but had not done so emtala does apply to facilities designated as critical access hospitals which provide 24 hour emergency services and acute

tially ambiguous language in the regulations 17 42 cfr 48924b prior to the promulgation of these regulations the seventh circuit had held that contacting hospital via telemetry alone does not invoke emtala johnson v univ of chicago hosps 982 f2d 230 7th cir 1993 these regulations are consonant with that holdingemergency room clinic in rural puerto rico because the clinic was not associated with hospital the federal district court for the district of puerto rico had initially held that because the clinic was the primary provider of 24hour emergency health care in its area applying emtala to the clinic best furthered the statutory goal of universal access to emergency medical care11 however the first circuit reversed holding that any considerations of the goals of congress were inappr opriate where the text of the statute was clear12 the screening requirement is triggered when an individual comes to the emergency department of hospital and requests to be treated13 under hhs regulations an individual may be deemed to have come to the emergency department in certain circumstances even though the individual is not physically present in the emergency department or elsewher on the hospital campus14 for example patient enroute to hospital in an ambulance or air transport owned by that hospital has come to the emergency department of that hospital and may not be re fused screening exam under emtala these regulations also state that incoming patients in ambulances that are not owned by the receiving hospital have not come to the emergenc department and may be redirected if the hospital is in diversionary status15 however at least one federal court of appeal has rejected this interpreta tion of the statute and has held that emtala could be triggered by an incoming ambulance that was not owned by the receiving hospital16 in either case should an ambulan ce ignore redirection request emtala is triggered when the patient physically arrives at the redirecting hospital17 what constitutes an appropriate screening exam although hospitals with dedicated emergency departments are re quired to perform screening exams it is

note 28 at 1166necessarily violation of emtala if screening exam falls short of either local or national medical malpractice standard18 the language of the statute requires only an appropriate medical screening exam19 the majority of the federal circuits have held that because the chief evil sought to be prevented was the lack of access for uninsured patients an appropriate exam is one comparable to what paying patient would receive under similar circumstances20 however the sixth circuit has construed the statute more narrowly holding that there is violation of emtala without th additional allegation of an improper motive that led to substandard screening exam21 the stabilization requirement like the screening requirement the stabilization requirement applies to all medicare participating hospitals with dedicated emergency department however in some cases the stabilization requirement may also apply to medicare participating hospital even if it does not have an emergency partment for example if treatment of an individuals medical condition requires par ticular hospitals uni equipment or expertise federal regulations compel that hospital to accept tr ansfer of that patient from any nearby us hospital22 the stabilization requirement is triggered when hospital discovers that an individual has an emergency medical cond ition actual knowledge of an emergency medical condition is required23 therefore if hospital fails to accurately detect an individuals emergency conditi on and discharges that indi vidual without stabilizing the medical condition the hospital may not ve violated emtalas stabilization provisions however the hospital may still be civilly liable to the individual based upon state medical malpractice claims if the failure to detect an emergency condition was due to negligence during the screening exam24 interpretations of the stabilization requirement except where medically necessary hospitals must ensure that an individual is stabilized

below 33 notice of proposed rule 67 fed reg 31403 314756 may 9 2002 34 bryant v adventist health sys 289 f3d at 11681169transfer federal regulations define an individual as stabilized as either 1 when there is reasonable assurance that material dete rioration would result from that individuals transfer or discharge from the hospital or 2 in the case of women in labor after delivery of the child and placenta25 unlike the screening requirement the language of the stabilization requirement does not qualify the care to be given as appropriate26 based on this textual distinction the us suprem court has held that improper motive need be alleged to show violation of emtalas stabilization provisions27 stabilization and inpatient status when an emergency medical condition is detected hospital may decide to admit the individual as an inpatient for further treatment whether the stabilization requirement continues to apply to patients after they have been admitted is disputed issue b ecause the statute only defines stabilization in the context of transfers the fourth nint h and eleventh circuits have held that hospital has stabilization duties that are enforceable under emtala once an individual has been admitted28 however the sixth circuit disagreed in thornton v southwest detroit hosp 29 in that case stroke victim alleged she was discharged from the icu without being stabilized in viola tion of emtala after 21 days of inpatient care the sixth circuit held that emtala still required stabilization before discharge despite her inpatient status30 the supreme court declined to rule on this issue in roberts v galen although it had an opportunity to do so31 however during oral arguments for that case an assistant solicitor general arguing as amicus curiae informed the court that the department of health and human services intended to begin rulemaking procedures to provide guidance on this question32 in 2002 the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms issued notice of pr oposed rule extending emtala protections to inpatients33 many solicited comments pointed to the bryant v adventist34 decision holdinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22738crs6 35 notice of final rule 68 fed reg 53221 532435 sept 9 2003 comments also expressed concerns that emtala would usurp existing protections for inpatients 36 42 cfr 48924d2 inpatients are still protected by other medicare

preempts any state laws that directly conflict with emtalas provisions 42 usc 1395ddf the fourth circuit later clarified baby ks holding in bryan v univ of virginia ruling that emtala only mandates treating patients emergency medical condition not the patients general medical condition bryan v univ of virginia 95 f3d at 352 therefore had the hospital admitted baby k afte r stabilizing her emergency respiratory distress it would not have been required to then treat her underlying anencephaly bey ond warmth and nutrition id 40 42 cfr 48924e2 41 42 cfr 48924e1iib otherwise35 and in 2003 cms reversed its position stating that if after performing screening exam hospital admits an individual for treatment of an emergency medical condition then the hospital has sa tisfied its duties under emtala36 stabilization of known emergency conditions the stabilization requirement may preempt certain state laws authorizing physicians to decline administering treatment where deemed inappropriate based upon their medical judgment in in re baby k hospital sought declaratory judgment that they were permitted to refuse to treat an anencephalic infant in respiratory distress37 the hospital argued that the prevailing standard of care for anencephalic infants was to provide warmth and nutrition without mechanical respiration and that virginia st ate law authorized physicians to refuse to provide care they believed would be inappropriate38 the fourth circuit disagreed and held that the requirement of stabilization prior to transfer or discharge was compulsory once an emergency medical condition had b een identified by hospital personnel even where the treating physician believed stabilization treatment would have been futile furthermore the court held that emtala preempted the virginia statute authorizing the physician to refuse to provi treatment he reasonably be lieved to be inappropriate39 requirements for transfers after stabilization all transfers must be conducted with qualif ied personnel and equipment an individual may not be transferred unless the receiving hospital consents to receive the individual the receiving hospital must have the capacity and expertise to treat the transferred individual and all medical records must be sent to the receiving hospital it is the transferring hospitals obligation to ensure that the transfer has been performed as described above and the transferring hospital remains liable under emtala until an appropriate transf er is completed40 it is not violation of emtala to transfer an individual who has not been stabilized when it is medically necessary to do so in ch situations qualified medical person as defined by the hospitals own rules and regulations must certify that the benefits of transfer to different fac ility outweigh the risks involved41
