international congress of dianeticists scientologists enewsletter the test of case improvement now the truth of the matter is you very often will process preclear who is on hectic frantic level of communication which appears at first glance upscale and you start processing him and the next thing you know he doesnt anymore talk like this hes starting to talk like this you changed his communications thats all you were trying to do and because they slowed down did not mean that you worsened the case they might have slowed down you see and gone under his control that would be the test now it would take more processing to speed them up under his control but theres the test of whether or not youve done something for case not because communications are sacred but because communications are the best representation of the handling and direction of footpounds of energy thats the number one index its right there because it includes perception and it includes force excerpted from the international congress of dianeticists scientologists energycreation capacity and communication level an article by l ron hubbard from the international congress of dianeticists scientologists if you wanted to know what was wrong with an office you would simply walk through and give everybody communicationslag test and fire all the people who had lag and the office would straighten up that would be all there was to business efficiency if you used this point now this is horrible fact but in treating preclears this is of the greatest importance to you because if you havent changed the communication lag you havent done anything for the case now why is their communication lag going to stay slow is it just willful perfidiousness on the part of the preclear is it just the orneriness and meanness of the mest universe that would make person into this condition what is it its scarcity of energy they cant put out any space because any energy that comes into the space is immediately drawn up into the bank at such rate that the space collapses and so they dont have any space and out in front of them if you ask somebody real quick youd say whose space is it in front of your nose flash and theyd say others somebody elses theyd say georges or bills yet person ought to own at least foot in front of him very few people do great many people dont even own their noses and great great many more dont own anything in front of their ears nothing forward of the ear they havent even got this space this space belongs to somebody else why is that its energy starvation now person has gotten lot of impacts at some time or another in his life and these impacts act as sponge for further impacts and the person has begun to believe that he himself cannot create energy theres only one thing for which the whole universe punishes theres only one punishment one crime and that in its fullest sense is communicating thats the one crime putting out an anchor point thats essentially communicating putting out an anchor point is the one thing for which person could get punished which tells you why the people that get to the rank of general and admiral get there its traditional in every army and navy of conservative country that person is advanced in the ratio that he doesnt do anything if he commits crimes he gets there and this isnt criticism of it its just the way things operate its just the way things operate it just happens that thats the way it is and they dont want to get well and so we cant do anything about it can we well anyway the only thing that is punishable is putting out an anchor point and so you can tell how often this person has been slugged slapped hit by the reluctance he has in putting out an anchor point but there is another thing here at work it is the remaining the residual potential person has in creation of energy some people have tremendous energycreation capacity and these people can take an enormous slugging around without altering their communication level thats because theyre still up above that break on the tone scale although the energycreation potential might be different isnt necessarily but might be different for every individual on earth there is this similarity amongst all individuals there is point above which they create manufacture and direct their own energy and below which they depend upon energy from exterior sources before they can operate that would be the makebreak line the goals of processing then should become very manifest to you they should be the restoration of the ability to create and direct energy now to direct energy one must have good sense of location and so the rehabilitation of location as well as the rehabilitation of the ability to make space as well as the rehabilitation of being able to create particles in that space all come under the same heading how do you know if the preclear is in better shape hes in better communication l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture processing and its goals this lecture is available in the international congress of dianeticists scientologists the test of case improvement energycreation capacity and communication level international congress of dianeticists scientologists international congress of dianeticists scientologists here are some examples of what you will find out in this series ron shows you how to get into action in life assist the society around you spark other minds encourage creativity and make better civilization in which to live how to get anyone to create space and extend anchor points matter what shape theyre in why being starts thinking how to exteriorize person with scenery how can you tell in few seconds who to hire and who to fire how lowtoned people take space away from you the two levels of thought which make up the paradox called man how the bank soaks up thetans energy ron answers questions on everything from bodies in pawn to exteriorization and anchor points to vitamins and even economics how different people react to the command to be three feet back of your head and the impact this can create on being ron describes the role of scientologist in the society with the eight things scientologist should be doing to raise the level of the culture and create better civilization includes 15 lectures complete with transcripts an extensive glossary
