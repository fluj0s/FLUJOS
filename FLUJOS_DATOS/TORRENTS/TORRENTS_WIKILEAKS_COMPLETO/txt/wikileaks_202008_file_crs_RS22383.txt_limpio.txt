budget authority for fy2006 although six infrastructure security programs which the administration proposes to consolidate into the targeted infrastructure protection program had aggregate budget authority of 415 million for fy2006 the percentage change of 446 is relative to 415 million 3 pl 109295 does not allocate specific amount for nongovernmental organization security instead it directs the dhs secretary to provide any remaining funding following the allocation of uasi grants to these organizations at the secretarys discretion crs4 the presidents budget also included structural proposals for these programs first the administration proposed to consolidate six infrastructure security grants into the targeted infrastructure protection program tipp4 the consolidation was initially proposed in the fy2006 budget request but congress chose to fund those programs as part of the budget authority for the urban area security initiative uasi grants tipp allocations would have been at the discretion of the dhs secretary second the administration proposed to change the current distribution formula used to allocate state homeland security grant program shsgp funds to states the administration would have reduced the guaranteed amount to each state from 075 to 025 of total shsgp appropriations5 dhs would have allocated the remaining appropriations for shsgp on the basis of risk threat vulnerability and unmet capabilities and uasi funding would have also been allocated based on risk threat vulnerability and unmet capabilities as determined by the dhs secretary pl 109295 does not change the distribution method for the programs in the 109th congress the house and senate passed versions of hr 5441 which did not propose funding for consolidated targeted infrastructure protection program the house and senate versions of hr 5441 proposed separate appropriations for port rail httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22383 intercity bus trucking industry and buffer zone protection security programs pl 109 295 does not consolidate the separate programs into consolidated tipp in the conference report accompanying pl 109295 hrept 109699 the conferees stated they were disturbed by the delay in issuing the final national preparedness goal6 and absent the final version of the goal national preparedness lacks clear direction and grant funds cannot be most efficiently allocated to states and localities additionally the conference report directs dhs to distribute grant funding in the same manner as fy2006 dhs is to ensure that terrorismfocused program funding is not to be directed to allhazard activities and dhs is to continue to evaluate shsgp letpp and uasi applications based on risk and on how effectively these grants will address identified state and local homeland security needs7 congress directs the government accountability office gao to report on the validity relevance reliability timeliness and availability of the risk factors and the application of those factors in the allocation of uasi and the six infrastructure security programs to the committees on appropriations later than 45 days after enactment of pl 1092958 4 the six uasi subgrants include port rail trucking industry intercity bus nongovernmental organizations and buffer zone protection security programs 5 pl 10990 fy2006 dhs appropriations title iii provides guaranteed amount of 075 6
