how and why auditing works lecture given on 17 april 1962 now this is still the 17th of abril after the coldest march in seventy years on twentytwo days last march the thermometer was below 30 this seldom happens here in january im sorry maybe you wont see display of rhodies that you would ordinarily see here on the grounds most gorgeous sight you ever saw rhododendrons here because we were out looking at them and many of their buds had been frozen but we still have hopes that they will manufacture some more saint hill special briefing course now i want to tell you some very important facts of life now and then now and then when youre growing up it reminds of marine sergeant marine sergeant came home and his little brother had been having bad time so his mother marine sergeants mother said why dont you take your little brother out back and talk about the birds and the bees the marine sergeant says okay so he takes him out and he says now look joey he says you know he says you get out your scooter go along the street you pick up goil you run her along back of hedge you know you know that kind of thing and joey says yep he says well birds and bees same way and i want to tell you why auditing works reference any publication or bulletin which discusses the twopole nature of the universe theres whole mathematics based on this by the way by man that i was very happy to meet one time buckminster fuller bucky fuller he invented dymaxion geometry hes stress analysistype man pure mathematics and that sort of thing dymaxion geometry proves that the universe couldnt exist without two poles everything has two poles there is not one of anything in this universe youve heard mention this before from time to time now in recent lecture i described to you the lowest level of observation or it get its so low that its nonobservation and that is being something remember the fellow couldnt see it because he was it thats your lowest level of observation now you see this in human behavior all the time the fellow cant observe what hes doing if he knew he was doing it he wouldnt do it but he actually cant observe what he is doing and thats to limited extent because he cannot observe himself now know thyself is an old philosophic saw and i think it was basically and originally introduced as trap for thetans the only way you could know yourself of course would be to view yourself now the goals problem mass contains in it anything you know about problems why does problem hang up because its postulatecounter postulate intentioncounterintention goalcountergoal and these two things being of equal strength hang up when theyre not of more or less equal strength they dont hang up an overwhump occurs one way or the other and you dont get hangup its never any problem to be shot youre just dead and thats that you see i mean if youre going to be seriously shot see its not problem to be shot it is problem to be shot at while shooting at somebody now that is probably primary problem and that is why war is protested against and why it stays with us because its bunch of guys shooting at bunch of guys wars which happen suddenly on total overwhump basis one really never hears much about them probably theyd never be objected to either and they certainly wouldnt hang up on the time track but these wars particularly static warfare hang up because youve got balanced forces and it hangs up in time and the more balanced the force the more hung up in time thats all you want to know how long war is going to last just estimate the force of nation and the force of nation b and of course in view of the fact that were dealing with general staffs when were dealing with war we have to equate the stupidity of one as compared to the stupidity of another and this is balancing factor now if that stupidity were equal and the forces of both nations were equal and the destructions accomplished were equal that war would go on forever there must have been something like this occurring during the hundred years war and that must have been the way it was you see and so it went on and on now goals problem mass means that the intentions of type of beingness oppose the intentions of type of beingness more or less equally to hang up and become part of the goals problem mass it must be exactly equally that of course is nearly impossible which is why you have so few items in the goals problem mass you have to have equal opposition just as weve really only had one hundred years war in the last many many many centuries you see why itd be very rare that you would get type of valence exactly against and balanced against type of valence dont look at this as goingon forever dont you see because person has been many more beings than are contained in the goals problem mass many many more beings and why arent they hung up well they just werent at that delicate opposition of one versus the other which gave us the fist against the fist which balanced it so as to make it drift in time and we get equal forces exerted one against another and we get an illusion of time and so it just goes on forever in time and that is why goals problem mass stays with the person and of course all there is all youve ever learned about reactive bank all that we know about mental energy phenomena and all the rest of it it just is contained in this thing goals problem mass now theres free track where person has not had an opposed lifetime and running engrams you run this free track of course its available its free and it erases but what hes up against is this nonfree track thats whats really rough where the valences versus the valence you see the type of identities versus the type of identity he has lived many lives as waterbuck and has opposed in those lives the tiger and has lived few lives as tiger and has opposed waterbucks and you get this kind of greprrrrrrrrrrrr and theres going to be nothing happens then except this stays there in the bank totally opposed to total opposition you see and its just balanced in time now frankly it is so difficult to make two of these valances bash up against the other its almost unheard of you see the chances against it happening are just fantastically remote that you get hangup over trillennia trillions of years you see of two types of identity oh itd go away sooner or later dont you see itd slip itd wear out itd get erased but those things in the goals problem mass have not worn out have not slipped have not gotten erased have never become overbalanced and are there in that delicate balance which maintains them in present time and theyre maintained in present time and they are the reactive mind now in view of the fact there are tremendous numbers of minds available for these you see each type of personality of course becomes mind you have tremendous numbers of minds in the reactive mind with tremendous numbers of retrained responses then for each one of these that is hung up you have an accumulation of locks and these can number into the hundreds for every one of these items now lets say well this is not an accurate figure but lets just get some idea of it lets say theyre average two hundred items as lock items for each valence that was hung up that would make four hundred for two valences wouldnt it and lets say there were twenty of these packages do your own mathematics any one of those is mind see the locks are as effective as the keystones of the gpm see its just the locks derive their power just because theyve got youve got two of these things hanging up one against the other now the locks can become just as effective on the individual as any one of these hungup things and before you get it straightened out every one of those see in their thousands are separate mind capable of thought capable of action and reaction with set solutions and nowimsupposedtos to all existing problems connected with them and they can be pretty dopey they got everything in them in other words and that composite lot is the reactive bank if you add to it the few areas of free track that hang on both sides youve just about got the lot see this lifetime has certain areas of free track and other lifetimes didnt happen to get mixed up in this and you get free track and the individual can run this free track free track oddly enough explain lot of things to him but never quite unravels it all there is always that reservation it didnt quite unravel everything do you see what this is all about now in other words the fellow galumphed along and he was very fine and he was doing wonderfully and he was polar bear and he went for long time as polar bear and he went swimming in the ice and everything was marvelous and he ate fish and so forth and youre not going to find that he didnt have any trouble as polar bear hes never posed anything as polar bear he went on being polar bear of course he got engrams as polar bear but thats fine and then one day one day he decided one day he decided all on his own you see to start being seal up to that time as polar bear he had never eaten any seal because this is early on the track you see and he accidentally knocked polar bear you see off of an ice pack and this started getting very complicated one way or the other so he decided well the devil with that i dont want to be seal i dont want to be polar bear im going down into the warm latitudes and heres an interesting looking animal waterbuck up to this time he doesnt have any reactive bank to amount to anything see oh there are incidents and oppositions and so forth but here he goes now hes waterbuck and he runs away from tigers and he antagonizes tigers and he has hell of time with tigers and one day he becomes tiger and he eats waterbuck and antagonizes waterbuck and has hell of time with waterbuck and one day he becomes waterbuck and has hell of time with tigers and just messes up tigers and pretty soon this is getting pretty gloomy to him and as waterbuck hes blangbang concentrated on nothing but tigers and as tiger hes blangblang concentrated on nothing but waterbucks hes been waterbuck more often than tigers but nevertheless hes mocked up the counteremotion of tigers and the counterforce of tigers often enough so that this is perfectly balanced and from that time there on waterbuck can collect minds tiger can collect minds this probably went on for long time and nothing much happened and he got into another sphere and one day he became priest and then he was mean to the vestal virgins and the vestal virgins were mean to the priest and he was priest and then hes vestal virgin and he got to be priest some more and he ate more vestal virgins and then he was vestal virgin and ate up more priests and weve got another one but there could have been could have been millions and millions hundreds of millions billions of years between the time the waterbuck and the tiger got together up to the time he became the vestal virginpriest package you see but because these packages exist they tend to lock up the rest of the track other pieces of track run into them collide with them and so on so the whole track begins to look like snarly mass of something or other but right internally in the middle of it why youve got these two poles the waterbuck and the tiger and just up adjacent to those youve got the vestal virgin and the priest and then you have got the god and the devil and youve got all kinds of wild oppositions but these oppositions each time they are perfectly balanced make new goals problem mass package and then these perfectly balanced opposing forces or opposing identities accumulate to themselves any other identity thats hanging around and youll get collapsed track now these are represented in the bank by spherical masses inside this spherical mass are compartments of thought there is an internal compartment of thought because the fellow usually had head and he did his thinking in the middle of the head so the goals problem mass tends to approximate head and its got thinkthinkthink in the middle of the head and its usually empty and theres lot of little compartments all through the goals problem mass which have ideas in them and you have the idea of force encl you have force enclosing ideas or force enclosing thought the trapped thought in other words and these can be dramatized they are not stretches of track they are crumpled up pieces of theyre crumpled up track in spherical shapes and that sort of thing now where these things are exactly counteropposed against other spherical shapes you see you got the waterbuck the tiger proposition these things are hung up one against the other clank to such degree that neither one can go away now all this comes down to attention of course doesnt it it comes down to all of the other factors you know but this is the final material form which it takes that we call the goals problem mass of course whats waterbuck do all day long but look out for tigers and whats tiger do all day long but prowl around looking for waterbuck and its just concentration concentration concentration concentration and eventually these two identities just get smashed together by this fact and youve got the dramatization of problem it floats in time all sorts of other dramatic or dramatizing factors here the individual is years years later hes busy selling hes busy selling boats you see and oh oh trillennia later he becomes boat salesman and he shows somebody that it is very very easy to paddle this little ski contrivance you see and he says you just slide over the back of the thing you know and kick your hoofs you know and he goes on and after while he the customer says you kick your hoofs whats that and he says i didnt say anything like that but he did see itd be hangover just momentary restimulation they revert to this type of pattern you will find some persons been dog and dog and cat and theyve got the dogcat goals problem mass package of some kind or another very equal balancing there if youve ever seen cat lick dog why you know it can be quite equally balanced thats why theyve always stayed foes and this dog has been dog long time ago and he hasnt been dog for ages for trillennia he hasnt been dog and hes living life as human being and everything is going along fine and he goes to bed and his wife thinks its fine hes fine his wife thinks hes fine but of course he turns round and round and round and round and round before he goes to sleep he has various explanations for this but these explanations are all just based on the fact hes been dog now all of this is very obscure to the person and to the auditor and you actually would be amazed the intricacies youd have to go through to figure out what the fellow had been by observing his behavior but after you find few of these items in 3d criss cross all of sudden you say oh you know oh i see yes ooooh yes it all now becomes clear and it wouldnt be clear because frankly there were thousands of possible choices from which this sudden habit of lrh noises with his lips lughing came from you see been most anything now the twopole character of the universe is something you should keep in mind electronically power can be generated in this universe in the absence of two poles you have to have two fixed positions in space before you can have any electrical current of any kind that is something that you would learn the hard way in physics you can take two poles and put them smash against each other or one inside the other and you could grind away with little wheels and all sorts of things for well trillennia without generating any power there would be electrical current of any kind whatsoever thered be electrical masses of any kind whatsoever if there werent two poles there have to be at least two poles now maybe you could have threepole fivepole sixpole twelvepole type of arrangement but remember the basic is two poles you could add new poles you could do all sorts of things but youve got to have two poles and thats fundamental and basic now the mind is composed of energy which exists in space and which condenses down into masses in the reactive mind there is time all time is now thats because of the poised character of these valences we must assume that if we have current standing waves electrical masses flows and other phenomena which are very easy to demonstrate in the human being there must be two poles involved youre about to learn the facts of life here there must be two poles involved otherwise youd never have any flows would you person would never have any ringing in his ears and frankly would never have somatic it requires two poles even to hurt its the twopole nature of things that from which all else proceeds now this sounds very intricate and i can see somebody now saying oh not about electricity well ill tell you all you need to know about electricity take your two fingers shove them into the mains you will learn all there is to know about electricity at that moment because you can actually put one finger in one prong and you can sit there and hold it all night and youll never get shock you dont notice any reaction there until you put two fingers in there one on the other prong and then youd know all there is to know about electricity you would have subjective reality on the fact that it required two poles to have any electricity go anyplace or anything happen and thats fact all right now whats this got to do with the cchs well it has everything to do with the cchs auditing is effective only in the presence of two poles effective auditing is two poles now there can be more poles scattered around but it requires at least two poles for auditing to occur this doesnt say that its impossible to selfaudit this doesnt say that it is absolutely necessary always everywhere to have an auditor that is not the case because you yourself at one time or another have run burn out of your finger and have done touch assist on your left ear or something and had it work but in that particular instance when it worked you were operating with two poles you were observing something you might have been being mass while you were observing the other mass but you had two poles going do you see that and one of the things thats been bugaboo to auditors from time immemorial is the pc who never cognites he just stirs on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and hell run processes and processes and processes and if he was processing himself he would go on and chew and chew and chew and chew and on and on and on and hed get ideas occasionally and they would come and they would go and they would erase and they would go on and on what an arduous activity the individual is running on one pole now the pole that hes running on happens to have thought in the middle of it and energy standing energy waves outside of it well hes in the thought area and he keeps running through the energy as thetan and hes just chewing on this energy you see and he gets into the thought zone and he only gets the ideas that are packaged inside that thought zone you see hes being that mass he is that mass he is not viewing the mass he is it so of course he cant view it because he is it and being that mass he is not viewing another mass so hes being himself and nothing else and not looking at anything else and there he could chew and chew and chew and chew forever you see how that would be can you imagine this glass now now were going to show you something graphically now just imagine this glass here as mass of energy or mass of mass or anything else well just as glass and now we get the idea get the idea of thetan being this glass to such an extent that he would never say i am thetan he would only say i am glass you see he couldnt conceive of being anything else but glass and now lets say hes very introverted glass and can never see you this glass isnt looking at anything never see the table never see and lets say he went on chewing on this glass would he ever make any gain in processing well the probabilities are he wouldnt and there is the picture of the nocognition case thats your minimum tone arm cognition case the person is being something observing nothing now it would be perfectly all right for this fellow to be this glass providing he could also view as glass something else he doesnt have to view anything as thetan he could view something as glass he all of sudden gets the idea well i i can rrr glass im glass you see and im glass and i can look at this cigarette lighter and here he is see heres glass and heres cigarette lighter oh well weve got two poles now and as glass he can look at the cigarette lighter he can asis this cigarette lighter things can happen with regard to this cigarette lighter he can do some control of it he can do some other things and youre sure going to get tone arm action and theres also something going to happen to the cigarette lighter thats for sure but you see as one pole the glass and being only the glass youre never going to get any tone arm reaction because youre never going to get any energy movement how can there be energy movement for energy movement to occur or diminish or increase or anything else youve got to have two poles and if the individual only is one pole and hes being that pole see he isnt thetan being glass hes glass why of course he could chew forever and if he was getting tone arm motion while you were auditing him of course he would get tone arm motion while you were auditing him because theres flow but as glass he is made to audit up against the cigarette lighter ah you get tone arm action ah you get change because the cigarette lighter is also going to react against the glass let assure you you see that youre going to get case change youre going to get change of these masses therefore youre going to get change of ideas do you see this you must never have in an auditing situation onepole situation thats all the individual is being man see hes not ever he has masses he has ideas this is your poor psychologist the poor guy he is brain never looks at anything never does anything he never does thing you see hes hes being man and thats all he is being he couldnt be anything else but man and if hes relatively introverted man why hes had it because he never sees anything else never gets any changes of potential never gets any anything and thats why the psychologist concluded that man could not be changed he concluded this as scientific conclusion and several years ago we were always being held up to scorn as dianeticists or scientologists because we said man could change and now he teaches in his universities nothing else but that man changes hes tried to disprove testing to get rid of us hes tried to do all kinds of things to himself to get rid of us he keeps doing things to himself hoping well go away and now today he more and more realizes what he is well hes scientologist he hasnt found it out yet but thats what hes being you get the idea were probably terribly good for him hes probably the first were probably the first thing he ever looked at since 1879 now get the idea here of glass action one pole the glass and the cigarette lighter two poles action now we see this easily in the auditing situation here is the auditor here is the pc something on that order or heres the auditor heres the pc see all right ah if we can get the pc to look at the auditor weve got two pole situation twopole situation thats all so youre going to get change but the pc who never finds the auditor never has any change theres the cchs at work and theyre only as good as that occurs and better when you dont have twopole situation in the cchs if you dont have the pc observing the auditor ahha you get change from the cchs has to be twopole situation all right well go into that little bit further but lets go on now to 3d criss cross what condition must exist for 3d criss cross or some think process to exist or any think process to exist ah the fellow is being one mass in his mind able to look at another mass in his mind the fellow its perfectly all right for the fellow to be mass in his mind but he also has to not only be that mass but be capable of looking at another mass in his mind and then you get tone arm action listing nulling youre going to get tone arm action but if hes only being one mass in his mind and cant view any other mass in his mind but this one mass youre not going to get any tone arm action its as simple as that dont you see so at the stage of the cchs the auditor and the pc furnish the two poles actually the auditor does not have to constitute solely the other pole there is the whole present time environment to constitute the other pole or any other pole or many other poles once in blue moon we have taken person who was having an awfully hard time and said look around here and find something thats really really really really real to you and they looked around the room and they eventually one person found silver teapot and my god she went over and she grabbed hold of the silver teapot and heaven and earth couldnt get that silver teapot away from her that was oneshot command she turned sane on silver teapot she found out there was something in the environment beside herself silver teapot so she got big change see oneshot change do you see how why that would be so it isnt just the auditor in the cchs that can constitute the second pole now is there anything in the pc that can constitute the second pole well theres two ways that the cchs could be run dumbox style which is well great deal of study of the steam engine would be about the best way to achieve this style and all you do is observe this steam engine and you observe the fact that it does nothing but have certain wheels go around and certain shafts move and certain hiss come out the exhaust pipe and the auditor gets so that he can make his arms go around and his piston go and hiss at proper tone 40 and he thinks hes doing the cchs all right thats fine odd part of it is theres enough mechanics built into it that even then itll work the cchs go from bright white to gray they do not go from bright white to black so this flaw in the cchs might not be observed some auditor might think the cchs were absolutely wonderful and he was doing it at the lowest shade of gray that you could obtain cchs will always produce change on case one way or the other so you never observe the fact that they can be done completely wrong you see how that is i mean theres gradient scale of wrongness and it doesnt ever get to black you cant be absolutely wrong in the cchs but the degree that you drift from white is measured by the length of time the pc spends under cch processing and the more gray it is the longer the pc is under processing do you see that in other words the less properly these are done they can be done totally mechanically and in five hundred hours everything is wonderful with the pc you see they can even be done totally mechanically and halfwrong most of the time and youll get some sort of result you see cch is actually its almost if the guy was as bad as shook the pc every now and then and said i like you you know occasionally or something like this somethings going to happen after five hundred hours something because you got two pole situation youre working with twopole situation regardless of what point of the tone scale now lets now do it right this is how to really speed up the cchs cchs are matter of bringing the pc to present time now why do you want to bring the pc to present time if what you really want to do is get him back down the track into the gpm ah thats because the gpm is upside down backwards locked in crossed up and theres so much keyed in in present time that it takes you quite while to get to these masses unless present time is more or less quote unquote achieved by the pc in other words you can do lot of keying out of masses before you do 3d criss cross and make 3d criss cross much more workable so do the cchs for while and key out several of those inverted loops see hes got stuff keyed in from the year zero you know well lets get that you know lined up little bit and hes got the vestal virgin where the waterbuck ought to be and so forth and its all messed up in other words locks are all curled over into present time and hes dramatizing some lock on the early track so hard you see that you cant even get to real piece of the goals problem mass you see the locks are so active hes got lock terminal you know murderous husband got lock terminal see its just lock it hasnt anything whatsoever to do with the real terminal but its locked up on it the real terminal isnt even murderer you see it isnt even that close the real terminal is probably bad wife and hes got this keyed in and somewhere or another murderous husband its all keyed in well its nothing that you would even want to come near in gpm because it isnt even part of the gpm you see its just locked up on it you do the cchs thatll fall into line otherwise hes got problem with his wife every couple of days see hes restraining himself from killing his wife every couple of days so he gets big gpm every day every couple of days he gets big ptp every couple of days he just has trouble hes just having trouble all the time well you do the cchs you kind of lay this stuff back on the track you see get him up to present time get him out of some of these things well how do you do that how whats the expert smooth way of doing that first thing you do is bring his attention over onto you do the cchs two ways at the same time you get his attention over onto the auditor and of course by utilizing communication control and havingness of the environment you of course attract the pcs attention to the environment because these are the mechanics of communication and duplication and that sort of thing the things that youre using you see all right and at the same time youre doing this you handle the doublemass factor in his mind see you not only handle the doublemass factor in the environment heres the pc being pc looking at the auditor and looking at the environment you also handle this in his mind how do you handle this in his mind at the same time by maintaining twoway comm with the pc of course how do you do that well you treat the pcs every twitch as an origin every time the pc does something youll notice that the pc doesnt notice most of these things that he does you call the pcs attention to it by querying say what was that you know any way you want to say you could say how does that feel now what the pc is the common response see why did he say what why hasnt he noticed it oh well thats because hes being the single mass hes being somatic for gods sakes hes being habit hes not even being being see and because hes being it he does it and you say what was that and the pc has to go back up here and look at what hes doing and he says what and you say that oh oh that ouch in other words you exteriorize him from this manifestation do you see its actually very easy every time he does something you exteriorize him from it if you fail to do so oh pass it on catch it next time now what are you doing in the cchs youre setting up twopole situation between the pc and the environment which includes the auditor and youre setting up twopole situation in the mind by insisting that there is something there except youd insist very gently by asking what is that that there is something else there besides the pc all the time and the pc has choice but to slip out of the somatic so he can look at it and then you get twopole situation going in the bank and so you get change change change change change change change change now what happens in 3d criss cross this again is an elementary situation youre finding what the pc has been and when he sees it he ceases to be it you recognize that when the pc is listing oh lets take five hundred item list you know hes been every one of those items every single blasted one of those items just the business of listing you know two hundred trillion years is lot of years if you dont believe it why just think back sometime anyway hes been every one of those items that hes listed well let say this hes either been them or raised hell with them hes had an intimate acquaintance with each one thats for sure well look how many youve made him differentiate five hundred times you made him exteriorize five hundred times oh this begins to look like route 1 doesnt it you made him exteriorize to some degree from five hundred identities less the one two or three hes being so obsessively he cant see them and the last one the pc thinks is it is always it why because if he werent being it it wouldnt hang up and keep reading if he knew which one it was accurately he wouldnt be in it thats where we get the idea of if the pc knows whats wrong with him that isnt whats wrong thats for sure because if he can look at it he isnt in it see whats wrong with him is what hes being so obsessively that he cannot observe it so youve exteriorized him from five hundred items to some degree except the last the last one and when that finally exteriorizes ooh that was the one that had all the charge on it oooooh thats bum one he gets cold he gets this and he gets that of course youve walked him back to what hes being now you find the oppterm and thats what hes concentrated on while hes being this hes concentrated on that and you start getting this whole package start blowing up right in his face because youve got twopole situation sitting right there in the bank and it starts discharging now the thing that makes the gpm hard to tie down and 3d criss cross little bit difficult to do is sometimes he is so obsessively being the internal items that are close in and so slightly being the first items that you find you see hes still being them but not to that obsessive degree which you might expect later but he doesnt come close sometimes this is not always true but he sometimes doesnt come close between the terminal and the oppterm you think youve got package like this but you very often dont get your terminal package like this you get terminal package this is the commonest early package is you get terminal and then plausible opposition terminal only there are twelve in between before they meet each other see if youre lucky youll hit them dead on the nose and they just go poof but when they dont go poof and they hang up youve just got many more packages intervening ill give you an idea pc finally finds the item child and then we oppterm this item and its badness oooooh see that was right at the end of long long intensive on pc by the way thats not quite what i said but to protect the case well you see we just fell short of getting the phfft we had all the items all combed down here to where theres only about two items left holding the whole bank together and we got the item next to the item that opposed the child that was sad day because it meant we didnt have time to give the pc any more auditing and it meant that we had to do more lists to get in close you see what we had was this kind of situation see see that isnt going to blow because that is the package see just the see thats the package there see and we found this leave it there whats there well thats exactly what the pcs being is whats there you see this you got to have twopole situation now anybody that knows anything about exteriorization should really roll up his sleeves when we were telling people to bop out of their heads and go sail about by the way youre going to be about six minutes more youre going to be about ten minutes late for this evening is that all right with you if i finish the lecture or should i stop right now audience all right the pc has got knowingness really of his beingness we look at this fellow hes being man he isnt being man actually in the way down deep in the reactive bank the most reactive thing about him and so forth and it makes him do this that and the other thing is waterbuck or something see and the reason waterbuck is hung up is because its tiger and sometimes he dramatizes the tiger you see and he the last thing hed recognize this you say to little johnny why dont you stop biting your fingernails and little johnny says his first reaction is do i bite my fingernails see wait minute you know hes gotta starts worrying about himself because he never noticed he was biting his fingernails before you see he never asked himself who or what would bite fingernails you know he goes around thinking theres something wrong with him because he shouldnt bite his fingernails well we dont know why he bites his fingernails somebody says its an absence of calcium id say it was prevention from scratching out waterbucks eyes splendid way to keep from scratching waterbucks eyes out keep them all bit off see real good now if i dont develop claws i wont get that nasty into any of these nasty situations whereby i suddenly get pulled into the water you know and drowned like last time i was tiger or something you know you got something wild going on and lord knows what the explanation will be but person starts worrying about himself that is such loose language whats he worrying about well you have to step back to take look and all of the cchs straight through to the end of 3d criss cross should simply be succession of stepping back to look and early in the game one steps back as beingness or an object or something to look at another object and later in the game one simply steps back as thetan to look at mass you still got twopole situation youve got thetan and you got mass in all of the processes youre doing from cchs right on up through to the end of 3d criss cross are exteriorization processes now when we originally told somebody to be three feet back of his head do you realize how often he came out as mass he went back in too didnt he the only thing we were doing was we were just overshooting his ability by about hundred thousand lightyears we were exteriorizing somatic we were doing all kinds of wild things in actual fact your 3d criss cross from the word go is an exteriorization process youre exteriorizing out of his past his past identities if you please his past energy masses if you please his past problems if you please all of these things youre exteriorizing him out of one after the other hes not ready to come out of his head why man he hasnt been in head for well incalculable so in cchs if you run the cchs very smoothly youll have present time sufficiently quiet and inviting and orderly and positive that the individual will start exteriorizing out of bits and pieces of the past we dont care what bits and pieces of the past he exteriorizes out of or if if he does more than say oh that somatic well i wonder what that was you see he was being it an instant before it turned on its been there all the time but he couldnt feel it because he was it he can only feel it when he wasnt it now as your individual is processed on the cchs he goes through sequence of exteriorizations little past this and little past that and little past something else and something else and he keeps exteriorizing and exteriorizing we dont care anything about what from were just trying to make him look at present time and its going to shift the bank thats for sure and of course we dont get him really basically all of him anywhere near present time but it feels like it to him it feels better to him and when weve got him up as much to present time as we can make it with the cchs why then we ought to kind of clean him up so his rudiments will stay in and get him over on to 3d criss cross and then of course we start exteriorizing him out of all the beingnesses he has been and all the whatnesses and so forth sometimes you get lots of whats and conditions that the person exteriorizes out of before you ever get beingness and you get these things and you exteriorize him out of them wholesale lots and of course if youre hitting these things on the button and youre doing good job why hes just coming out of mass after mass of course hes coming out of mass as mass and as mass he is inspecting other masses you will only get tone arm action to the degree that the individual is looking at something and you wont get tone arm action unless the individual is looking at something we dont care what he is being while he is looking but he has to be looking at something now of course substitute for looking lowerscale lookingness is feelingness and you can sometimes do bunch of feelies and get someplace with the cchs where you might not now knowing that knowing what i told you there and so forth you actually youve got all this you could dream up whole bunch of cchs you dream up whole bunch of them you know you could take your various drills of communication and to the room to you to this to that you know and treat them all repetitively you know good duplication you could dream up cchs like mad but of course they wouldnt be any good if you didnt keep calling the pcs attention not just to present time but to his bank because he wouldnt come out of his bank would he hed just lock up hed slide out of his bank accidentally you can actually kick him out of his bank you know you say gimme your paw mate and thank you and he gives you his paw and as he does this he says oomp and you say well good you thank him you see you finish your cycle thats moot question whether you finish your cycle and ask or just ask but you say what happened there well what oh shoulder oh yeah shoulder ooooh it it it raised hell just minute ago yeah it kicked yeah it did didnt it big win see exteriorize him out of somatic of course these somatics will turn on and off kind of automatically without ever calling his attention to it and to the degree that you never call his attention to it and keep him in twoway comm on the subject and keep him calm about the whole thing to that degree he wont progress see so youve got five hundredhour cch staring him in front of you you could extend the cchs to the degree that you didnt make your drills precise and repetitive and follow the rules of the cchs in general just the basic rules and to the degree that you didnt keep present time attractive for the pc all very important see he wants to do it for you and keep his attention on whats happening to his somatics or twitches or something of this sort see if he did those two things hell those the pc will just sail on the cchs they are not slow process they are very fast process 3d criss cross is fantastically fast process if you get the idea of how many exteriorizations per unit of time the pc is doing man it must look like the telegraph poles going by to him you can exteriorize him one after the other one after the other and exteriorize him exteriorize him exteriorize him you do list differentiate the list null the list well youve exteriorized him very well out of 497 and indifferently out of two and found out he was stuck in one and he keeps forgetting the one its hard to remember the one how does he re yeah yeah cant look at it hes just remembering it you told him so he remembers it get the idea and then you find the other side of it and maybe everything goes clank you know or smash ooooh or maybe its been going smash the whole time you see and he eventually is the one he can look at the other and so on and hes and youll find him for days hes likely to go around trying to be the waterbuck looking at the tiger and the tiger being the waterbuck trying to say well i wonder how it really feels to be waterbuck well i wonder how it feels to be tiger i wonder how it feels i wonder how waterbuck would think of tiger how would waterbuck think of tiger i cant conceive of being waterbuck cant conceive of it and frankly i cant make up my mind about tiger he wont even know hes dramatizing them because hes obsessively being them well when youd get into that combination why youd need little higher boost but again its just exteriorization but to summate very rapidly its twopole universe unless you have two poles you dont have ta action if you dont have ta action you dont have two poles so you must be doing something wrong thats simple if you got ta action and youre getting items and youre calling the pcs attention to it and arc exists matter what youre doing youre exteriorizing him from things and youre straightening him on up and bringing him on up the line as case thats for sure and thats basically all there is to the theory and practice of auditing now if you did that very neatly you could actually figure out ways by which this could be done see you could take almost any pc and exteriorize him out of something even if you had to kick him in the head say look at my boot you know kick him in the head say look at my boot and i tell you sooner or later hed see your boot man im not advising that sort of thing its much better sometimes pretty girl sits there and audits this fellow for five or six hours and all of sudden he gets kind of dazed look on his face and he looks across from him and he realizes pretty girl is sitting in the other chair first gain ten hours later he knows its an auditor maybe that evening he finds out its an auditor okay well thats thats what i wanted to tell you about this that actually is the first time ive been able to phrase accurately and precisely as communication unit exactly what auditing does and exactly what youre doing as an auditor and its fairly brief comprehensible summary i think youll find out and it possibly will make your auditing lot easier to do thank you very much good night
