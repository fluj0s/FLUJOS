been increasing and is now considered significant threat to the health of the current salton sea ecosystem ecosystem changes in the sea were exemplified by several large dieoffs of fish and birds that inhabit the sea some of these events included endangered species such as the brown pelican the sea receives most of its water from agricultural drainage originating in the imperial and coachella valleys in california when water transfers from agricultural lands in these valleys to municipal wate r districts in san diego were proposed to reduce californias reliance on water from th colorado river concerns about the environmental impacts of these transfers on the sea surfaced the proposed water transfers would have resulted in less water flowing into the salton sea which according to some scientists would increase the rate of evaporation in the sea so that salinity levels would be lethal to most fish and wildlife in less than 10 years interest in restoring the salton sea was evident before its role in water transfers was realized severa l studies were done by state and federal agencies to determine baseline data about the sea and potential manage ment regimes for restoring the sea federal efforts to study the sea were amplified with the reclamation projects authorization and adjustment act of 1992 title xi of pl 102575 which authorizes research to develop plans to c ontrol

containi ng provisions that would allocate an estimated 300 million for restoring the salt on sea was enacted by the state of california whether or not to restore the salton sea remains controversia l some who favor restoration argue that the value of the sea is high because it is one of the remaining wetland habitats in the region for migratory birds fish and wildlife further some argue that the sea has potential for econo mic development r ecreation and tourism some against restoring the sea believe that the sea is destined to evaporate similar to the water bodies in the salton basin that

funding and developing plans to restore the salton sea stems from the value of the sea as habitat for federal and state listed endangered species as well as other migratin g and resident bird species reservoir for agricultural drainage center fo r recreation and wetland ecosystem1 the salton sea is located in southern california and is considered the largest inland water body in the state figure 1 the salton sea was formed in 1905 when levee break allowed water to flow into the salton basin from the colorado river uninterrupted for 18 months2 the salton sea was not the first body of water in the basin several other lakes have existed in the basi n throughout its geological history3 interest in the ecological health of the salton sea has amplified since 2002 when negotiations of proposed water tran sfers in southern california began the proposed water transfers woul d have diverted agricultural water from farms in the imperial valley to san diego and the coachella valley this was expected to result in less water flowing into the salton sea which some scientists predict would have increased the rate of evaporation in the sea so that salinity levels would be lethal to most fish and wildlife in less than 10 ears questions over how environmental impacts in the salton sea would be mitigated and who u ltimately would be responsible for their costs pl ayed large part in the negotiations on september 12 2003 the state of california enacted three b ills that contain provisions that would allocate an estimated 300 million for restor ing the salton sea these funds were secured when the quantification settlement agreement qsa was passed on october 10 20034 the agreement allows california to gradually reduce its over dependence on the colorado river to 44 million acrefeet in the absence of surplus water through voluntary agriculturetourba n water transfers nd other water supply programs the agreement will attempt to protect inflows to the salton sea for

authorize the creation of an advisory committee for restoration activities and set deadline of 2006 for the california state re sources agency to prepare restoration study of the salton sea background the salton basin where the salton sea is located has supporte d many lakes and water bodies throughout its geological histor the last of these prehistoric water bodies was lake cahuilla wh ich dried up nearly 400 years ago in 1901 portion of the colorado river was diverted through th imperial canal to irrigate agricultural fields in the salton basin water flowed through the new alamo river and into the imperial valley from this channel5 in 1905 water from spring floods broke through levee diverting portion of the colorado river and began forming the salton sea water flowed uninterrupted for nearly 18 m onths into the salton sea before it could be turned back to the gulf of california the sea formed as closed basin with outlets this is still valid today the sea consisted largely of fresh water at its inception and immediately began to ev aporate and increase in salinity due to the construction of the hoove r dam and the all american canal in 1928 some water from the colorado river was directly transferred to the imperial valley for irrigation after flowing through agricultural lands this water entered the salton sea and prev ented it from completely ev aporating in 1924 and 1928httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31820crs3 6 ibid 7 cohen et haven or hazard 8 since 1986 advisories against consuming fish in quantities above eight ounces every two weeks have been posted for the salton

for the withdrawal of lands located in and around the salton sea these lands were designated as repository for agricultura l subsurface and surface water drainage during this period dissolved salts in the colorado river water combined with evaporation led to an increasingly salin sea and subsequent population reductions in freshwater fish species in 1950 when the salinity of the sea was roughly equivalent to the ocean the california department of resources began transferring saltwater fish species to the sea some species thrived in the sea including the orangemouth corvina cynoscion xanthulus and gulf croaker bairdiella icistia 6 during this period and in the next two decades the sea became popular des tination for sportfishing and tourism however changes to the sea including th inundation of resort areas and wildlife habitats bird and fish dieoffs and health threats of untreated water among other things led to decline in recreation and development around the sea in the 1960s7 health advisories for example included posted warnings against human contact with the sea and consuming fish from the sea8 the stench of dead fish and concern over inorganic and organic pollution from the sea were also factors that led to less interest in inhabiting the shorelines of the sea in the mid1980s recreation around the sea had dropped nearly 50 since the 1960s9 in the past few decades the focus of activities concerning the sea has been on the environmental problems it faces the current salton sea ecosystem has problems ranging from poor water quality to loss of habitat the new river provides water to the salton sea after it flows through the urban area of mexicali mexico and the imperial valley as the urban area of mexicali increased water pollution from sewage treatment plants agricultural runoff and other sources of pollution has increased water inflows to the sea from another country illustrate the complexity of efforts to re gulate water pollution in the sea10 elevated levels of selenium and dde have been detected in sea fish and wildlife selenium can cause variety of physical problems in humans and was one of the reasons for advisories against cons uming too much fish from the sea dde which is derived from ddt is also found in waters of the sea ddt was banned in the united states in 1972 but is still used in mexico as an insecticide both dde and

riparian corridors due to the loss of wetland habitat in southe rn california and throughout the states vast central valley the salton sea is regarded as pr imary stopover point for birds on the pacific flyway12 the salton sea is periodically inha bited during the year by the second largest number of bird species in the unite d states including some federal and state recognized threatened and endangered species13 in one season for example more than 380 bird species were observed surveys have estimated that the total population of birds in the salton sea can reach up to 500000 birds per month14 the sea also provides habitat for large fish population most of wh ich were originally introduced manually or through drainage ditches leading to the sea the most ubiquitous species in the salton sea is the tilapia oreochromis mossambicus which was introduced by farmers to control weeds in their ponds15 the ecosystem properties of the salton sea are largely determined by its water level chemical and salt centration and balance between the rate of evaporation and water inflow nearly 75 of the water flowing into the sea comes from agricultural runoff originating in the imperial and coachella valleys in california the other 25 is from rain and other surface inflows16 the salinity of the sea has been increasing over time recent studies have reported that about 4 million tons of salt enter the sea annually as water evaporates the centration of salt increases presently the salinity level in the sea is approximately 44 part s per thousand ppt which is approximately 25 greater than ocean water and onesixth that of the great salt lake utah 280 ppt high salinity vels combined with high concentrations of other toxic substances eg naturally occurring selenium nd disease is thought to be factor in the mortality of fish and birds in the sea17 largescale mortality of fish and bi rds in and around the salton sea received national attention in the 1990s in 1992 for example

198610842have died from consuming fish with high selenium levels whereas other scientists attribute grebe mortality to disease definitive answers to these deaths were not found18 in 1994 another 20000 eared grebes died and in 1996 approximately 20000 american white pelicans pelecanus erythroryhnchos and brown pelicans pelecanus occidentalis died in and around the sea19 the death of brown pelicans was especially dramatic since it is federally listed endangered species listed in 1970 indeed avian mortality was reported to be high est in and around the sea in the 1990s compared to other decades the cause of mortality in these events was largely attributed to microbes that lead to disease in birds20 the origin of these microbes was unclear lthough some scientists have ttributed them to contaminated fish that were eaten by birds large fish kills are also reported in the sea including the mass mortality of tilapia and gulf croakers bairdiella icistia dead fish were thought to have weakened immunity because of high levels of toxins eg selenium and dde and parasites and low levels of dissolved oxygen in the sea21 low immunity in fish will increase their chances of contracting disease and dying high salinity levels are also thought to affect fish populati ons in the sea scientists regard salinity levels of 33 37 ppt adequate for ocean living organisms beyond salinity levels of 40 ppt fish may have limited reproductive succe ss and physiological stress22 the mortality of bird and fish species in and around the salton sea is of concern because of federal and state listed endangered species that inhabit the sea for example the brown pelican and yuma clapper rail rallus longirostris yumanensis are federally listed endangered species wh ich reside in and around the sea during the year other endangered species such as the peregrine falcon falco peregrinus and threatened species such as the bald eagle haliaeetus leucocephalus are occasionally seen at the sea as they ma ke their way along the pacifi c flyway the desert pupfish cyprinodon macularius is the only endemic fish species in the salton basin and was listed as an endangered species in 1986 in 1986 the us fish and wildlife servi ce fws issued biological opinion for the desert pupfish23 in this opinion the fws stated that both agricultural drain maintenance activities by the imperial irrigation district

that there was large number of desert pupfish inhabiting the drains this opinion also covered the effects on the yuma cl apper rail and califor nia brown pelican conserving endangered species in the salton basin is one of the objectives of the salton sea authority which formed in 1993 to remedy problems facing the salton sea indeed some policymakers assert that the presence of endangered species in the sea obligates the federal government to restore the sea and designate it as useful water body restoration activiti in the salton sea some of the ecological problems in the salton sea were foreseen by scientists in the 1960s who noted that salinity in the sea was increasing at rate that would eventually render the sea inhabitable for fish and wildlife early studies that attempted to create base of information for restoration activities focused on understanding the hydrological and saline prope rties of the sea since then several federal state and private entities have developed proposals to restore the sea primarily by controlling its salinity and maintaining its water level see appendix for examples federal efforts to restore the salton sea were amplified with the passage of the reclamation projects author ization and adjustment act of 1992 title xi 1101 of pl 102575 this act came on the heels of massive dieoff of eared grebes approximately 150000 from january to ma rch 1992 as well as the issuance of second biological opinion on the desert pupfish that limited incidental take of species when agricultural drainage areas were maintained see appendix for more information the act direct s the secretary of the inte rior to conduct research to develop plans to control sa linity levels provide habitat to endangered species enhance fisheries and protect recreational values in the salton sea ten million dollars were authorized in this act for this effort seven years later the authorization and funding for restoration activities in the salton sea ex panded with the passage of the salton sea recovery act of 1998 pl 105372 this act authorized the secretary of the interior to conduct f easibility studies and economic analyses of various options for

tributaries that flow into the salton sea to counter environmental changes in th salton sea and support restoration and management activities the federal government has provided approximately 367 million in funding to date26 the state of californi has provided approximately 108 million to date for similar activities and has approved 20 million to fund the development of restoration plan further an estimated 300 million from water transfer fees is expected to be generated for restoration activities in the future summary of the primary fede ral management and restor ation activities in and around the salton sea is presented in the appendix27 in addition to the listed activities there have been several specific studies on various biological and hydrological properties of the salton sea conducted by private inte rests university personnel and state and federal agencies several restoration project s have been administere d through the salton sea authority the salton sea authority is joint powers agency chartered by the state of california to ensure the beneficial uses of the salton sea such as maintaining the sea as an agricultural drainage reservoir restoring the wildlife resources and habitats around and in the sea stimulating recreational use and providing an environment for ec onomic development around the sea28 this agency is comprised of riverside and imperial counties the coachella valley water district imperial irrigation district and the torres martinez desert cahuilla tribe federal and state agencies have representatives on the authority as exofficio members29 the salton sea authority collaborated with the us bureau of reclamation bor to provide draft environmental im pact report and environmental impact statement in 2000 that provided five altern

latest information on some alternatives for restoring the sea including engineering feasibility and cost estimates31 other plans have been proposed by public and priv ate interests such as the pacific institute nonprofit organizati on in california and the us filter corporation the largest water company in the united states all of the proposed restoration plan s include mechanism for reducing or stabilizing the salinity level of the salton sea some plans expect to accomplish this by creating evaporation ponds and implementing proce sses that accelerate water evaporation other plans propose dividing the sea into hypersaline section and managed section with low salinity in most plans the resulting brine from evaporation and removal techniques is di sposed to locations away from the sea some plans also propose the construction of desalinization plant that would treat water entering the salton sea and send it to re gional users the cost of restoring the salton sea according to most of these pr oposed plans ranges from 10 billion to 90 billion32 on april 22 2004 the salton sea authority endorsed restoration plan for the salton sea that calls for the construction of causeway across the center of the sea this would separate the sea into two ba sins an 85000 acre north basin that would reach salinity levels similar to the ocean nd southern section that would consist of wetlands areas as well as numerous recreational lakes ranging from fresh water to hyper saline the estimated cost of this project is 738 million this plan is now under review by the california partment of water resources conclusion taking water out of the imperial and co achella valleys is expected to reduce water inflows to the salton sea and increase the level of salinity in the sea over relatively short period unless the salinity level in the sea is stabilized or reduced its ecosystem will soon be unable to support th current diversity of fish and wildlife some proponents for restoring the sea base their arguments on the value of the salton sea as one of the few remaining habitats in the region for migratory birds and other fish and wildlife with nearly 90 of californias origin wetlands gone the sea according to scientists is of regional or national importance to pelicans and cormorants wading birds waterfo wl shorebirds gulls and terns33 indeed some scientists believe that because of the connectivity of the sea to the migratory patterns of hundreds of species of birds the environmen tal health of the sea is directly relatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31820crs9 34 ibid 35 according to the bor water use in mexi can urban areas on the border may increase if water quality is improved this may lower water inflows in the new river and hence reduce water flowing into the salton sea to the population health of these birds34 the value of the sea can also be measured in terms of its potential for recreation nd economic developmen t eg tourism as well as its function for agricultural drainage some opposed to restoring the salton s ea base their arguments on the premise that the salton sea is destined to evaporat and eventually convert back to desert ecosystem throughout geological histor water bodies in the salton basin have eventually dried up leading some scientists to hypothe size that evaporation and conversion to desert would be the progre ssion of the salton sea if restoration activities are undertaken some critics also argue that sa linity levels will increase in the sea despite restoration attempts especially if water inflows to the sea are reduced by water transfers or other diversions35 further some argue that the high cost of restoration and the scientif ic uncertainty of the rest oration proposals do not warrant the expenditure of federal f unds some critics of restor ation also suggest that if restoring wetlands for environmental reas ons is paramount then efforts should be made to use funds to restor naturally occurring wetlands in california instead of in the salton sea they cite the san francisco bay sacramentosan joaquin rivers delta restoration calfed effort as an example of where funds can be allocated to restore naturally occurring wetlands the question of whether or not to rest ore the salton sea is expected to be addressed in the near future as negotiations continue over water allocation in southern california if restoring the s ea becomes federal or state priority then determining how restor ation will be funded and what restoration plan will be used will be issues for congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31820crs10 appendix
