relations stagnation in usegyptian bilateral relations as the 30year anniversary of the camp david peace accords approaches most observers believe that usegyptian re lations must be revitalized although diplomatic ties remain str ong the current paradigm of the relationship has grown stale and condemnation of egypts poor human rights and democratization record has increased both in the us media and in c ongress from egypts standpoint there has been deep disappointment and anger directed at the us government as many egyptian officials believe that their coope ration with us policy in the region has been taken for granted they argue that egypt dutifully upholds its peace treaty obligations with israel and has pushed othe r parties in the region to pursue peace in addition the egyptian military f acilitates us military requests for transit of the suez canal overflight of egyptian territory and storage of us military equipment in egypt yet while other arab government s have received add itional us support in recent years egypts annual foreign assistan ce package has remained flat and despite its lobbying plans for possible usegy ptian free trade agreement have been put on hold us officials have found it more difficu lt to defend usegy ptian relations in light of continued reports of regimesponsored suppression of peaceful opposition figures while many us policymakers continue to express gratitude for egyptian military cooperation intelligence sharing and contributions to international peacekeeping operations it would seem that both parties have had difficulty in publicly framing the relationship around any one issue egypt continues to push for more active us role in the middle east peace process while the united states continues to push for meaningful government reform in egypt albeit less intensely since the 2006 hamas electoral victory in pa lestinian authority gislative elections the core question for the administration nd congress remains how to preserve the strategic benefits of close military intelligence and diplomatic relations with egypt while promoting political and economic refo rms that will ensure the stability and development of egypt over the long term experts have posited variety of reas ons for the current stagnation egyptian critics have called their government gerontocracy noting that 80yearold president hosni mubarak continues to be surrounded by some of th same advisors and cabinet officials from the early 1980s while so egyptians consider such stability reassuring others contend that the egyptia n government needs to be infused with new generation of civilian leaders analysts continue to speculate over mubaraks 44yearold gamals possible ascension to the egyptian presidency and what his

increase historical background egypt during the colonial era egypts relations with the west including its current friendly relations with the united states are colored by long hist ory of foreign intervention in egyptian politics which has made egypt along with other arab states wary of outside influences on their domestic affairs in the 19th century egypt was semi autonomous province in the ottoman empire which by then was in decline and being propped up by the british in order to serve as buffer between it and czarist russia at the time egypt was viewed as extremely valuable to the british and french empires and was prized for its agricultural output large domestic market and strategic location between the mediterranean and red seas most importantly the british saw egypt as vital to securing the sea route to its most prized colony india ottoman weakness led its sultans to grant europeans certain legal protections and economic advantages in egypt which s tifled the egyptian economy by flooding it with european manufactured goods driv ing local merchants out of business1 over time egypt developed cash crop economy based almost solely on the export of cotton the price of which cons tantly fluctuated leaving the economy vulnerable and dependent on good harvests without strong diverse economy egypt could not generate enough capital to fund its modernization leading it to become even more financia lly dependent on the west as it rulers borrowed huge sums from european banks six years after the completion of the suez canal in 1869 egypt was forced to sell all of its shares in the suez canal company which operated the canal in order to ma ke payments on its foreignow ned debt when egypt could longer pay its debts the british and fr ench became directly
