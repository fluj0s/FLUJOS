the buy american act1 the major domestic preference statute governing procurement by the federal government is quite broad in scope applying to all federal procurements that do not come under one of the five exceptions2 enacted in 19333 the act attempts to protect domestic labor by providing preference for american goods in government purchases in determining what are american goods the place of mining production or manufacture is controlling the nationality of the contractor is not considered in determining whether product is of domestic origin4 there are five primary exceptions to the buy american act the act excepts procurements 1 to which application would be inconsistent with the public interest 2 for which compliance would require unreasonable cost5 3 of products or services for use outside the united states 4 of products not produced or manufactured in the united states in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of satisfactory quality6 or 5 for under 25007 the third exception exempting articles or services purchased for use outside of the united states8 would apply to most contracts for the reconstruction of iraq this exception is not limited to only the country of use but to products of any origin9 for example the exemption has applied to canadian steel towers for use in west german communications system procured by the military10 and military bases leased from foreign governments11

buy american act is domestic preference enacted to govern specific type of procurement that for some reason is exempt from the buy american act this is usually necessitated because procurement is for articles for use outside of the united states targeted domestic preference provisions have often been attached to the appropriations acts for the agencies making the procurement in question and are of the formnotwithstanding any other law funds may be used to purchase not made in america the most well known of these acts is commonly referred to as the berry amendment and requires domestic origin

in providing government aid for the reconstruction of iraq little buy americanlike provision in the foreign assistance act of 1961 authorizes special rules for the source and nationality of commodities and services financed by usaid13 these special rules are set out at 22 cfr part 228 and apply to goods and services financed directly with program funds under the act14 detailed rules restrict contracts and subcontracts by categories of countries classified according to certain foreign policy considerations 15 also special rules require us procurement of agricultural commodities with some exception motor vehicles designed for normal road speeds and pharmaceutical products16 other rules set forth usflag requirements for transporting procured goods17 and yet other provisions set forth preference requirements for placing marine insurance18 the existence of the usaid provision does not preclude the enactment of little buy american act aimed specifically at iraqi reconstruction funds such provisions have in the past been attached to an appropriation placing buy american restriction on the use of the funds
