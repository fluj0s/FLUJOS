and sometimes the primary source of income for consumption and investment moreover the presence of remittances in the international economy presen ts several policy concerns fo r the united states these range from making remittance services as cheap and yet as safe as possible to possible implications for us immigration polic this report will be updated introduction in speech to the world bank on sept ember 22 2003 secretary of the treasury snow stated that remittances from the deve loped countries to people in poor countries play crucial role in economic development with recorded flows reaching over 70 billion per year and far exceeding official velopment assistance he further added actual flows are believed to be significantly higher given that remittances often flow through informal channels the use of informal channels indicates that there is room for improvement in our formal financial systems and that we can reduce the cost of remittances thereby increasing the flows significantly1 unlike private flows or official assistance remittances are unrequited meaning there is corresponding claim on the assets of the foreign country the united states is the largest source of remittances sending around 23 billion in 2002 according to the international m onetary fund this represents very small percentage of th us balance of payments any negative economic effect of these outflows on th us economy would be negligible in his address to the world bank secretar snow highlighted two important points 1 remittances are major source of capital for developing and ss developed countries and 2 significant amount of global re mittances are transmitted through unregulatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21910crs2 2 manuel orozco worker remittances an international comparison

million immigrants in the united states alone with most of them sending money back home to their families2 according to wayne abernathy assistant secretary of the treasury for financial institutions remittances are quickly becoming the central source of new capital for many countries3 such massive private giving worth almost twice us oda official developmen t assistance is changing the nature of development states carol adelman formerly with the us agency for international development4 background one analyst posits two reasons for the migrationremittance cycle5 the first is pure altruism citizen leaves hi s country and remits money to ta ke care of those left behind the other extreme would be pure selfinterest the remitter wants to invest his income in his home country and sends the money to his family to take care of giving small amount of it to them as payment for looking after his funds in between the two extremes are reasons that have come to be known as the new economics of labor migration6 this theory sees remittances as an intertwined network between the migrants and those living back home sending migrants abroad is ofte n an investment decision and an effort by households to overcome local market failures and constraints for example if developing country cannot employ its popul ation household can invest its abundance of labor by sending part of the population abroad the remittances sent back are the returns on investment for the family the international monetary fund and worl d bank define remittances as the sum of three components 1 the money value of transfers sent to their home country from workers living abroad for longer than one ear 2 compensation of border seasonal and other nonresident employees and 3 migrants transfers or the net worth of migrants who move from one country to another httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21910crs3 7 dilip ratha workers remittances an important and stable source of external development finance global

total remittances7 according to one expert while it is difficult to measure accurately the total volume of financial activity associated with the system it is estimated that at minimum tens of billions of dollars flow through hawalas and other informal value transfer sy stems on an annual basis8 some analysts think that the official statistics may be becoming more reliable as the united states and other gove rnments have cracked down on informal money transfer systems for example pakistan record ed 24 billion in remittances in 2002 compared to 11 billion in 2001 this increase could re flect true increase in the nominal amount of remittances or rather shift toward the formal sector9 for the most part the collection of remittance data is an inexact science with many countries not reporting flows trends in global remittances total 2002 remittances were around 75 billi on with latin america the largest recipient by far since 1996 the western hemisphere prima rily the countries of latin america has seen more than 200 in crease in remittances from 115 billion in 1996 to 244 billion in 200210 while asia saw spike in remittances around 1997 due to the asian financial crisis following the crisiss resolution remitta nces returned to precrisis levels and are only now returning to their 1997 high figure 1 charts global worker remittances by region from 1996 to 2002

markets 2001of all the forms of international capital flows remittances are the most stable private commercial capital flow s tend to be procyclical during times of economic expansion such as during the 1990s intern ational investment especially in the developing countries increases when th economy goes into recession as it did in 2001 private capital flows contract unlike pr ivate flows remittances do not fluctuate with the overall international economy figure 2 compares remittances to other forms of investment over the time period shown remittances fluctuate the least and are the only source of flows to developing countries that increased thr oughout the time period shown while remittances are larger than official sector flows they are still substantially smaller than foreign direct investment fdi or private capital flows yet the gap has narrowed in the past five years the decline in private capital flows is consistent with the economic downturn during this period on reason among many is that contraction in the money base leads to less money invested in the developing countries which are often considered riskier than investments in the developed countries figure 3 shows the largest global remittance recipients in addition to looking at the nominal figures it is interesting to compare the top twenty nominal recipients with the countries where remittances comprise the largest percentage of gdp the two largest remittance recipients on nominal basis mexico and india are not even within the top twenty countries when remittances are counted on percentage of gdp basis although the philippines receive the third most remittances in the world as percentage of gdp basis they rank 24th for countries such as tonga lesotho and jordan remittances represent between 14 and 13 of their gdp11 for these and other low inco countries remittances represent much larger component of the economy th an countries like i ndia and mexico that receive more remittances overall when remittances represent such rge component of countrys economic activity if the remittance flows are interrupted the consequences could be devastating following the collapse of the somali government in 1991 remittances accounted for between quarter and 40 of somalias total gnp12 since somalia lacked formal banking sector these remittances were sent largely through one firm barakaat

somalia lost 25 million to 27 million per month in remittances13 while many other companies have filled the void left by barakaat the somali situation underscores major policy concern for the united states regarding remittances how to make remittances as cheap as possible for senders yet also ensure that the system is secure from money launderi ng and terrorist financing especially when countries use informal money networks moreover if good mone and bad money flow through the same channels how can you only isolate the bad money to be stopped by stopping all the flows large amount of ill will and antius sentiment is created among the majority of the population that relies on these remittances to survive14 since informal systems are not subject to any systematic supervision they have traditionally operated outside the purview of international regu lators unlike banks credit unions or formal money transfer systems such as western union and moneygram informal value transfer systems are difficult to regulate the effects of remittances on developing countries consumption at its most basic level remitta nces fund the consumption of goods and services in the local economy for t hose in the developing and least developed countries monthly remittances of just fe w hundred dollars are enough to lift many out of abject poverty two exampl are ecuador and cape verd ecuador suffered major economic and political crisis in the 1990s in 1999 and 2000 more than 267000 ecuadorians emigrated prima rily to europe followi ng this emigration remittances jumped from an estimated 643 milli on in 1997 to 14 billion in 200115 in 2000 the island of cape verde off the coast of africa had 435000 people living on the island with twice as many cape verdians living abroad approximately twothirds of the families on the island receive remittances and for many of them it is the only source of income16 investment some analysts express concer n that remittances to many countries are used solely for consumption and thus ve little if any inves tment effect without money being saved and invested in development projects it is difficult to stimulate economic growth other analysts state that if remittances increase the consumption of domestically produced goods and rvices there are valuable mu ltiplier effects that reverberate through an economy increased consumption can stimulate the local housing market local agriculture and textile industries remittances can also help ease capital and liquidity constraints faced by entrepreneurs in developing c ountries as noted earlier ma

sectors with poor credit and fina ncial markets some analysts contend that remittances can have multiplier effect by forcing the development of banking and credit sector in developing countries the effect on investment is stronger for developing and transition ec onomies 2001 study of remittances and migration in ea stern europe found that remittances had stronger effect on investment than they did on consumption17 in egypt large number of migrants who returned in the late 1990s set up their own businesses using funds that they had earned working abroad18 other analysts are not as sanguine about the effects of remittances chami fullenkamp and jahjah found that since re mittances are compensatory they increase as economic cond itions worsen in the recipient country and since they occur in an environment of asy mmetric information the sender cannot directly observe how the remitted funds are spent as well as economic uncertainty remittances can create sense of dependency and lack of incentive to increase productivity cape verde discussed earlier provides an exampl of this phenomenon in the countries they assessed the authors found that remittances led to decreased output and lower levels of economic growth19 potential issues for congress to date congressional intere st has focused primarily on the cost and efficiency of official remittance services that cater to immigrant workers in the united states20 as immigrants continue to utilize the informal sector additional regulation may be needed to insure the safety of these financial flows from money laundering and terrorist financing21 following the september 11th attacks the bush administration and the international community are taking various efforts to improve the informal sector and to make the formal banking sector as attractive as possible both for migrant remitters and for their families in their home country there may also be implications for us migration policy there is the issue of allowing illegal immigrants access to us banking services in the mexican case available by some banks through the matricula consular program22 us officials may also wish to consider costbenefit analysis of both the migrationremittance sector and us foreign aid and development programs these sectors can complement each other and many argue that their relativ effectiveness s hould be assessed
