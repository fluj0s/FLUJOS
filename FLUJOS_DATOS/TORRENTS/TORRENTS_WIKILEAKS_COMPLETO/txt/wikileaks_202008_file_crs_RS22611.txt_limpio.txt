customized postage each of these forms of postage is described below postage meter indicia postage meter or mailing machine is device that is used to print postage indicia directly onto mailpieces or pieces of adhesive tape that are to be affixed to mailpieces11 the usps does not produce postage meters rather private firms manufacture meters to meet standards set in regulations issued by the postal service12 to use postage meter mailer must fill out an application with the usps and enter into rental agreement with postage meter manufacturer the mailer then prepays for postage and this prepayment is registered in his postage meter when he wishes to mail an item the mailer places it in the meter which weighs it and prints the required postage the customer may then drop the item into any mailbox within the 5digit zip httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22611 code in which the meter is registered for delivery by the usps indicia made by postage meters may be customized to include

indicia printed at the top right of envelopes13 mailing permit imprints may be made on envelopes by printing press handstamp lithography mimeograph address plate or similar device14 typically mailing permit imprints are used by firms to send mass mailings of identical mailpieces thus for example if notforprofit firm wanted to send letters to its 5000 donors it first would fill out an application with the usps to receive mailing permit and imprint the firm then would hire another firm to print 5000 envelopes with the imprint on them the notforprofit company would stuff these envelopes with letters and deliver them to the post office from which it received its mailing permit the usps would receive the mail and the firm would pay for the postage required on the spot15 according to the usps mailing permit imprints may not be customized to include advertisements or messages 10 see usps website at httpwwwuspscompostagesolutions 11 examples of meter indicia may be found on the uspss

1192 of the violence against women and department of justice reauthorization act of 2005 pl 109162 119 stat 2960 the act amended 18 usc 475 to except indicia of postage payment from more than century old law which prohibited the counterfeiting of government obligations or securities and the placement of advertisements on said obligations or securities the usps has entered into agreements with number of private firms such as stampscom and zazzlecom that permit these firms to create stamplike indicia that carry advertisements and images chosen by the purchaser eg photographic image of ones pet cat along with indicia of postage paid16 the usps requires firms that produce customized postage indicia to limit the messages and images that may be placed on them to cite just two of the restrictions customized postage indicia may not carry partisan or political contents or messages and they may not depict profanity nudity or sexually explicit functions despite their appearance customized postage indicia are not stamps rather they are adhesive stickers that indicate postage paid customized postage indicia are sold at premium by authorized private companies sheet of 20 42cent customized postage indicia may cost 1495 or more sheet of 20 42cent usps definitive stamps httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22611 costs 840 the extra cost of customized postage goes to the licensees though in

much do stamps and postage cost the easiest way to determine current postage rates is to visit the uspss prices web page at httpwwwuspscomratespriceshtm consumers also may call the usps httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22611 at 18002758777 how are postage rates set the postal accountability and enhancement act paea pl 109435 120 stat 3198 which was enacted on december 20 2006 changed the postage ratesetting process20 under the former ratesetting system the usps would submit request to the postal rate commission to raise postage prices that detailed the proposed increases and the justifications for them this began quasijudicial process in which all interested parties including citizens and business firms would submit testimony to the commission concerning uspss proposed postage rates the postal rate commission would hold hearings take testimony from witnesses and issue recommended decision which the uspss board of governors could accept or reject frequently the entire process took more than six months and the results were difficult to predict the paea replaced this process with less adversarial and more expeditious process that takes less than two months 120 stat 32013203 the paea replaced the postal rate commission with the postal regulatory commission prc now when the usps wants to raise postage rates it files notice with the prc which takes public comments and verifies the proposed rates compliance with the law the paea separates the uspss products into two types marketdominant products and competitive products and gives the usps different pricing authority for each type 19 for an enumeration of these criteria see crs report rs20221 commemorative postage stamps history selection criteria and revenue potential by kevin r kosar 20 120 stat 3201 required the prc to put the new ratesetting system in place within 18 months after enactment of the law the prc completed this task early and the new system took effect on november 9 2007 72 fr 6366263704 crs6 marketdominant products are those that the usps need not compete with the private sector to provide21 marketdominant products include 1 firstclass mail letters and sealed parcels 2 firstclass mail cards 3 periodicals 4 standard mail 5 singlepiece parcel post 6 media mail 7 bound printed matter 8 library mail 9 special services and 10 singlepiece international mail each year the usps may raise the postage rates for marketdominant products at rate that is higher than the previous years increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers22 competitive products are those for which competitive market exists23 they include 1 priority mail 2 expedited mail 3 bulk parcel post 4 bulk international mail and 5 mailgrams the usps may set the postage rates for competitive products in accordance with regulations promulgated by the prc the paea prohibits the usps from pricing competitive products below the costs to produce these products 120 stat 3205 otherwise the usps may price these products at the level it deems appropriate relative to competitors prices may the families of members of the armed services send mail to them for free httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22611 during the 109th and 110th congresses bills have been introduced to permit certain persons to send letters and packages free of postage to servicemen and women in combat zones none of these bills has become law24 may any active duty members of the armed services send mail for free yes member of the armed services may do so provided that he or she is on duty in designated combat area the mail is personal correspondence and the mail is addressed to someone in the united states 39 usc 340125 the department of defense reimburses usps for portion of the delivery costs 21 120 stat 3209 defines marketdominant product as product in the sale of which the postal service exercises sufficient market power that it can effectively set the price of such product substantially above costs raise prices significantly decrease quality or decrease output without risk of losing significant level of business to other firms offering similar products 22 120 stat 32033204 does permit two exceptions to this limitation 23 120 stat 3209 defines competitive products as those products and services that do not meet the definition of marketdominant product 24 for
