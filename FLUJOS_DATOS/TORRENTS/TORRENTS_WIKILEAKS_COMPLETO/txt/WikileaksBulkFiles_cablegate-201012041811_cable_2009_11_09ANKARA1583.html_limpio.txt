community allegations that iran intends to acquire nuclear weapons as gossip the ambassador emphasized iran will be the single most important topic when erdogan and potus meet in washington december 7 in contrast to erdogan president gul november 2 pressed iran to be transparent with iaea inspectors we will urge gul and senior turkish bureuacrats to curb erdogans damaging defense of irans nuclear activities end summary 2 c during an october 21 meeting with mfa undersecretary sinirlioglu the ambassador challenged pm erdogans public statement made the previous day while he was in tehran dismissing allegations of irans intent to acquire nuclear weapons as gossip holding copy of president obamas pittsburgh summit comdemnation of iraqs nuclear ambitions the ambassador asked sinirlioglu if this was the gossip to which erdogan had referred the ambassador emphasized that erdogans statement made turkey vulnerable to international community criticism should iran balk on iaea inspection of its qom reprocessing facility or secondparty reprocessing of its lowenriched uranium stockpile erdogan was in effect allowing the iranians to infer weakening of the international community consensus against them the ambassador warned sinirlioglu that washington was now wondering if it could any longer count on turkey to help contain irans profound challenge to regional peace and stability 3 c implying erdogans use of the term gossip was unconfirmed sinirlioglu claimed that the turkish government fully supports the p5plus1 he asserted the prime ministers principled opposition to nuclear weapons in the region he argued erdogans rhetoric is tactical effort to gain him credibility with the middle eastern street so he can better place the antinuclear weapons message though turkey doesnt believe in sanctions sinirlioglu said we will support consensus in the security council the ambassador responded that iran would be the single most important topic of conversation when erdogan and potus meet in washington on december 7 4 sbu in marked contrast to erdogan president gul november 2 said turkey is against nuclear weapons in its region and the world especially in neighboring countries in remarks to reporters while enroute to slovakia gul reaffirmed turkeys preference for diplomatic means as opposed to the use of military force to compel tehrans adherence to its international obligations but insisted that iran must be transparent and open to iaea inspection in order to overcome suspicions 5 c comment erdogans recent comments on irans nuclear program amount to defense of tehrans defiance of the international communitys will his desire for good washington visit is the goad we will continue use to try to turn him back towards the international community consensus on iran we will also emphasize to erdogans senior bureuacrats and when the opportunity arises to president gul their interest in reining in erdogan on iran jeffrey visit ankaras
