trade in agricultural products frequently is one of the more difficult issues negotiators face in concluding free trade agreements ftas while us negotiators seek to eliminate barriers to us agricultural exports they also face pressures to protect us producers of import sensitive commodities ie beef dairy products sugar among others fta partner country negotiators face similar pressures one us objective is for ftas be comprehensive ie cover all products for the more importsensitive agricultural commodities negotiators have agreed on long transition periods or compromised to allow for indefinite protection of few commodities in addition because of political sensitivities for the united states or its partners negotiators excluded sugar in the australia fta tobacco in the jordan fta and rice in the korea fta though food safety and animalplant health matters technically are not part of ftas resolving outstanding disputes and reaching common understanding on the application of sciencebased rules to bilateral trade have directly affected the dynamics of concluding recent ftas andor the process of subsequent congressional consideration one example has been the high us priority to secure assurances that prospective fta partners allow imports of us beef in accordance with internationally recognized scientifically based rules most of the us agricultural export gains under ftas have occurred with canada and mexico the top two us agricultural trading partners though us sales to overseas markets were expected to increase anyway because of population growth and income gains analyses suggest that the ftas recently put into effect or concluded since 2004 could boost us agricultural exports by an additional 39 to 72 because of the reciprocity introduced into the agricultural trading relationship in those ftas concluded with several developing countries that protect their farm sectors with high tariffs and restrictive quotas us exporters will benefit from increased sales net us agricultural imports under these ftas could be 15 higher than forecast the share of twoway us agricultural trade exports and imports covered by ftas has increased from 1 in 1985

pending free trade agreements ftas negotiated with colombia panama and south korea he emphasized the importance to us economic growth of opening up new markets overseas and noted how these ftas will level the playing field in giving the united states better access to 100 million customers in these three countries on january 23 senator baucus chairman of the senate finance committee called for the quick conclusion of new import protocol with south korea consistent with internationally recognized guidelines providing full access for us beef regardless of the cut of beef or the age of cattle in letter to us trade representative schwab he again reiterated that the fta negotiated with korea will not move forward in his committee until such protocol is in place and us beef sales have resumed the senator stated the protocol must clearly outline the criteria us beef producers must meet to sell to the korean market and must include both process for handling problems that arise and mechanism

expand commodity and food exports as vital to improving farm income and business profitability for this reason many us policymakers since the mid1980s have viewed negotiating trade agreements as way to create opportunities to increase agricultural sales overseas primarily by seeking to lower andor eliminate other countries trade barriers eg tariffs and quotas to accomplish this the united states has had to reciprocate by lowering similar forms of border protection on farm and food products imported from prospective trading partners because of the import sensitivity of some us commodity sectors eg beef dairy and sugar among others to the prospect of increased competition from foreign suppliers the executive branch has had to take the concerns of producers of these commodities into account during negotiations in order to secure congressional approval of concluded trade agreements the 1994 uruguay round agreement on agriculture negotiated under the structure of the multilateral institution that preceded the world trade organization wto created substantial export opportunities for us agriculture and agribusiness by partially lowering thenexisting trade barriers worldwide however the us ftas that took effect with canada in 1989 and with mexico in 1994 when both were combined into the north american free trade agreement nafta were more ambitious than the uruguay round in reducing barriers to bilateral agricultural trade with these two trade agreements setting into motion process that removed

since mid2002 the bush administrations fta negotiations have been guided by provisions spelled out in tpa authority in support of the overall agricultural negotiating objective to obtain competitive opportunities for us agricultural commodities in foreign markets and to achieve fairer and more open conditions of trade in bulk specialty crop and valueadded commodities2 other stated us objectives pertinent to negotiating bilateral ftas are to seek to eliminate on the broadest possible basis tariffs and other charges on agricultural trade to seek to eliminate nontariff barriers to us exports including licensing barriers on agricultural products restrictive administration of tariffrate quotas unjustified trade restrictions that affect new us technologies ie biotechnology and other trade restrictive measures that us exporters identify to provide adequate transition periods and relief mechanisms for the us agricultural sector to adjust to increased imports of sensitive products to seek to eliminate partner government practices that adversely affect us exports of perishable or cyclical agricultural products to eliminate any unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary sps restrictions imposed by the prospective partner and seek its affirmation of its wto commitments on sps measures and to develop mechanism with each partner to support the us objective to eliminate all agricultural export subsidies in the wto negotiations3 in the fta negotiations initiated by the bush administration us officials frequently have affirmed their position that product or sector should be excluded particularly when partner negotiators in jockeying for leverage seek to exclude their sensitive agricultural commodities from coverage in the final agreement also us officials repeatedly have made clear that the issue of us farm support or subsidies which some countries have sought to place on the fta negotiating table will only be addressed in the wto multilateral negotiations

agreedupon time period achieving preferential access as much as possible to each others market is the primary objective in negotiations with the intent also to secure competitive edge over third countries that sell into an fta partners market accomplishing this requires that negotiators work to reduce and eventually eliminate tariffs and quotas on most agricultural goods because the united states and each prospective fta partner have some agricultural products that benefit from high levels of border protection negotiators spend much of their time wrestling with how to transition these importsensitive products towards free trade the united states also has sought to address other nontariff barriers particularly those dealing with food safety and animalplant healthcommonly referred to as sps measures on separate but parallel track though us negotiators assert that resolution of outstanding bilateral sps disputes is not on the formal fta negotiating agenda press reports point toward negotiators on both sides seeking to resolve such disputes and using them as leverage to achieve other fta negotiating objectives further resolving these disputes is viewed as essential to ensure that fta partners do not resort to using these barriers to undercut the openings created for us exporters in market access talks

one us objective in negotiations is that bilateral free trade agreements be comprehensive ie cover all products for the more sensitive agricultural commodities negotiators generally agree on long transition periods before tariffs and quotas are completely eliminated recently negotiated ftas though provide for indefinite protection for few commodities us commodities that are protected this way include sugar in four ftas and beef in the australia fta such protection takes the form of slowlyexpanding preferential tariffrate quotas trqs and the retention of prohibitive tariffs on overquota imports in perpetuity the use of safeguards to protect against import surges and special mechanisms to address unique situations see types of provisions in us ftas that apply to agricultural trade

including current and prospective fta partners on animal plant and human health and food safety issues have significantly reduced or limited us agricultural sales to these markets though us negotiators state that they do not view fta negotiations as the forum in which to try to raise and resolve these disputes parallel discussions on these sps issues have affected the negotiating

statement s to date and ustr 2006 national tra estimate report on foreign trade bar rier s marc h 2 00 6 the controversies that have surfaced reflect the growing use by countries of sps rules intended to ensure food safety and protect animal and plant health as disguised trade barriers trade experts have observed that as quota expansion has opened up foreign markets to agricultural imports governments face pressure to protect domestic producers from increased competition using such nontariff measures as sps rules accordingly us policymakers have concluded that resolving outstanding sps issues is important to the us agricultural sector in order for exporters to be able to take advantage of the market access openings that new ftas can create exporters also have signaled that the application of sps rules must be sciencebased transparent and predictable so that they know what applies to them when selling products to fta partners their view reflects each countrys rights and obligations under the wtos 1994 sps agreement which lays out rules to ensure that each countrys food safety and animal and plant health laws and regulations are transparent scientifically defensible and fair 5 even though they are not technically on the agenda two sps issues have concerned us negotiators in recent fta talks with several countries one us objective has been to secure an fta partners recognition of the us meat beef pork and poultry inspection system as equivalent to its own panama and some centra l american countries had argued that their regulatory agencies be allowed to continue their policies of accepting meat imports only from those us meat processing plants that their own food inspectors had approved us exporters argued that this practice stymied sales requiring them to comply with multiple sets of rules that were redundant to the existing us meat inspection system second following the discovery of cow with bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease in washington state in december 2003 many countries imposed bans on the import of us beef6 the united states asked the office of international epizootics oie7 to review its response and the validity of measures already in place to mitigate the risks of this animal disease to humans and cattle herds along with canada and mexico the united states earlier had asked this panel to reconsider its international guidelin for determining the risk status of countries with bse to better reflect the adequacy of countrys safeguards this has involved us regulatory agencies presenting extensive evidence to show that us beef products are safe and 5 for more detailed description of this agreement see ibid pp 1112 6 for background on how the presence of bse risk in us cattle herds has affected us beef exports and on the actions the us government has taken to address this risk to regain overseas markets see crs report rs21709 mad cow disease and us beef trade by charles hanrahan and geoffrey

the more recent ftas the united states pressed prospective partners eg colombia malaysia peru panama and south korea to recognize us measures taken to address the bse issue as conforming with internationally recognized scientific guidelines governing meat trade8 and to allow purchases of us beef to resume similarly some members of congress have stated that their s upport for the korea fta will depend on the measures south korea adopts to allow us beef imports to enter under the bilateral agreement reached in january 2006 9 to resolve these bilateral sps issues us and fta country negotiators have reached separate agreements or exchanged side letters that acknowledge prospective partners acceptance of the equivalency of the us meat inspection system and recognition of the steps the united states has taken to ensure the removal of beef parts that carry the risk of transmitting bse these frequently have stipulated the steps partner will undertake to facilitate the entry of imports of us meat products andor commit partner to allow us beef certified as meeting specified standards to be imported by specified date though these sps side letters and agreements are not an integral part of fta texts the use of fta negotiations as the opportunity to leverage resolution to longstanding sps issues resulted in attaining market openings that would otherwise have taken much longer to achieve for example the united states succeeded in securing from colombia peru and panama changes in their regulations to allow for the import of us beef the sps chapter in each recent fta reaffirms each partners rights and obligations under the wtos 1994 sps agreement to also be the basis for resolving sps issues that come up in future bilateral trade this text establishes sps standing committee to facilitate consultations on and resolve bilateral sps problems as they arise the australia fta went further creating technical group on animal and plant health measures to work to achieve consensus on the scientific issues behind specific sps disput unlike nafta with canada and mexico all ftas negotiated since 1993 prescribe that the agreements dispute settlement process cannot be used to challenge the other partners sps standards

of this increase second trade policy developments have bolstered this tr end implementation of us ftas with canada and mexico and of the multilateral 1994 urug uay round agreement on agriculture that

approved ftas since 2004 and with colombia panama and south korea whose ftas await congressional consideration could be an estimated 41 to 43 higher than would occur without these trade agreements12 us agricultural exports would be higher largely because of the market openings created as most fta partners high agricultural tariffs and most other border protections are largely eliminated over time us agricultural imports would also rise primarily from australia chile and colombia as us tariffs on farm products of export interest to these countries and quotas on us sensitive agricultural

partners lowers overall us agricultural imports as result of these agreements to about 700 million15 as result usitcs import projection adjusted for trade diversion could be 14 higher th an would be the case otherwise16 most of this increase would reflect additional imports from australia which has gained access to the us market under expanding us preferential trqs for sensitive agricultural commodities beef and dairy products if the usitc analyses for the chile an d singapore ftas are added to the picture us agricultural imports could be another 600 million higher but when adjusted for trade diversion only 300 million more australia and chile would account for most of the increase in agricultural imports under the ftas analyzed by the usitc agricultural imports from most of the other fta partners classified to be developing countries have benefitted for some time from low or zero duty access under us unilateral trade preference programs generalized system of preferences gsp andean trade preference and the caribbean basin initiative as result the small increases shown for them in table 7 largely reflect the benefits they would rece ive with the additional export access gained into the us market under expanding preferential trqs for commodities that the united states has protected with quotas for some time continued levels under these ftas that is b ecause afbf projections shown in the last column in table 7 only reflect the value of additional sugar imported from drcaftas six countries panama peru and colombia however the afbfprojected imports under the ftas with australia and morocco can be compared to those developed by the usitc for these two countries in terms of product coverage but were developed using different methodologies as explained in appendix 15 trade diversion occurs when one member of an fta shifts imports of product away from nonpartner country even if it is more efficient producer to its fta partner even if that product is produced less efficiently there because the removal of the tariff and other border protection makes it cheaper to import that product from its partner to illustrate the afbfs analysis on the australia fta suggested that australian cheeses will become more competitive in the us market than europeanorigin cheeses ie resulting in shift or diversion in some cheese imports from france or switzerland to australia this likely would be due to the us preferential tariff and quota treatment granted to australian cheese while us imports of european cheeses would continue to be subject to tariffs and quotas the usitcs analysis of the peru fta suggests that us imports of cut flowers would be diverted from colombia to peru if colombia did not receive similar trade benefits in its own fta with the united states 16 the benchmark used to derive the percentage change in us agricultural imports as result of these ftas is consistent with the methodology used by the usitc in its analyses here the sum of usitcs import projections adjusted for trade diversion is compared to the 2005 us agricultural import level

years those with israel canada and mexico except for the jordan fta six trade agreements have taken effect since 2004 table 1 onethird of total twoway us agricultural trade is accounted for by canada and mexico largely because of the market openings created by nafta many years ago and both countries proximity to the us market the rate of growth in bilateral agricultural trade with canada and mexico but not with israel has been higher compared to the rate of increase in us agricultural trade with the rest of the world during the time period that each agreement has been in effect because six ftas are relatively new ie with implementation periods of four years or less it is difficult to determine whether the growth in two way trade is attributable solely to liberalizing trade provisions portion of the increase is also due to growing populations per capita income growth and changing diets also us consum ers growing demand for fruits and vegetables would likely have been met in part by imports from these partners even without these ftas the more significant market access provisions gained for us exporters will take time to take effect with the long transition periods negotiated for sensitive commodities more detailed analysis would be required to correlate changes in comm odity trade flows to specific tariff and quota provisions in these ftas agriculture as

sugar imports from mexico can now freely enter the us market is affecting the dynamics of the debate on the future us sugar program as congress continues to consider the 2007 farm bill22 concerned with the impact of free trade in sweeteners sugar and hfcs the us and mexican sugar producing sectors recently reached an agreement to be proposed to their respective governments to control the flow of sugar between both countries both sect ors would adopt measures to limit sugar exports to the other countrys market under specified conditions us sugar processors and growers reportedly are seeking to have these recommendations incorporated into the farm bill measure during conference committee deliberations in response us hfcs manufacturers some members of congress and food industry association have expressed concerns that such managed trade could lead to new mexican tariffs and barriers on us hfcs exports to mexico and would undercut nafta as commodity groups in both countries call for

to 20 years trade in four very sensitive commoditiesfresh potatoes and fresh onions imported by costa rica white corn imported by the other four central american countries and sugar entering the us marketare treated uniquely in the agreement at the end of specified periods the quota amount set for these four commodities will continue to increase by about 1 to 2 each year in perpetuity in other words quota though rising will always limit imports of these four commodities the tariff on above quota entries though will not decline but stay at current high levels to protect producers because of its sensitivity drcafta also commits all parties to consult and review the implementation and operation of the provisions on trade in chicken about midway in the long transition period to free trade the six countries covered by drcafta accounted for 53 billion or almost 4 of twoway us agricultural trade in 2006 us agricultural exports in 2006 to the six countries totaled just over 22 billion which represented just over 3 of us worldwide sales that year the six countries combined represented the eighth largest export market for us agricultural products leading us exports were corn 443

tobacco and cotton these quotas will be in addition to ie not carved out of the existing agricultural trqs established by the united states under current wto commitments which the six countries in varying degrees historically have used to export to the us market drawing much attention during congressional debate were the agreements sugar provisions which allow additional sugar from the region to enter the us market members particularly during senate finance committee hearing questioned how the agreements sugar compensation mechanism would work this provision allows the united states to compensate the six countries for sugar they would not be able to ship under drcaftas preferential sugar quotas if the entry of such additional sugar is ex pected to undermine usdas ability to administer the us sugar price support program this unique mechanism in us ftas which applies only to sugar imported under drcafta and the ftas with colombia panama and peru is structured to be activated and exercised at the sole discretion of the us government though not spelled out in detail officials have mentioned that if used compensation could include donating surplus commodities in usda inventories or making cash payments as compensation to sugar exporters in the six countries to assuage these members concerns the bush administration pledged prior to senate passage to take steps only through fy2008 to ensure that all sugar imports including those under dr cafta do not exceed trigger that could undermine usdas ability to manage the domestic sugar program sugar producers and processors responded that usda s pledge did not address their longterm concerns about the viability of the us sugar program fearing that drcaftas sugar provisions would set precedent for the in clusion of sugar in ftas being negotiated with several other sugar exporting countries the industry continued lastminute but unsuccessful efforts in the house to defeat the agreement 24 agricultural imports in 2006 from these six countries equaled 30 billion or almost 5 of all us farm and food imports combined these countries ranked as the fourth leading source of us agricultural imports in that

g3g158g156g157g155g138g149g146g138g344g347g561 efforts by australias negotiators to secure additional access for beef dairy products and sugar in the us market proved to be among the most contentious issues just before the australiaus fta was concluded in february 2004 us negotiators succeeded in excluding sugar from the agreement an objective that the us sugar industry had sought and in immediately eliminating australias tariffs on all imports of us agricultural products while australia sought immediate and substantial openings for its beef and dairy products the fta provides for limited but growing access under quotas to the us market over long transition periods quotas and high tariff protection on some dairy product imports will continue in place indefinitely negotiators also agreed to create new mechanism to facilitate scientific cooperation between both countries to resolve bilateral sanitary and phytosanitary animal and plant health issues available analyses indicate that australias agricultural sector will gain more under this fta than will us agriculture largely because of additional access to the much larger us market for its most competitive food products because of the us stance that longstanding sps issues that limited us pork exports to australia be addressed before congress considered the fta australias regulatory agency completed its assessment of the risks associated with such imports in may 2004 this decision has opened the door for sales of processed pork products since the agreement began to be implemented taking effect on january 1 2005 this fta provided immediate dutyfree access for all us agricultural exports to the australian market key products expected to benefit quickly from such treatment include processed foods soybeans and oilseed products fresh and processed fruits vegetables and nuts and alcoholic beverages likely due in part to the fta the value of us agricultural exports to australia in 2006 519 million was 34 higher than the 387 million average in the threeyear period 20022004 before the fta took effect exports of pork 47 million pet food 47 million food preparations 39 million walnuts 19 million fresh grapes 16 million breeding horses 15 million confectionery products 14 million essential oils 14 million tobacco 13 million soybean meal 13 million protein isolates 12 million almonds 11 million and fresh oranges 11 million accounted for just over onehalf of us agricultural sales to this market in 2006 the fta also eliminated us tariffs on 20 of australian agricultural imports immediately and

access for commodities now subject to us trqs beef dairy products peanuts cotton and tobacco in the form of slowly expanding preferential quotas but not for sugar these new quotas are in addition to wto quotas that australia already takes advantage of to sell to the us market us safeguard protection against import surges from australia will be triggered automatically under specified conditions for beef and specified horticultural products during the 18year period that ends in 2022 austra lias preferential beef quota will rise from 0 to 70000 metric tons mt this end amount is 19 more than australias current share 378214 mt of the us wtos beef trq commitment26 inquota tariffs were eliminated immediately the phase out of abovequota tariffs is backloade d to begin in year 9 2013 beginning in 2023 there will be restriction on imports of beef from australia to protect against surges in beef imports quantitybased safeguard will be avai lable from years 9 through 18 beginning in 2023 pricebased safeguard available in perpetuity could be triggered if beef prices fall below specified trigger level this beef safeguard is the only exception in recent ftas that does not expire at the end of its transition period the united states also agreed to gradually open its market to additional imports of dairy products eg fluid milk and cream butter various cheeses skim and other milk powders ice cream from australia under 12 new preferential trqs inquota tariffs on these imports longer apply and the amount of each quota will increase each year however abovequota tariffs on dairy products will remain at their current high levels indefinitely beginning in year 18 2022 quotas will grow in perpetuity at compound rates ranging from 3 to 6 annually depending on the product category these new quotas are in addition to the access that australia already has under several wto quotas to sell these dairy products to the us market the agreement allows either partner after year 20 2024 to request consultations for the purpose of considering changes to its dairy market access commitments at the time this fta was reached ustr stated it did not expect the additional imports to affect the operation of usdas dairy price support program this program indirectly supports the farm price of milk through usda purchases of butter cheddar cheese and skim milk powder at levels above world market prices australia has ranked as the fifth leading source of us agricultural imports in recent years partly due to the fta us agricultural imports from australia were 15 higher in 2006 having increased from an average 22 billion in 20022004 to 25 billion purchases of beef and veal 934 million wine 761 million lamb meat 283 million sugar 70 million cheese and curd 43 million milk protein concentrates 39 million fresh oranges 29 million and wheat gluten 26 million accounted for 88 of all such entries 26 because us beef exporters saw sales to key asian ma rkets plummet immediately after the december 2003 initial mad cow incident us negotiators succeeded in including an fta provision that prohibited sales of australian beef under its preferential quota into the us market for three years through 2007 unless us beef exports to the world return to their 2003 level this threshold has not been reached with usda projecting that us beef and veal sales to the world in 2007 will be 585000 mt about onehalf of the 2003 us beef export level of 1142000 mt usda fas livestock and poultry world markets trade april 2007 p 10 in 2008 australias preferential beef quota will be 20000 mt

period before all importsensitive products are free to enter from the other country interim protection for such products will include the use of trqs and agricultural safeguards the special safeguards are pricebased and will be implemented automatically using listed trigger prices prior to this fta chiles tariff on most agricultural products was 6 by comparison the us average tariff equivalent on agricultural imports from chile was less than 15 chile agreed to grant dutyfree status to more th an 75 of us agricultural products immediately or within four years such treatment applies to pork and

vegetable oils from the united states by year 12 201529 us products subject to chiles safeguards include certain meat products broken brown and partiallymilled rice rice flour and certain wheat products the usitc anticipates that the fta could provide opportunities for us soybean sales in offseason months and for wheat sales after the eighth year in 2006 likely due in part to this fta being in effect for three years the value of us agricultural exports to chile 301 million was 212 times higher than the annual average of 118 million in the threeyear period 20012003 before the fta took

include specified vegetables and fruits various canned fruits frozen concentrated orange juice tomato products and avocados the usitc 27 see also crs report rl31144 the uschile free trade agreement economic and trade policy issues by j f hornbeck 28 this mechanism serves to insulate producers and processors from the trade impact when the world price for any commodity falls below calculated reference price eg price target comparable to commodity support level the domestic sector is protected by variable fee on the imported commodity which when added to the lower world or selected international reference price raises the importers cost to this adjusted import price this fee can fluctuate depending on changes in the reference price adjusted for freight insurance and other factors to equal this predetermined minimum import price colombia peru and some central american countries also use price bands as in the chile fta the ftas with these other countries convert the level of border protection that their price bands provide into relatively high overquota tarifffrequently the prod ucts bound ratewhich is then reduced to zero during the transition period 29 for

european union and other countries that might broaden or initiate improved trade ties with morocco because of the sensitivity of the wheat sector complex provisions detail the terms of us access to the moroccan market these differentiate between durum wheat and common bread wheat while the inquota tariff on durum imports will be reduced to zero from the current 75 over 10 years the preferential inquota tariff on common wheat imports will decline using formula that applies whenever moroccos current 135 applied mfn rate is lowered this preferential tariff will not be available to us exporters during june and july and possibly august for common wheat of any year unless morocco imports either type of wheat from another country in which case us wheat will then receive the preferential rate overquota tariffs for both wheat types will remain at current high levels indefinitely unless morocco negotiates reduction with another supplier if this occurs us exporters will automatically benefit from this wheat tariff reduction the preferential quota for common wheat will be based on the level of moroccan wheat output smaller quota if production is 3 million mt or more larger quota if output is less than 21 million mt while the durum wheat quota will expand slowly indefinitely the common wheat quota will increase during the first 10 years and then be capped indefinitely beginning in 2015 in other words while us wheat will benefit from much improved access to the moroccan market quota and prohibitive overquota tariff will always apply also morocco secured the right to operate wheat auction system for inquota imports of us wheat the united states similarly agreed to eliminate tariffs and offer preferential quota access to all agricultural imports from morocco under seven phaseout periods immediately or 5 8 10 12 15 or 18 years the longest transition 18 years is reserved for six designated processed fruit products the united states established preferenti trqs for beef dairy products including fluid milk products cheese milk powder butte r sugar and sugarcontaining products scps peanuts tobacco cotton tomato products including tomato paste and puree tomato sauces dried onions and dried garlic imports of sugar and scps are subject to trade surplus calculation meaning that morocco can sell the lower of its preferential quota or the amount by which all of its exports of specified sugar products exceed imports of similar products 34 the usitc estimates that full implementation would result in an increase in us exports to morocco of primarily grains and processed

materials are removed following oies guidelines the minister argued this would give the united states about 80 of its market share before the late 2003 restrictions took effect the eventual second

promising market if fta negotiations result in significant reduction in its high tariffs on agricultural imports and provide increased access for its many quotaprotected products us agricultural exports by one estimate could increase by an additional 800 million if thai trade barriers are reduced or eliminated and the countrys economy recovers to pre1997 financial crisis levels 69 thailand similarly intends to pursue increased access for its fruit vegetables and sugar in the us market but its negotiators at the same time face strong opposition from thai farmers and resistance within the bureaucracy to opening up the countrys market after six negotiating rounds had taken place thailand suspended the talks in february 2006 because of the countrys political crisis the government set up after the september 2006 military coup initially appeared to be committed to pursuing an fta and having its legislature consider any possible deal but there are plans at present to resume negotiations

the burdensome requirements involved in securing import permits and the high fees required to be paid to obtain import licenses ironing out food safety and health issues reportedly received much

with high levels of border protection for their agricultural sectors in particular us agricultural trade with those fta partners that have benefitted from long period of preferential access to the united states will quickly take on more reciprocal character as their trade barriers to imports of us agricultural products are reduced us agriculture and agribusiness exporters where they have competitive edge over other countries in these markets will be able to take advantage of sales opportunities at the same time some us commodity sectors will face competition from increased imports under these ftas the degree of such competition will be mitigated by negotiated long transition periods and by likely continued growth in us demand for such products due to population growth looking ahead as transition periods to free trade for the more sensitive agricultural products near their end disputes are likely to arise this has been the case under nafta for several agricultural products as free trade loomed or actually took effect and led affected producers in canada mexico and the united states to seek relief from the impacts of increased imports reflecting this outlook most us agricultural commodity groups agribusiness and food manufacturing firms have supported these recently negotiated ftas looking to benefit from preferential and guaranteed increased access to these

illustrate expected changes to us agricultural exports and imports as these ftas are implemented vary significantly because of the different analytical approaches used to derive them what is common in the simulations developed by the us international trade commission usitc and the american farm bureau federation afbf is that they seek to present what would happen to us agricultural trade under each fta compared to baseline that represents what each expects such trade would be without an agreement77 their approaches however differ in the scope of analysis undertaken and in how each handles the timing of full implementation of an fta s agricultural trade liberalization provisions these differences in turn largely explain the difference in estimates in the change in us agricultural exports and imports attributable just to these agreements table 7 the usitc employs multicountry and multi commodityservices sector econometric model to quantify what the broad and sectoral impacts of fta market access provisions would mean for the entire us economy the afbf also uses an econometric model but employs narrower methodology to examine what only happens to each fta partners main agricultural commodity sectors as border protection is eliminated it then quantifies the resulting demand that would be met with increased agricultural imports from the united states another significant difference is that the usitc assumes all fta provisions are fully implemented and its full effects felt immediately ie in the first year that an agreement takes effect in other words the us economy is different in this first year from what it is in the baselinewith the same population resources and other economic characteristics by contrast the afbf projects the change in an fta partners agricultural trade with the united states at point during or at the end of long transition period s this is derived by looking at the impact of adjustments expected to occur in each countrys agricultural sector as trade liberalization takes effect over time population growth and assu med higher economic growth and per capita incomes associated in part because of its fta with the united states because usitc analyses do not take into account that the more significant agricultural provisions in an fta are staged in over long periods up to 20 to 25 years nor that in come levels and population likely will grow over time its projections probably understate the magnitude of the change in us agricultural exports and imports attributable to these agreements the farm bureaus estimates may overstate the magnitude of the projected higher level of us agricultural exports because of overly optimistic assumptions on the potential future us market share for key agricultural commodities in some fta partner countries for more information please see the following crs products crs report rl33463 trade negotiations during the 110 th congress by ian f fergusson 77 the only common feature in both the usitc and afbf analyses of fta effects are estimates on projected changes in us agricultural exports and importsmeasures that capture part of the prospective gains and losses experienced by us agriculture under these ftas both sets of analyses do not convert what ftacaused changes in agricultural trade mean for net us farm income except for the afbfs morocco report us farm commodity
