from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to santer1llnlgov subject an issueproblem with tims idea date thu jan 10 161428 2008 ben tims idea is possibility ive not always got on that well great with glenn mcgregor but tim seems to have reasonable rapport with him dian has suggested that this would be the best route it is the logical one i also think that glenn would get quick reviews as tim thinks he realises hes made mistake tim has let into part of secret glenn said the paper had two reviews one positive the other said it wasnt great but would leave it up to the editors discretion this is why glenn knows he made the wrong choice the problem the person who said they would leave it to the editors discretion is on your email list i dont know who it is tim does maybe they have told you i dont want to put pressure on tim he doesnt know im sending this it isnt by the way nor tim tim said it was someone who hasnt contributed to the discussion which does narrow the possibilities down timglenn discussed getting quick reviews whoever this person is they could be the familiar reviewer and we could then come up with another reasonable name kevin he does everything at the speed of light as the two reviewers colour in ijc costs bit but im sure we can lean on glenn also we can just have colour in the pdf ill now send few thoughts on the figures cheers phil tom wigley wigleycgducaredu karl

douglass et at 0352 10012008 ben santer wrote much as i would like to see highprofile rebuttal of douglass et in journal like science or nature its unlikely that either journal will publish such rebuttal so what are our options personally id vote for grl i think that it is important to publish an expeditious response to the statistical flaws in douglass et in theory grl should be able to give us the desired fast turnaround time why not go for publication of response in ijc according to phil this option would probably take too long id be interested to hear any other thoughts you might have on publication options hi ben and phil as you may know phil certainly knows im on the editorial board of ijc phil is right that it can be rather slow though faster than certain other climate journals nevertheless ijc really is the preferred place to publish though downside is that douglass et may have the opportunity to have response considered to accompany any comment i just contacted the editor glenn mcgregor to see what he can do he promises to do everything he can to achieve quick turnaround time he didnt quantify this and he will also ask the publishers for priority in terms of getting the paper online asap after the authors have received proofs he genuinely seems keen to correct the scientific record as quickly as possible he also said and please treat this in confidence which is why i emailed to you and phil only that he may be able to hold back the hardcopy ie the printpaper version appearance of douglass et possibly so that any accepted santer et comment could appear alongside it presumably depends on speed of the review process if this does persuade you to go with ijc glenn suggested that i could help because he is in kathmandu at present with achieving the quick turnaround time by identifying in advance reviewers who are both suitable and available obviously one reviewer could be someone who is already familiar with this discussion because that would enable fast review ie someone on the email list youve been using though i dont know which of these people you will be asking to be coauthors and hence which wont be available as possible reviewers for objectivity the other reviewer would need to be independent but you could still suggest suitable names well thats my thoughts let know what you decide cheers tim dr timothy j osborn academic fellow
