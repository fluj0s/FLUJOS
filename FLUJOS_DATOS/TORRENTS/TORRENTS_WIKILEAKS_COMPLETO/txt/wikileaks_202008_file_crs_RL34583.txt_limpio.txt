agricultural policy resources science and industry division midwest floods of 2008 potential impact on agriculture summary unusually cool wet spring weather followed by widespread june flooding across much of the corn belt cast considerable uncertainty over 2008 us corn and soybean production prospects as much as 5 million acres of crop production were initially thought to be either lost entirely or subject to significant yield reductions estimates of floodrelated crop damage varied widely due in part to lack of reliable information about the extent of plant recovery or replanting in the flooded areas these circumstances generated considerable market angst and us agricultural prices for corn and soybeans as reported on the major commodity exchanges hit record highs in late june and early july since then most of the corn belt has experienced nearly ideal growing conditions suggesting the potential for substantial crop recovery and market prices have weakened accordingly on august 12 2008 usda released the first crop production estimates for corn and soybeans that have incorporated survey data from the floodaffected regions according to usda us farmers will produce the second largest corn crop on record 123 billion bushels in 2008 up about 5 from the previous months forecast but down over 6 from last years record crop usdas soybean crop forecast of nearly 3 billion bushels is unchanged from july but up 15 from 2007 these production forecasts reflect three factors first floodrelated acreage losses appear to be substantially less than initially projected second nearly ideal growing conditions that have persisted across the corn belt since late june have contributed to sharp increases in usdas yield outlook for corn thus offsetting floodrelated area losses third despite 176 increase in planted acreage in 2008 soybean production is flat due to diminished yield outlook largely the result of the lateness of the crops planting and development as well as dry conditions in the delta the southeast and the northern plains congress has appropriated nearly 480 million in emergency usda funding primarily for conservation activities in floodaffected regions as part of the fy2008 supplemental appropriations act pl 110252 usda has also committed resources to the floodaffected areas including rescue and clean up food assistance housing community assistance business assistance and farmer and rancher assistance in addition usda announced permission on july 7 2008 to use crp land for grazing only in disaster and contiguous counties in light of current market uncertainties surrounding the 200809 supply and demand balance for corn and soybeans and the outlook for extremely tight supplies by late summer commodity market prices are likely to remain volatile through the remainder of the growing season if crop production ultimately proves less than forecast to be determined at harvest time it will likely contribute to higher commodity prices thereby adding to pressure on policymakers over concerns about consumer food price inflation international food aid availability and the soundness of policy that dedicates commercial agricultural

of 2008 potential impact on agriculture background the united states plays critical role in global markets for both feed grains and oilseeds the united states is the worlds leading producer and exporter of both corn and soybeans in 2007 the united states had 42 and 63 shares respectively of world corn production and trade and 32 and 41 shares of world soybean production and trade as result of this dominant role unexpected changes in us production for either corn or soybeans such as those stemming from the midwest floods of 2008 can have major impact on both us and global commodity markets during the first half of 2008 us and world agricultural markets for most grains and oilseeds experienced tight supplies and record high prices1 the high prices provided tantalizing incentive for us farmers as they prepared to plant their crops this past spring in contrast the dramatic unexpectedly sharp price increases of the past year have raised costs for livestock feeders and agricultural processors evoked considerable concern about consumer foodprice inflation and international food aid availability and sparked global debate referred to as the food versus fuel debate about the increasing policy trend of dedicating commercial agricultural crops to biofuels production particularly corn used for ethanol against this backdrop of producer anticipation and consumer angst substantial new concerns emerged by late june about potential weather and floodrelated production losses to this years us corn and soybean crops widespread good growing conditions have persisted since the floods adding to the uncertainty over crop production prospects us corn belt the corn belt is 13state region located in the midwest where corn is the predominant cash crop figure 1 it stretches from ohio through indiana illinois iowa northern missouri southern wisconsin and minnesota to the eastern fringe of the great plains states of north and south dakota nebraska and kansas the corn belt also includes parts of michigan and kentucky since 2000 these 13 states have accounted for 89 of us corn production table 3 iowa and illinois in the heart of the corn belt are the two leading cornproducing states with combined production share of 36 similarly 88 of us soybean production occurs in the 13 corn belt states with iowa and illinois again the two leading producers with

third despite 176 increase in planted acreage in 2008 soybean production is flat due to diminished yield outlook largely due to the lateness of the crops planting and development as well as dry conditions in the delta the southeast and the northern plains usdas august crop production forecast appear to have calmed much of the market concern regarding crop losses due to flooding however large portion of the 2008 corn and soybean crops were planted late and as of early august remain substantially behind historical development rates3 as of august 11 usda estimates that 30 of corn had reached the dough stage of development compared with the 5year average of 50 while only 6 had dented compared with an average of 16 the past five years similarly 60 of soybean plants had set pods compared with the 5year average of 75 as result market analysts suggest that weather problems could still emerge such as an early freeze that could lower yield and 2 crop production national agricultural

regions the yield estimates are based on objective field surveys while the planted and harvested acreage estimates are usually drawn from the june acreage report4 however most of the survey data for the acreage report was collected during the first two weeks of june prior to the worst flooding in response to the changed circumstances usda conducted an extensive reinterview of producers harvesting intentions in midjuly in the floodaffected areas of illinois indiana iowa minnesota missouri and wisconsin to supplement the earlier survey data in deriving estimates of abandoned and harvested acres5 usda stated that under return to normal weather conditions by midjuly most flooded fields would be dry and affected farmers would be better able to assess their options data obtained from the midjuly reinterviews were incorporated into usdas august 12 2008 crop production and wasde reports outlook for corn harvested acres usda estimates 2008 us planted and harvested corn area of 86977 and 79290 million acres respectively6 this compares with the june acreage estimates of 87327 million and 78940 million acres table 1 thus planted corn acreage has been revised downward 350000 acres while harvested acreage was raised by 350000 acres planted area losses occurred primarily in the floodaffected states harvested area gains occurred primarily in states outside of the flood regions and is reflected in belowaverage abandonment rates high market prices appear to be encouraging farmers to make every effort to harvest more marginal areas that are traditionally abandoned or grazed off by livestock outlook for soybean harvested acres usda estimates 2008 us planted and harvested soybean area of 74783 million and 73341 million acres respectively7 this compares with the june acreage

harvested area gains occurred primarily in the floodaffected states outlook for corn yield usdas august estimate of 2008 corn yields was 155 bushels per acre if realized this would be the second

southeast delta and northern plains appears to be taking its toll just month earlier in july usda had forecast national average soybean yields at 416 buac based on 19892007 regional trend analysis adjusted for late planting and emergence10 as with corn final soybean yields may still vary based on growing conditions through the remainder of the growing season estimating crop losses for 2008 floodrelated crop damage assessments generally are made by county and state officials in the affected regions however rough approximation of flooddamaged acres can be obtained by comparing the implied statelevel abandonment rates from usdas august forecasts with the recent eightyear average abandonment rates if one attributes any change from the 8year average entirely to the flood then the data suggest that about 889000 acres planted to corn and intended for harvest were lost in iowa 453000 illinois 236000 indiana 102000 and missouri 99000 see table 1 this lost area estimate represents about 1 of the 870 million acres planted to corn in 2008 however projected belowaverage abandonment rates throughout the remainder of the corn belt particularly in nebraska kansas south dakota ohio and in loweryielding noncorn belt states more than offset the lost acres applying usda august yield forecasts to the arealoss calculations suggests that the four major floodaffected states of iowa 775 million bushels illinois 406 indiana 158 and missouri 144 cumulatively account for 1482 million bushels of potentially lost production11 this lost production estimate represents 12 of the 123 billion bushel crop estimate announced by usda applying the same abandonment rate methodology to soybeans suggests that projected area loss related to bad weather and flooding amounts to nearly 400000 acres in the corn belt partially offset by 184000 acres of belownormal abandonment in noncorn belt states table 2 this lost area estimate represents about 02 of the 748 million acres planted to soybeans in

minnesota 1312 this lost production estimate represents 21 of the estimated 3 billion bushel crop unusual spring weather across the us corn belt wet cool weather persists since late 2007 the 2008 midwest weatherrelated crop problems the late planting start slow crop development and severe june flooding were precipitated in 2007 by abovenormal rainfall and cold wet winter that saturated soils in iowa 2007 was the fourthwettest year on record13 the unusually cool wet conditions persisted through spring 2008 again citing iowa which was subsequently hit the hardest by june floods figure 2 as an example the first six months of 2008 represented the wettest januarytojune period on record cool weather inhibited evaporation rates thus slowing the soils rate of drying as result many regions of the corn belt were saturated and vulnerable to erosion ponding standing water and flooding when heavy storms in late may and early june dropped additional rainfall planting date is critical for optimal yields traditionally farmers plant corn as early as possible because early planting provides the greatest potential to achieve maximum yields14 corn is usually planted ahead of soybeans early corn planting is discouraged by wet or cold soils below 50o f as result more southerly regions tend to have earlier optimal planting dates in iowa the optimal corn planting dates are between april 20 and may 5 yields begin to drop off as the planting date is delayed significant yield reduction occurs when the planting date is extended to late may or june similarly the optimal soybean planting date in iowa is the last week of april for the southern twothirds of the state and the first week of may for the northern third optimal planting dates in more northerly latitudes such as in minnesota or wisconsin occur slightly later and have smaller window for delayed planting this years excessive rainfall coupled with unusually persistent cold ground temperatures delayed both corn plantings and subsequent plant emergence across much of the prime growing region of the corn belt by may 11 only 51 of intended corn area in the corn belt had been planted compared with the previous 5 year average 200207 of 7715 similarly only 11 of intended soybean area had been planted compared with the 5year average of 29 the late start pushed key 12 note that these calculations by crs are purely

susceptible to heat stress and dryness and later into the fall when the possibility of an early freeze can prematurely end ear or pod filling in addition late start to corn generally implies late start to soybean production whose planting generally follows corn with similar growth concerns figure 2 counties designated as presidential disaster areas by may 27 88 of intended corn acres had been planted versus the 5year average of 94 and 52 of intended soybean acres versus 5year average of 67 however equally if not more critical were the ongoing delays in plant emergence for both crops only 52 of planted corn had emerged compared with 5year average of 76 emergence and only 12 of planted soybeans had emerged versus the 5year average of 34 as result crop yield concerns were already developing by late may june flooding ravages key growing areas with soils already saturated and yield concerns mounting widespread heavy rains across the corn belt in late may and early june washed out substantial areas recently planted to crops in addition they produced severe erosion and gullying and left saturated soils and standing water in many fields but most damagingly the rains triggered widespread flooding across the heart of the corn belt thousands of acres of prime cropland in iowa nebraska illinois indiana wisconsin and missouri were flooded by rivers that swelled their banks and caused levees to break as the storm surge moved through the mississippi river watershed indianas agriculture director said that the june crs7 floods had likely caused the worst agriculture disaster in the states history damaging nearly 10 of corn and soybean crops16 the flooding likely led to the abandonment of substantial planted crop acreage and to yield losses in those crops that survived the flooding but were subject to extended periods of standing water or waterlogged soil17 further concern of saturated soils persisting during the early stages of plant development particularly for lateplanted crops is that corn plants are more likely to develop shallow root systems which in turn increase their vulnerability to heat and dryness later in the growing cycle initial attempts to ascertain the extent of the crop damage were difficult because the eventual yield and production outcomes for the affected areas depends on how quickly flood waters recede and whether plant growth resumes or new seed is planted for many farmers by late june the replanting window for corn had already closed or was approaching faster than the soils were drying in many cases the indemnities offered under federally subsidized crop insurance represented greater potential remuneration than incurring the costs of replanting subject to substantial reduction in yield coverage due to the late planting date replanting to soybeans was an option for some but many farmers who initially planted corn had already applied round of herbicide which would likely damage or kill the soybean seed floodrelated crop production and marketing issues transportation infrastructure damage while spring flooding in the upper midwest had caused problems for barge traffic earlier in the year the extreme rain in june stopped navigation on nearly 300mile stretch of the mississippi river18 major parts of the rail network in the midwest were damaged and several major highways in iowa were temporarily closed the transportation infrastructure damage resulted in significant delays as grain shipments were rerouted and repairs were underway by july 6 the mississippi river had reopened to commercial traffic but substantial delays persisted as result many shipments of corn and soybeans were still being rerouted to texas gulf ports agricultural processing and storage facilities disruptions the

temporarily closed or operating at reduced capacity in the weeks immediately following the floods the iowa renewable fuels association initially estimated that more than 300 million gallons annualized of ethanol production capacity were off line on june 1319 in addition several grain elevators and other types of storage facilities located within the flood zone were damaged the number of grain elevators damaged and the potential volume of corn and soybean stocks lost is not yet available but is being evaluated by usda livestock losses and disposal issues the suddenness of the floods across eastern iowa resulted in the deaths of possibly thousands of head of livestock particularly hogs however preliminary assessments for the state of iowa suggest that the actual livestock mortality tally may be substantially lower than initially feared20 it appears that most producers had sufficient advance warning of potential flood conditions to move their animals to safer location ahead of the floods the federal response designated disaster areas the president is authorized by the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act the stafford act to issue major disaster or emergency declarations in response to catastrophes that overwhelm state and local governments21 iowa with 85 of its 99 counties declared eligible for either individual or public federal disaster area appeared to be the hardest hit by the storms and flooding22 however counties in indiana 44 counties illinois 24 minnesota 4 wisconsin 30 nebraska 53 as well as west virginia 18 were also identified as primary disaster areas related to the spring floods figure 223 19 grain storage facilities take hit from flooding by tim hoskins minnesota farm guide july 3 2008 20 conversation with staff at the iowa

appropriations to the drf remain available until expended however drf funds are not available to cover agricultural production losses instead usda offers several permanently authorized programs to help farmers recover financially from natural disaster including federal crop insurance the noninsured assistance program nap and emergency disaster loans24 agricultural assistance usda is actively engaged in committing resources to the flood response in this regard usda has undertaken broad range of activities in the floodaffected areas including rescue and clean up food assistance housing community assistance business assistance and farmer and rancher assistance25 congress has appropriated nearly 480 million in emergency usda funding specifically targeted to 2008 midwest flood response activities as part of the fy2008 supplemental appropriations act pl 110252 this funding is available for eligible farmers to defray the cost of cleanup and rehabilitation of farmland and watersheds following disaster26 of the total amount available 894 million is for the emergency conservation program which assists farmers in the cleanup and restoration of farmland damaged by natural disaster and 3905 million is for the emergency watershed protection program which is designed to relieve imminent hazards created by natural disasters and to alleviate future flood risk the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 included provisions that authorized and funded new fouryear supplemental revenue crop disaster program for crop years 2008201127 however without advance payments emergency supplemental disaster assistance for 2008 crop and livestock losses will be available before october 2009 this is because according to the farm bill disaster programs design the payment formula used to determine the level of payments for 2008 crop and revenue losses is based on national average market prices which will not be known until fall 2009 usda claims that it does not have the authority to make advance payments some policymakers want to amend the farm bill to require usda to make advance payments while several farm groups contend that usda already has the flexibility and should exercise its authority 24 for

disaster assistance in the 2008 farm bill by ralph m chite crs10 usda has also been under considerable pressure from members of congress and groups representing the livestock biofuels and agricultural processing sectors to do more to bring high commodity prices down corn and soybean products are important ingredients for those industries among other things these groups have called for the secretary of agriculture to announce penaltyfree release of acreage presently under longterm contract in the conservation reserve program crp28 and for the epa administrator to announce waiver of the renewable fuels standard which mandates an increasing minimum use of biofuels in the national fuel supply29 on april 25 2008 texas governor rick perry in letter to stephen johnson administrator of the environmental protection agency epa the federal agency responsible for administering the rfs to request that epa waive 50 of the rfs ethanol requirements to alleviate their impact on corn prices30 however governor perrys request was denied by the epa31 on may 27 usda announced that 24 million acres of crp land could be used in 2008 for critical feed use cfu program of managed haying and grazing following primary bird nesting season32 however us district court issued permanent injunction on july 24 against the cfu except for those who applied before temporary restraining order issued on july 833 floodrelated crop production concerns have added to this pressure and have perhaps contributed to the usda decision on july 7 2008 to announce that permission is granted in both presidential

prices for feed grains and oilseeds as well as those crops that compete for area with feed grains and oilseeds to remain at significantly higher levels than experienced during the recent 19982006 period36 the main factors behind higher longterm prices are projections for steady rise in global population accompanied by steady income growth in the worlds developing economies which combine to sustain growth in demand for livestock products and the feedstuffs eg coarse grains and protein meals needed to produce those products in addition the outlook for increased demand for agricultural feedstocks to meet large increases in government biofuelusage policies particularly in the united states and the european union eu suggest that demand will increase strongly over the coming decade for corn the primary feedstock for us ethanol production and vegetable oils the primary feedstock for biodiesel production in the united states and the eu these longrun forecasts assume normal crop growing conditions and successful harvests as result any deviation from normal growing conditions can be expected to have negative market repercussions and drive prices higher the potential weather and floodrelated production losses to this years us corn and soybean crops were unwelcome news to the market and likely to contribute to higher commodity prices in june because the united states plays dominant role in global corn and soybean markets us price changes transmit directly to the international marketplace in summary good growing conditions during july and early august of 2008 appear to have moderated initial concerns over potential floodrelated crop losses however large portion of the 2008 corn and soybean crops were planted late and as of early august remain substantially behind historical development rates as result market analysts suggest that weather problems such as an early freeze could still emerge to lower yield and production prospects such concerns are likely contribute to volatile commodity prices thereby maintaining pressure on policymakers over concerns about consumer food price inflation international food aid availability and the soundness of policy that dedicates commercial agricultural crops to biofuels production particularly corn used for ethanol 35 continued what are the issues by randy schnepf 36 for examples of longterm agricultural
