ways been the province of the states and their localities the first juvenile court in america was founded in 1899 in cook county illinois twentyfive years later all but two states had enacted legislation establishing separate juvenile court system for young offenders the mission of these juvenile courts was to attempt to turn young delinquents into productive adults rather than merely punishing them for their crimes this led to marked procedural and substantive differences between the adult nd juvenile court systems in the states including focus on the offenders and not the offenses and rehabilitation inst ead of punishment1 congress began to get involved in the stat juvenile justice systems in the 1960s and 1970s as the baby boom generation be gan to reach adolescence

through the department of health edu cation and welfare to conduc t demonstration projects to research improved methods fo r preventing and controlling crime among juveniles in 1968 congress passed the juvenile delinque ncy prevention and control act of 1968 pl 90445 to provide assistance to stat and local governments and train juvenile justice personnel in order to receive funding states were required to designate single agency to take the lead in improving deli nquency prevention and c ontrol programs pl 90445 also placed juvenile justice within the purview of the doj for the first time despite these congressional efforts to rein in juvenile crime juvenile arrests for violent crimes increased by 216 between 1960 and 19742 this increase outstripped the growth in the juvenile population engendered by the baby boom the under18 population grew from 47 million in 1950 to 70 million in 1970 an increase of 493 it seemed apparent that the technical assistance and financial ai d that congress had provided the states was not enough to address the growing problem of juvenile crime in 1974 congress addressed the issue by passing the first comprehensive piece of juvenile justice legislation the juvenile justice and delinque ncy prevention act pl 93415 in the 1980s many states responded to the public perception that juvenile crime was increasing by passing more punitive laws for juvenile offenders some of these laws removed certain types of juvenile crimes from the juvenile court system altogether mandating that they be handled by the adult criminal system instead other laws instituted mandatory sentences for juvenile offenders c onvicted of certain cr imes this movement towards punishment of juven iles and away from rehabilitation accelerated in the 1990s with all but three states4 passing laws that modified or removed traditional juvenile court confidentiality agreements all but five states5 passing laws easing the transfer of juveniles into the adult criminal justice system and majority of states passing laws expanding sentencing options for juveniles6 congress has also incorporated more punitive measures into the accepted federal funding str eams for juvenile justice programs juvenile crime trends figure 1 shows that the juvenile violent crime index which combines arrests for murder forcible rape robbery and aggravated assault in creased steadily from the late 1980s to the mid1990s reaching an all time hi gh in 1994 some have attributed this increase in violent crime to an increase in youthgangs during this period whereas others maintain that

decreased by 47 over that span this downward trend parallels that of the national violent crime rate which has also declined each year since 1994 and reached record low in 20038 one gauge often used to evaluate the effectiveness of the juvenile justice system is the number of cases referred to juvenile courts nationwide9 although the actual process by which juvenile cases are handled can va ry widely nationwide the number of cases referred is nevertheless the best available data concerni ng the day to day functioning of the juvenile justice system the number of referrals to juvenile court for violent crime index offenses fell by 37 from 1995 to 1999 mirroring the overall reduction in arrests during that period seen in figure 1 however the overall number of delinquency cases processed by juvenile cour ts around the country increased by 27 from 1990 to 1999 the bulk of this increase came from drug viol ations which increased by 169 during the decade and public order offenses such as disrupting the peace which increased by 7410 lastly although the number of arrests for violent crimes is clearly an important gauge of the scope of the juvenile crime pr oblem in the united states it does not capture all of the nuances involved in the issue ma ny incidences of youth violence do not result in arrests or formal charges and are thus not captured by this index according to surgeon general report in 2001 for every outh who was arrested for violent crime during the late 1990s there were at least 10 ot hers who engaged in violent behavior that could have seriously injured or killed another person this led the surgeon general tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22070crs4 11 us surgeon general youth violence report of the surgeon general 2001 available at http wwwsurgeongener

disconcertingly high11 juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act of 1974 the juvenile justice and delinquency pr evention act jjdpa was first passed by congress in 1974 and was most recently reauthorized in 2002 by the 21st century department of justice ppropriations authorization act pl 107273 although congress first began to addr ess juvenile justice in the 1960s the jjdpa was and continues to be the landmark piece of legislation in the field when it was first enacted jjdpa transformed the way states handled th eir juvenile offenders by mandating the deinstitutionalization of status offenders dso by states12 as such the act mandated that status offenders were to be diverted from instutional placement to shelters and that juveniles be separate d by sight and sound from adult offenders when placed in shared detention facilities in order to receive formula grant f unding authorized by the act states were required to comply with the acts mandates in the three decades that followed congress made several importa nt revisions to the jjdpa in 1980 congress modified the jjdpa to prohibit states from detaining j uveniles in local lockups and adult jails and approved an exception to the dso mandate for status offenders who were found to be in violation of va lid court order13 in 1988 congress added disproportionate minority confinement mandate to the act that required states that received grants through the jjdpa to assure that they would formulat strategy to reduce the overrepresentation of minorities in their juvenile justice syst ems in 1992 congress created two national initiatives under title ii of the jjdpa the gang free schools and communities program and the state challenge activities grant program congress also created title v incentive grants for local delinquency prevention programs14 authorization for the jjdpa as amended expired in 1996 but congre ss continued to appr opriate funding for juvenile justice programs under the act the 21st century department of justice ppropriations author ization act of 2002 made significant changes to the jjdpa and reauthorized the act through fy2007 the main change made to the jjdpa was the tablishment of new juvenile delinquency prevention block grant jdpbg program which replaced the various grant programs under title ii jdpbg grants are awarded to the states and indian tribes under formula which is based on the proportion of the popula tion that is under 18 years of age the states then apportion the grants to eligible localities but must give special consideration to grant applications from areas with high levels of juvenile crime currently the jjdpa continues to have the followi ng four core mandates status offenders cannot be held in secure facilities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22070crs5 15 rural areas are exempted from this provision in that such detention is permissible for 24 hours if acceptable alternative placement is available with certain exceptions 16 42 usc 5633 a22states cannot detain juve niles arrested for nonstatus offenses in adult lockups or jails15 states must separate juvenile offenders from adults in jail and from parttime or fulltime security adult prisoner staff or directcare staff ojjdp has interpreted this as requi ring sight and sound separation states are to address juvenile linquency prevention efforts and system improvement efforts designed to reduce without establishing or requiring numerical standards or quotas the disproportionate num ber of juvenile members of minority groups who come into contact with the juvenile justice system16 juvenile accountab ility block grants in 1998 congress created the juvenile accountability incentive block grants jaibg program through the doj appropr iations bill pl 105119 the jaibg program marked shift in the federal governments juvenile justice policy away from rehabilitation and towards the strengthening of state and local juvenile justice systems through the implementation of reforms that stressed accountability the jaibg program established 12 purpose areas for grant funding including among other things expanding juvenile corrections fac ilities developing and admin istering accountabilitybased sanctions hiring and training more juven ile court staff including judges probation officers and public defenders funding for hiring more prosecutors increasing their effectiveness and improving the technology at their disposal and establishing juvenile drug and gun courts the 21st century department of justice appropriations authorization act of 2002 replaced the jaib g program with the juvenile accountability block grants jabg program the new jabg program further emphasized enforcement and accountability by increasing the number of purpose areas for funding from 12 to 16 the additional areas included developing and implementing systems of graduated sanctions establishing and maintaining juvenile records systems creating programs that utilize risk and needs assessments establishing and maintaining restorative justice programs and hiring corrections personne l additionally the maximum authorized annual funding level was re duced
