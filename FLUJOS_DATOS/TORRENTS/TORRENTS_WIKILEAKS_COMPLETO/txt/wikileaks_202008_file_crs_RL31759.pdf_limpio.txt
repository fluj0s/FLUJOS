for congress introduction afghanistan has begun the slow proce ss of reconstruction according to many observers the most serious challenge faci ng afghans and afghanistan today remains the lack of security while the taliban regime fell and the new government has celebrated its first anniversary afghanis tan is still in peacebuilding process an essential part of which is reconstructio n most observers agree on the need for substantial longterm reconstruction nd the need for international support but questions are raised about the funds requi red the priorities and the coordination necessary for this process this report examines us foreign aid to afghanistan in the context of the international effort nd explores the major issues for congress background past forms of assistance to afghanistan the united states other countries and international relief organizations have long been active in providing assistance to the afghan people1 during the 1980s the united states along with other count ries had funded through pakistan the mujahedin forces fighting against th soviet union as well as providing humanitarian aid to the large refugee camps in pakistan after the soviet union left afghanistan and dissolved the united stat sharply reduced its programs from fy1994 the united states agency for inte rnational development usaid did not have mission in afghanistan but conti nued to provide aid mainly through agencies and nongovernmental organizations ngos during the violent civil war that lasted throughout the 1990s the ited nations continued to seek peace agreement which would allow for sustai ned reconstruction however with the failure of several peace agreements th international donor community focused primarily on humanitarian aid because the c onditions were not stable for longterm development and donors did not want to pr ovide assistance to the taliban which came to power in 1996 between 1996 and 2001 the united states alone provided half billion dollars in emergency aid to afghanistan2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31759crs2 3 for further discussion of these economies see usaid us agency for international development afghanistan recovery and reconstruction strategy october 18 2002 4 for more information please refer to crs report rl31710 afghanistan prospects for opium eradication by rensselaer leethe assistance situation changed dramatically once the taliban was removed from power allowing for the implementation of humanitarian assistance and the development of recons truction plans these plans quickly took shape with the bonn accord on december 5 2001 which led to the formation on december 22 2001 of an interim government led by hamid karzai the central government was further strengthened in june 2002 through the loya jirga which was attended by 1550 delegates it chose new government to run afghanistan for the next two years during which time new constitution is to be drafted and elections are to be held at the loya jirga karzai was chosen to lead th new government named the islamic transitional government of afghanistan itga the afghan government has been working with the international donor co mmunity on reconstruction programs and plans since major donor conference in january 2002 in tokyo and subsequent ongoing meetings with international donors as result of decades of violent conflict afghanistan is in great need of substantial reconstruction fro m roads and schools to br oad range of development projects encompassing the whole country ccording to usaid the decades of civil war and proxy regional war have created four intertwining nd competing economies in afghanistan3 these economies create conflicting incentives for afghans and their neighbors and have dete rmining influence on the future of afghanistan there is the war economy an econom of arms trafficking looting kidnaping black market activity and the brokering of violence different factions funded by ne ighboring countries control border crossings generate revenue from trade and illicit smuggling support militias through arms purchases and thus fuel violence some contend that this economy creates incentives for the continuation of conflict connected with the first is the drug economy4 poppy trade provides substantial income for some afghans but also has led to skyrocketing addiction rates in the region and created incentives leading away from other forms of agriculture critical to the sustained livelihood of the country as result of decades of conf lict deep poverty and ongoing drought many afghans rely on the benevolence of the international community which has created humanitarian aid economy while humanitarian aid is essential in the shortterm the influx of money and people can create distortions in local markets and provide few incentives for local production as result development aid agencies will be critical to assi sting afghans with local productionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31759crs3 5

before the civil war afghan istan had been selfsustaining in agricultural production in additi on afghanistan also has other economic sectors though much weak ened by war the most vibrant sector is

reconstruction recently got underway the united states and the international community provided other forms of assistance humanitarian military and security during the height of the antitaliban war and with the preparations for both winters 2002 and 2003 the focus of ssistance was on the continuation of the war and on humanitarian aid and quickimpact projects humanitarian military and security assistance continue humanitarian assistance the united nations and other organizations have provided afghans human itarian assistance since at least 1979 when the soviet union invaded afghanistan5 as result of this long term involvement the united nations and other organizations had basic institutional network in the region to provide and expand humanitarian assistance since the fall of the taliban regime and the establishment of new government this institutional network has been utilized the afghan government and the international donor commun ity have sought to focus on reconstruction but humanitarian relief assistance continues to be greatly needed the overwhelming majority of assistance outside of military aid to date has been spent on humanitarian needs the united states has been the largest contributor of humanitarian assistance to afghans6 refugees and internally displaced persons idps have been the focus of much humanitarian assistance these groups have been returning to their homes in unexpectedly high numbers the high commissioner for refugees unhcr reports that since march 1 2002 more than two million afghan refugees have repatriated mainly fro m pakistan but

international organizati ons and countless ngos working to help afghanistan the international community and the afghan government have sought to establish common set of goals in or der to utilize donor funds most effectively in agreement with many in the interna tional donor community during its sixmonth tenure the first transitional government identified intended outcomes of the reconstruction process political stability and security access to basic services an adequate standard of living for its people economic growth and in the long term independence from foreign aid17 however these goals are broad and abstract because afghanistan not only experienced 23 years of war but also was one of the less developed countries even before the war particularly in the case of afghanistan humanitarian assistance reconstruction and developmen t are not easily separable humanitarian assistance can overlap with the goals of reconstructi on such as by repairing water systems to provide clean water or by providing basi c building materials to repair housing reconstruction and development further bl end in the case of afghanistan these efforts run on parallel and sometimes overlapping tracks institutional mechanisms to understand the reconstruc tion process in afghanistan it is useful to be familiar with the different institutions involved in the process and their own particular institutional mechanisms fo r conducting and coordi nating postconflict reconstruction many of these mechanisms were put into pl ace during earlier reconstruction attempts in afghanistan or were result of less ons learned from other postconflict countries building on thes initiatives the international community sees afghanistan as test case for new forms of donor coordination as result not only is afghanistan the beneficiary of pa st practices but also the international community including the united states has invested itself in the success of afghan reconstruction us institutions

implement reconstruction as the s development agency undp in 1993 conducted major study for the imme diate rehabilitation and longterm reconstruction of afghanistan in response to peace accords in

there was hope again for peace accord21 in afghanistan undp developed its strategic framework new coordinating structur aimed to bring coherence to multilateral b ilateral and nongove rnment efforts the undp planned to reorient international development according to this new structure and thus afghanistan played an important role in these new ideas and programs as part of this framework the united nations organized the international forum on assistance to afghanistan in turkmenistan which led to the afghanistan support group asg made up of the 15 largest donor countries and the eu asg met until recently twice per year and focused on coordi nation of humanitarian relief efforts22 since september 11 2001 this formal coordina ting structure for humanitarian and reconstruction efforts has been utilized the world bank has also had continuing role for countries in conflict the world bank generally puts them in watchin g brief status during which the world bank monitors the countrys economy and provides analytical support to international relief agencies at work with in its borders thus supporting preparation efforts for reconstruction in 1997 afghan istan entered watching brief

taliban regime supposedly neutral nonpartisan humanitarian assistance could appear partisan coordination is comp licated matter but some would argue that there should be coordination only among likeminded organizations such as among humanitarian groups separate from the coor dination of political groups and separate from the coordination of military oriented groups34 funding international and us funding levels areas of concern include whether the fundi ng levels to afghanistan are adequate and whether funding is being used for reconstruction the afghan governments donor assistance database which keeps track of aid flows provides picture of international funding levels for list of th funds committed and disbursed by country see the appendix of this report it should be recognized that these numbers are selfreported by countries may include double counting such as country pledges that flow through organizations and may cover nonmone tary items such as food aid or donation of used goods in addition some new projects have not yet been included such as road project proposed by iran donor countries have committed 17 b illion and from that disbursed 15 billion the top donor countries in des cending order by funds committed are as follows the united states european commission japan germany united kingdom saudi arabia the nether lands italy france and china35 pledge fulfillment problems with donor countries committing 17 billion and disbursing 15 billion the numbers approach the 18 billion pledged at the donor conference in tokyo in january 2002 throughout the year however the afghan government expresse d disappointment and even exasperation for delays in the delivery of funds that slowed rec onstruction and theref ore undermined popular support of the government according to th afghan government as of october 11 2002 about 67 of the pledges had been disbursed36 some of these delays could be explained by the donor countries need to obtain congressiona l or parliamentary support and appropriations fo r funds which takes time yet efforts have been needed to make certain countries deliver their pledges in addition some countries have changed their pledges for example for the kabulkandaharherat road project saudi arabia has changed its 50 million pl edge to 30 million lowinterest loan37httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31759crs13 38 us

two of these senior official s went to the persian gulf to fundraise and obtained several new pledges38 questions about funding levels despite the seemingly large pledges many observers have argued that even the pledged amounts are not adequate according to the preliminary needs asse ssment presented in january 2002 by the undp the world bank and the asian velopment bank adb afghanistan would need 15 billion over the next 10 years39 us secretary of state colin powell stated that afghanistan would need 8 billion over the next five years40 the afghan government however seeks much more money

countries at the tokyo conference pledge d around 45 billion about one third of the undpwbadb 15 billion estimate though th 18 billion pledge for the first year met the estimated levels the

eemed necessary by the undp world bank and adb observers also have found that in compar ison with other countries afghanistan has received smaller pledges and less funding the pledges calculated as per capita annual allocations are far sm aller in afghanistan than in many other postconflict situations 42 for afghanistan versus 195 for east timor 288 for kosovo and 326 for bosnia43 as part of

according to this view food aid in nonemergency situation undercuts market prices for food and d ecreases the incentiv for agricultural production48 in addition the afghan government argues for different process of funding since humanitarian aid generally moves through the united nations and non governmental organizations the afghan government does not have access to these funds or control over how they are distri buted moreover it cannot use these funds to increase capacity building in the gove rnment and therefore cannot demonstrate government effectiveness to the afghan population

smallscale and some large longerterm mostly road projects are underway there are several issues of concern for the international community the afghan government and observers beyond the funding challenges discussed above first the lack of security has threatened the pr ogress of reconstruc tion second not much obvious progress has been made on recons truction because there have been many small programs and few larg programs according to some observers afghans have become frustrated with what they perceive as little evidence of reconstruction there are many possible explanations for the percei ved lack of progress lack of security lack of human and physical capacity to implement substantial reconstruction inadequate funding levels and funding predominately going towards the continuing humanitarian crisis and towards the admin istrative costs of the international donor community rather than towards reconstructi on projects both security and progress on reconstruction are

82 this agreement was signed by afghanistan iran pakistan china tajikistan uzbekistan and turkmenistan in addition to the administration some in congress have talked about developing marshall plan for afghanistan so far th calls for marshall plan seems to mean only sustained longterm commitment to reconstruction which in the case of afghanistan includes nation building the marshall plan for europe was substantially different from what is evident in afghanistan first the european marshall plan would have been 103 billion in todays money spread out over four years which is much more than the amount currently provided by the united states even including the military assistance s econd the european marshall plan was also regional strategy for western europe as opposed to national strategy third afghanistan is much less developed than western europe was at the time which means that reconstruction will entail much more development senator biden proposed kind of marsha ll plan for central

pakistan ira n russia the central asian countries india and the united states sought to influen ce the wars outcome from experiences in other similar situations in rwanda somalia nd kosovo scholars have argued that peace processes are most threatened in count ries with intervening neighbors as result these scholars have argued for re construction efforts in afghanistan to be coordinated with

aid by the united states and other c ountries is also an issue for congress on the one hand f ood aid can undermine market prices and provide disincentives for agricultura l production and thus some parts of reconstruction other forms of assistance such as cashforwork programs could help afghanistan reduce its dependence on in ternational assistance on the other hand food aid and humanitarian assistance are considered essentia l in some parts of afghanistan the form of assistance is significant issue for congress funding in march 2003 the next major donor conf erence for afghanistan will take place the pledges at the first donor conference in tokyo in january 2002 nearly met the first year needs assessment conducted by th world bank undp and adb however these pledges were primarily used for humanitarian assistance furthermore reconstruction is just now slowly beginning and there is concern about maintaining donor interest in afghan reconstruction therefore the pledges at the march conference are pa rticularly important in regard to us funding the administrations request for fy2004 for afghanistan totals 531 million not including disaster assistance86 some members of congress believe the amounts should be greater with fewer constraints the afghanistan fr eedom support act of 2002 pl 107327 authorizes 33 billion over four years in addition if marshall plan were to

countries be encouraged to contribute more how can interest in afghanistan from the donor community be sustained donor conferences and trust funds many inside and outside the afghan government have cr iticized donors for not following through on their pledges howe ver donor conferences in general exhibit problems such as slow disbursement of funds weak mechanisms for pledging and mobilizing assistance inadequate devices for tracking aid flows inappropriate forms of aid conditionality poor artic ulation between relief and development efforts and weak coordination within the donor community87 donors overpledge pledge already allocated funds and slowly or ne ver fulfill their pledges in the case of afghanistan the international community has sought to avoid some of these problems such as through the creation of the aaca aid data base which has made pledging tracking and monitoring more transparent whether donor conferences and trust funds are the best way to fund reconstruction has been questioned by some observers who also ask if the united stat should give more money to the trust funds if not then other poten tial methods must be examined military role in humanitarian assistance as of this fall the pentagon announced th at it was transforming its strategy from military to security and r econstruction goals dod has been providing humanitarian assistance to afghanistan since oef began and it seems that this role in reconstruction framework will increase in general militaries worldwide are increasingly providing such assistance b ecause humanitarian agencies increasingly work in wartorn areas however many ngos have argued that the provision of humanitarian assistance by militaries comes at high cost military provision of this assistance associates humanitarian agencies and actors as well as refugees and other victims with military objectives and activities even with particular sides in the war it is argued that this association may put these agencies and actors in danger on the other hand security remains key factor in the distribution of aid itself and often requires military presence for it to be effective it would be useful to examine the costs and benefits of the increased humanitarian programs conducted by dod in afghanistan and elsewhere to understa nd better the impact of the military on non military assistance programs afghanistan and po ssible iraq war there is consensus that afghanistan requires longterm international attention in order to receive adequa donor funds have successful reconstruction and
