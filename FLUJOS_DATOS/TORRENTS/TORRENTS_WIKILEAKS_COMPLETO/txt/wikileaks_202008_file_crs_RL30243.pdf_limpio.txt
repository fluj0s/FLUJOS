background public concern and confus ion regarding the proper respect shown to the united states flag has given rise to many questions on the law relating to the flags handling display and use both the state gove rnments and the federal government have enacted legislation on this subject on the national level the federal flag code1 provides uniform guidelines for the display of and respect shown to the flag in addition to the code congress has by statute designated the national anthem and set out the pr oper conduct during its presentation2 the code is designed for the use of such civilian groups or organizations as may not be required to c onform with regulations promulgated by one or more executive departments of the federal government3 thus the flag code does not prescribe any penalties for nonco mpliance nor does it include enforcement provisions rather the code f unctions simply as guide to be voluntarily followed by civilians and civilian groups the federal flag code does not purpor t to cover all possible situations although the code empowers the president of the united states to alter modify repeal or prescribe additional rules regarding the flag4 federal agency has the authority to issue official rulings lega lly binding on civilians or civilian groups consequently different interpretations of various provisions of the code may continue to be made the flag code itself however suggests general rule by which practices involving the flag may be fairly tested disrespect should be shown to the flag of the united states of america5 therefore actions not specifically included in the code may be deemed acceptable as long as proper respect is shownhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30243crs2 6 18 usc 700 7 491 us 397 1989 for further information on this case see

code as matter of custom and without specifi c statutory or offi cial authorization the flag is flown at night at many other sites including the united states capitol it would seem that display of the

darkness flying the flag duri ng inclement weather the flag code states the flag should not be displayed on days when the weather is inclement except when an all weather flag is displayed32 the language of this section reflects the nowpopular use of flags made of synthetic fabrics that can withstand unf avorable weather conditions it is not considered disrespectful to fly such flag even during prolonged periods of inclement weather however since the s ection speaks in terms of days when the weather is inclement it apparently does not contemplate that on an otherwise fair day the flag should be lowered dur ing brief periods of precipitation flying the flag at halfstaff the flag code sets out detailed instructions on flying the flag at halfstaff on memorial day and as mark of

to ornament s finials for flagstaffs we know of law or regulation which restricts the use of finial on the staff the eagle finial is used not only by the president the vicepresident and many other federal agencies but also by many civilian organizations and private citizens the selection of the type finial used is matter of pref erence of the individual or organization the placing of fringe on the fl ag is optional with the person or organization and act of congress or executive order ither requires or prohibits the practice fringe is used on indoor flags only as fringe on flags used outdoors would deteriorate rapidly the fringe on flag is considered an honorable enrichment only and its official use by the army dates from 1895 1925 attorney generals opinion states the fringe does not appear to be regarded as an integral part of the flag and its presence cannot be said to constitute an unauthorized addition to the design prescribed by statute an external fri nge is to be distinguished from letters words or emblematic designs printed or superimposed upon the body of the flag itself under the law such additions might be open to objection as unauthorized but the same is

enacted in 194242 the second sentence of 7c prohib iting flying international flags equal in height to the flag of the united states was not in the original flag code this provision was added in 195343 the legislative history of this amendment clearly states that is purpose was to make it an ffense against the united states to display the flag of the united nations or any othe r national or international flag equal to above or in position of superior prominen ce or honor to or in place of the flag of the united states at any place within the united states or any possession or territory thereof44 the only exception recognized is at the headquarters of the united nations when statute contains apparently contradictory provisions the rules of statutory construction first ma ndate an attempt to interpret the provisions so both can be given effect if this proves futile the usual rule is to give effect to the latest in time the reasoning is that this represents the most recent statement of the will of the legislature following this second rule of construction would lead to the conclusion that flying flag of another nation at the same height as the flag of the united states may not be proper eti quette under the federal flag code but this creates right of action in private individuals45 when the united states flag is displayed with the flags of states of the union or municipalities and not with the flags of other nations the federal flag which represents all states should be flown bove and at the center of the other flags46 where there is only one flag pole the federal flag should be displayed above state or municipal flags47 use of the flag in jewelry commercial products wearing apparel and advertising the flag code addresses the impropriety of using the flag as an article of personal adornment design on items of temporary use and item of clothing48 the evident purpose of these suggested restraints is to limit the commercial or common usage of the flag and thus maintain its dignity the 1976 amendments to the code recognized the wearing of flag patch or pin on the left side near the heart of uniforms of military personnel firemen policemen and

never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever50 while wearing the colors may be in poor taste and offensive to many it is important to remember that the flag code is intended as guide to be followed on purely voluntary basis to insure proper re spect for the flag it is at least questionable whether statutes placing civil or criminal penalties on the wearing of clothing bearing or resembling flag could be constitutionally enforced in light of supreme court decisions in th area of flag desecration51 in the past the supreme court has held th at states may restrict use of pictures of the flag on commercial products52 there is federal criminal prohibition on the use of the flag for advertising purposes in the district of columbia53 while commercial speech does not receive the full protection of the first amendment54 the status of these statutes and cases can not be taken for granted in light of eichman and johnson restrictions on size and proportions of the flag questions on size and dimensions usually arise in the context of the display of huge flags the flag code is silent on recommendations for proper flag size and dimensions regulations governing size and dimensions and ot her requirements for flags authorized for federal executive agen cies can be found in executive order 1083455 these regulations provide that the ngth of the flag should be 19 times the width restrictions on display of the flag by real estate associations the freedom to display the american flag act of 200556 prohibits condominium cooperative or real estate management association from adopting or enforcing any policy or agreement that would restrict or prevent member of the association from displaying the flag in accordance with the federal flag code on residential property to which the member has separate ow nership interest
