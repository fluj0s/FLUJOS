although the authority to trigger such emergency electronic surveillance is not limited to the attorney general as in current law the attorney general must be informed of the emergency electronic

obtained when th application is denied or at the end of the sevenday period whiche ver is earliest in the absence of court order authorizing the electronic surveillance the proposed provision imposes the same restrictions on use and disclosure of information acquired or derived from an emergency electronic surveillance as those in current law limitations on liability for providers aiding in fisa electronic surveillance or physical search sec 209f of s 3886 sec 9f of s 2453 would also modify subsection 105i dea ling with limitations in liability for those who provide information fac ilities or
