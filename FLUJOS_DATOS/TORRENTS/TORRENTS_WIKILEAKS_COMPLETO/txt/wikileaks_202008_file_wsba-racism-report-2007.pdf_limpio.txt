1 i introduction this final report report produced by the washington state bar association wsba civil rights committee crc ol ympic peninsula racial discrimination subcommittee subcommittee offers glimpse of racial and ethnic issues in hoquiam and aberdeen primarily among school children that were reported in t he seattle weekly and confirmed by the subcommittee the report descri bes incidents of prejudice and discrimination in which the n word is still used black children are subjected to physical abuse and fights confederate symbols are worn to school and latino immigrants separate themselves into violent gangs at the schoolhouse this investigation was authorized under the wsba bylaws including article viii b1 to investigate and study matters relating to the general purposes and business of the bar which are of continuous and recurring nature and the following wsba crc mission statement the civil rights committee studies and investigates matters relating to american civil liberties to keep the spirit of civil rights alive within the bar and the community civil rights committee available at wwwwsbaorg last viewed on may 5 20071 the problems raised in this report can be mitigated with local community and wsba leadership on the whole it may be that hoquiam and aberdeen are tolerant and fair communities the subcommittee only heard evidence of few students on few occasions whom made life difficult for people of different origins clearly though incidents of racial intolerance are not limited to the olympic peninsula2 therefore these issues are suitable for the statewide attention of the wsba the wsba has unique resources among its statewide membership to provide solutions energy and commitment to educate citizens about the law and 1 graphic language is quoted in this report because t hose are the harsh facts experienced by an african american family in hoquiam the subcommittee does not wi sh to shield itself or the readers of this report from the real pain that these remarks caused vulnerable family to assist this family and other minorities it is important to fully understand their experience 2 see ex email from robert gaudet to wsba crc lis

racial incidents reported in popular press in state of wash in 2005 available at wwwwsbaorg last viewed on may 27 2007 2to support efforts of local leaders to protect civil rights these purposes align with the goals stated in the wsba bylaws including article i a9 to promote understanding of and respect for our legal system and the law under article i b19 the wsba may maintain and foster programs of public information and education about the law and the legal system change however must first come from within the wsba with renewed commitment to the standards reflected in the wsba bylaws and an appreciation for the legal professions unique ability to increase awareness of civil rights issues among lawyers and citizens the victims involved in the incidents that led to this investigation could not find lawyer to represent their interests in hoquiam3 moreover this investigation met resistance from the start within the wsba and such resistance continued months and even more than one year after the formation of the subcommittee4 to address these internal challenges and still continue with this investigation took enormous commitment and resolve from the subcommittees volunteer lawyers this report describes the start of the subcommittees inquiry infra at 1 6 the investigation into criminal allegations infra at 10 14 and collaboration with the local community infra at 17 culminating in large meeting in aberdeen with local officials infra at 22 28 to hear their concerns many solutions that the wsba may undertake and which were 3 see telephone conversation between michael brown and ngela walker nov 20 2006 on file with r gaudet and m brown thad martin was the attorney who told the walkers to file complaint with the aclu unfortunately angela threw away all of the written documentation because she was so upset about the events however martin did nothing further and there has been other attorney who has helped them note this was in response to my question about whether there we re any attorneys working with them 4 the crc cochair reba weiss initially opposed the fo rmation of the subcommittee but majority of crc members voted for the formation of subcommittee to investigate the allegations in the seattle weekly article one to three months later ms weiss suggested in the gene ral meeting of the crc that the subcommittee had real purpose and should be dissolved but again crc members supported the continued work of the subcommittee at public meeting of the wsba bog on september 14 2006 wsba general counsel bob welden stated in reference to the subcommittees august 5 2006 meeting in aberdeen high school at the request of local officials the following in my personal opinion the bar has business going to high school in aberdeen see also ex c at 13 minutes of public session of wsba bog seattle wash sept 14 15 2006 welden reportedit is highly doubtful that advising about civil rights issues within public schools are sic are within the purpose of the standing committee when the subcommittee reported to the general crc on its meeting in aberdeen and the desire of those school offici als to receive general inform ation about constitutional rights of students mr welden in his capacity as staff liaison to the crc noted that it would be inappropriate for the crc to distribute any such brochures or materials to aberdeen high school two subcommittee member s karrin klotz and michael brown had prepared rough drafts containing ge neral information about constitutional ri ghts in schools but those drafts have not been refined or distributed due to this admonition the 2005 2006 staff liaison to the crc kate mullen informed past president brooke taylor in late 2006 that the crc was out of control and runni ng amok in part because of the subcommittees investigative work 3specifically requested by community leaders and teachers in aberdeen infra at 26 28 are discussed in this report infra at 31 34 of this report as proactive opportunities to strengthen civil rights throughout the state particularly for immigrant and minority youth ii investigation the article that sparked an inquiry this inquiry was initiated by the wsba crc as the result of coverpage article published in t he seattle weekly on march 16 2005 titled black and white in grays harbor county by rick anderson see exhibit c the author of the article grew up in the olympic peninsula and had firsthand knowledge of raci issues and challenges mr anderson subsequently confirmed in meeting with the subcommittee that the racial incidents had occurred as wrote about them in the article mr andersons article describes the challenges facing angela walkers african american family in hoquiam the incidents range from the mild eg people asking to touch her sons hair because it is different ex d at 1 to chasing her with an ax and calling him fuckin nigger ex d at 12 emphasis added individuals in hoquiam have said i never felt colored persons hair before ex d at 1 emphasis added ms walker is mixed but her five children and husband are black ex d at 1 because of their race or for some other reason an unknown individual put sugar or something in the gas tank

january 2005 female drove wildly up onto grassy area in west hoquiam where jordan was standing causing him to jump over fence she was trying to hit question says jordan ex d at 3 the community response has been appeared inadequate sometimes when mrs walker reports incidents police tell her to contact the schools and the schools tell her to contact police ex at 3 these struggles appeared particularly ironic in light of the unjustly reputed racial harmony of the pacific northwest ex d at 3 mrs walker believes that city and school officials dont recognize patterns of harassment ex d at 4 mrs walker asked if someone could give school talk on the hurtfulness f racism but hoquiam school officials would not allow racism to be discussed ex d at 4 emphasis added5 hoquiam principal

district principals would not comment on the claims ex d at 5 the school superintendent tim mccarthy said the schools are dealing with students who commit offenses and using progressive discipline ex d at 5 the us department of education seattle office of civil rights has done nothing claiming that the principal of the school never received properly documented complaints of the racial discrimination and that the principals complaint log did not reflect that he had received such complaint ex d at 5 5 hoquiam school officials had tentatively agreed through local lawyer ben winkelman to meet with the subcommittee during its trip to aberdeen high school on august 5 2006 but they later backed out the subcommittee therefore has not had any substan tive conversations with hoquiam school officials 5a local police officer spoke to mrs walker of your people and said they always play the victim shunning responsibility he also threatened to withdraw police protection from mrs walkers family if she filed complaint against him ex d at 6 emphasis added mrs walkers neighbor called her family members nigger in one dispute involving mop handle and allegations of roughness between the neighbor and her sons ex d at 56 emphasis added the chief of police in hoquiam rick thomas says that mrs walker has received fair treatment and that if we can pursue prosecution we will do so ex d at 76 in addition to the walker familys troubles t he seattle weekly article mentions incidents affecting other people black aberdeen eighthgrader was attacked by schoolmates and samoan us

county ex d at 4 the editor of the local newspaper the daily world in aberdeen is quoted in the article there is racism here but its hard for to quantify ex d at 78 emphasis added feeling that these issues were something that the crc should at least deliberate upon crc member rob gaudet distributed t he seattle weekly article published on march 16 2005 to the crc membership through the crc yahoogroups email listserv the matter was 6 the subcommittee discovered that charges were filed over any of these incidents except for one reckless driving charges were filed against the driver of the vehicl that swerved off the road nd nearly hit jordan as he walked home from school warrant was later put out for the drivers arrest see infra at 12 none of these allegations or police reports were forwarded by hoquiam officials to the grays harbor prosecutors office for review at the time of the subcommittees investigation see infra at 12 see also ex k at 1 6discussed in crc meetings on may 3 2005 and again on november 11 2005 mr gaudet re distributed the article to the listserv see ex by may 3 2005 several voting members of the crc had volunteered to join the subcommittee ex listing jim kaufman joe marra rob gaudet others the crc decided to investigate these issues to find out if there was truth to the claims the power to investigate is described in the crc mission statement as posted on the wsba website the civil rights committee studies and investigates matters relating to civil liberties to keep the spirit of civil rights alive within the bar and the community civil rights committee available at wwwwsbaorg last viewed on may 5 2007 moreover the wsba bylaws state that each committee shall carry out various tasks and assignmentsas the committee may determine consistent with its function see wsba bylaws article viii g therefore the crc established subcommittee chaired by rob gaudet to investigate allegations of racial discrimination in the ol ympic peninsula including hoquiam and aberdeen and to report back to the crc with the results the crc chair richard reed asked the subcommittee to keep him informed of its results the subcommittee subsequently made monthly reports to the crc of its progress see eg ex f at 1 crc minutes dated may 16 2006 ex g at 4 5 crc minutes dated nov 8 2005ex h at 2 crc minutes dated jan 17 2006 ex j at 1 crc minutes dated march 21 2006 ex k at 1 crc minutes dated july 18 2006 b conducting the investigation 1 obtaining records from city of hoquiam on may 16 2005 mr gaudet telephoned hoquiam police chief rick thomas to request police records concerning the incidents reported by mrs walker ex v telephone conversation between rob gaudet and richard thomas dated may 16 2004 mr thomas said that requests for records should run through the city attorney steve johnson and he recommended that mr gaudet contact mr johnson ex v at 1 mr thomas affirmed that 7police records would be available to the public mr thomas said there was actual discrimination report that mrs walker had filed he said that she had filed couple of reports that her children were being harassed and that there were racial preferences she filed third report but he was not sure whether she declined to move forward with that one ex v at 2 mr thomas suggested that mr johnson might request from the police department any and all city records and law enforcement reports re angela walker over the previous three years and then mr johnson would be able to deliver those documents to the subcommittee upon receipt ex v at 2 mr gaudet phoned mr johnson on the same day and left voicemail ex v at 3 around december 16 2005 the hoquiam city attorney steve johnson affirmed that he would request that the hoquiam police department provide him with copies of all relevant reports involving angela walker mr johnson suggested that the subcommittee speak with mrs walker noting i think that she is happier with the city of hoquiam than she was when the article was written several months ago the subcommittee subsequently discussed the matter and determined that it was possible that even if mrs walker had reached truce that made her comfortable there were still issues to explore nobody denied that the incidents had occurred and those incidents in and of themselves justified further investigation into the state of civil rights the subcommittee concluded that fulfillment of its mission was not limited to mrs walkers particular circumstances at any given time but more broadly it included the investigation of racial discrimination in the olympic peninsula including the background behind the incidents affecting mrs walker as just one example in letter dated january 28 2006 from the hoquiam city attorney the subcommittee received police reports regarding mrs walker and her family the subcommittee reviewed the records see infra at 10 12 ex l second letter dated february 17 2006 was received from the city attorney and it included letters from witnesses and participants that had been attached to the original police reports but were not forwarded to the subcommittee with the january 28 2006 letter see ex m the second letter was sent in response to request from mr gaudet for 8those statements as he had noticed they were referenced in the police reports but not enclosed in the initial mailings see ex n at 1 subcommittee minutes dated march 6 2006 2 contacting angela walker directly in mid to latenovember 2005 the subcommittee contacted angela walker the victim of discrimination whose familys troubles were reported in t he seattle weekly article specifically mike brown contacted her on behalf of the subcommittee they spoke mr brown got the impression that mrs walker felt she had truce with the community and was reluctant to break the truce or create any further trouble see ex i at 2 she had been given gainful employment with the city of hoquiam after publication of t he seattle weekly article mr brown transcribed notes recording this telephone call see ex i mrs walker told mr brown that after moving to hoquiam her children started getting into trouble eg selective punishment even when they were the victims ex i at 1 she filed complaint with the aclu but the hoquiam school would not cooperate with the aclu investigator ex i at 1 emphasis added the attorney who recommended that mrs walker contact the aclu did nothing further and there has been other attorney who has helped them ex i at 1 moreover local attorneys have ties to the school board etc and all are in denial7 at the time mrs walker spoke with mr brown she reported that in general things are going better although football player has been bullying her boys and telling them about neonazi group ex i at 1 she reported that apparently at school one of her sons was jumped by two boys and one girl who pushed him ex i at 1 apparently the school does have policies but it doesnt enforce them ex i at 1 emphasis added in addition to racial problems gays and the disabled also have problems at the school in hoquiam ex i at 1 emphasis added 7 the legal profession appears to have failed mrs walker and her family in their time of need emphasizing the importance of intervention by statewide authorities such as the wsba 9these events caused angela walker to have depression for period of about three months staying within her home during the period ex i at 1 it is hard to overstate the traumatic effect that these incidents have had on mrs walker angela has received death threats shesat in front of her window with coffee pot because she was afraid to go to sleep ex i at 2 regarding the incident where driver ran off the road and attempted to hit her with car before he jumped over fence in fear infra at 10 12 one officer said dont expect anything from the authorities ex i at 2 emphasis added the writer from t he seattle times rick anderson subsequently got on it ex i at 2 two other officers opined that the incident may have been case of vehicular assault ex i at 2 but the case was eventually prosecuted under the lesser charge of reckless driving see infra at 12 mrs walker and her family never learned of what happened so they were apparently not wellinformed by the prosecutorial authorities ex i at 2 regarding the incident where young female student at school pulled down the pants of mrs walkers jordan the police blamed the victim and tried to intimidate mrs walker for reporting the incident an officer tried to pin the pants down incident on the walker family and scolded them for reporting the incident saying you people and as he said this he had his hand on his gun and tried to force himself into the home f bitchthe officer complained about the trouble caused bythe walkersreporting the incident ex i at 2 in addition mrs walkers husband is pulled over all the time by the police indicating inappropriate harassment and racial profiling by the police ex i at 2 emphasis added perhaps out of fear of re taliation mrs walker did not followup with mr brown to provide the names of particular offi cers ex i at 2 in the opinion of the subcommittee mr browns conversation with mrs walker added further credence to the allegations reported in t he seattle weekly were accurate 10iii criminal allegations racial slurs and harassment of black children in hoquiam further confirming allegations reported in t he seattle weekly the children of angela walker were subjected to racial and physical abuse by several children in the area see exhibit l at 2 letter from s johnson dated jan 28 2006 with attached law incident table from hoquiam police dept hpd ms walker called 911 to report the abuse and the hpd recorded that this abuse occurred on october 18 2002 the investigation narrative describes walker told that her children have been harassed and racial slurs are common especially from 11 yoa female by the name of erica weston and her younger brother devin the problem is so bad the school has been notified that they were asking for civil rights investigation and she went on to advise that her children have been having the problems going to and from school as well as at school yesterday she reports that her daughter and another friend who is also black were accosted by these and several children at eklund and fillmore on the way home from school aa sic fight erupted and several punches were thrown by all involved i spoke with the two girls who told they were accosted by weston her younger brother devin and several others who called them niggers and made other racial slurs punch was thrown and all started to fight exhibit l at 23 emphasis added mrs walker confirmed that this event occurred when approached by member of the subcommittee mike brown via telephone ex i b attempt to hit black child with automobile in hoquiam in hoquiam the children of angela walker were subjected to racial slurs and then one of them was targeted by an automobile as he walked home

at school taunted ms walkers children called them by racial slurs pulled down the pants of ms walkers and threatened ms walkers daughter outside the aunt of this belligerent child then picked her up in car and shortly thereafter veered off the road in the direction of ms walkers 11 the police report records the full arrest narrative on 011005 at approximately 1836 h ours i officer beebe responded

walker stated words were exchanged between the two girls including the n word being used against her daughter walker stated she did not want to pursue any charges against pettis for the assault she only wanted to make the incident known in case there were problems in the future walker went on to say that when her children were walking home on west eklund car driven by who they described as pettis sister swerved and attempted to hit tashiannas brother jordan kayla tashianna and jordans sister had dropped some school work in the middle of west eklund and jordan was picking it up when the

names including the n word and that she and several other kids were yelling and cussing at each other 12pettis went on to say that it was her aunt mary mary pettis that had picked her up from school she explained that she was still yelling at tashianna and the other kids and mary told her to get in the car and quit yelling her uncle john john pettis was also in the vehicle and was telling angel to be quiet they all stated that angel got in the car and they left ex l at 6 emphasis added the driver of the car mary pettis admits that she saw someone jump over fence but she denies that she swerved off the road to hit him ex l at 6 these accounts were corroborated by admission statements signed by the involved parties ex m at 7 8 jordan harringtons statement dated jan 11 2005 ex m at 9 tashianna walkers statement dated jan 11 2005 ex m at 10 kayla nelsons statement dated jan 11 2005 ex m at 10 aziza wirths statement dated jan 11 2005 c city of hoquiams attorney brought charges for reckless driving the city of hoquiam brought charges against mary pettis for reckless driving ex m at 1 as of march 2007 warrant was out for the arrest of mary pettis ex m at 1 charges were brought against angel pettis for pulling down jordans pants or for threatening him the hoquiam city police apparently did not timely refer this matter to the juvenile division of the grays harbor county prosecutors office see ex k at 1 d grays harbor prosecutors office has done nothing at the time of the subcommittees investigation and over 16 months after the incidents occurred the grays harbor prosecutors office had not yet opened file or maintained any records regarding mrs walker or her family see exhibit at 1 minutes of the subcommittee meeting dated july 11 2006 it does not appear that the city attorney of hoquiam referred the matters regarding ms walkers family to the grays harbor county prosecutor ex k at 1 minutes dated july 18 2006 ben winkelman attorney in grays harbor county talked to stu menefee harold s menefee with the grays harbor county prosecutors office file has been opened the subcommittee asked jim kaufman and ben winkelman to contact prosecutor stew menefee and the deputy prosecutor ie lawyer who handles juvenile matters for the grays 13harbor prosecutors office has known mr winkelman for years to learn more about the situation they learned that juvenile cases relating to this incident had been referred to the grays harbor prosecutors office as of ma rch 2007 the charge of reckless driving against mary pettis was outstanding with warrant for mary pettiss arrest this being less than felony which occurred within the city limits of hoquiam would be subject to municipaldistrict court jurisdiction and would be the responsibility of municipal as opposed to county authorities to handle criminal charges that might have been brought under various sections of the revised code of washington there were several possible criminal charges arising out of these incidents that could have been prosecuted but which were not prosecuted ex charge might have been brought for malicious harassment consisting of the commission of crime with race or other bias as an aggravating factor8 another might have been brought for vehicular assault regarding the incident in which mary pettis swerved off the road and nearly hit mrs walkers jordan the city of hoquiam attorney did in fact issue an arrest warrant against ms pettis for reckless driving rcw 4661500 et seq but charges were brought for vehicular assault9 the subcommittee considered the practicality of bringing these criminal charges even if they were otherwise theoretically viable one concern expressed by former prosecutor jim kaufman was that the charges may have become stale ie it was unlikely for the city attorney or the country prosecutor to pursue the ch arges simply because of the passage of time see ex p at 1 2 see also brown april notes as practical matter execution of warrant for 8 rcw 9a36078 080 see also notes taken by michael brown on olympic peninsula subcommittee meeting march 6 2006 on file with m brown brown march notes 9 the rcw defines reckless driving as inter alia driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug rcw 4661502 actual physical control while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug rcw 4661504 reckless driving rcw 4661500 or hitandrun an attended vehicle rcw 46520205 it is not clear which of the specific sections the charge against ms pettis was based on see ex p minutes of olympic peninsula subcommittee dated april 14 2006 see also notes taken by michael brown on olympic peninsula subcommittee meeting april 14 2006 on file with m brown brown april notes 14criminal acts after approximately three years b ecomes difficult because of the fading memory of witnesses and the possibility that witnesses andor parties may have moved10 the incident in which angel pettis pulled jordans pants down did not result in the filing of criminal charge11 the age of at least one of the perpetrators angel pettis who had pulled down jordans pants could make prosecution difficu lt she was only fourteen years of age at the time of the incident12 the subcommittee speculated that the age of fourteen may have been sufficient in the prosecution of some types of cr imes but nevertheless it could give rise to speculation as to whether prosecutor would be willing to bring charges against her13 another factor that could make prosecution difficult was the element of intent according to jim kaufman charges involving racebased crimes can be difficult to prove because of the intent element14 on the other hand the local judge in whose court any criminal proceedings against juvenile would take place had reputation for taking juvenile criminal violations strictly15 perhaps further charges should have been brought against the responsible minors16 members of the subcommittee felt that the hoquiam school could have done more to discipline the responsible minors17 f angela walkers perspective on november 20 2005 mike brown telephoned angela walker at her home on behalf of the subcommittee mr walker had been at his job for four years and things had begun to settle down since the publication of t he seattle weekly article since they moved to the area mrs walker and her family experienced unusual little incidents but they were not certain that 10 brown march notes 11 brown april notes 12 brown march notes 13 brown march notes brown april notes 14 brown march notes 15 brown april notes 16 brown march notes subsequent information gathered by the subcommittee indicated that juvenile justice proceedings would likely go through th city prosecutors office which ultimately did not pursue formal proceedings against angel pettis 17 brown march notes 15the incidents were racebased then the walker children started getting into trouble at school receiving what the walker family believed was selective punishment at school even when they were the victims in the incidents at one point mrs walker received death threats and she used to sit in front of her window with coffee pot because she was afraid to go to sleep in the spring of 2004 acting upon the advice of lawyer thad martin the walker family filed complaint with the aclu which assigned mr steven reilley to investigate the walkers hoped to change the system not necessarily seek monetary damages mrs walker felt that gays and disabled people also had problems in the area and that local attorneys and the school board were in denial she thought that although the school does have policies it does not enforce them18 according to ms walker after the aclu investigation started the school did not cooperate with mr reilley ms walker speculated that the actions of another african american family in aberdeen who had exaggera ted and lied about racial incidents may have contributed to the apathy of all involved in fit of frustration about the inefficacy of the investigation mrs threw away all of the written documentation subsequently mr martin did nothing further and there were other attorneys who were willing to help the walker family the events caused ms walker to have depression for period of about three months causing her to stay within her home during the entire period19 following the incident in which mary pettis swerved her car off the road in the direction of mrs walkers jordan three police officers responded two of the officers said it was attempted vehicular assault but third officer told her to not expect anything it was at that point that mr rick anderson of t he seattle weekly began journalistic investigation that led to the publication of an article that sparked the formation of this subcommittee the hoquiam city attorney contacted the walker family and took photographs but to mrs walkers 18 telephone conversation between angela walker and ke brown nov 20 2005 notes on file with m brown 19 id 16knowledge the city attorney never filed charges against mary pettis as of the time of mrs walkers conversation with mike brown on behalf of the subcommittee the walker family had not received any news of what if anything the city attorney had done about the reckless driving and vehicular assault by mary pettis20 the subcommittee learned from the city attorney directly that reckless driving charges had been brought ex m at 1 after the incident in which angel pettis pulled down the pants of one of mrs walkers sons jordan police officer scolded the family for reporting the incident saying you people see also supra at 9 as he railed against the family the hoquiam police officer kept his hand on his gun tried to force himself into their home and called mrs walker f bitch21 mrs walkers family has immediate plans to move as the situation seems to have settled down however football player has been bullying her sons and telling them about neonazi group see supra at 8 further police officers have continued to pull over her husband while he is driving id mrs walker told mr brown of the subcommittee that she does not wish to reopen these issues because she appears to have truce between her family and the city of hoquiam mrs walker noted that others may have information about the incidents and racial relations in the area including doug waddington who is affiliated with the prison and margaret huff liaison for the mayors office the subcommittee did not followup with mr waddington or ms huff because mr brown refused to turn over his notes on the conversation to the subcommittee for over one year mr brown was not entirely sure if he was authorized by mrs walker to share the results of their conversation with the subcommittee even though he introduced himself to her at the start of the conversation as an agent for the subcommittee who was calling in pursuit of the subcommittees 20 id 21 id 17investigation mrs walker did not respond to subsequent emails sent to her by mr brown and there was further contact between the subcommittee and any member of the walker family22 iv hostility and nonresponsiveness from state and county bar leadership for reasons of practicality and courtesy the subcommittee attempted to work through the wsba including the bog governor responsible for the olympic peninsula and the grays harbor county bar association to pursue its investigation the subcommittees attempt to collaborate with the grays harbor county bar association was supported by wsba bylaws article viii h which states each committee shall cooperate withlike committees and sections of local bar associations the subcommittee had great difficulty findi ng lawyers in grays harbor county with whom to collaborate the subcommittee reached out by email and telephone to the bog governor for the grays harbor area see ex r at 1 2 through the bog governor for that area the subcommittee had hoped to keep the bog apprised of its work and to pursue its investigation through official channels in cooperation with state county and local bar associations therefore subcommittee members attempted to contact the wsba governor for hoquiam mr howard graham at that time mr graham the wsba governor did not respond to two email messages from mr gaudet or to one or two phone calls from another crc member jerrilyn hadley exs r s t the subcommittee agreed that jim kaufman would send third email to mr graham with copy to the wsba executive director jan michaels23 the subcommittee speculated on its own that mr graham might be the outgoing governor and that perhaps new incoming governor would be responsible for the district of hoquiam on behalf of the wsba confirming th is belief subcommittee member jim kaufman determined that mr sal mungia of tacoma would be the new incoming governor for the hoquiam district on behalf of the wsba mr mungia said he had not received earlier email 22 id 23 notes on subcommittee meeting dated august 25 2005 on file with michael brown 18correspondence from the subcommittee but he offered to be of assistance where he could be of assistance and that was relayed to the subcommittee by mr kaufman mr kaufman forwarded to mr mungia copy of t he seattle weekly article that initiated the subcommittees investigation ex r at 2 it had taken ma ny months to finally reach the wsba governor responsible for the hoquiam district after many unreturned email messages and phone calls to the outgoing and incoming governor by several different people acting on behalf of the subcommittee mr kaufman determined from mr mungia that paul strittmatter who comes from hoquiam and maintains an office there might have some interest in assisting the investigation on december 19 2005 the subcommittee noted in its meeting that paul strittmeyer may be interested in assisting24 jim kaufman who had attempted to reach both mr mungia and mr strittmatter confirmed that strittmatter had indicated some interest in the matter via email25 however the subcommittee and mr kaufman never heard back from mr strittmatter the subcommittee tried to reach young lawyers in grays harbor by working through the trustee for that region in the washington young lawyers division the first attempts were unsuccessful and one subcommittee member reached out to the young lawyers division trustee four times by email and telephone without receiving response ex u the subcommittee eventually reached jennifer brugger the young lawyers division trustee for grays harbor county to assist the subcommittee ms brugger subsequently contacted about one dozen young lawyers in the hoquiam region and asked if they would be interested in attending social function andor helping the subcommittees investigation none was interested as an example of the subcommittees strenuous attempts to reach lawyers in grays harbor the subcommittee planned meeting for september 19 2005 subsequently postponed with the following agenda i jim kaufmans efforts to reach bog member responsible for that area ii mike browns efforts to reach gray s harbor county bar association president iii 24 notes on subcommittee meeting dated decembe r 19 2005 on file with michael brown 25 notes on subcommittee meeting dated decembe r 19 2005 on file with michael brown 19rob gaudets efforts to work with the wyld trustee responsible for that area ex s ex t mr brown never did receive return call or message from the grays harbor county bar association president therese wheaton throughout the investigation the subcommittee attempted to engage the wsba county and local officials and lawyers on august 25 2005 the subcommittee specifically considered how to work through the local channels the subcommittee made plans to contact jennifer brugger of the young lawyers division whose jurisdiction included the hoquiam area the subcommittee also informed wsba president brooke taylor of its investigation26 rather than let the investigation die due to nonresponsiveness from the grays harbor county bar association and the wsba governors mr gaudet directly contacted the hoquiam police department to request reports of incident s involving the walker family he was referred to the hoquiam city attorney in january and february 2006 mr gaudet received police records from steve johnson the hoquiam city attorney exs l m as of march 2006 however the lack of any further response from mr mungia made it impossible to determine whether he had in fact discussed the matter with paul strittmatter as he had promised to do27 at the april 14 2006 meeting jim kaufman reported that further efforts to contact mssrs mungia or strittmatter might be moot because of their apparent lack of interest in the matter as evidenced by their repeated failures to communicate with mr kaufman28 on march 30 2006 sharon payant of the subcommittee made renewed effort to locate local lawyer in grays harbor county she made this effort after the subcommittee reported to the crc that it had experienced great difficulty in finding local lawyer see ex j at 1 the subcommittee is still trying to locate lawyer in hoquiam that will assist with the investigation 26 notes on subcommittee meeting dated august 25 2005 on file with michael brown 27 notes on subcommittee meeting dated march 6 2006 on file with michael brown see also ex n at 3 gov mungia the wsba governor for the hoquiam area was supposed to contact st rittmatter but we have received word about whethe r he had ever done so 28 ex p minutes of subcommittee meeting dated april 14 2006 see also notes on subcommittee meeting dated april 14 2006 on file with michael brown 20sharon will start by contacting 3 of the 10 lawyers practicing in hoquiam ms payant contacted attorneys in hoquiam and aberdeen via email asking if any of them would be willing to serve as contact person for the subcommittee in relation to the investigation she received an almost immediate response from ben winkelman who is in private practice in hoquiam mr winkelman agreed to be an area contact and liaison for the subcommittee the subcommittee agreed that in spite of failed attempts to communicate with non responsive wsba governors the attempts at communication had been worthwhile the subcommittee members were outside the peninsula and they had tried to respect the local community as well as the governance structure of the wsba29 however the subcommittee also reached consensus that it should continue its investigation despite of lack of communication or support from wsba governors responsible for that region the subcommittee also resolved to seek local initiatives and to work with local lawyer in the community ie ben winkelman in reaching out to hoquiam school administrators the subcommittee also resolved to contact katie svova the new lawyer in the grays harbor county prosecutors office who handled juvenile matters for additional information30 on april 14 2006 the subcommittee met again mr winkelman attended the meeting and decided to go beyond his role as liason and become member of the subcommittee to assist in the investigation mr winkelmans wife jennifer winkelman is counselor at aberdeen high school mr winkelman also said th at he had contact at the juvenile division of the grays county prosecuting attorneys office and he agreed to be in touch with her regarding the incidents discussed in the criminal allegations section supra during the april 14 meeting mr winkelman confirmed that the area around hoquiam had had history of racebased incidents including fights31 mr winkelman related to the 29 ex p see also notes on subcommittee meeting dated april 14 2006 on file with michael brown 30 ex p minutes of subcommittee m eeting dated april 14 2006 subseque nt events led the subcommittee to the conclusion that grays harbor county prosecutor brett colocurcio never brought charges regarding the incidents against the walker family and that ms svova who replaced him after his departure in january 2005 never brought charges either the subcommittee learned th at the grays harbor county prosecutors office did not even have police records on these incidents as they had apparently not been forwarded by the city of hoquiam 31 notes on subcommittee meeting dated april 14 2006 on file with michael brown 21subcommittee that he was aware of some of the incidents after having read about them in the local papers he stated that he had become aware of growing problem of racism in hoquiam during his campaign for city council and had even witnessed fights in the same location where the school fight involving angel pettis and tashianna walker had occurred the fights appeared to have been racially motivated and racial epithets were used at its june 20 2006 meeting the subcommittee continued to emphasize the importance of local partnership and resolved to contact th grays harbor county prosecutors office ms payant agreed to gather teaching tolerance materials32 karrin klock who had just joined the subcommittee agreed to forward information to crc liaison kate mullen to keep her apprised of the work of the subcommittee33 on july 21 2006 message was posted to the listserv of the wyld membership committee ex w inviting young lawyers to go to aberdeen high school for meeting of school officials to listen and discuss possible implementation of the we the jury program which had been previously taught by wyld ex x in several high schools there was response to the invitation again the subcommittee attempted but failed to generate interest and support within the wsba for its investigation subcommittee members traveled to aberdeen to listen to the concerns of local officials on august 5 2007 ex k this was perhaps the most critical stage of the investigation and the subcommittee members demonstrated great interest and sensitivity the meeting was productive and local officials requested followup assistance and education from the crc the subcommittee members promised to pass on their requests to the general crc for deliberation and possible action on or around august 15 2006 most of the work of the subcommittee came to standstill when the wsba leadership accused the subcommittee of having exceeded its role under the applicable wsba bylaws by interfering in what it referred to as local matter and for the alleged failure of the subcommittee to inform andor otherwise respect protocol concerning 32 notes on subcommittee meeting dated june 20 2006 on file with michael brown 33 notes on subcommittee meeting dated june 20 2006 on file with michael brown 22intervention in such matters34 in subsequent events including the wsba presidents extraordinary threat to dissolve the decadesold crc for considering resolution to the washington attorney general on the separate topic of wiretapping the work of the crc as whole including the subcommittee came to standstill from the fall of 2005 for period of several months as of the writing of this final report the work has never fully resumed v aberdeen meeting introductions members of the subcommittee traveled to aberdeen for meeting with local lawyer ben winkelman and teachers counselors and the principal of aberdeen high school to hear their concerns about civil rights matters mr gaudet informed participants that the meeting was largely continuation of that investigation sparked by t he seattle weekly article ex k at 2 the meeting took place on saturday august 5 2006 from noon to 400 pm the meeting was held in classroom at the high school the hosts provided coffee and snacks mr gaudet clarified that the subcommittee was not there to give legal advice but only to pursue an investigation and listen to their concerns and create dialogue ex k at 2 see also ex k at 5 rob and ben clarified that the wsba crc cannot provide legal advice to the school but the crc members are capable of studying particular issues to educate themselves and the community and that the results of any such study could be shared with others detailed minutes were taken by anita redline and rob gaudet and later distributed among all participants see ex k as an opening exercise at the meeting everyone introduced themselves and described their ethnic backgrounds there was surprising amount of diversity within each individual at the meeting ex k at 1 2 mr gaudet introduced the subcommittee and its work noting that it was appropriate to have the meeting at school because half of all hate crimes are committed by people under the age of 20 which is roughly the same as school age ex k at 1 moreover 34 notes on subcommittee meeting dated august 15 2006 on file with michael brown 23schools are in the best position to influence these students id mr gaudet clarified that the meeting was being held to see if there were any concerns and then to see if there were ways that the crc could help address them ex k at 1 2 the subcommittee posed simple question is there problem ex k at 3 the answer was yes b demographics of the school the school has about 1000 students in grades 9 through 12 including 45 students taking english language learning there are some native americans some laotians some vietnamese and few africanamericans ex k at 3 most students are caucasian ex k at 3 there is diversity club that encompasses all the groups and does not focus on any one group ex k at 3 although most of the students are accepting small number has challenges ex k at 3 1 africanamericans the africanamerican students have been called brillo pad or nigger at school ex k at 6 emphasis added there is small number of africanamericans at aberdeen high school ex k at 2 the number may be as little as one or two ex k at 6 2 native americans native american students at school are sometimes called apple which means red on the outside and white on the inside ex k at 6 emphasis added they are also called tomato on occasion ex k at 6 emphasis added 3 asians there are some students of asian origin at aberdeen high school they include some laotians and vietnamese ex k at 3 sometimes an asian student will call another asian student nigger ex k at 6 emphasis added 4 latinos the latino students are sometimes called beaners ex k at 6 emphasis added they are also called wetback ex k at 6 emphasis added about 12 percent of the 24students are latino said the principal dave tobin ex k at 3 mr tobin noted that the school has two different hispanic gangs and caucasian gang with confederate flags id emphasis added the latino gangs membership carries over from the regional homes of the immigrants the hispanic gangs are based on two different parts of mexico that the students come from as soon as new hispanic student arrives into the ell ie english language learning program he or she is immediately placed by peers into one or the other gang one gang looks down at the other gang because of the part of mexico from which they came there are about 45 students in the ell program and this is roughly the size of the membership in the gangs the hispanic gangs act out with violence there used to be person who put up graffiti but he is gone maybe in jail he used to write the word bicth as graffiti on different walls and he seems to have had some trouble spelling the word properly ex k at 2 emphasis added these tensions lead to physical violence sometimes serious regarding fights they happen during school after school during class they are usually lowlevel without injury sometimes the ambulance comes because the injuries are more serious there will be cameras in the new school building that is under construction the hispanic girls may fight too it is less racial ie hispanic on white fighting and more personal ex k at 4 emphasis added there is code of silence in which students are reluctant to tell on their friends ex k at 2 the school officials were asked if they th ink quiet reporting system as noted in the teaching tolerance materials of southern poverty law center splc would be useful at the school ex k at 2 this would involve box planted in subtle area that might serve purpose and keep pulse on student body and nip potential problems with confidential box students could leave notes about problems ex k at 2 students are supposed to report to counselor such as ms winkelman and the counsel can keep the students name confidential if so desired by the student ex k at 4 in 2005 the 25school created an anonymous tip linefor people to leave messages about threatening things they heard aboutthis was an effort to deal with the violence ex k at 4 the principal asks the staff to be visible at the start of the year and to be aware ex k at 4 5 gays and lesbians ms king teacher at the school ex k at 2 noted that there is gay population and that there is some prejudice against gays especially among the boys ex k at 3 emphasis added ms king works with special education students with low iqs and they often get talked into doing socially inappropriate things and they call each other retarded ex k at 3 there is lesbian or gay organization at the sc hool ex k at 6 emphasis added students who want to form such club are not allowed to do so but may nonetheless belong to the diversity club it is catchall and includes gays and lesbians as well ex k at 6 emphasis added 6 caucasians the majority of the students are caucasian there is small group of students on the cam pus who wear the confederate flag on their clothes and put the symbol on their vehicles ex k at 4 emphasis added mr tobin aborated as here reflected in the minutes some students fly the flag from their vehicles or put it on their car windows as sticker they also put it on their tailgates if it becomes harassment then it will be an easier issue to deal with because it will be more clearcut there are about 5 to 10 kids who participate in this it is possible that they dont know what it is they are not from the south it could be some interest in the dukes of hazzard the school staff however is offended by it some students are offended by it it was noted that the confederate flag upsets staff more than students ex k at 4 the school is not entirely sure how to address this ex k at 4 in terms of balancing their rights but also protecting the rest of the student body and the sensibilities of the teachers at this point the teachers try to minimize their own reactions to the flag so as not to embolden further such behavior or make the students think it is more important than it is ex 26k at 4 5 the school is thinking of treating it as dress code issue that possibly disrupts the learning environment ex k at 5 but they have not yet taken any action as an example maltese cross representing the nazi regime would be disruptive as violation of the dress code ex k at 5 mr tobin feels that drug sy mbols and lowcut dresses are clearer violations of the dress code than the confederate flag 7 teachers the school officials were asked if there was problem with bigoted teachers at ahs the answer yes it was noted that there are some bigoted teachers ex k at 4 emphasis added mr tobin said that some teachers may ignore inappropriate things that are said in class or they just let the comments pass ex k at 4 there is policy on what to do about harassment that all teachers read and sign ex k at 4 c schools request for assistance 1 teaching materials for students the principal of the school mr tobin said that what he would like to see as result of the meeting is things that can be applied to the classrooms and that teachers can use any materials or ideas to help students understand tolerance and the importance of diverse groups ex k at 2 moreover mr tobin would like to hear ideas on how to create better situation id emphasis added he thinks that part of the population can use some help with education and information and understanding that we are all part of the community id mr pier teacher at the school said that he would like to have materials that he could distribute to students he asked the wsba crc to put together list of resources that would be available to them and they could then calendar various ideas on their school calendar for the upcoming year ex k at 4 they would like to receive about 65 copies of the responding to hate materials distributed by the splc ex k at 4 ms king said that the teachers could also use some conflict resolution training and student mediators so that students who get caught in fights can appear in front of their peers ex k at 4 272 constitutional law questions the school was greatly interested in receiving general information on the parameters of students constitutional rights while at school especially regarding searches of their lockers breath eg alcohol and backpacks the school is open to being educated receiving thoughts and obtaining new ideas on how to conduct searches without violating constitutional rights of students they understand that they may search lockers if students have drugs or weapons they are concerned about the process of conducting searches davie takes another person with him whenever he does locker search for in case the student later claims that something was stolen dave said the school would be interested in knowing whats the best procedure or practice ex k at 5 emphasis added in addition they sometimes conduct backpack searches ex k at 5 the school would like to know about the standards protocols and best practices out there ex k at 5 it was thought that the wsba crc might be able to provide general educational materials on the constitutional rights of students and limits on the authority of schools in general when conducting such searches ex k at 5 regarding searches with dogs the school is again open to education on the best practices and constitutional law issues and whatever is correct in procedure ex k at 6 it was thought by participants that this would be another useful topic for the crc to study and share with the community ex k at 6 the school confirmed that they would be interested in the latest case law on this issue they try to keep abreast of what is current it would be purely informational ex k at 6 there is contract lawyer outside the county in seattle to whom the school may direct legal questions ex k at 6 however this is rarely done ex k at 6 regarding the breathalyzer that was used eg at school dances in hoquiam to check for alcohol the school would like to know whether such devices are generally permissible and what the parameters for its use might be they did have breathalyzer at hoquiam high school that they used randomly at dances are there any civil rights problems with these procedures would breathalyzer at school dance be viol ation of constitutional rights ex k at 6 28vi followup to aberdeen meeting the school asked the subcommittee to research issues relating to locker searches and the use of dogs and breathalyzer tests the school also asked the subcommittee if it was aware of any civil rights concerns relating to students havi ng or wearing confederate flag emblems other topics discussed were implementing confidential reporting system asking lawyers to attend law day and putting together street law class and we the jury program using civil rights scenario research when the school asked about civil rights issues relating to locker searches the use of dogs and breathalyzer tests and the confederate flag the subcommittee became concerned about providing guidance on these issu without crossing the line into providing legal advice ex k at 6 this was concern was discussed extensively at the subcommittee meeting and at the civil rights committee general meeting ex k at 6 school officials were told at the meeting that the subcommittee cannot provide legal advice and that the school should address specific concerns regarding partic ular issues to its attorney ex k at 5 nevertheless the subcommittee decided that it would look into at least some of these issues while it was decided how or even whether this information would be disseminated to aberdeen or any other school as these are issues of concern to many schools and the wsba may be called upon to address these issues in the future ex k at 6 michael brown and karrin klotz prepared draft memos addressing constitutional issues of concern to schools the memos were not di stributed to the aberdeen high school they were held by the subcommittee because wsba leadership had expressed concerns about the crc giving legal advice to the school therefore the crc decided to wait until such concerns were fully addressed the subcommittee later noted that brochures offering general information on legal issues such as tenantlandlord rights were freely available and distributed in the wsba lobby similar brochures could be distributed to schools containing general advice without reference to any specific application at any particular school 29b confidential reporting of hate crimes the school raised concern that if there were incidences of racism at the school students might be reluctant to tell teacher or staff member out of fear of retaliation by other students the school was also concerned that if they put up an anonymous box similar to suggestion box they would receive information on which they would need to follow up but they would have way to know the identity of the student who submitted the comment or concern specifically mentioned was the fear that someone would write about wanting to harm herselfhimself or someone else if the school were to create confidential reporting system it would have to 1 enable students to report incidents to teacher or staff member that heshe trusted while 2 allowing the school to know the id entity of the student yet 3 keeping the fact of the report from other students when this concern was mentioned at the next subcommittee meeting sharon payant said she remembered seeing confidential reporting system on the teaching tolerance website service of the southern poverty law center and would forward that information to jennifer winkelman the confidential reporting system on the teaching tolerance website the safe contacts policy35 designates certain teachers or staff members as safe contacts people to whom the students can turn when they wish to discuss issues relating to harassment or bias ms payant forwarded the link via email to jennifer winkelman with the message that the material might be of interest to her given their concerns about implementing confidential reporting system c law day the school mentioned that it would be helpful if members of the crc attended law day at their high school and spoke to students about opportunities for minorities in the legal profession this was raised at the general meeting of the crc and two members corbett gordon and tracy flood volunteered to contact th school about attending this event during the 35 safe contacts policy teaching tolerance available at httpwwwtolerance orgrthassection4_3_1jsp last visited 51207 30next school year the event was postponed and then eventually cancelled so ms flood and ms gordon were never actually able to attend career day as planned d street law class one or more teachers at the school were interested in receiving materials about street law program that might be used in their classrooms to teach their students about basic legal rights the subcommittee resolved to followup through friend of sharon payant who was familiar with street law there was subsequent followup on this issue due in part to the controversy that wsba leadership rose in relation to the subcommittees activities we the jury program another resource that was considered was we the jury program that could be introduced in schools such as aberdeen high school and would serve the dual purpose of introducing kids to the legal system and educating them about civil rights issues two or more teachers at the school said that they would like to receive these materials the we the jury program already exists developed by the american bar association and it offers curriculum and mock trials on different civil and criminal law issues the washington young lawyers division has already used such program in schools around the state ex x the materials that are available however do not pertain to civil rights issues sharon payant contacted the young lawyers di vision and asked if they had any materials relating to civil rights or hate crimes but she was told that they had such scenarios similar inquiry of the association of trial lawyers of america netted the same results ms payant reported these results to the subcommittee but she said that she would keep searching for materials that would fit the subcommittees needs rob gaudet also suggested searching recent case law for civil rights or hate crime scenarios that might be suitable for we the jury type program that could be crafted by the crc there was some interest in the subcommittee in creating we the jury type video and transcript of trial regarding hate crime that had been prosecuted in the state of washington 31such materials could be developed by the crc as training and educational program for students corbett gordon and rob gaudet resolved to work on this issue but they made progress due to the obstacles raised by wsba leadership to the activities of the subcommittee36 vii remedies the potential remedies offered here by the subcommittee align with goals stated in the wsba bylaws including article i a9 to promote understanding of and respect for our legal system and the law under article i b19 the wsba may maintain and foster programs of public information and education about the law and the legal system in the subcommittees continuing efforts to investigate and further the purposes of the crc under the authority vested in it by the wsba bylaws the subcommittee proposes implementation of the following solutions we the jury the civil rights committee or the wsba as whole should work with attorneys andor civil rights professors to develop we the jurytype program that utilizes civil rights scenarios just as the washington young lawyer s division has already done ex x the texas bar association has developed its own we the jury program through its young lawyers association according to the texas materials portion of the contents were reproduced from the association of trial lawyers of america and the national institute for citizen education in the law materials37 the mock trial in texass materials involves criminal possession of marijuana case so although their focus is somewhat different than ours it is notable that at least one other state bar has funded such project th crc could take the lead in developing such program budgetary funding from the bog on par with funding allocated toward the creation of diversity training dvd would be of great assistance to this project 36 wsba general counsel bob welden eg said at the october 2006 public wsba bog meeting that the bar has business going to school in aberdeen neither the wsba president nor any member of the bog clearly countered this statement by mr welden 37 we the jury jury service project of the texas young lawyers association available at httpwwwtylaorgpdfsjurypdf last viewed 51207 32b empower crc to create and distribute brochures the crc should be explicitly authorized by the bog to draft and develop suitable brochures describing the constitutional rights at the schoolhouse for general distribution to the public including schools students parents and anyone who asks such brochures should be posted on the crc website and otherwise made available wherever the wsba displays similar brochures on other legal topics c empower crc to investigate future incidents the bog should encourage the crc to form subcommittees to investigate current and future civil rights abuses to counter the negative reaction from wsba leadership over the past two years to the subcommittees investigation the bog should expressly reaffirm that the crc has the authority to carefully investigate matters pertaining to civil rights d encourage partnerships with wsba diversity committee the diversity committee has produced wonderful dvd that can be used and distributed among school and perhaps shown by vol unteer lawyers at schools or career fairs the diversity committee should be encouraged to distribute the dvd and make presentations at schools and venues targeted for special importance by the crc the diversity committee might brainstorm and promote other ideas to spread the message of tolerance including education on the laws against discrimination in the state of washington in aberdeen and hoquiam it appears from the subcommittees investigation that instruction on sensitivity and legal rights regarding native americans africanamericans latinos gays and lesbians and disabled people may be needed the diversity committee has special capabilities to assist and encourage lawyers to volunteer on these projects educate county prosecutors the wsba should encourage programs to educate county prosecutors on the tools that are available to them to prosecute hate crimes and racial incidents they should also be encouraged to open and keep files on all hate incidents they must also be encouraged to work with their local police departments to request such information particularly today when the us 33department of justice has placed classic crimes of racial and national origin discrimination on the backburner see ex in addition federal criminal civil rights law does not prohibit sexual orientation discrimination so the state of washingtons county prosecutors should be encouraged to make special effort at collecting information on sexual orientation discrimination from their local police departments in the course of this investigation the subcommittee discovered that the incidents regarding the walker family were not reported to the grays harbor county bar association by the local police department f strengthen relationships between wsba and county bar associations the wsba should strongly encourage its governors to establish and maintain relationships with the county bar associations w ithin their respective jurisdictions this will enable governors to better respond to inquiries updates requests for assistance from wsba committees regarding activities in their territories g increase budget of crc the wsba should increase the budget of the crc to pay for some of the basic expenses in its investigations the trip to aberdeen high school eg was paid for by each participant but wsba funding for transportation or one night of hotel would have been helpful for many lawyers traveling from seattle in addition the wsba should encourage staff liaisons to the crc and other committees to use wwwfreeconferencecallcom for free conference calls because great deal of funding is currently wasted on c onference calls that cost hundreds of dollars per meeting sapping the small budget of the crc and other committees in fact the crc budget was not able to pay for the last two conference calls of the subcommittee that were scheduled for the end of 2006 therefore the subcommittee either had to cancel those calls or find free way using wwwfreeconferencecallcom to host its final two calls to conduct business h encourage distribution of aching tolerance materials the crc should have resources such as teaching tolerance materials from the southern poverty law center available for schools that are concerned about intolerance teaching 34tolerance is an online resource for people interested in dismantling bigotry and creating in hates stead communities that value diversity38 in addition to resources available to educators the website also has materials available for fighting intolerance and bias in the workplace and the community the crc should have link on its we bsite to wwwteachingtoleranceorg and adopt policy of referring educators to the teaching tolerance website many educators may be unaware of the materials available free of charge through the teaching tolerance website i require wsba governors to respond in timely and helpful fashion to wsba committees and their requests wsba governors failed to respond to numerous attempts to reach them by telephone and email made on various occasions by different members of the subcommittee the subcommittee was diligent in recording these attempts and pursuing followup calls because the subcommittee wished to operate professionally play by the book be courteous and maximize its effectiveness by absorbing all useful knowledge from the people who were most knowledge about the area surrounding hoquiam and aberdeen these attempts failed largely because of the failure of wsba governors to return messages or otherwise followup on requests made by the subcommittee this is unacceptable practice the wsba governors must lead by example activism and communication not by mere title of their office viii conclusion the subcommittee confirmed allegations made in t he seattle weekly article that the family of angela walker had been subjected to racial discrimination however this is the tip of the iceberg there are systemic problems in the way the school in hoquiam failed to deal with the issue b the way some police officers blamed the victims and further harassed them c the utter failure of the hoquiam school officials to cooperate in any way with this investigation d the racial namecalling in the region including schoolhouses the lack of substantial interest or activism by lawyers in grays harbor county with one exception to 38 southern poverty law center bout us available at httpwwwtoleranceorgaboutindexhtml last viewed on may 12 2007 35address these issues and f the hostility and nonresponsiveness of wsba leadership to deal with such pressing issue change must occur starting within the wsba leadership in order to successfully address racism and intolerance in the state of washington
