governmentsponsored enterprises gses an institutional overview kevin r kosar analyst in american national government government and finance division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21663 congress chartered governmentsponsored enterprises gses to improve the workings of credit markets this report briefly describes the nature of gses their mixed governmentalprivate nature the differences between gses and government agencies and the arguments for and against gses this report will be updated as events warrant what is governmentsponsored enterprise number of organizations fall between the categories of private sector and governmental entities1 one type of quasigovernmental organization is the government sponsored enterprise gse for the purpose of budgetary treatment congress has defined the term governmentsponsored enterprise in the omnibus reconciliation act of 1990 to refer to corporate entity created by law of the united states that i has federal charter authorized by law ii is privately owned as evidenced by capital stock owned by private entities or individuals iii is under the direction of board of directors majority of which is elected by private owners iv is financial institution with power to i make loans or loan guarantees for limited purposes such as to provide credit for specific borrowers or one sector and ii raise funds by borrowing which does not carry the full faith and credit of the federal government or to guarantee the debt of others in unlimited amounts and 1 crs report rl30533 the quasi government hybrid organizations with both government and private sector legal characteristics by kevin r kosar crs2 b i does not exercise powers that are reserved to the government as sovereign such as the power to tax or to regulate interstate commerce ii does not have the power to commit the government financially but it may be recipient of loan guarantee commitment made by the government and iii has employees whose salaries and expenses are paid by the enterprise and are not federal employees subject to title 52 few scholars of public administration and finance are likely to argue that this definition is incorrect however some have argued that the above definition omits an essential characteristic gse benefits from an implicit federal guarantee to enhance its ability to borrow money3 each gse is created by congress with its particular attributes defined in its enabling legislation and charter despite this diversity there are at least four readily observable characteristics of gses 1 private sector ownership 2 limited competition 3 activities limited by congressional charter and 4 chartered privileges that create an inferred federal guarantee of obligations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21663 why did congress create gses gses were not created for the purpose of expanding home ownership by lower and middleincome members of the public rather congress established gses to improve the efficiency of capital markets and to overcome statutory and other market imperfections which otherwise prevent funds from moving easily from suppliers of funds to areas of high loan demand4 the economic rationale for gses is the belief that without such governmentsponsored institutions critical area of necessary debt financing would be underserved or served inefficiently government according to this rationale should use some of its sovereign powers eg full faith and credit of the us treasury to encourage the development of private financial intermediaries to serve selected markets gses are part of tradition of mercantilist financial institutions government assigns them benefits and privileges in their charters that are not available to fully private corporations5 in return the government limits activities and lines of business of gses and requires them to promote selected public policy objectives as private entity gse is exempt from federal management and staffing laws which provides additional operational flexibility6 2 104 stat 1388607 sec 13112 and 2 usc 6228 3 ronald c moe and thomas h stanton governmentsponsored enterprises as federal instrumentalities reconciling private management

flexibility has led to controversies for example some have argued that gses compensate their executives too generously terence ohara exit packages in dispute at fannie mae washington post dec 28 2004 p e1 crs3 gses are not banks credit unions or savings and loans associations excepting the farm credit banks none of the gses lends money directly to members of the public gses are forprofit financial entities that provide capital market liquidity to these ends gses to varying degrees issue capital stock and short and longterm debt instruments guarantee mortgagebacked securities mbs purchase loans and hold them in their own portfolio fund related activities and collect fees for guarantees and other services7 how many gses exist at present there are seven gses three of the gses the federal national mortgage association fannie mae the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and the federal agricultural mortgage corporation farmer mac are investor owned the others the federal home loan bank system and the farm credit system are owned cooperatively by their borrowers8 what are the differences between gses and agencies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21663 gses are instrumentalities not agencies of the united states this distinction is both legally and administratively important the federal governments control over an institution differs significantly depending upon whether that institution is an agency or instrumentality an agency as defined in title 5 part 1 of the united states code is managed directly through the federal management hierarchy as general rule an agency is subject to all general management laws and regulations provided in the united states code unless it is exempted from such coverage either in its enabling statute or by virtue of being part of an exempted class of agency thus an agency is subject to federal appointment of its senior officers often requiring senate confirmation to civil service and federal procurement laws and to the federal budget and other direct federal management controls unless exempted an instrumentality of government on the other hand is privately owned institution not subject to any of the general management laws and regulations unless so indicated in its enabling legislation charter an instrumentality may be assigned limited prerogatives in its charter eg immunity from state taxation normally associated with the governments sovereign authority in return for this limited assignment of governmental powers an instrumentality cannot on its own authority alter the charter or conduct activities contrary to the intent of the charter thus gse is supervised but not directly managed by the federal government today gses primarily act as financial intermediaries to assist borrowers in housing and agriculture although they are privately owned they benefit financially from 7 us general accounting office financial services institutions information for assessing the governments potential financial exposure gaoggd98125 washington gao 1998 p 3 8 the other two gses the financing corporation and the resolution funding corporation are funding shells not operating companies they were given gse status so that their funding would not appear to be federal borrowing for purposes of the federal budget the student loan marketing association sallie mae was not included in the list because it shed its gse designation and became the entirely private slm corporation in 2004 crs4 government sponsorship their securities can collateralize public deposits eg social security administration and state and local government deposits and can be held in unlimited amounts by most banks and thrifts with one exception farmer mac they sell securities to the public without registering them with the securities and exchange commission and their corporate earnings are exempt from state and local income taxes the latter practice attracting particular controversy9 all but one farm credit system have line of credit with the treasury these statutecreated benefits create an inferred federal guarantee that is investors act as if they believe that the federal government would make good on gses debts and obligations in the event of failure what are the concerns about gses in terms of meeting their original congressional objective to provide liquidity to credit markets on national rather than regional or state basis the gses have been remarkably successful they are widely credited with 1 serving rural agricultures financial requirements 2 lowering the cost of home mortgages and 3 increasing liquidity by forging stronger links with general capital markets defenders of the current gses also hold that gses are generally well managed and financially sound moreover httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21663 they contend that gses continue to provide valuable public service by assisting low and lowmiddle income individuals to become homeowners10 however with these successes have come reservations and questions these concerns are rooted in investors inference that the federal government backs gse obligations and in the privileges accorded by the federal government to gses as well as in their hybrid nature size and subsidization inferred guarantee and privileges through their charters gses receive number of privileges not granted to private sector financial firms these privileges and the publicprivate hybrid nature of gses create the perception among investors that the federal government backs gse obligations to be clear there is explicit guarantee in law for gse liabilities in fact the charter of each gse requires that it inform investors that its securities are not governmentbacked nevertheless there is general presumption to the contrary which fannie mae acknowledged in letter to the office of the comptroller of the currency fannie mae standard domestic obligations like treasuries typically receive rating on an issuebyissue basis because investors and rating agencies view the implied 9 recently freddie mac and fannie mae agreed to register voluntarily with the securities and exchange commission sec see crs report rs21263 fannie mae freddie mac and sec registration and disclosures by mark jickling and barbara miles 10 fannie mae has suggested that its special gse status lowers the cost of home loan by quarter to half of percent which means that 400000 families qualified for mortgages that would not have otherwise see fannie mae advertisement washington post may 11 1999 p a5 former secretary of housing and urban development disagreed numerous hud studies and independent analyses have shown that the gses have historically lagged the primary market instead of led it with respect to funding mortgage loans for lowincome and minority home buyers statement of mel martinez secretary of the department of housing and urban development before us congress senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs oct 16 2003 p 3 crs5 government backing of fannie mae as sufficient indication of the quality of fannie mae obligations11 this impression of federal backing has been encouraged by the federal governments past actions for example when the farm credit system was in crisis in the late 1980s the federal government arranged bailout12 hybrid nature gses are chartered for public purpose but are privately owned forprofit firms as an instrumentality the gse is to serve the public good yet the primary accountability of gse management is not to the federal government or the public but to owners of gse stock and securities as chief executive officer of sallie mae once told senate oversight subcommittee we are private corporation and as such with stockholders and bondholders we have fiduciary responsibility to those individuals13 indeed the recent managerial turnover at freddie mac and fannie mae was due in great part to its use of inaccurate accounting methods to report earnings that are attractive to investors14 the forprofit nature of the gse also means it has incentives to seek profits in product and service markets outside its government charter15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21663 size and systemic risk gses in fact are among the largest financial institutions in the united states investors inference of federal backing is one factor that has enabled gses to grow rapidly on average the combined size of fannie mae and freddie mac has more than doubled every five years since 196816 for example the combined debt outstanding of fannie mae and freddie mac is approximately 17 trillion in 2004 the federal home loan bank system had 754 billion in consolidated debt outstanding in 200317 gse securities are held by both us and foreign banks and 11 as quoted in stanton government sponsored enterprises p 35 12 on the rescue of

oversight needed in nonmortgage investments gaoggd9848 washington gao 1998 16 stanton government sponsored enterprises mercantilist companies in the modern world p 8 not only does the inferred guarantee make gse securities attractive to investors it also encourages investors to continue to invest in gses 17 office of federal housing oversight 2005 report to congress washington ofheo june 15 2005 p 63 and website of the federal home loan banks office of finance httpwwwfhlbofcomissuancedebt_outstandinghtml crs6 financial institutions therefore some observers believe the failure of gse has the potential to create worldwide destructive spillover effects18 subsidization gses borrow money at significantly lower interest rates than competitors because of the inferred federal guarantee and the governmentbestowed privileges the congressional budget office estimated this federal subsidy to the housing gses to be over 135 billion in the year 2000 alone19 this subsidy generates at least three major issues critics ask the following 1 is it is fair for the government to give gses an advantage over private banking firms20 2 if the banking system longer suffers from barriers to the free flow of credit why continue to have gses why not critics ask evolve the gses into private companies as was done with sallie mae21 and 3 are gses really the most efficient way to subsidize home purchases and agricultural activities would another policy be less costly issues for congress on september 7 2008 the us treasury placed two of the gses fannie mae and freddie mac into government conservatorship secretary of the treasury henry m httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21663 paulson jr said that the agency did this to provide stability to financial markets support the availability of mortgage finance and protect taxpayers he stated that policymakers now face the challenge of resolving the systemic risk created by the inherent conflict in the gse structure22 the financial troubles of these two gses raise many questions are gses still needed should the gse model be replaced with different type of entity should gses subsidies be provided in some other form these are some of the questions that congress may wish to consider 18 for example see international monetary fund global financial stability report september 2003 19 congressional budget office federal subsidies and the housing gses
