initial release for comment on the draft operational instruction 1 the nominal insurer work in collaboration with the wcc to ensure consiste ncy is maintained between practices followed by agents and decisions madeupheld by arbitrators clear guidelines to be developed in conjunction with the wcc anecdotally in instances where previous operational instructions have been adhered to when applying change in benefit entitlement the workers compensation commission wcc seldom supports the decision and often benefits are reinstated it is suggested that if services provided are consistent with the ods then there is assurance that the cision will be upheld at the commission the wcc is an independent dispute resolution body where decisions are made independent of any involvement from the nominal insurer the intent of the oi is about applying sound principles in claims management derpinned by soundly based decision making model case law has been noted when preparing the oi with key principles incorporated it is important that scheme agents take holistic approach when applying operational instructions as opposed to process based approach analysis conducted on relevant case law where decisions were found in favour of the applicant indicates that scheme agents had taken process rather than holistic approach the oi has been drafted with this approach as key principle 2 the guidelines in the draft oi relating to job seeking requirements are vague exhausted job seeking services will vary according to workers needs request the nominal insurer provide clear minimum expectations guidelines to outline what the necessary skills to independently job seek are to ensure consistency amongst services engaged by agents noted job seeking services will vary according to workers needs and the case law supports this concern the key issue is for scheme agents to sure all reasonable job seeking opportunities have been provided relevant to the workers needs setting minimum standard may be counterproductive in potentially disadvantaging worker each workers individual circumstances need to be considered 3 the guidelines in the draft oi relating to s40a assessment report content and methods are not detailed enough to ensure consistency amongst scheme agents noted there has been additional information included in the oi the intent is that agents set cle ar

identified job options the approach is to take broad range of the reasonably accessible labour market open to the worker the types of earnings those types of jobs will produce and obtain weighted average the jobs that are more read ily available weigh high and those that are rarely available weigh low the intention is the decision making to be balanced and reasonable on the job options identified and calculation process 19 the draft oi indicates that new imp is to be issued when change in rate occurs this requirement is supported in general except for circumstances where the worker transitions from section 38 to section 40 purely because of the expiration of the 52 weeks of section 38 benefits the existing imp may wel l still be appropriate and require further amendment the imp should still be reviewed and reissued if longer appropriate but there should not be hard and fast rule to require scheme agents to do so noted the oi has been amended to reflect t he establishment and review of an imp with change in benefit entitlement in the first instance the imp needs to be relevant when circumstances change and the agent needs to be satisfied the current imp is appropriate in the circumstance where worke r transitions from s38 to s40 where 52 weeks of s38 have expired the imp needs to be reviewed against the relevant circumstances of the case and ensure the worker understands the change in benefit and the requirements and potential ramifications the i ntent of this clause is to ensure alignment with the principles to claims management in the oi such as communication with the worker on benefit changes and maintaining regular contact with the worker the imp would formalise the communication process and further inform the worker of the change in benefit 20 the draft oi requires the agent to advise the worker in writing the section under which they are being paid in some claims an injured worker can quite regularly transition between total incapa city and partial incapacity eg be on partial incapacity and then suffer an increase in symptoms so then total for several days or week and then back to partial is it the expectation that written communication is issued on every instance of these it is not anticipated that written correspondence would be required on each benefit change based on workers regular fluctuation in f itness for work capacity the scheme agent needs to ensure the worker understands their rights and obligations and potential ramifications of benefit change the scheme agent needs to consider the evidence and relevant circumstances of the case and det ermine the reasonableness of written communication in every instance of change in fitness for work status impacting benefit change the evidence pertaining to the workers fitness for work status in relation to duration and stability of capacity and the workers level of understanding of the benefit change will be key elements in the decision making of the

cooperate is limited in scope to the employer with whom the worker sustained their injury and which is on page 9 under section 52a1a the worker is not suitably employed within t he meaning of section 43a and is not seeking suitable employment as determined in accordance with section 38a note 2 seems to indicate that the cooperation is limited to the employer with whom the injury was sustained further in the legislation esp ecially s52 1b there is mention of with whom the worker has rejected an offer of suitable employment rather s52a 1b refers us back to s40 2b which states any person suggest an amendment to note 2 which broadens the scope to inc lude other employers and provides further guidanceclarification on what constitutes unreasonably refusing to cooperate would address this note 2 is referring particularly to section 38a 5b which reads unreasonably refuses to cooperate in proced ures connected with the provision or arrangement of suitable employment or rehabilitation training under the employers return towork program it does not make general reference such as an employer more particularly employer is defined in section 38a the definition reads employer of worker who is partially incapacitated for work means the employer liable to pay compensation to the worker in respect of the incapacity or if there are 2 or more such employers the employer so liable who last mployed the worker therefore amendment can be made to the operational instruction as to do as suggested would be outside the law it is considered the term unreasonably refusing to cooperate is adequately defined 47 on page 2 first dot poin t of the oi that reads advise the worker both verbally and in writing the section under which they are now being paid the period of time there are concerns regarding the practical implications of this particularly for claims where the changes are fr equent or involves very short periods eg 1 day is written notification sufficient in such please refer to response in matter number 20 the intent of the oi is to ensure the scheme agent applies sound principles to claims management including p lain language communication to the worker on benefit entitlements scheme agents need to ensure the communication provided is relevant to the workers needs and the worker understands the entitlement they are to be paid under the obligations and potential ramifications scheme agents need to consider the effectiveness of the communication case law indicates that the wcc will be looking to see that the scheme agent has made reasonable and appropriate
