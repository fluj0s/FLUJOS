the political leaders of the world they have to protect the victims and ensure the respect for the courts decisions3 the government of sudan condemned the icc action while the african union asked for deferment of the icc case against bashir however the chairman of the african union president jakaya kikwete of tanzania stated at the united nations in september that when we talk about deferment we should not in anyway be perceived as condoning impunity justice is matter of essence president museveni of uganda stated that you cannot stand up and say dont touch bashir because he is president suppose he made those mistakes if you take that position you will be ignoring the right of the victims4 other african leaders also expressed similar views concerning the icc case against bashir the

legal processes vice president salva kiir was appointed to chair crisis committee to deal with the icc process and other emerging issues foreign minister deng alore of sudan informed president bashir that he will not defend him at the united nations or lobby against the icc case this led to decision by bashir to appoint vice president osman ali taha to lead 50person delegation to the united

travel ban and asset freeze on musa hilal bush administration officials have criticized the appointment of hilal8 president bashir argued that hilal is an influential leader in darfur and that his

relations between sudan and china expanded and china became key 11 httpwwwusatodaycomnewsworld20070625darfur_nhtm 12 httpwwwunmisorgenglishenmainhtm crs6 trading partner investing billions of dollars in sudans oil sector china reportedly imports an estimated 64 of sudans oil and chinas national petroleum corporation is the largest shareholder 47 in the two biggest oil consortiums in sudan petrodar and the greater nile petroleum operating company gnpoc in addition to the oil sector china is an important player in other sectors of the sudanese economy in february 2007 china signed 12 billion agreement to upgrade the railway between khartoum and port sudan china is also an active participant in power generation the arms industry and other major infrastructure projects china built the 1000mile oil pipeline used by sudan to move its oil from the oil fields in south sudan to port sudan china is an important supplier of weapons to the government of sudan sudan also produces significant quantities of weapons itself and is the third largest arms manufacturer in africa after south africa and egypt human rights groups and other observers accuse the chinese government of being the principal supplier of weapons in violation of weapons embargo on sudan in 2005 china reportedly sold sudan 24 million in arms and ammunition and 57 million worth of spare parts for aircraft and helicopters13 in july 2008 bbc televison report presented evidence of chinese army trucks and several a5 fantan fighter planes in darfur in february 2008 fantan fighter planes were used to bomb

china provides important political and financial support to the government of sudan as permanent member of the security council china has threatened several times to veto security council resolutions or has influenced the council either to withdraw or amend statements in july 2008 britishdrafted presidential statement was withdrawn because of chinese opposition china also has abstained on resolutions 1556 1591 1593 and 1706 relating to darfur in 2007 china forgave 70 million in debt and provided 13 million in interestfree loan to sudan to build new presidential palace advocacy groups in the united states and in other parts of the world have engaged in campaign to highlight chinese support to the sudanese government and link that support to the upcoming beijing olympics the advocates refer to the beijing olympics as the genocide olympics these advocates argue that the main purpose of the campaign is to shame china into using its influence over sudan in order to bring an end to the crisis in darfur the campaign does not advocate boycotting the olympics or targeting the athletes although these groups have called on world leaders to boycott the opening ceremony in beijing the pressure on china has yielded some results the chinese government appointed special envoy for sudan and has also deployed an estimated 315 engineers to take part in the peacekeeping mission in darfur 13 amnesty international sudan arms continuing to fuel serious human rights violations in darfur may 2007 14 bbc news china is fueling war in darfur july 13 2008 ted dagne spoke with the reporter on number of occasions in preparation for the bbc television report which was aired on july 14 2008 crs7 recent developments southern sudan in october 2007 the government of southern sudan suspended the participation of its ministers state ministers and presidential advisors from the government of national unity to protest measures taken by the national congress party and to demand full implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement cpa the sudan peoples liberation movement splm has been complaining and urging the sudanese government to implement key provisions of the cpa and to consult the first vice president on key issues they complained that president omer bashir has been taking important decisions with little or consultation with the first vice president since the signing of the peace agreement in 2005 on darfur president bashir has been waging war and deliberately sidelining the splm on key decisions for example the eastern sudan agreement was negotiated and signed between the national congress party and the eastern rebels without serious consultation with the first vice president according to the cpa the president shall take decisions with the consent of the first vice president on declaration and termination of state of emergency declaration of war appointments that the president is required to make according to the peace agreement summoning adjourning or proroguing the national assembly request by the first vice president to reshuffle southern ministers in the government of national unity was held up for several months by president bashir in large part due to bashirs opposition to the proposed change of the foreign minister in october the splm leadership submitted number of demands to president bashir in letter to president bashir first vice president salva kiir wrote15 at this critical juncture of the history of our country the sudanese people the region and the international community at large do follow with concern the evolving situation in our country in particular they follow closely with concern what both of us and the parties we lead are doing to enhance and consolidate peace in our country the comprehensive peace agreement cpa is the corner stone of that peace it is with this spirit that i am addressing you today on behalf of the splm and on my own behalf as partner in peace the splm was encouraged by the creation of bilateral permanent mechanisms for the resolution of outstanding issues on cpa implementation as well as for the enhancement of cooperation and partnership between our two parties despite the progress made on several issue areas critical flash points remain thereby giving rise to the impression that the mechanisms we have created were mere vehicles for public relations exercises and not meant to help the parties in resolving critical differences the above impression was reinforced by recent provocative actions emanating from authorities within the government of national unity gonu of which we are part indeed the major partner to the ncp the height of these provocations was the raids in khartoum on splm premises and the mess of spla senior officers in the joint defense board jdb the jdb is the highest military organ created by the cpa and inc to oversee the smooth implementation of security arrangements those indecorous acts were compounded by the unrepentant 15 government of sudan source crs8 reaction by their perpetrators to splms protest the perpetrators include ncp ministers and officers in the law enforcement agencies who are dutybound by the inc to steer away of politics it became clear to us however that the provocations reflected pattern of behavior intended to humiliate the splm the splm therefore should not be expected to take that behavior lightly indeed the situation called for pause and deep reflection on the way and spirit with which we are handling the implementing of cpa to that end the splm interim political bureau ipb met in juba from october 4th 11th 2007 to assess and evaluate the status of cpa implementation and draw concrete actions for the way forward in that evaluation the ipb identified cpa violations and enumerated unacceptable deliberate actions demeaning to the splm and its leadership i am enclosing herewith copy of the ipbs resolutions encompassing violations to the cpa as well as actions to which the splm takes serious exception in presenting these resolutions i am confident that you shall address with wisdom and statesmanship the serious issues raised therein truly those violations and actions constitute major challenge to the sustenance of peace and consolidation of unity in our country on my part i remain committed to the full implementation of the cpa and i do not wish for moment to contemplate the collapse of the cpa let alone take part in that collapse furthermore the ipb expressed deep concern with your excellencys inaction on the reshuffle of splm ministers in gonu which in the spirit of collegial decisionmaking i proposed in doing that i was exercising my constitutional rights and prerogatives as the chairman of the splm to effect the recommendations of my party in view of the perception that this inaction amounts to an encroachment on the first vice presidents constitutional powers the ipb recalled all splm presidential advisors ministers and state ministers in gonu and they have been directed to stay away from their duties till considerable progress is seen in addressing the issues raised in the attached resolutions in order not to paralyze the work of gonu i am again presenting to your excellency our new list of ministerial changes in gonu i am confident that you shall address this matter together with other pressing issues contained in the resolutions of ipb with due regard to the risks inherent in the present stalemate this stalemate if left unresolved may degenerate into crisis which none of us wants it is our political duty and national obligation to avert actions that might endanger the cpa it is also our moral and constitutional responsibility to provide the necessary leadership so that our country is enabled to enjoy peace stability democracy and unity based on the free will of its people in response to these demands and unexpected developments president bashir reportedly accepted number of the government of south sudan goss demands in late october except those related to the abyei issue according to senior splm officials the acceptance of their demands by president bashir does not resolve the crisis they would like to see timeline and roadmap for implementation of their demands before they return to government president bashir accepted new list of ministers submitted by the first vice president although he deleted the name of one senior official who was appointed as presidential adviser according to sudanese sources in late december 2007 the new ministers were sworn in office former minister of foreign affairs lam akol was replaced by deng alore senior member of the splm crs9 status of the comprehensive peace agreement historical context in 1956 sudan became the first independent country in subsaharan africa having gained independence from britain and egypt for almost four decades the east african country with population of 35 million people has been the scene of intermittent conflict an estimated 2 million people died over two decades from war related causes and famine in southern sudan and millions more were displaced the sources of the conflict were deeper and more complicated than the claims of most political leaders and some observers religion was major factor because of the islamic fundamentalist agenda of the current government dominated by the mostly muslimarab north southerners who are christian and animist reject the islamization of the country and favor secular arrangement social and economic disparities were also major contributing factors to the sudanese conflict former president jaafer nimeris abrogation of the 1972 addis ababa agreement in 1983 which had ended the first phase of the civil war in the south is considered major factor triggering the civil war the national islamic front nif government which ousted the democratically elected civilian government in 1989 pursued the war in southern sudan with vigor previous governments both civilian and military had rejected southern demands for autonomy and equality northern political leaders for decades treated southerners as secondclass citizens and did not see the south as an integral part of the country southern political leaders argue that under successive civilian and military governments political elites in the north have made only superficial attempts to address the grievances of the south reluctant to compromise the norths dominant economic political and social status in recent years most political leaders in the north now in opposition to the current government have said that mistakes were made and that they are prepared to correct them but the political mood among southerners has sharply shifted in favor of separation from the north the northsouth peace agreement background on january 9 2005 the government of sudan and the sudan peoples liberation movement splm after two and half years of negotiations signed the sudan comprehensive peace agreement at ceremony in nairobi kenya more than dozen heads of state from africa attended the signing ceremony secretary of state colin powell who led the us delegation reportedly urged the government of sudan and the splm to end the conflict in darfur the signing of this agreement effectively ended the 21yearold civil war and triggered sixyear interim period at the end of the interim period southerners are to hold referendum to decide their political future national regional and local elections are to take place during the second half of the interim period on july 30 2005 first vice president and chairman of the splm dr john garang was killed in plane crash in southern sudan discussed below his death triggered violence between government security forces and southerners in khartoum and juba more than 100 people were reported killed the government of sudan has crs10 established committee to investigate the violence the crash was investigated by team from sudan uganda russia united nations and the united states the final report was issued in april 2006 in early august 2005 the splm leadership council appointed salva kiir as chairman of the splm and first vice president of sudan salva kiir had served as garangs deputy after the splm split in 1991 he was officially sworn in as first vice president in the government of national unity gnu on august 11 2005 on august 31 2005 the national assembly was inaugurated according to the cpa the national congress party was allocated 52 of the seats 234 28 to the splm 126 and the remaining 20 for the northern and southern opposition groups in september 2005 after weeks of contentious negotiations the splm and the national congress party ncp formerly known as the national islamic front nif agreed on cabinet at the core of the dispute was the distribution of key economic ministerial portfolios the ncp insisted on keeping the energy and finance ministries while the splm argued that each party should be given one or the other the splm ultimately gave up its demand and managed to secure eight ministries including foreign affairs cabinet affairs labor transportation health education humanitarian affairs and trade several advisers were also appointed to the presidency the presidency consists of president bashir first vice president kiir and vice president osman ali taha including two from the splm implementation of the cpa implementation of the cpa by the government of national unity has been selective and at times deliberately slow according to united nations officials and sudan observers president bashir for example has not yet implemented the abyei boundary commission abc recommendations and the formation of the joint integrated units has been slow although over the past several months important progress has been made the abc was mandated to define and demarcate the area known as the nine ngok dinka chiefdoms transferred in 1905 to kordofan in north sudan the abc was chaired by former us ambassador to sudan donald peterson with active international engagement in july 2005 the abc submitted its final report to the presidency according to the cpa upon presentation of the final report the presidency shall take necessary action to put the special administration status of abyei area into immediate effect after signing of the peace agreement abyei area was suppose to be administered by an executive council members of the executive council were suppose to be elected by the residents of abyei and the chief administrator appointed by the presidency at the end of the interim period the residents of abyei are to choose between retaining special administrative status in the north or be part of south sudan the bashir government has not put in place an administration in abyei and continues to reject the recommendation of the abc according to september 2007 report by the united nations secretary general the lack of administration in abyei has hampered cpa activities and left gaps in policing public crs11 sanitation and health services continued intransigence on this issue is likely to lead to war according to south sudanese officials and many sudan observers16 the cpa faces serious challenges despite the number of commissions created and decrees issued by the presidency to address issues related to the agreement government force redeployment from southern sudan as called for in the peace agreement has been slow especially in the oil field regions of southern sudan the spla completed redeployment of its forces from east sudan in 2006 the government of sudan redeployed most of its forces as of december 2007 although thousands of sudanese armed forces saf remain in the oil region of south sudan saf has increased its forces in the nuba mountains and southern blue nile in violation of the cpa according to the cpa forces in these two states were suppose to be at level of peace time moreover according to the cpa government forces were to be out of south sudan by july 9 2007 as of december 2007 more than 20000 sudanese armed forces had presence in south sudan according to the united nations the government of sudan has redeployed 88 of its forces spla forces also had presence in the nuba and southern blue nile regions according to senior splm officials the spla will pull out of the area once the saf reduces its presence and the joint integrated units jius are fully deployed in early january 2008 the spla withdrew some of its forces from nuba17 number of commissions remain dysfunctional although many of the commissions have been created by the government of sudan however according to the september cpa monitor the national human rights commission the electoral commission and the land commission have yet to be created18 the assessment and evaluation commission aec which was mandated under cpa to monitor implementation of the peace agreement has created four working groups to monitor implementation of the cpa although the parties to the agreement have not been actively engaged in the process the parties have made little progress in the implementation of the wealthsharing and powersharing provisions of the cpa while work on the northsouth border is behind schedule failure to resolve the border issue is likely to complicate the redeployment of forces and sharing of oil revenues since number of the oil fields are located along the 1956 northsouth border in december the splm and the national congress party reached agreement to resolve the northsouth border issue and on oilrelated issues19 the united states and the northsouth peace

in critical dialogue and offered the normalization of bilateral relations as an incentive for the resolution of the darfur crisis and settlement of the northsouth conflict according to us officials and sudanese sources us policy toward sudan is complicated because the same government that signed the peace agreement with the south is also the one implicated in atrocities in darfur which the us government has declared is genocide this reality has led to some criticism of the bush administration although many praise the administrations sustained engagement in the northsouth talks according to some critics the administration did not initially consider the darfur crisis to be priority instead the administration was largely focused on the talks between the government of sudan and the splm the first statement on darfur by the white house they point out was issued in early april 2004 the bush administration and congress however have been at the forefront in calling for an end to the crisis in darfur and demanding accountability especially since mid2004 the darfur conflict and impact on chad and car the crisis in darfur continues to affect chad and the central african republic car in large part due to rebellions supported by the government of sudan against the governments of chad and car indeed the conflicts in chad and car are largely internal political disputes between the respective governments and number of armed groups in chad some of the belligerents are armed and given safe havens for training purposes by the government of sudan the most affected areas in chad are towns and villages near the border with sudan the government of sudan accuses the government of chad of supporting some of the rebel groups in darfur the sudan liberation army sla reportedly benefitted from outside support including from fellow zagawa elements in chad the zagawa are dominant in some sla factions president idriss deby of chad is zagawa and some of the senior officers in the chadian army come from the zagawa ethnic group successive governments in sudan have intervened in the internal affairs of chad by providing support to armed factions crs13 the current instability in eastern chad is also due to prosudanese government militia groups and the janjaweed crossing the border into chad and attacking civilians february 2007 secretary general report on chad and car stated that fighting between the chadian armed forces and rebel groups some of which are armed and supported by the sudan and attacks by militia on the civilian population have continued to destabilize eastern chad leading to widespread insecurity and human rights violations including continued displacement of civilian populations20 according to international ngos and the united nations more than 120000 people have been internally displaced in eastern chad chad has more than 230000 refugees from darfur according to these sources the incursion by the janjaweed and the fighting between government forces and chadian rebel groups have contributed to the suffering of the internally displaced and the refugees in eastern chad the internally displaced persons often move to areas closer to the refugee camps because humanitarian assistance to the displaced has been limited in december 2006 president deby reached an agreement with one of the rebel groups led by mahamat nour in march 2007 mr nour was appointed as minister of defense in the central african republic the fighting between rebel groups and government forces has displaced more than 70000 people in northeastern car according to the united nations over the past several months the car government has recaptured towns taken by rebel groups the car armed forces supported by french troops and multinational force from the central african economic and monetary community cemac have largely succeeded in containing rebel advances meanwhile negotiations between the government of president francois bozize and several rebel groups have led to some agreements in february 2007 in negotiations mediated by libya two rebel leaders abdoulaye miskine and andre ringui gaillard signed an agreement with the car government however the agreement was rejected by the military chief of one of the rebel groups the united nations has been working towards the deployment of peacekeeping force to chad and car over the past several months and has concluded two technical assessment missions to chad and car the mandate of the proposed multidimensional presence would include the protection of civilians and internally displaced persons maintenance of law and order facilitation of the free movement of humanitarian assistance and coordination with african union mission in sudan amis and the mission in sudan unmis the area of operations would be in eastern chad and northeastern car the secretary general recommended to the security council the deployment of 10900 personnel to chad and car the government of chad has reportedly expressed reservations about the deployment of an armed force but stated that the government would welcome police force 20 report of the secretary general on chad and the central african republic february 23 2007 at httpwwwunorgdocsscsgrep07htm crs14 the crisis in darfur background the crisis in darfur began in february 2003 when two rebel groups emerged to challenge the national congress party ncp government in darfur the sudan liberation army sla and the justice and equality movement jem argued that the government of sudan discriminates against muslim african ethnic groups in darfur and has systematically targeted these ethnic groups since the early 1990s the government of sudan dismisses the sla and jem as terrorists the conflict primarily pits three african ethnic groups the fur zaghawa and massaleit against nomadic arab ethnic groups periodic tensions between the largely africanmuslim ethnic groups and the arab inhabitants of darfur can be traced to the 1930s and had surfaced again in the 1980s most observers note that successive governments in khartoum have long neglected the african ethnic groups in darfur and have done little to prevent or contain attacks by arab militias against nonarabs in darfur nonarab groups took up arms against successive central governments in khartoum albeit unsuccessfully in the early 1990s the national islamic front nif government which came to power in 1989 began to arm arab militias and attempted to disarm the largely african ethnic groups the conflict in darfur burgeoned when the government of sudan and its allied militias began what is widely characterized as campaign of terror against civilians in an effort to crush the rebellion and to punish the core constituencies of the rebels at the heart of the current conflict is struggle for control of political power and resources the largely nomadic arab ethnic groups often venture into the traditionally farming communities of darfur for water and grazing at times triggering armed conflict between the two groups darfur is home to an estimated 7 million people and has more than 30 ethnic groups which fall into two major categories african and arab both communities are muslim and years of intermarriages have made racial distinctions difficult if not impossible fighting over resources is one of several factors that has led to intense infighting in darfur over the years many observers believe that the nif government has systematically and deliberately pursued policy of discrimination and marginalization of the african communities in darfur and has given support to arab militias to suppress nonarabs whom it considers threat to its hold on power in 2000 after the ouster of the founder of the nif hassan alturabi and after split within the islamist movement the government imposed state of emergency and used its new authority to crack down on dissidents in darfur by 2002 littleknown self defense force emerged as the sla challenging government forces in darfur with the ncp regime internally in turmoil and mounting international pressure to end sudans northsouth conflict the sla and jem were able to gain the upper hand in the initial phase of the conflict against government forces in early 2003 and appeared well armed and prepared the rebels also enjoyed the support of the local population as well as officers and soldiers in the sudanese army significant number of senior officers and soldiers in the sudanese armed forces come from darfur the sla reportedly benefitted from outside support including from fellow zaghawa elements in chad and financial support from some darfur businessmen in the persian gulf region in late 2004 another darfur armed group the national movement for reform and development nmrd emerged initial reports suggested crs15 that the nmrd was created by the government of sudan in order to undermine the sla and jem in december 2004 the nmrd and the government of sudan signed ceasefire agreement in chad and month later agreed to cooperate in facilitating the return of refugees from chad to darfur regional officials and sudanese opposition figures assert that the nmrd is backed by the government of chad and that the rebels wear uniforms and carry arms similar to those of the chadian army over the past year the rebel groups have splintered into different factions and often clashed with each other in june 2006 another rebel group was formed the national redemption front nrf consisting of several rebel faction groups these include splinter groups from slm and jem as well as the sudan federal democratic alliance sfda darfur developments accountability for atrocities in july 2004 the us house of representatives and the senate unanimously passed resolutions hconres 467 sconres 133 declaring the crisis in darfur to be genocide based on the five criteria for genocide enumerated in article 2 of the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide on september 9 2004 then secretary of state colin powell in his testimony before the senate foreign relations committee declared the atrocities in darfur genocide secretary powell stated that after reviewing evidence collected by the state department team genocide has been committed in darfur and that the government of sudan and the jingaweit bear responsibility and that genocide may still be occurring powell further stated that because the united states is contracting party to the geneva convention washington will demand that the united nations initiate full investigation shortly after powells testimony draft resolution 1564 was adopted the resolution requested the secretary general of the united nations to establish an international commission of inquiry in order to immediately investigate reports of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in darfur by all parties to determine also whether or not acts of genocide have occurred and to identify the perpetrators of such violations with view to ensuring that those responsible are held accountable the declaration of genocide by the bush administration did not lead to major shift in us policy or threat of intervention to end genocide instead bush administration officials continued to support negotiated settlement between the rebels in darfur and the government of sudan but continued violence in darfur and the governments failure to disarm the janjaweed militia further strained relations between khartoum and washington in january 2005 the international commission of inquiry on darfur submitted its report to secretary general kofi annan the 176page report provided detailed accounting of atrocities committed by the government of sudan and its janjaweed militia allies the commission declared that based on thorough analysis of the information gathered in the course of the investigations the commission established that the government of sudan and the janjaweed are responsible for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law amounting to crimes crs16 under international law21 the commission found however that the government of sudan has not pursued policy of genocide the commission while acknowledging that government officials and other individuals may have committed genocidal acts stated that the crucial element of genocidal intent appears to be missing the commission submitted sealed document listing 51 suspects for prosecution by the international criminal court icc us officials argue that the government of sudan is responsible for genocide in darfur despite the commissions conclusion of genocidal intent washington initially did not support the commissions referral of these cases to the icc us opposition to the icc is unrelated to the darfur case it is largely driven by concerns about the potential prosecution of us personnel by the icc and because of this concern the united states is not signatory to the icc in march 2005 the united states abstained on security council resolution 1593 paving the way for its passage resolution 1593 refers the situation in darfur to the international criminal court icc in june 2005 the special prosecutor of the icc formally began an investigation icc spokesman yves sorokobi indicated that the decision to launch the investigation came after the icc had finished its analysis of the referral by the security council this analysis included he said consultations with experts ensuring that the icc had met statutory requirements before beginning the investigations meanwhile icc officials continue to gather information and pursue their investigation although the icc has not issued any indictments to date in july the icc chief prosecutor charged president bashir with genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes22 since the crisis began in 2003 sources estimate 450000 people have been killed more than 2 million displaced and some 234000 sudanese are in refugee camps in neighboring chad the security situation continues to deteriorate especially since the signing of the peace agreement in may 2006 reportedly due to recent troop deployments by the government of sudan according to human rights groups over dozen humanitarian workers have been killed in darfur including an international rescue committee nurse on september 1 and an international committee of the red cross driver on august 30 2006 in 2007 according to reports tens of thousands darfuree civilians have been displaced from their homes due to government and janjaweed attacks according to february 2008 united nations report tensions inside camps of internally displaced persons and carjacking incidents continued one week after the transfer of authority from the african union mission in the sudan amis to unamid the force faced its first armed attack23 meanwhile humanitarian groups have warned that they may not be able to continue to provide assistance to the civilian population because of deteriorating security conditions in november 2006 the government of sudan ordered the 21 report of the international commission of inquiry on darfur to the united nations secretary general january 25

2006 armed militia attacked village in jebel moon and seleah in west darfur killing over 50 people including children and elderly meanwhile security conditions inside idp camps have also deteriorated in recent months with increasing number of armed groups in the camps in his monthly report to the security council in november 2006 secretary general kofi annan stated that the insecurity banditry and fighting which have characterized the reporting period continued to prevent access to populations in need of humanitarian assistance24 according to the same report in northern darfur alone the world food program wfp reported that 355000 people went without food aid during july and august in early august 2006 the government of sudan submitted letter to the united nations security council outlining the governments decision to deploy significant new security forces and implement other measures in darfur according to the government of sudan the national plan embodies several priority themes for the restoration of normal life in darfur the government of sudan began to deploy more than 26500 troops and 7050 police personnel in order to address threats imposed by the nonsignatories of the darfur peace agreement and getting control of the security situation and restoration of peace in darfur human rights groups secretary general kofi annan and us officials have criticized the deployment of these troops and stated that this action violates the peace agreement meanwhile senior commanders of the slm the only group that signed the peace agreement have stated that continued government attacks in darfur and continued rejection of force could lead to the collapse of the peace agreement the janjaweed background since the crisis in the darfur region began in 2003 the name janjaweed also spelled as janjawid janjawad jingaweit jinjaweed has become very familiar name to many in the international community the janjaweed and the government of sudan have been accused of committing genocide against civilians in darfur by the united states government in 2004 and accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the united nations and other governments the existence of the janjaweed goes back over decade in the mid1980s the government of sudan began to arm arab militias in order to prevent african darfuris from joining the southern sudanese rebellion against the government in 1983 the sudan peoples liberation movementarmy splma began its armed struggle against the government of sudan attacks against darfuri african tribes and nubans increased in intensity for most of the 1980s in 19911992 an splm commander from darfur led force into darfur in support of the darfuris who were being targeted by the government of sudan and progovernment arab militia those targeted were the fur massaliet and zagawa peoples more than 200 villages were attacked and later occupied by progovernment 24 monthly report of the secretary general on darfur november 8 2006 crs18 arab militia in the garsilla district now know as the wadisaleh province these attacks were carried out by group now known as the janjaweed daoud yahya bolad who was senior member of the national islamic front nif in darfur before the 1989 coup was the leading figure in the splmled rebellion against the sudanese government in darfur in the early 1990s in 1976 bolad an ethnic fur was chairman of the student union of the university of khartoum he was sent by the nif leadership to darfur in the late 1970s to recruit members for the nif he left the nif due to major disagreement with the leader of the nif hassan alturabi turabi and other nif leaders recruited arab youth to go to libya and other places for training purposes and began other activities without consultation with bolad and other darfuri leaders the traditional leaders in darfur described the janjaweed then as men who own horse and g3 rifle and who commit crimes against civilians darfuri leaders link the janjaweed to manifesto called the quresh the principal objective of the quresh they argued was to create region called darelarab land of the arabs the architects of the manifesto and those who signed it are senior members of the national islamic front government currently known as the national congress party the 19911992 rebellion against the nif regime failed in large part due to lack of preparation inside darfur and major janjaweed and government operations against the small spla force in the region the commander of the spla force decided to withdraw his troops after the government and arab militia forces discovered the location of the spla force before final preparation for operations elements within the government intensified their campaign to bring bolad back into the nif for talks with pledges to change policies and address the concerns of the darfuris bolad decided to return to engage nif officials against the advice of the spla leadership and the force commander believing that since he knew some of the leaders in the government and the nif he might be able to make deal upon his return he was captured tortured and executed according to sudanese sources for many darfuris the war between the various groups started well before 2003 darfuris who experienced the atrocities in the mid1980s in large part are the ones currently fighting the janjaweed and the government of sudan the groups that were targeted in the mid1980s are the same ones currently being attacked by the janjaweed and the government of sudan the fur massaliet and zagawa in the current crisis in darfur the janjaweed are armed and protected by the government and their attacks against civilians are coordinated with the sudan armed forces the popular defense force and other governmentsupported militia groups senior sudanese government officials and leaders of the janjaweed admit this collaboration between the janjaweed and the government as was the case in the mid1980s one of the main objectives of the janjaweed is to push out african darfuris in order to take control of areas belonging to nonarabs human rights groups foreign governments and sudanese groups have documented the atrocities committed by the janjaweed against darfur civilians humanitarian workers and african union peacekeepers human rights watch in its crs19 report darfur destroyed25 provides detailed accounts of janjaweed atrocities as well as those committed by government forces janjaweed leaders and government officials claim that they are fighting rebels and violent militia but the victims of these atrocities have been reported as the civilians in darfur mainly the zagawa fur and massaliet the janjaweed like the interhamwe in rwanda and the lords resistance army in uganda are reported to principally target civilians and terrorize the civilian population the darfur peace agreement and status of implementation on may 5 2006 the government of national unity and the sudan liberation movement slm signed the darfur peace agreement dpa after almost two years of negotiations the agreement was rejected by two other darfur groups the justice and equality movement jem and splinter group from the slm the agreement calls for the integration of 4000 sla troops into the sudan armed forces provides 300 million initially and 200 million each in 2007 and 2008 from government funds for reconstruction and development purposes for darfur and establishes the transitional darfur regional authority tdra new entity mandated under the dpa to administer darfur the agreement provides seats for the slm in the national and regional parliaments and several top positions including the chairmanship of the tdra and senior assistant to the president on august 7 2006 the leader of the slm mini minawi was sworn in as assistant to the president the agreement also calls for the disarmament and demobilization of the janjaweed since the signing of the agreement the dpa has failed to win popular support in darfur the faction that signed the agreement is also accusing the government of violating the agreement in midmay 2006 violent demonstrations in idp camps had led to number of deaths and injuries amis personnel have also been targeted forcing african mission in sudan to reduce its presence in idp camps meanwhile implementation of the agreement is also moving slowly according to the united nations dpa monitor report the parties continued to miss critical dpa implementation deadlines26 the preparatory committee tasked to organize the darfurdarfur dialogue was not fully functional

peacekeeping operation on september 20 2006 au officials extended the amis peacekeeping operation until the end of december 2006 and in december the au extended the amis operation for another six months united nations officials and many observers of sudan argue that failure to resolve peacekeeping deployment is likely to lead to the collapse of the dpa and major humanitarian crisis in addition to its peacekeeping responsibilities amis is key player in the implementation of key provisions of the dpa the ceasefire commission and the joint commission are chaired by amis while it is also tasked to establish and play key role in the joint humanitarian facilitation and monitoring unit security in idp camps creation of demilitarized zones verification of disengagement and demobilization are also the responsibility of amis possible policy options concerning darfur there are number of unilateral and multilateral policy options available to consider in facing the darfur crisis these options are complicated by number of factors members of the international community are divided over sudan and some governments are allies of the regime in khartoum since the late 1990s the european union has adopted policy of engagement instead of containment while the united states pursued policy of isolation and containment of the government of sudan sudans neighbors are also divided relations between eritrea and sudan were poor although in recent years relations have improved while relations with chad are poor for some of the options outlined below to be successful close cooperation and coordination between the united states and the international community especially the security council and sudans neighbors is pivotal some of the other options are not dependent on close cooperation with the international community engagement one option is engagement with the government of sudan the government of sudan is eager to appease the international community as long as it can avoid punitive sanctions and ensure its own political survival in this scenario engaging the government might yield some positive results short of full cooperation and accountability by the government past engagement with the current government however has not succeeded in changing its behavior the government of sudan signs peace agreements or shows flexibility when it feels that it is in its interest to do so sanctions many observers assert that the current regime only responds to real pressure the clinton administration imposed comprehensive economic and trade sanctions in 1997 the impacts of these sanctions are mixed over the past decade number of punitive measures have been imposed on the government of sudan the government of southern sudan is exempted from these sanctions but the government of sudan has survived years of sanctions imposed by the united states crs22 moreover some countries oppose sanctions against the government of sudan especially those countries with business interests in sudans oil sector multilateral targeted sanctions including oil embargo travel ban and asset freeze might have serious impact especially if enforced by the international community another option is prohibiting foreign businesses from raising capital or trading their securities in the united states if they are engaged in business activities in sudan regime change some observers and sudan opposition leaders argue that the regime is incapable of change they argue that since the national congress party government came to power in 1989 it has committed war crimes in south sudan the nuba mountains and now in darfur they also maintain the regime has ties to international terrorist and extremist groups regime change in khartoum they argue could bring swift end to the crisis in darfur and help implement the north south agreement but opposition groups are not strong or united enough to pose serious threat to the regime moreover 21years of war with the spla and other armed groups did not lead to the collapse of the regime in khartoum for this option to be viable the opposition would have to be united and assisted nonetheless the only force capable of countering the regime in khartoum is the spla proponents of the regime change concept argue that strengthening the spla militarily unifying the darfur factions and assisting other opposition elements in the north could pose threat to the regime in khartoum international intervention another option involves military intervention by the international community the international community could disarm the janjaweed enforce nofly zone and provide protection to civilians in darfur by deploying large numbers of peacekeepers with chapter vii mandate the government of sudan has rejected the deployment of united nations peacekeeping force after the security council passed resolution 1706 deployment without government consent is an option although there seems to be strong support for such forceful measure bilateral targeted military measures another forcebased option is the targeting of certain military assets of the sudanese government these targets might include the sudanese air force military airfields intelligence and military headquarters and training facilities for the janjaweed and the sudanese armed forces in 2005 138 members of congress cosponsored hr 1424 which would have
