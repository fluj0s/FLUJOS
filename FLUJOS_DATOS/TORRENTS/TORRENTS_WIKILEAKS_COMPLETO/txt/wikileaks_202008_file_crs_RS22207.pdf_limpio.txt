the emissions of haza rdous air pollutants from electric utility steam generating units 65 federal register 79825 december 20 2000clean air act2 by reversing its earlier determin ation epa effectively eliminated requirement that utilities meet maximum achievable control technologymact standards at each individual coal and oilfired plant had mact standards been promulgated existing facilities would have had three years to meet them with the possibility of oneyear extensions of the deadline if it were necessary for the installation of controls thus epas march 29 rule eliminated requirement that individual utility plants meet mact requirements by march 2008 or 2009 in eliminating the mact requirement the march 29 rule paved the way for separate may 18 2005 rule in which epa promulgated capandtrade program for power plant mercury emissions the capand trade rule would be implemented in two phases and would allow utilities to bank for later use or trade allowances earned by reducing emissions earlier or more than required in general according to epas analysis power plants would not install cont rol equipment specifically designed to reduce mercury emissions until the 2020s under the cap andtrade rule for full discussion of the capandtrade rule and epas rationale in promulgating it see crs report rl32868 mercury emissions from electric power pl ants an analysis of epas capandtrade regulations there has been much discussion among inte rested parties regarding what level of control would have been required by the ma ct provision in section 112d the statute requires that mact standards for existing facilities shall not be less stringent and may be more stringent than the averag emission limitations achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing s ources on january 30 2004 epa had proposed mact standards for five categories of electri c generating units that would have required mercury emission reductions of about 30 on average many maintained that this mact proposal did not meet the statutory minimum requirements for discussion of the mact proposal see crs report rl32744 mercury emissions from electric generating units review of epa analysis and mact determination if the march 29 rule were to be ultimately disapproved by congress epa would be forced to issue mact standards for coal and oilfired electric power plants how quickly the agency would do so is uncertain having proposed mact standards and taken public comment on them in 2004 the agency could proceed to promulgation without significant delay but the dispute over the stringency of such standards would likely continue even if promulgation came swif tly as stakeholders debate whether epas choice of mact meets the best performin g 12 percent minimum established by the statutehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22207crs3 3 the next four sections of this report disc ussing the effect of the congressional review act the procedures under which disapproval resolution is taken

in 19964 establishes special congressional procedures for disapproving broad range of re gulatory rules issued by federal agencies before any rule covered by the act can take effect the federal agency that promulgates the rule must submit it to congress if congress passes joint resolution disapproving the rule it would becomes law unle ss congress sustained presidential veto if the resolution became law the rule could not take effect or continue in effect and the agency would be barred from reissuing it or an substantially similar rule except under authority of subsequently enacted law5 pending action on disapprova l resolution the rule may go into effect unless it is major rule in which case delay period of 60 calendar days applies unless waived by the president or i ssuing agency the march 29 mercury rule has not been categorized as major rule and thus is currently in effect pending any action on disapproval resolution the congressional review act provides that disapproval resolution may be introduced in each chamber within 60 days exc luding recesses of ither house after the receipt by congress of the rule to be disa pproved the rule in question was received by the senate on april 4 and by the house on ap ril 21 both sjres 20 and hjres 56 were submitted within the requisite 60day period whic h began on the latter date pursuant to the act disapproval resolution is referred in each chamber to the appropriate committee of jurisdiction sjres 20 was referred to th senate committee on environment and public works and hjres 56 to the house committee on energy and commerce the act provides an expedited procedure for initial floor consideration of disapproval resolution only in the senate the house w ould consider disapproval resolution under its general proce dures very likely as prescribed by special rule reported from the committee on rules in the senate beginning 20 calendar days after congress receives the rule if the committee to which disapproval resolution s been referred has not reported it the panel may be discharged if 30 senators submit petition for the purpose and the resolution is then placed on the calendar on july 18 2005 32 senators submitted petition discharging the environment and public works committee from further consideration of the mercury resolutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22207crs4 6 5 usc section 802d1 7 motion to proceed sjres 6 proceedings in the senate congressional record daily edition vol 147 march 6 2001 p s1831 8 5 usc section 802d2taking up disapproval resolution in the senate pursuant to the congressional review ac t the expedited procedure for senate consideration of disapproval resolution may be used at any time during the 60 days of senate session that begin when the rule in question has been published in the federal register and received by both houses of congress for the mercury rule this period for expedited senate considera tion appears likely to end on approximately september 13 under this expedited procedure once disapproval resolution is on the calendar in the senate motion to proceed to consider it is in order6 this provision of the expedited procedure has the effect of waiving any yover requirements that would normally apply under the general rules of the nate the motion to consider is normally reserved to the majority leader to whom the senate in pr actice accords responsibility for arranging the floor agenda nevertheless by including the motion explicitly in the expedited procedure the act emphasizes that the senate in principle has means of calling up the disapproval resolution matter what position the committee or leadership take on it as with any other measure of course disapproval resolution could also be brought up for consideration by unanimous consent which would usually be obtained by the majority leader several provisions of the expedited procedure protect against various potential obstacles to the senates ability to take up disapproval resolution some of these help ensure that the senate will be able to vote on motion to proceed once the motion is pending by prohibiting motions to postpone its consideration to amend it or to proceed to consider some other business any points of order that might be raised against the measure or its consideration are waived as well finally if the motion to proceed is adopted motion to reconsider that action is prohibited the congressional review act does not explicitly make the disapproval resolution privileged for consideration senate preced ents however indicate that if statute establishes time limit for the consideration of specified measure the provision has the effect of rendering the measure privileged in the senate motion to proceed to consider privileged measure is not debatable consis tent with this principle the senate has treated motion to consider disapproval resolution under the cong ressional review act as not debatable so that this motion ca nnot be filibustered th rough extended debate7 floor consideration in the senate after the senate takes up th disapproval resolution itself the expedited procedure of the congressional review act protects the ability of the body to continue and complete that consideration first once the motion to proceed is adopted the resolution becomes the unfinished business of th senate until disposed of and motions to proceed to consider other business or to postpone c onsideration of the resolution are prohibited8 under these conditions other business may in terrupt considerati on of the disapprovalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22207crs5 9 5 usc section 802d4 10 5 usc section 802d3 11 5 usc section 802fresolution only if the senate gi ves unanimous consent if th senate does turn to other business by unanimous consent the disa pproval resolution automatically recurs as pending after the interruption unless the unanimous consent agreement provides that the other business displace the disapproval re solution as the unfinished business second it is not in order in the senate under the act to move to amend or recommit the disapproval resolution th senate sometimes uses th motion to recommit in such way as to effect an amendment these provisions therefore help to ensure that the senate disapproval resolution will remain identical at least in substantive effect to the house joint resolution disapproving the same rule potentially however this identity could be destroyed by house action on hjre s 56 inasmuch as the act does not prohibit amendment of disapproval resolution during committee or floor consideration in the house third senate deba on disapproval resolution is limited to 10 hours equally divided between supporters and opponents so that filibuster is possible on the resolution itself in addition the act provi des that motion may be offered to limit the time for debate further and this motion itself is not debatable any appeal from ruling of the chair during consideration of disapproval resolution or motion to proceed to its consideration also is to be decided without debate9 finally the act provides that at the conc lusion of debate the senate automatically proceeds to vote on the resolution intervening action is permitted except that one quorum call may take place if any senator so requests10 if the act did not prohibit other intervening actions at this point those ac tions might be used for dilatory purposes final congressional action measure can be presented to the president for action until both houses have agreed to it in identical form if each hous initially passes its ow n disapproval resolution even if the texts are identical neither can yet go to the president for neither has been agreed to by both chambers to prevent this situation the congressional review act provides that when either house adopts disa pproval resolution and nds it to the other the receiving house must hold it at the desk ra ther than refer it to committee this action retains the received resolution in status in which it is available for floor action the act then provides that after the receiving house later considers disa pproval resolution of its own it shall vote not on its own measure but instead on the resolution already received from the other house in this way both houses take final action on the same measure if both adopt it the requirements for presen tation to the president are satisfied11 in one respect these proceed ings reflect normal practice in both houses for carrying out hookup between corresponding house and senate measures normally each house initially considers its own measure but the house that acts second then takes up and passes the corresponding measur already received from the ot her if the two measures are not identical the house acting second norma lly amends the measure received from thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22207crs6 12 gop rejects ergonomics rules cq 2001 almanac plus washington cq press 2001 p 133 13 new jersey v epa no051097 dc cir 14 environmental defense v epa 051159 dc cirother with the text of its own measure th is action enables the two houses to proceed by conference or otherwise to resolve the diffe rences between these two versions of the same measure the expedited procedure of the congressional revi ew act avoids this necessity by requiring one chamber to vote directly on the measure received from the other without amending it it appears that these provisions of the act would apply even if the texts of the two measures are not identical as long as the chair could determine that both would disapprove the same rule and that they therefore corres ponded to each other for purposes of the statutory procedure in this wa even if the two houses initially consider disapproval resolutions with differing texts both will u ltimate ly vote on the same text namely that approved by whic hever house acted first this mechanism helps to prevent any delay that might arise if the house and nate could not agree on final text through conference or amendments between the houses the automatic hookup mechanism provided for by the act presumes that each house will initially act on its own disapproval re solution in 2001 however when congress disapproved the rule on ergono mics submitted by the clinton administration in 2000 the house never took up the house measure for fl oor consideration but instead considered and acted on only the companion measure already received from the senate12 doubt seems to have been raised that this form of action failed to satisfy the requirements of the act for disapproving rule the congressional review act sets d eadline for final congressional action on disapproval resolution nor does it establish any exped ited procedure for further congressional action on disapproval resolution if the president vetoes it congress could however attempt to overri veto using its normal procedures for considering vetoed bills effect of congressional review on other avenues of appeal in addition to the resolutions of disa pproval opponents of th march 29 rule are pursuing several other approaches to overturning it the day the rule appeared in the federal register march 29 nine states filed suit to overturn it in the us court of appeals for the dc circuit13 on may 31 14 states and five environmental groups petitioned epa to reconsider the rule and to stay its effect pending the reconsideration on july 8 12 environmental groups asked th dc circuit for stay of the rule14 in responding to these or other potential motions the courts and epa are prohibited from basing their decisions on whether congress takes action on resolution of disapproval under section 801g of the congressional re view act if the congress does not enact joint resolution of disa pproval under section 802 respecting rule court or agency may infer any intent of the congress from any action or inaction of the congress with regard
