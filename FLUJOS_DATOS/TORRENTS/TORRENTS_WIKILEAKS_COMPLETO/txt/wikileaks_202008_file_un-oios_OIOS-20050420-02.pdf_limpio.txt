stem renewal project finance modules ar200416603 executive summary in october and november 2004 oios conducted post implementation review of unhcrs management system renewal project msrp at geneva headquarters this report covers the implementation of the msrp finance modules general ledger accounts payable accounts receivable and cash management and related functio nal issues separate report is being issued dealing with general project management and with th msrp postimplementation of the supply chain components overall assessment oios assessed the implementation of the msrp financ modules as average although the system was declared operational for serving the users as f rom 5 january 2004 various unsettled matters and preliminary problems remained for some time and users showed some dissatisfaction towards the new system various interim measures particul arly on data uploads to msrp are required until the rollout to the field and the implementati on of the human resourcepayroll module are complete implementation of msrp finance reconciliation of open items the introduction of msrp has made the reconciliatio n of cashintransit miscellaneous receivables and outstanding commitments cumbersom process pending the delivery of other msrp components such as travel and expenses and hr payroll what had been an automated routine task under the legacy system fmis now requires considerable manual intervention and absorbs staff resources needed els ewhere as of 23 december 2004 over 100000 items with an aggregate value of more than us 25 million remained as open items pending reconciliation frs had requested the msrp team to customise such accounting reconciliation tasks within msrp however manual p rocesses will continue for some time as customisation was considered very costly and techni cal staff had been engaged on the field rollout reports certain reports which are essential for managing u nhcr activities and which were available under the legacy system fmis such as statutory re ports ageing analysis of receivables and project budget and expenditure variances had not b een fully developed in msrp in oios view this is limiting unhcrs ability to effective ly manage its resources and monitor their use implementing partner coding and mapping the initial coding and mapping of implementing part ners in msrp was deficient as result in numerous cases instalments paid to implementing partners and budgets established for those partners could not be matched oios noted that abou t us 10 million was paid in instalments during 2004 to implementing partners either without budget or in excess of approved budget while such inconsistencies cannot be fully eliminat ed until the msrp rollout to the field is completed mechanism should be established in the interim period to monitor detect and rectify them project monitoring system msrp lacks the functionality to facilitate project closure and track information on projects forcing the bureaux to develop different spreadshee t solutions although project monitoring system pms was developed to fill the gap the app lication has links to the msrp finance modules and can only deal with 2003 and earlier pro ject closure out of over 60 projects with over 400 subprojects implemented between 2001 and 2003 and approved for closure by the bureaux due to other priorities the finance secti on could only close 25 projects with over 150 subprojects in 2004 project closure has become complex and due to li mitations with pms unhcr needs to formalise strategy to track nd monitor the closure of 2004 and later projects b other accounting and financial issues expenditure recording at present msrp is used comprehensively only at unh cr headquarters whereas field offices and payroll continue using legacy systems fmis fie ld and unog payroll data files generated from these systems are uploaded to the ms rp general ledger which involves considerable work conservatively estimated for upl oading of 5500 text files per annum foas fobs iprs and payroll data generally ch text files were uploaded upon receipt however validation or verification of the data integrity was performed prior to the upload in msrp for example validation for fmis should be p erformed at least twice year an indepth review of sample of five country oper ations six per cent of the population disclosed some variances between the figures upload ed to msrp and that recorded on the field cashbooks for kenya and sierra leone though these variances were not material they highlight the risks and vulnerabilities existing in the standalone systems and the need for compensating controls to mitigate them some more information on this matter is being gathered by unhcr the electronic data provided by payroll to finance was received processed and posted to the general ledger without comprehensive verification r reconciliation to ensure their completeness and accuracy oios noted that basic co ntrols relating to electronic data receipt and upload like the number of recordslines the hash totals of various numeric columns for the payroll data files were not available before th upload into msrp considering that payroll costs account for over us 300 million or 33 per ce nt of the total unhcr expenditure the reconciliation process needs to be strengthened to improve transparency and provide assurance on the completeness and accuracy of payroll expendi ture oios also noted inconsistencies in the recording of payroll data in the msrp general ledger test on certain entitlements showed that some pay roll elements were not correctly stated in the gl but were lumped under common staff costs s uch costs in 2004 including repatriation grant and mobilityhardship to staff under tempora ry assistance amounted to over us 77 million or 20 per cent of the payroll expenditure it appears that these are payroll costs related to staff members who were not charged against estab lished posts due to implementation problems with undps new atla s system unhcr had not yet received from undp by the end of 2004 expenditure reports to substantiate some us 45 million paid to undp unhcr continues to followup with undp to retrieve the reports undp senior management has been contacted the method of processing travel related costs was f ound to be convoluted and involved constant flow exchange of data also at the end f november 2004 us 11 million in understated expenditure existed due to technical di fficulties the technical issues were later resolved and the outstanding amount was reduced to an acceptable level some us 85 million was established as outstanding obligations for 2003 and as of november 2004 about us 19 million still remained unliquida ted by yearend 2004 the finance section has retained us 5 million and has liquidated the b alance however although the unspent funds can be reallocated in 2005 the us 14 millio n could have been identified much earlier for reallocation in 2004 pledges due to the limitations of the legacy fmis system p ledges received during fiscal year but relating to future operations were in the past neit her recorded in the general ledger nor disclosed in the notes to the financial statements similarly reserved pledges were not recorded as income until the donors provided the ea rmarking oios highlighted that the method of accounting and

and november 2004 oios conducted postimplementation review of unhcrs management system renewal project msrp this report covers the implementation of the msrp finance modules and also other issues related to msrp finance the audit was conducted in accordance with the inte rnational standards for the professional practice of internal auditing and was largely based on information systems audit and control association isaca guidelines 2 the finance modules of msrp general ledger acc ounts payable accounts receivable and cash management have been operation at unhcr headquarters since january 2004 and constitute one of the two componen ts of phase i of msrp the main objective of msrp is to enhance unhcrs operational and business management capability through realtime access to information faster pro cessing of transactions and timely decision making this should allow unhcr to increase the eff ectiveness of their service delivery as msrp is initially operational only at headquarters various temporary interfaces and arrangements were needed for compiling and processi ng data of particular concern is data from unhcr field locations and payroll due to thi s situation the postimplementation review was not limited to pure peoplesoft system review but included review of the interfaces with and the data upload from various gacy systems these legacy systems will continue to be in use until msrp has been fully rol led out to the field and the hrpayroll components are completed 3 it should be stated that unhcr embarked initiall on very ambitious project to establish its erp system within relatively short time frame and with limited resources decision was taken in 2002 to use the peoplesoft v anilla version within the finance area and to limit customisation to only the necessary minimu m workarounds and process changes were expected to provide sufficient solutions the refore some gaps between wishesexpectations and final product were inevitab 4 the findings and recommendations contained in t his report were discussed with the head financial resources service during meeting held on 23 november 2004 the related comments are reflected in the draft report the aud it results were further discussed in meeting on 11 february 2005 with the head frs and the director msrp ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the review were to assess whether the msrp project objectives have bee n achieved assess the adequacy of procedures and controls over the input processing and output of data determine if information processing complies with stablished business rules and is accurate reliable and generated timely 2 iii audit scope and methodology 6 oios conducted detailed review of unhcrs 2004 general ledger as well as the subsidiary systems that feedin the data this incl uded mainly the fmis field standalone budgeting and accounting system used by unhcr field offices for recording budgets and expenditure of over us 500 million the second ma jor data input came from unogs legacy systems used for unhcr payroll and headquar ters travel processing with total annual expenditure of over us 300 million 7 oios reviewed relevant documentation and intervi ewed number of staff from the finance budget treasury payroll msrp team dono r relations service and staff from selected desks oios performed data integrity test s to examine the accuracy completeness consistency and authorization of data recorded on m srp for the period from january to october 2004 most of our tests focused on the pro cesses at headquarters iv audit findings and recommendations implementation of msrp finance reconciliation of open items 8 msrp made the reconciliation of cashintransit miscellaneous receivables and outstanding commitments cumbersome process what had been automated routine tasks in the legacy fmis system now requires considerable m anual intervention and the processing of additional journals and absorbs considerable staff resources as result over 100000 items with an aggregate value of more than us 25 million remained as open items pending reconciliation as of 23 december 2004 it is accep ted that the number of open items would drop considerably and the reconciliation process wo uld be greatly simplified once msrp has been rolledout to the field and after the travel nd expenses and hrpayroll modules have been delivered however as these additional activ ities will not be fully completed for almost two more years there is need to address this iss ue now oios understands that steps were taken to customise some of these tasks in msrp 9 oios is aware that implementation of this matter is in progress involving both dfsm and the msrp team unhcr explained that additional training had been provided to users they added that the cost of customisation for the i nterim period would greatly exceed the cost or additional manual work and would the limited ms rp technical resources at the expense of the field rollout the finance and treasury sect ion would therefore continue to require temporary staff to deal with the exceptional level of manual work oios trusts that the required staff resources will be made available as long as extensive manual reconciliation is required as the issue is being dealt with reco mmendation is raised b reports 10 number of essential reports which had been vailable from fmis had not yet been made available in msrp examples include the statu tory reports of unhcr ageing of receivables for drrms the cashbook report for trea sury and project budget and expenditure variance reports at the account subit em level such reports are essential for 3 managing unhcr activities and should have been deve loped at the very beginning oios noted that one year after going live these reports are still not available limiting unhcrs ability to effectively manage its resources and mon itor their use recommendation head2right the unhcr management system renewal project team in cooperation with the division of financial and supp ly management should develop certain key reports requ ired to effectively manage unhcr resources and monitor thei r use rec 01 11 unhcr stated that implementation was underway and t hat emphasis was placed on the development of set of standardized integrated rep orts particularly as all users may not feel comfortable in mastering the peoplesoft reporting t ools oios appreciates the clarification provided and will close the recommendation upon rec eipt of list of standardized integrated reports available for monitoring control and decis ionmaking c implementing partner coding and mapping 12 unhcr programme implementation is decentralised until the complete rollout of msrp to the field field offices will continue to u fmis field fobs and send the programme documents to dfsm and the bureaux once t he director of the bureau approves the lois they are issued to representatives who ar empowered to enter into subproject agreements or change the implementing partners loca lly without seeking additional approval from headquarters 13 the introduction of msrp has added restrictions to this process as and when new subproject agreements are entered into with partne rs which were not included in the initial lois or supplementary agreements are concluded wit h budgetary revisions this information needs to be forwarded to headquarters to update msr p to ensure that field and headquarters budget information match such process required tha t the budget section created the implementing partner codes and mapped them to the r elevant projects oios reviewed instalments paid to implementing partners and relat ed project costs and noted the following implementing partners that were paid instalments b ut had budget recorded in msrp total payments in this category amounted to us 58 million implementing partners that had budgets but were pai d instalments in excess of the budgets recorded in msrp total excess payments am ounted to us 44 million implementing partners that had budgets aggregating to us 67 million but did not receive any instalments 14 significant cases of budgetexpenditure mismatc h included the implementing partners qandil iraq expenditure us 24 million the salv ation army uk expenditure us 14 million and the ministry of health eritrea expen diture us 12 million there was fobs budget recorded for these implementing partner s the budget section explained that 4 the msrp team carried out the mapping exercise in arly 2004 and pointed out that qandil iraq 1125000 and qandil sweden 1245011 were one and the same though they have two codes the budget section also explained that in t his case instalment payments of us 24 million were recorded against one code while the ip r data had been recorded against another according to the budget section the same s cenario would hold good for another implementing partner the salvation army who recei ved an instalment of us 14 million 15 consequently there is risk that some of the implementing partners have more than one code it also appears that msrp lacked sufficient validation controls that would prevent iprs from implementing partners being uploaded without m atching outstanding instalments oios appreciates that such inconsistencies cannot be ful ly eliminated until msrp rollout to the field is complete and the stand alone legacy syst ems have been discontinued 16 in the transitional period it is important tha t dfsm and the division of operational support dos establish procedures to ensure budget s and other financial data agree whether they originate from the field level or headquarters moreover the development of exception reports to easily identify such differences in msrp data would be beneficial and should ensure that corrective action is initiated timely recommendation head2right the unhcr division of financial and supply manageme nt and the division of operational support should establis h procedures for the transitional period for the recording of pr ogramme budgets to ensure matching of budgets and other financial d ata at the field level and headquarters rec 02 17 unhcr confirmed that the problems with ip payments without budgets with budgets and instalments and instalments in excess of bud gets had been addressed they stated that due to procedural changes such situations were unl ikely to recur in 2005 further unhcr considers that existing project related policies an d procedures were but required greater compliance oios appreciates the clarifications provided and wi ll close the recommendation upon receipt of information how compliance in this area will be monitored d project monitoring system 18 so far msrp lacks the functionality to facilit ate project closure and track information on subproject agreements including amendments sup plementary agreements status reports and audit certification such functionalit was available within fmis to work around this problem some desks developed adhoc li sts excel to ensure that information on 2004 subprojects was kept uptodate 19 also to continue tracking the project document s relating to 2003 and earlier as well as to facilitate their closure the division of inform ation services and telecommunications dist developed separate webbased application c alled project monitoring system pms the software was available from mid2004 but it s not been extensively used as the application has links to the msrp finance module therefore the closure exercise has become more complex than it was under the legacy sy stem fmis 5 20 for example over 1400 subprojects initiated in 2002 were still open at the end of 2004 in addition oios noted that another 3900 s ubprojects relating to 2001 and earlier years remained open in the past there was dedi cated team in the finance section to handle project related transactions clearance of x21 and project closure this team was dissolved when msrp was introduced in january 2004 and the re sponsibility for all project related transactions including project closure was moved t each accountant to streamline accounting responsibilities the finance section staff indicated that the projec t closure exercise was long and timeconsuming coupled with various other difficulties linked with the introduction of msrp and other priorities in the finance section during 2004 during 2004 finance section only closed some 25 projects with 154 subp rojects from the period from 2001 to 2003 of the 61 projects with 433 subprojects appr oved for closure by desks 21 missing data or outstanding balances may explai n the relatively few project closures in 2004 as well as the absence of logical link betwee n the financial data outstanding instalments in msrp and the status of reports in p ms hence project closure activities did not have the necessary impetus and this may become serious issue if not properly addressed 22 on test basis oios matched the instalments pa id in fmis for three subprojects implemented in 2003 in azerbaijan burundi and afgh anistan with the ipr data and the refunds received as recorded within msrp such an exercise was timeconsuming and cumbersome as data from three different systems had to be compared msrp pms and fmis archives however similar data comparison failed on 2002 subprojects in guinea and needed intervention from dist to avoid different interpretations of the data and to avoid confusion dist has recommended some modifications to the pms recommendation head2right the unhcr division of financial and supply manageme nt should address the high number of unclosed projects from 2003 and prior years identify bottlenecks and adjust it s project closure policies until msrp is fully operational and capabl of handling smoothly such closure rec 03 23 unhcr has confirmed the need to close the numerous 2003 and prior years projects which required temporary staff to deal with the bac klog oios will keep this recommendation open until reasonable level of pro ject closure for 2003 and prior years has been achieved 24 as pms only provides data to assist with closur of projects from 2003 and earlier years dfsm needs to plan and formulate strategy for 2004 and later project closure until the completion of the field rollout recommendation head2right the unhcr division of financial and supply manageme nt should formulate and put into motion strategy for closing 2004 and later projects until msrp is fully operational rec 04 6 25 unhcr stated that dfsm was working with the msrp am on solution to deal with the 2004 and future project closure oios appreciates that the issue is being dealt wit h and will close the recommendation upon confirmation tha t that the new implementing partner recording functionality has been released and is op erational b various accounting and financial issues subseque nt to msrp implementation fmis field data upload 26 the finance section receives monthly data extra cts in text files financial transactions processed by the field offices from over 170 field locations by email this information alone results in the need to upload nearly 3000 text fil per year it is very cumbersome task and open to the risk of error oios was concerned that there were insufficient internal controls over the receipt and upload process of data to msrp to ensure the validity and integrity of unhcrs financial data 27 the text files received from the field offices are stored in shared folder with the original email submission the shared folder can be accessed by number of persons while text files are the most portable format and are com patible with nearly all computer applications they can be easily opened and there i s risk that the data could be accidentally changed it is important therefore that sufficien t compensating controls are established further although register was maintained to reco rd the receipt of monthly extract files the date of receipt was not documented frs explained that as the original email submissio n was kept separately the risk of loosing data was nimized 28 from the five unhcr country offices selected by oios for an indepth review sierra leone kenya burundi yemen and italy oios found some variances between the figures uploaded to msrp and the information recorded on th cashbooks review of small part of the population six per cent resulted in the fo llowing issues balance of us 39131 with bank in burundi was shown in the burundi fmis records but not in the msrp general ledger g l upon further inquiry it turned out that the balance had been co nsidered doubtful and provision in the accounts had to be made however rather than recording the bank balance and the corresponding provision parately in the gl the balance was only recorded as miscellaneous receiv able oios considers this accounting treatment as incorrect furthermor while the variance turned out to be an accounting issue the absence f proper reconciliation left this issue unnoticed the finance section explained that it had transferred this balance to accounts receivable as it did not have reasonable expectation of recovery bank account in kenema suboffice cash book sl1l in sierra leone showed difference of leones 53 million us 200 0 between msrp gl and the foas cash book balance in the field the finance section explained that this difference had surfaced due to foas system problem 7 and it continued to follow up on this matter since 2003 the foas cashbook at the kakuma suboffice in kenya was overdrawn by ksh 245000 us 3400 in 2003 the corresponding msrp upload showed nil balance in the general ledger the finance section explained that they had reviewed this matter and accordingly cleared the overdraft and closed the cashbook 29 field offices also forward hard copies of the pproved cashbooks bank reconciliation statements and other support documents to the finan ce section for review these are normally received several days after the monthly da ta extract files have been posted to the msrp gl finance section staff explained that the monthly ac counts processing could not be considerably delayed for the reason of waiting f or the hardcopy cashbook arrivals at headquarters and subsequent verifications particul arly after the decentralization of accounting functions to field offices oios tends to agree that monthly validation of t he data uploaded from fmis field would not be feasible without incurring significant delays in accounts processing however given the risks ident ified and pending the msrp field rollout data should be validated periodically preferably t wice year before the account closures in june and december recommendation head2right the unhcr finance section should verify periodicall preferably twice year the completeness and accur acy of data files from field offices that are uploaded to msrp this exercise should ensure that the msrp general ledger data mat ches with the approved cashbooks and bank reconciliation stat ements rec 05 30 dfsm explained that the proposed biannual verifica tion calendar corresponded to the routine checks by finance section the added that special msrp report had been requested to compare fmis field and msrp data posted oios appreciates the steps taken to address this issue and will close the recommendation upon c onfirmation that the new report has become available and is used for the biannual veri fication 31 some of the unhcrs ongoing emergency and speci operations afghanistan for example operate solely on cash basis there is r isk due to the delay in receiving the hard copies of cashbooks that the monthend cash balance is not correctly recorded in the consolidated msrp gl there is independent contr ol to verify the balance such as the bank reconciliation statement oios would suggest that in such situations dfsm request heads of offices to confirm and certify the monthly closing cash balance such verification will provide confidence that the msrp gl monthend balances are not understated overstated recommendation head2right the unhcr division of financial and supply manageme nt 8 should ensure that for unhcr offices that operate n cash basis conduct physical count of the cashonhand at the monthend and that certificate is signed by responsible fficer the certificate should be forwarded to dfsm to verify t he monthend cash balance to ensure it is not understatedoverst ated rec 06 32 unhcr accepted the recommendation and stated that t hey would request cash balance certificates from relevant field offices starting w ith the april 2005 accounts oios appreciates the positive response and will close th recommendation upon receipt of the instructions to field offices requesting cash balan ce certificates f payroll data upload 33 the unhcr payroll serviced close to 6000 staff in 2004 with expenditure of well over us 300 million there were two sets of payrol l data regular payroll comprising of headquarter staff and all professional staff and b field staff national staff in different countries the unhcr payroll section uses legacy software to process payroll transactions the monthly payroll data is transmitted to the fina nce section in four text files for upload to msrp the payroll section informed oios that ma jor discrepancies or problems in the data they provided had been communicated to them 34 on receipt of the data from payroll the financ section carries out coding checks and performs budget validations prior to posting it to the general ledger oios noted that the finance section accepted the electronic files from the payroll section and assumed the data to be correct apart from reconciling regularly the sa laries payable clearing account however there was confirmation that global reconciliat ion was performed on the payroll data 35 oios noted that normal data upload procedures w ere not followed the finance section and the msrp project team explained that particular upload controls existed in the past and the payroll data upload process to ms rp was simply continued as before as the existing human resources and payroll legacy sys tems will continue to be used until 2006 at least and considering the significant expenditu re recording normal data upload controls should be performed the payroll section should at least provide to the finance section along with the electronic data basic control total s like the number of recordslines hash totals of various columns value totals etc for th data in the electronic files recommendation head2right the unhcr division of financial and supply manageme nt should ensure that the payroll section provides for the electronic file transfers summary report on the contents of the data to the finance section to facilitate data comparison and r econciliation rec 07 36 dfsm accepted the recommendation and will specify dditional reporting in collaboration with the payroll section oios appreciates the positive response and will clo the recommendation upon receipt of confirmation tha t payroll section provides summary report to facilitate the comparison and reconciliat ion for electronic file transfers 9 37 oios noted inconsistencies in the payroll data in the msrp gl system test on certain entitlements showed different results betwe totals from the payroll calculations in the earning and deduction register edr which is accounted within the gas legacy system and the msrp gl data for example difference of as much as us 37 million existed between the 2004 mobility and hardship allowances object code 621140 calculated by payroll and the totals in the corresponding object of expenditure codes in msrp gl similar differences also existed on other allowancesentitl ements such as repatriation grant code 621630 and commutation of accumulated annual leave code 621620 finance section could not explain these differences but indicated t hat the msrp gl should be compared to the gas trial balance and not with the edr 38 upon further research to explain the above vari ances oios noted that substantial amounts were not recorded under the various entitle ment object codes but were lumped under global object code 620320 which is for common st aff costs temporary assistance previous code 032 under fmis oios assumed tha t such accounting treatment resulted from the great number of staff costs not covered der established posts such as siba during 2004 as much as us 77 million over 20 per cent of annual payroll was recorded as temporary assistance under object codes 620310 and 620320 therefore any queries or management information extracted from the msrp obje ct codes for common staff costs allowances and entitlements provided inaccurate r esults also the real cost of temporary assistance remained invisible and was not easy to xtract unhcr managers who may need relevant information from the related object codes should be aware of this lapse 39 dfsm may want to take advantage of the msrp cap acity and create new object codes for siba costs and others that are lumped with the temporary assistance codes so that more accurate information will be available on expenditu re patterns and related total costs recommendation head2right the unhcr division of financial and supply manageme nt should initiate modifications to the code mapping b etween the gas and msrp gl systems to ensure that reports on c ertain payroll elements recorded in msrp gl provide fair picture of the actual expenses rec 08 head2right the unhcr division of financial and supply manageme nt should request the msrp team to create additional bject codes to be able to account more accurately for salaries and common staff costs rec 09 40 unhcr generally agreed with the recommendations and stated that more workable interim solution required the combined efforts of t he various offices involved in the longer term the msrp hrpayroll module was envisaged to p rovide fully integrated realtime reporting oios appreciates that efforts will be made to find more workable interim solution and will close the recommendation upon rec eipt of information on the interim measures taken 10 41 the budget section is responsible for correctin g payroll related posting errors in the general ledger like for example correcting expendit ure charged to incorrect cost centres the budget section made the adjustments based on the d ata in the dollar history to adjust salaries and entitlements that were incorrectly cha rged to different cost centres the budget section assumed that the data in the dollar history edr file was correct further there was adequate audit trail of changesadjustments made as the vouchers processed by the budget section had unique identifiers oios suggested t hat the msrp team address this issue to ensure there is facility to track the adjustments made by budget section in the msrp gl recommendations head2right the unhcr management system renewal project team sh ould assign distinct identifiers to the adjustment journ als processed by the budget section to facilitate the tracking of ad justments rec10 42 unhcr explained that this functionality had been pr ogressively activated since the last quarter of 2004 oios appreciates the measures already taken and wi ll close the recommendation upon confirmation that the new funct ionality assigning distinct identifiers to the adjustment journals has been fully implemented g undpunv account reconciliation 43 unhcr records in three ledger accounts transact ions relating to service clearing accounts sca previously known as iovs of undp n ew york and unv bonn for 2004 total unhcr payments through undp amounted to about us 18 million the normal procedures were that undp field offices record the expenses of volunteers working for unhcr with undp headquarters extracting the relate d global financial information to provide monthly expenditure report to unhcr fro m the information received the finance section records the transactions in suspens accounts and provides details of the cost to each field location only when the field office concerned has confirmed the charge to be correct it is recorded as expenditure in the local fmis system 44 due to difficulties with the implementation of undps new atlas system the reports received by unhcr included number of errors also as of november 2004 undp had only provided details for us 8 million paid in adv ances due to this discrepancy unhcr was unable to forward timely and proper information to field offices for subsequent fmis recording consequently the expenditure recording by unhcr was delayed and remained incomplete 45 unhcr informed that by yearend us 135 million ou t of us 18 million had been verified and recorded as expenditure reducing the outstanding balance to some us 45 million unhcr also stated that undp had yet to pro vide the final global service clearing accounts file for 2004 incorporating any missing 2 004 expenditure unhcr has and is continues following up with undp both at the workin g and at the senior management level 11 oios understands that this situation arose from pro blems with the implementation of undps atlas system given the significant reductio n of the outstanding balance at yearend and in view of the ongoing followup oios does not raise recommendation at this stage h travel expenditure 46 unhcr headquarters staff travel transactions co ntinued to be processed through the unog legacy system during 2004 with data subsequen tly uploaded to msrp commitments were frequently liquidated by payment f advances to staff or the payment of other authorized expenses sometimes from field off ices field offices recorded transactions in fmis and when the details were submitted to headqua rters in the monthly text files they were posted to suspense accounts and subsequently transf erred to the unhcr travel unit for processing 47 due to cumbersome transmissions of data between msrp fmis field and the unog legacy system transactions in transit accumulated this had resulted in an understatement of travel expenditure by some us 11 million at the d of november 2004 special effort by finance section had brought this balance down to so us 130000 before the yearend closure oios is satisfied with those results and consid ers them to be at an acceptable level further as from january 2005 travel related paymen ts are made from msrp i outstanding commitments 48 as special preparation for msrp all unhcr off ices were requested to establish list of valid outstanding commitments by 31 december 200 3 which amounted to some us 85 million the related liquidations were rather slow in 2004 by november some us 19 million 22 per cent were still outstanding by earend five purchase orders amounting to some us 5 million had to be retained therefore th ey were reobligated to be still valid in 2005 49 major part of such yearend commitments is rmally liquidated through direct payments during the first three months of the follo wing year finance section had set 30 june 2004 as target date to review and liquidate oblig ations that were still listed but longer needed the finance section explained that due to various ther priorities particularly the msrp implementation the review and clearing of obl igations longer needed were only completed just before the 2004 account closure the effect of the late liquidation of these obligations was that us 14 million was blocked dur ing 2004 and was temporarily not available for other operations j implementing partner reporting 50 financial information received from

that ipr data from qandil iraq was uploaded against qandil sweden from the past experience oios noted that the final spmrs were not always available with the concerned bureaux though their ipr data

far as pledges received for future periods re concerned fmis which was not capable of opening general ledgers for multiple yea rs could not handle such pledges they were therefore recorded only by drrms on their sta ndalone system and not reflected in the general ledger nor disclosed in the unhcrs financi statements since the amounts involved could be material for 2005 activities the total amount pledged at the donor conference in december 2004 was us 400 million t hey should be appropriately disclosed in the financial statements 55 msrp offers facility to open general ledgers for
