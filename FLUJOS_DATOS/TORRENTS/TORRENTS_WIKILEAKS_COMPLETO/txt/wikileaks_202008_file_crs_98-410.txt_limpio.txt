expenditures excise taxes duties gifts and miscellaneous receipts are other sources of federal revenues offsetting collections are not classified as revenues but instead are treated as negative spending ie as noted above deducted from gross budget authority and outlays budget deficit or surplus the difference between government revenues and outlays in fiscal year equals the budget deficit or surplus budget deficit results when outlays exceed revenues budget surplus results when revenues exceed outlays what is counted as government revenues and outlays however depends on the presentation of the federal budget the federal budget typically is presented in the form of the unified budget reflecting unified budget deficit or surplus the unified budget or consolidated budget includes the revenues and outlays of all budget accounts including federal funds and trust funds regardless of whether they are designated in law as onbudget or off budget the unified budget represents

presents an onbudget deficit or surplus and an offbudget deficit or surplus the onbudget deficit or surplus includes all accounts not designated in law as offbudget the offbudget deficit or surplus includes those accounts designated in law as offbudget currently there are three accounts designated in law as offbudget the federal oldage and survivors insurance trust fund social security retirement the federal disability insurance trust fund social security disability and the postal service fund debt the gross federal debt almost all of which is subject to statutory limitation

budget deficits over the years usually analysts use the debt held by the public as the measure of the impact of the federal governments borrowing on the economy it is this portion of federal debt that not only reflects the amount of the nations wealth invested in federal government securities rather than in private investment but crs3 also determines the level of real resources the government must acquire to make interest and principal payments the debt held by government accounts is the total net amount of federal debt issued to specialized federal accounts primarily trust funds it represents internal transactions of the federal government for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98410
