banks the amcs have sold someportfolios of npls to foreign investors at steep discounts the international community has stake in chinese financial reform for three primary reasons the first reason is to prevent contagion to keep the failure of chinese banks from touching off global financ ial turmoil in the same manner that the failure of several finance companies in thailand ignited the 199799 asian financial crisis the second reason is associated with the political turmoil that could ensueshould the chinese economy fail indonesia and argentina are two examples of whatcan happen to society

during the great leap forward or cultural revolution would have direct impact upon the rest of the world the third reason is to ensure that china opens its financial markets in accord with its wtoobligations since the initiation of the economic reforms in 1978 china has acted to implement number of changes to open the economy and move further away from central planning even though many have critic ized the pace of change as being too slow considering their starting point th chinese authorities have made significant progress although they still have long way to go and are faced with competinginterests while attempting to introduce more market forces and efficiency into their economy they continue to subsidize ailing stateowned enterprises for political and other reasons they would like to clear the banks of excess npls but fear the resultant rise in unemployment and social distress that might occur the need for china to change its financ ial system to make it more market

response to the asian financial crisis th at began in 1997 beijing decided to pursue expansionary monetary and fiscal policies in order tomaintain the high growth rate of the ec onomy with this objective in 1998 the pbc reduced its discount rate and the interest rates on deposits and loans of financialinstitutions three times following three previous cuts in 199697 according to bank of china estimates the three interest rate cuts in 1998 saved enterprises over 83 billion yuan 10 billion in interest charges during the following year 21 in 1999 countering deflation remained the main fo cus of chinese monetary policy and the bank cut interest rates seventh time in june1999 this reduced the pbcs interestrate on loans to financial institutions from the may 1996 level of 1098 to 324 in june 1999 where it remained through 2001 the lending rate for short andmediumterm loans by banks consequently fell from 12 in april 1996 to 324 in june 1999 22 introduced first in 1984 the pbc has vigorously used changes in reserve requirements of financial institutions as an instrument of monetary policy in 1989 an additional excess reserve requirement made it obligatory for financialinstitutions to keep in reserve an amount equivalent to 5 to 7 percent of theirdomestic currency deposits furthermore each branch of financial institution wasrequired to keep its reserves on deposit in branch of the pbc at the same administrative level in order to meet th is requirement bank branches often resorted to borrowing on the interbank loan market which was not always readily availableto them as result the bank branch tended to keep high excess reserves monitoring of the reserves under this frag mented system proved to be cumbersome and somewhat wasteful hence in 1998 the pbc decided to allow banks to meet the reserve requirement on consolidated basis 23 in 1998 the pbc reduced the required reserve ratio from 13 to 8 percent and again to 6 in november 1999 the bank re quired that the liquidity created by the cuts in the reserve ratio in 1998 be used for buying special government bonds in 1999 however the bank allowed the nearly 200 billion yuan 24 billion worth ofliquidity created by lowering th reserve ratio to be used at the discretion of the financial institutions 24 as for open market operations buying and selling government securities from 1993 the pbc

1995 however it also began to use open market operations for debt management and for government borrowing initially open market operations were kept to relatively small scale the pbc bought and sold its own bank bills to reduce surplus liquidity in some areas and to redistribute the funds to other areas in 1995 the pbc in addition to using its own bills began to use treasury bills with maturity of less than one year and policybasedfinancial bonds as instruments for its open market operations 25 during 1998 the pbc carried out 36 open market operations by which it injected 701 billion yuan84 billion of base money into the system 26 in 1999 such operations increased the monetary base by 192 billion yuan 231 billion which accounted for 52 of the annual increase in the monetary base the buying of foreign exchange by thebank added another 1013 billion yuan 122 billi on to the monetary base thereby creating total of 2933 billion yuan 353 billion an amount equivalent tonearly 80 of the annual growth of the monetary base 27 in addition to these three main instru ments of monetary policy the pbc uses other requirements such as the loandeposit ratio and limits on legal lending toregulate the money supply it also uses mo ral suasion extralegal pressures quite effectively to influence bank behavior b ecause the main financial institutions are owned by the state weaknesses of the chinese banking system when compared with banks in industrialized countries or to international standards chinese banks have some majo r weaknesses most of the problems have been caused by years of central planning in which banks were an intermediarythrough which the central government carried out its national plans as the economy has become more open market oriented less dependent on dir ection from beijing and more reliant on equity markets china s banks are being compelled to transform themselves from conduits for government subsidies into financial institutions subjectto international standards and market pre ssures this has exposed several weakness including 1 relatively low capitalasset ratios 2 declining networth 28 of state owned banks 3 insufficient provision of

problems and risks he listed the major problems as the excessively large proportion of savings in the moneysupply rmb 54 trillion out of rmb 105 trilli on the high leverage ratio of the stateowned enterprises the high ratio of nonperforming loans of the statecommercial banks and the insolvency of handful of small and mediumsizedfinancial institutions 30 as judged by western financial rating

support for the bank of china and industrial commercial bank ofchina for example are bbb 31 moodys bank financial strength ratings which assess intrinsic strength without outside s upport place the bank of china as d and the industrial commercial bank of china as e32 these ratings are low and imply that the banks are likely to require government assistance at some point there are two major approaches to asse ssing the problems with banks in china the first is to evaluate the probability of insolvency and assess the probability and effectiveness of intervention by beijing the second is to evaluate the effects of the banking problems in view of chinas obligations to the world community and theoperation and growth of the chinese economy insolvency those who frame chinas banking problems in terms of the probability of bankruptcy of the system or widespread banking panic view the risks as relativelylow because of the chinese governments involvement in the economy in essence this argument rests on the fact that si zable proportion of the nonperforming loans never were intended to be repaid anyway they were government subsidies funneled through stateowned banks to stateowned terprises intended to carry out the goals of the planned economy or to accomplish othe r state priorities such as maintaining employment the fact that the loans have become nonperforming is notsurprising to either the lenders or the borrowers since most of the lenders did notexpect the loans to be collectible even at the time they were first made they were policy loans

criteria an 8 capital ade quacy ratio means that the ratio of capital to assets must be 008 or higher loans are counted as assets so that loan with risk weight of less than 100 10 implies that bank

strengthening the banking system in china issues and experience bis policy paper no7 october 1999 p 73under this framework it can be argued that banking concepts developed for privately held commercial banks should not apply directly to chinas stateownedbanks even under the basle accord for estimating the capital adequacy for banksthe degree of risk that can be assigned to loans to domestic public sector entities is less that half the risk for loans to private sector borrowers 34 in chinas case its big four stat eowned commercial banks hold some 70 of the countrys financial assets with thei r main debtors being large enterprises that are also stateowned the risk weights on their loans therefore would be expected to be smaller than 100 the exact number depending on the governmentswillingness to bail them out or to let them collapse in cases where beijing is likely to rescue an unprofitable soe chinese banks could require less capital to back loans to that enterprise and still meet the capitalasset ratio stipulated in the basleaccord 35 in theory one could assign risk probability to each soe depending on the importance of the soe to the governme nt the nature of the product produced and the amount of employment it provides in the face of rising unemployment and worker discontent in china soe employment has become an importantconsideration in determining

how much influence the stateowned banks have in the lendingdecisions of the other commercial banks as chinese banks have had to cope with problems of npls caused partly by policy lending they have also been confronted with corruption and purely illegalactivities by banking officers while these problems can occur in the banks of any country the potential for them in chinese banks appears particularly great because of the rapid transition to market economy relatively new oversight methodsregulations and institutions and culture of corruption that the chinese government is attempting to

its lowcost and plentiful labor other asian economies such as south korea and thailand however havediscovered that lowcost labor does not stay lowcost for long and uneconomic investments in officebuilding constructi on real estate ventures and unprofitable business ventures can drag down whole ec onomy an indicator of this problem is the fact that domestic credit has been growing faster than gross domestic productthe domestic credit to gdp ratio rose from 87 in 1995 to 117 at the end of 1999 this means that economic productivity has been lagging behind credit expansionand opens the possibility that lending growth has been for unproductive or underproductive purposes 50 chinas banks also must become more internationally competitive since the country now is member of the world trade organization it has committed itselfto opening its banking market to foreign ba nks within five years allowing them to compete for domestic deposits by then if chinas banks still are carrying large burden of npls they will have great difficulty competing not only with foreignbanks but with new private chinese banks that are being incorporated attempts to resolve the banking problems the chinese government is tackling its banking problems through several avenues the first is by addressing the pr oblem of nonperforming loans it also is pursuing consolidation mergers and closur as well as allowing in foreign banks and some privatization nonperforming loans china is attempting to resolve the problem of nonperforming bank loans through two avenues the first as mentioned above has been to place lending ona more commercial basis and to channel socalled policy loans through special policybanks this is an attempt to reduce the probability that future loans will go sour the second approach is to reduce the curre nt accumulation of npls being carried by banks the target for chinese banking polic is to bring the level of nonperforming loans in the state commercial banks to the level in developed countries within three to five years after chinas entry into the world trade organization december2001 countries usually take either or combination of three approaches to npls

perspective p 910 52 ibid p 11provide assistance to debtors or 3 interv ene directly and take over and manage the problem assets bad loans of banks51 in the first approach the government trie s to relax various kinds of restrictions on the banks with regard to reserve require ments loan classification and loanloss provisioning for instance during 1995 and 1996 the south korean governmentrelaxed the provisioning requirements for nonperforming assets and for losses onsecurities portfolios in 1998 the malaysian government lowered reserverequirements and relaxed restrictions on lending to the property and equity sectors in the philippines the government lowered the requirements regarding the reservesagainst bad loans such regulatory forb earance often achieves only marginal results and in many cases the problems worsen the policies of regulatory forbearance are often supplemented by financial assistance particularly in the form of shortterm liquidity assistance through thecentral bank to the troubled banks some countries also provide longterm capital assistance in form of debentures with opti ons of being converted into equity in the bank sometimes financial assistance is geared to facilitating merger with ahealthier bank the provision of financia l assistance is often criticized on grounds of moral hazard because such policy ultimately protects bad bank managersagainst their own imprudent management since the decision to assist bank introuble is by and large po litical decision it is possible that the choice of bank to be assisted is made on the basis of th political influence of the owners of bank this happened in indonesia during the asian financial crisis similarly privatebanks in sweden complained that financial assistance primarily went to stateowned bank which used the resources to take market share away from private banks as an attempt to reduce the overhang of npls the government may try to facilitate or mediate debt restructuring negotiations some countries establishcorporate debt restructuring agencies in order to encourage voluntary meetingsbetween creditors and debtors and to obtai n independent assessments of the viability and the worth of the indebted company sometimes debtors are given financialassistance to meet their increased costs from rising interest rates or losses arisingfrom devalued currency several east asian countries such

countriessimultaneously massive capital outflows undermined the asian currencies which had been on fixed pegs causing drastic curre ncy depreciation soaring interest rates and shortages of foreign exchange the chinese financial system has some of the same systemic weaknesses of its asian counterparts bank supervision though gradually being tightened by thepeoples bank of china is lax by modern banking standards particularly in the case of the stateowned commercial banks political rather than economic and commercial considerations play an important role in decision making with regard toloans risk analysis is in its infancy and bank supervisors rarely possess adequatetraining for the duties they are required to perform the banks have high proportion of nonperforming loans and for stateowned banks low rate of return on assets and net worth that is virtually negative on the other hand china has some distinct advantages over its neighbors even during the asian financial crisis china achieved relatively high rates of growth which have continued into 2002 as indicated in table 4 however other asianhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31363crs27 77 driwefa forecastnations also had high growth rates in 199697 leading into the financial crisis high growth in itself is not sufficient cond ition to keep nation from facing financial crisis in 2001 moreover many of the asian nations registered recessionary growthrates and recovery from the global ec onomic slowdown is occurring only haltingly while chinas continued economic growth bodes well for its ability to avoid animmediate financial crisis the experience with other asian nations shows that high growth rates can drop precipitously particularly if they are based on uneconomicinvestments and government deficit spending the macroeconomic weakness that precipitated the asian financial crisis was the rising current account deficit in the troubled economies of thailand southkorea and indonesia if nations defi cit on current account reaches 4 of gdp that is warning signal that financial danger lies ahead as shown in table 4 in chinas case its current account balance at 20 to 30 billion remains positive at 2 to 3 percent of gdp as long as this acc ount remains in surplus it is unlikely that china will experience foreign exchange shortage such as occurred in thailandindonesia and south korea chinas curre nt account surplus however is shrinking and may turn into small deficit by 2004 this deficit may continue through thedecade 77 even if nation runs current account deficit it can finance it through foreign capital flows into the country this foreign investment can take the form of foreigndirect investment which goes into purchasing controlling shares of companies orestablishing subsidiaries or joint ventures it also can take the form of portfolio investment which goes primarily into noncontrolling equity shares or securities inthe case of china foreign direct investment fdi has remained high at

in east asia 50 more than the fdi received by all the east asian countries included in table 5 except for hong kong which is now part of china the primary method by which country defends against run

risen fr om 75 billion in 1995 to 158 billion in 1999 and further to 212 billion in 2001 this is huge war chest that can be used tocounter sudden downward pressures on the renminbi exchange rate in the asianfinancial crisis countries with large foreign exchange reserves as was the case withchina and hong kong were able to keep their exchange rates stable or in singapores case suffered only modest depreciation countries with insufficientreserves experienced severe depreciation of their currencies because they did nothave the financial resources to defend them 78 for china the current 200

the use of foreign excha nge reserves to counter speculators and investors who are fleeing currency in trouble exchange reserves also may becomenecessary to repay loans denominated in dollars or other international currency inthe years leading up to the asian financial crisis borrowers were obtaining shortterm international loans to fund longterm domestic lending as long as internationalbanks were willing to roll over the loans as they came due the borrowers had problem managing them many of the borro wers were quasinational banks whose debt was considered semisovereign and he nce low risk as financial institutions in the borrowing nations began to face insolv ency and their shortterm debts fell due however skittish lenders refused to roll over their loans this precipitated crisis as investors and lenders stampeded out of thailand malaysia indonesia thephilippines and south korea one indicator of risk for nation therefore is the extent of its borrowing in foreign currencies that is shortterm less than one year in this respect the chinese situation has been significantly different from its neighbors as indicated in table 6 at the end of september 2001 218 billion out of total foreign currency debt to inte rnational banks of 544 billion 401 was shortterm this amounts to about 10 of chinas foreign exchange reserves and about the level of annual current account surplus which is declining in southkoreas case in 1997 at the onset of the as ian financial crisis as much as 60 of its borrowing was shortterm for china moreover reliance on shortterm debt hasbeen risinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31363crs30 79 of course investors or businesses in need of foreign exchange for capital account transactions can circumvent restrictions by disguising foreign exchange

factor in lessening the likelihood that china will suffer from an international liquidity crisis is that its rmb is non convertible on capital account that implies that rmb cannot be converted into forei gn exchange for capital account transactions in other words rmb cannot be converted into foreign exchange without government permission for use in international transacti ons related to foreign direct and portfolio investments bank loans and deposits t he rmb is convertible for current account or trade transactions79 another factor for stability in the chinese banking system is that it allows citizens to hold foreign currency accounts the banking system therefore is able to keep foreign exchange within the system and thereby domesticate capitalflight 80 citizens with dollars for example can simply deposit them in their chinese banking accounts rather than use swiss or other international account according to the peoples bank of china the forei gn exchange deposits in the chinese banking system amounted to 1137 billion at the end of june 200081 this sum alone was almost twice as much as the claims of international banks on chinahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31363crs31 the risk of an external liquidity crisis for china therefore currently seems low but might arise if the worldwide rece ssion and import liberalization required by entry into the world trade organization pushes the countrys current accountsubstantially into deficit prolonged recession also could reduce the inflow offoreign capital china therefore would have to depend on its foreign exchangereserves which now are ample but cannot last forever for china domestic liquidity crisis or credit crunch is less likely because the government is continuing to guarantee the bank deposits particularly in the stateowned banks as long as the economy is growing at reasonable rate chinese depositors have reason to loose confidence in the banking system equity andbond markets are still relatively underdevel

education and health further increase the incentive for households to savemore the prospect of buying ones own house which the government is promoting may provide further incentives to save more in fact the regular flow of deposits into chinas financial institutions is rising at rates higher than the rate of growth of gdp despite the various problems of chinese banks their deposits continue to grow the chinese banking system is by means illiquid
