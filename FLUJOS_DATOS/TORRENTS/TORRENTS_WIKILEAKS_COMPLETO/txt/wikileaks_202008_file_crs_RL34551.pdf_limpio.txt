assesses their similarities and differences with respect to selected factors supporters of sunset commission measur suggest that there are too many overlapping and ineffective fe deral programs that contri bute to the growing federal deficit and that the existing structure of congressional committees does not encourage systematic review of similar agencies and programs according to sunset proponents congressional revi ews of many programs are sporadic and inadequate as evidenced by the number of unauthor ized appropriations an actionforcing mechanism such as threat of termination is necessary sunset commission would assist congress in performing its oversight function th ereby reducing fraud waste and abuse critics of the sunset commission measures counter that such bills would burden congress with tremendous workload for mandatory reauthorization of agencies and programs consequently such measur may prove infeasible to carry out or alternatively result in perfunctory reviews sunset commissions might increase congressional personnel costs since additional staff would be needed to assist the commission in its review activities opponents further contend that the review and reauthorization process would pose special threat to certain kinds of programs such as those which provide safety net for the most vulnerable in society this report will be update d as

mechanism carrying the ultimate threat of elimination and framework or guidelines for the systematic review and eval uation of past performance1 in 1976 colorado became the first state to enact sunset law by 1982 sunset measures had been considered in all 50 state legislatures and 36 states had enacted some version of the sunset review process representing remarkably rapid diffusion of state innovation2 however state experiences proved to be mixed by 1990 12 of the 36 states with sunset laws had ceased the use of this legislative oversight mechanism because of high monetary and temporal costs of sunset review intensive lobbying by vested interest s unfulfilled expectations of agency termination low levels of citizen pa rticipation and other perceived problems s till the study stated results indicate that sunset has resulte d in some agency terminations and more importantly numerous substantive procedural and crosscutting modifications aimed at increasing accountability efficiency

sunset process in texas is of special interest both because it is generally recognized as one of the more active state efforts and because recent federal legislative proposals borrow from th at model the website of the texas advisory commission offers 70page guide to the texas sunset process noting that the sunset process in texas is guided by 12member body appointed by the lieutenant governor and the speaker of the house of representatives assisting the commission is staff whose reports provide an assessment of an agencys programs giving the legislature the information n eeded to draw conclusions about program necessity and workability7 according to the guide since the texas sunset process began in 1978 54 agencies have been abo lished and another 12 agencies have been consolidated for an estimated savings of nearly 7845 million8 when reviewing the accomplishments of sunset in texas however it is well to recall that the texas sunset advisory commission while ultimately saved by its supporters in the texas legislature was nearly abolished in 19939 at the federal level over 70 b ills were introduced in the 94th congress 1975 1976 proposing various sunset arrangements and sunset measures have continued to be introduced in each subsequent congre ss many hearings have been held on sunset measures and several bills have been reported but the only floor action occurred in

ency sunset commission to review and make recommendations at least every 12 years rega rding the reorganization or abolishment of each federal agency with the schedule for review to be determined by the commission the speaker of the house and th majority leader of the senate were to appoint the members each naming four congressional member s and two private citizens with experience in the operation and administration of government programs each agency was to be abolis hed within year of completion of the commissions review unless congress acted to continue the agency in september 1998 the house subco mmittee on government management information and technology held hearin g on the bill representative brady and four other members provided testimony in favor of the bill11 arguably the most serious criticism of the bill raised at the 1998 hearing concerned potential constitutional problems with the commission framework an advisory opinion from the department of justice provided for the record referenced the ins v chada decision by the supreme court in 1983 462 us 919 and concluded the following because this bill hr 2939 would allow the abolishment of statutorily created executive agency not through legislation passed in conformity with article i but at the discretion and in accordance with timetable imposed by twelvemember commission composed of eight members of congress and four persons selected by the speaker of the house and the majority leader unless congress affirmatively decides to adopt legislation preserving the agency it violates the constitutionally required separation of powers12 in 1999 congressman brady along with 92 cosponsors introduced revised bill hr 2128 106th congress modified version of the sunset commission legislation containing two noteworthy additions first new subsection was added under review and abolishmen t of federal agencies relating to extensions that would have allowed the deadline for abolis hment of the agency absent

vote of 102320 sense of the senate provision regardin g commission to review the performance of programs was included in hconres 95 as reported from conference and agreed to by both chambers16 the senate language appeared to reflect the results commission idea more than sunset alt hough neither type of commission was explicitly referenced provisions for commission to eliminate waste fraud and

key factor in concerns of constitutionality provisions relating to the establishm ent and functioning of the sunset commission in hr 3277 and in section 4 of s 1399 were very similar but the structure and language in the two bills were not identical both would have established federal sunset commission consisting of seven members to be appointed by the president in consultation with congressional leaders programs and agencies were to be reviewed by the commission at least once every 10 years according to the schedule for review proposed by the president and enacted into law the commission was to be empowered to obtain information from federal agencies to hold hearings and to consider any public ly available evaluations and assessments including those by omb the bills would have required the commission to use six stipulated criteria in conducting the reviews including cost effectiveness and extent of duplication or conflict w ith other agencies and programs the commission would have provided the president with an annua l report containing its assessment of each agency and program reviewed during the preceding year along with its recommendations on how to improve the resu lts achieved and whether to abolish any agency or program the president would have then submitted his recommendations to congress on the respective agencies and programs along with the report of the sunset commission and any draft legislation needed to implement the recommendations program or agency was to be abolished two years after the date of submission of the presidents recommendation regarding its future unless the agency or program was reauthorized or received up to twoyear deadline extension pursuant to law the senate bill differed from the omb dr aft and hr 3277 with respect to

similarities and differences among the measureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34551crs10 the bills are similar with respect to scope of coverage the two bills in the 110th congress refer to the definition of federa l agency in 5 usc 105 in all three bills however the actual coverage w ould be dependent upon decisions taken subsequent to enactment hr 3277 109th congress provides th at all programs and agencies would be reviewed at least once every 10 years but the president would propose the coverage contingent on appr oval by congress in hr 5794 and s 1731 the sunset commission would submit to

by four from outside eight members of congress woul d make up the entire membership of the bipartisan commission to be tablished pursuant to s 1731 all three bills call for the commission chai r to appoint staff director s 1731 would have the chair appoint other personne l as needed whereas the other two bills would delegate appointment of other staff to the director with regard to administrative support the two house b ills would have the general services administration gsa provide such serv ices to the commission on reimbursable basis in contrast s 1731 would author ize the commission to receive administrative support services from gsa or gao on nonreimbursable basis all three bills contain actionforcing mechanisms to terminate programs and agencies following the sunset reviews unless reauthorized in law hr 3277 would terminate programs and agencies two years after the date of submission to congress by the president of recommendations along with the report of the commission while provisions in hr 5794 would abolish an agency within one year of the commissions review absent statutory extens ion both house bills would allow for enactment of legislation extending the deadline for abolishing an agency for an additional two years s 1731 would abolish any agency or program two years after the commission completes its review absent reauthorization the three bills each specify criteria to utilize in carrying out the program reviews hr 5794 arguably contains the strongest provisions for transparency and public involvement in the sunset reviews with respect to information gathering hr 5794 requires that the fasc shall conduct public hearings and provide an opportunity for public comment on the abolis hment of the agency the fasc also shall also consult with the chairman and ranking minority member of the congressional oversight committees as well as gao and omb the administration bill provides that the sunset commission sc should hold public hearings and meetings to the extent appropriate nd consult with gao relevant inspectors general and the relevant committees in congress there is reference to public hearings or public comment in s 1731 th bill simply provides that the usasc in carrying out the provisions of the act may hold hearings take testimony and receive evidence table 1 shows two other instances where cer tain features are found in

respective commissions hr 3277 109th congress and s 1731 contain typical such sums as may be necessary lang uage for authorizations while hr 5794 would require that amounts appropriated for commission operations be offset by reductions in spending for other programs finally all three bills include sunset provisions for the commission itself under hr 3277 109th congress the commission would terminate on decembe r 31 2026 under hr 5794 on december 31 2033 and under s 1731 on december 31 2037 brief overview of arguments for and against sunset commissions supporters of sunset commission measur suggest that there are too many overlapping and ineffective fe deral programs that contri bute to the growing federal deficit and that the existing structure of congressional committees does not encourage systematic review of similar agencies and programs according to sunset proponents congressional revi ews of many programs are sporadic and inadequate as evidenced by the number of unauthor ized appropriations an actionforcing mechanism such as threat of termination is necessary sunset commission would assist congress in performing its oversight function th ereby reducing fraud waste and abuse president bush has all uded to some of these factors in support of sunset commission in his recent budget submissions advocates of federal sunset commission sometimes contend that the viability and usefulness of sunset commissions has been demonstrated in states such as texas in his remarks accompanying the introduction of s 1731 senator cornyn stated the following the bill is modeled after the sunset proc ess that the state of texas instituted in 1977 to identify and eliminate waste duplication and inefficiency in government agencies this process has led to the elimination of dozens of agencies that have outlived their usefulness and has saved texas taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars24 some figures regarding the outcome of sunset reviews in texas have already been noted with respect to the fis cal impact of commission recommendations the texas sunset advisory commission has reported estimates from reviews conducted between 1982 and 2007 indicat potential

counter that such bills would burden congress with tremendous workload for manda tory reauthorization of agencies and programs and might prove infeasible to carry out or alternatively result in perfunctory reviews sunset commi ssion might increase congressional personnel costs since additional staff would be need ed to assist the commission in its review activities opponents of sunset commissions also contend that the review and reauthorization process would pose special threat to programs serving diffuse and unorganized constituencies federal programs providing safety net for the most vulnerable in society might be especially endangered some disapproving of federal sunset commission further note that key feature of the sunset process is that programs and agencies would terminate after the submission of the commissions report nd recommendations to congress unless they receive statutory extensions this means that following congressional approval of reauthorization bill the measure would ve to go to the president in order to be signed into law if the president were to veto the bill twothirds majority in both chambers would be necessary to override th veto and extend the life of the program or agency the possibility of popular pr ogram or agency being eliminated by president with the support of one third of the house and senate arguably would represent significant transfer of power from congress to the executive branch httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34551 crs13 table 1 selected features in three measures to establish federal sunset commission feature hr
