specialist in labor economics december 23 2008 abstract this report ﬁrst examines trends in employment and job loss since the start of the latest recession it next focuses on job creation estimates associated with increased spending on infrastructure placing heavy emphasis on explaining the limitations and caveats associated with the inputoutput methodology that often is utilized to develop the estimates the report will be updated after the 111th congress convenes to reﬂect legislation that includes direct job creation provisions ie economic stimulus bills having the government raise demand for goods and services through increased federal spending for the purpose of creating and preserving jobs it will not discuss stimulus measures that give consumers more money in the hope they will spend rather than save it and that provide income support such as extension of unemployment

services and utilities as shown in table 2 these four industries reported higher employment in november 2008 than at the outset of the recession in contrast the financial activities industry began to lose jobs before the advent of the economywide downturn this mirrors the abovementioned trend in construction employment in part because real estate is component of financial activities and it like construction has been hurt by the collapse of the housing market other components of financial activities such as brokerage firms that packaged highrisk mortgages and the investors eg banks that purchased them have been negatively affected by the housing market downturn as well 2 data available at httpstatsblsgovces

information gathered from such sources as newspapers trade publications and securities and exchange commission filings the outplacement firm of challenger gray christmas reported that during 2008 companies have announced their intention to lay off increasingly large numbers of workers firms announced job cuts totaling more than one million between january and november 20083 in november financial companies announced the largest number of jobs to be eliminated 91356 driven principally by citigroups stated intention to shed about 50000 jobs worldwide in addition the blue chip economic indicators reported the consensus forecast among the nations leading business economists that firms will not expand employment until 2010 4 the 50plus economists who are employed by major manufacturers banks insurance companies and brokerage firms also forecast that the unemployment rate will continue to rise through 2009 with some expecting the rate will peak in the second lf of the year and others in the first half of 2010 to date the unemployment rate has risen to 67 from 50 in december 2007 according to bls data derived from the current population survey 5 workers who lost jobs have been an increasing presence among the unemployed group that also includes new entrants reentrants and job leavers job losers accounted for more than four of every five workers added to the ranks of the unemployed between december and november 2008 the 61 million laid off workers represented 58 of all unemployed workers 103 million in november 2008

when in response to recession congress has acted to create jobs by raising demand for goods and services through increased federal spending it often has chosen to direct the funds to infrastructure public works activities other means of direct countercyclical job creationemployment tax credits state revenuesharing and public service employmenthave been relied on much less often see crs report 92939 countercyclical job creation programs by linda levine more expansive definition of infrastructure than was used in the past is now under consideration historically public works has been synonymous with heavy and civil construction activities eg road and bridge building today it appears to include socalled green jobs although numerous studies on the emerging green economy have been released in the last several years consistent definition of green jobs exists at present green jobs seemingly are those in and related to industries that utilize renewable resources to produce their outputs eg energy generated by wind and solar technologies and jobs in and related to industries that produce energyefficient goods and services eg energy star appliances and equipment mass transit 6

creation estimates usually are developed the focus then narrows to look at two models that can be used to calculate the number of jobs dependent upon demand in the construction industry which includes road and bridge building the section ends by briefly reviewing the difficulties that researchers encounter in estimating the number of jobs supported by expenditures on green infrastructure and the consequent caution that should be taken when utilizing these public works job estimates in particular

type of economic activity has surfaced when the economy is in downturn and policymakers seek to compare the relative advantages of different stimulus options it also has arisen when policymakers want to know the impact of shifting expenditures from one federal budget category to another eg away from defense and towards social services programs unless there is an increase in total spending however the number of jobs in the labor market would remain largely unchanged7 although there are other bases upon which to develop estimates of the number of jobs created by given economic activity an inputoutput io model of the economy often is utilized due to its costeffectiveness8 an io model describes the interrelationships between industries in the production process showing how the dollar value of sale is distributed across industries at particular point in time it thus reflects how much of the purchased product comes from final and supplier industries an io table might show for example the dollar value of roof trusses produced by the veneer plywood and engineered wood products manufacturing industry and the dollar value of bricks produced by the clay product and refractory manufacturing industry used by the construction industry the output requirements from each industry must th be converted to employment requirements employment requirements are derived from productivity estimates for each industry at particular point in time the total employment requ irement associated with given type of final demand eg water reuse program is the employment in the industry producing the final product or service and in the supplier industries in other words it is an approximation of both the direct and indirect employment dependent upons upported by the economic activity it commonly is expressed as the number of jobs per billion dollars of expenditures valued in particular years dollars like an io table an employment requirements table is matrix of hundreds of columns and rows each column displays the number of jobs supported in each of the industry rows by an expenditure of one billion dollars in the column industry for example one billion dollars spent in the construction industry supports direct employmen t in the various components of that industry eg residential and commercial building highway and bridge building and indirect employment in many other industries that supply their goods and services to the construction industry eg asphalt shingle manufacturing fabricated metal bridge section manufacturing an 7 small differences in the total number of jobs could occur at the same spending levels if the economic activities to from which funds were being shifted were more less capitalintensive for example 8 another basis for estimating the impact of policy and other changes on the economy is conducting surveys according to the us bureau of economic analysis bea the advantage of the io approach to making impact estimates is the accessibility of the data sources required to develop the io model httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40080g12g152g139g561g14g152g156g156g561g138g151g141g561g11g151g143g155

productivity at particular point in time thus the jobgenerating potential of an economic activity undertaken today could differ from that of an earlier period if there were technological and productivity improvements in the intervening years similarly the estimates often are stated in terms of the number of jobs created for every billion dollars of expenditures but billion dollars spent in one year could buy less more than billion dollars spent in another year depending on changes in price levels over time there also could be differences in estimated versus actual job creation because io models assume that resources are unlimited if for example the economy was performing at fairly high level with plants operating near full capacity and with fairly few workers unemployed the actual number of new jobs might fall short of the estimate due to capital and labor constraints this is less likely to matter during broadbased economic downturn further io tables do not necessarily differen tiate between imported and domestically produced goods as consequence the domestic employment impact of expenditures might be overstated to the extent that inputs are imported similarly io tables typically do not express employment in terms of fulltime equivalents ie both fulltime and parttime jobs are counted equally thus programs which draw upon industries that rely relatively more on parttime workers eg retail trade might appear to create more jobs than programs that draw to greater extent on industries employing relatively more fulltime workers eg manufacturing

the number of jobs directly attributable to the activity the number of jobs indirectly attributable to the activity and the number of jobs induced throughout the economy as result of the activity induced jobs are those dependent upon the purchases of persons in direct and indirect jobs for example workers who are directly or indirectly employed as the result of highway construction program might spend some portion of their wages in their communities at grocery stores auto repair shops and movie theaters estimates of induced jobs or the multiplier are considered tenuous to calculate the multiplier effect one must estimate how much of the additional money earned by directly and indirectly employed workers will likely be spent versus saved the actual number of jobs created by this added spending will further depend on economic conditions eg the availability of labor the inflation rate as result there are widely varying estimates of the multiplier effect and those job creation studies that include induced employment utilize different multipliers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40080g12g152g139g561g14g152g156g156g561g138g151g141g561g11g151g143g155

of federal spending on our nations roads comes from the federal highway administration fhwa although the fhwa twice updated its 1997 analysis which estimated that 1 billion of federalaid highway expenditures plus 250 million state match supported 47575 jobs some proponents of stimulating job growth through increased federal spending on infrastructure continue to use this figure the most recent update by the fhwa to 2007 indicates that 125 billion dollar expenditure on highway construction consisting of 1 billion from the federal government and 250 million from state government could support 34779 jobs if state match is not required then 1 billion in federal funds supports 27800 jobs 9 the jobs number has decreased over time in part because of increases in the price of inputs such as asphalt and diesel fuel the fhwa breaks down the estimate of 27822 jobs per billion dollars of federal spending on highways as follows 9536 constructionoriented jobs ie jobs at construction companies working on the projects and at businesses that provide direct inputs to the projects such as asphalt concrete and guard rails 4324 jobs in supporting industries ie employment at firms that provide inputs to the industries directly providing the materials and equipment utilized in highway construction such as producers of sheet metal who supply the manufacturers of guard rails and 13962 induced jobs ie jobs thr oughout the economy dependent upon consumer expenditures from the wages of workers in constructionoriented and industrysupporting jobs thus the multiplier effect accounts for onehalf of the total estimate the fhwa notes one caveat about io analysis in addition to those mentioned above that is the job estimate utilizes the national average mix of construction materials and labor inputs specific projects and local utilization ratios will alter the estimated number of jobs supported 10 for example different combination of materials and number of workers might be required for road resurfacing projects compared to bridge building or commuter rail projects the fhwa also states that the employment figures have recently been used as justification for including highway spending in an economic stimulus package but with the exception of shortterm resurfacing and preservation projects highway funds spend out slowly with only 27 of project on average outlaying in the first year 11 9 us department of transportation federal highway administration employment impacts of highway infrastructure investment pp 1 httpwwwfhwadotgovpolicyotpspublicationshtm 10 us department

impact on employment of different policies or actions the us bureau of labor statistics bls makes available electronically freeofcharge to the public the employment requirements tables it develops as part of its employment projections program12 io and employment requirements tables developed and utilized by others often are proprietary and not made widely available the employment requirements tables are based on the official io tables for the nation that the us bureau of economic analysis bea devel ops every five years bls takes the latest national io table available from bea in this case 1997 and updates it to reflect more recent production and distribution technologies it then utilizes the updated io table and recent labor productivity data to develop an employment requirements table because the base year for the most recently published employment projections is 2006 the latest employment requirements table reflects 2006 technologies of production and distribution as well as labor productivity the bls employment requirements table provides information for the construction industry as whole the construction industry according to the north american industry classification system is composed of three major subdivisions construction of buildings residential and nonresidential heavy and civil engineering construction highway street and bridge construction and specialty trade contractors foundation structure and building exterior contractors building equipment and finishing contractors the bls employment requirements table shows 11768 jobs directly and indirectly dependent upon one billion dollars of spending on construction majority of the jobs are in the construction industry itself ie 6925 direct jobs the figure from the bls employment requirements table for construction expenditures 11768 is somewhat lower than the direct and indirect jobs figure for highway expenditures from the fhwa 13860 potential explanations for the disparity include differences in

number of jobs dependent upon green infrastructure activities presents greater challenge than estimates related to infrastructure projects as traditionally defined the basis for most data collection by us statistical agenci is the north american industry classification system naics it currently does not identify separately socalled green industries eg those that utilize renewable resources to produce their outputs those that manufacture goods which minimize energy use within naics the electric utility industry is disaggregated into hydroelectric fossil fuel nuclear and other power generation transmission and distribution such renewable sources of energy production as wind solar and biomass are not uniquely recognized they are included in the other category if harnessing the wind to produce electricity and plant material to produce biofuel requires substantially different mix of inputs than relying on coal and gasoline for example the conventional io model does not seem well suited as basis for estimating the number of jobs supported by these green activities similarly within naics building construction industry does not have unique category for retrofitting eg installing additional insulation fluorescent lighting or energyefficient heating and air conditioning systems retrofitting likely requ ires combination of inputs from supplier industries that differs from the mix for the toptobottom construction of buildings once again making use of conventional io models problematic this recognized difficulty generally is either not mentioned or how it is dealt with is not described in the analyses of green job crea tion one study commissioned by the center for american progress that is discussed in more detail below does address the problem the researchers explain that because the us government surveys and accounts that are used to construct the inputoutput tables do not specifically recognize wind solar biomass building retrofitting or new mass transit as industries in their own right they created synthetic industries by combining parts of industries for which data are available the researchers provided an example in the case of the biomass industry they constructed it by combining the farming forestry wood products and refining industries then they assigned relative weights to each of these industries in terms of their contributions to producing biomass products 14 further complicating the matter is the context and manner in which estimates of green jobs generally are presented studies often develop empl oyment projections based on differing sets of assumptions and time horizons for example the number of direct and indirect jobs some 10 or more years in the future supported by an assumed increase in the demand for energy that is met by an assumed shift during the projection period from coal to wind and geothermal power generation some reports also include induced employ ment but this is not always made clear in addition some analyses relate to particular state their results may not be generalizeable to other areas because state economys have different mixes of industries and may not be able to provide any or all of the inputs for particular green output the analyses also may express job estimates per unit of power generated by renewable resources and saved by increased demand for energyefficient products and equipment rather than per dollar of investment in green activities 14 robert pollin heidi garrettpeltier and james heintz et green recovery program to create good jobs and start building lowcarbon economy center for

estimates often are not clearly articulated which makes thoughtful review of the results very difficult for these reasons policymakers considering which if any green infrastructure programs to fund to create and preserve jobs in the near term to mitigate the recessions impact on us workers may not find helpful many green economy studies it should be noted that many of the studies by green economy proponents were not conceived for the purpose of quickly stabilizing or increasing the number of jobs in the nation or in industries particularly hard hit by the current recession job creation estimates from two organizations that have proposed broadbased green economy strategies intended in part to stimulate the deteriorating labor market are briefly described below the september 2008 report green recovery program to create jobs and start building lowcarbon economy was commissioned by the center for american progress research and educational institute it represents an acceleration of 10year program included in 2007 report capturing the energy opportunity creating lowcarbon economy the 2008 reports authors at the department of economics and political economy research institute university of massachusetts amherst who relied on io analysis estimate that almost 2 million jobs 935200 direct jobs 586000 indirect jobs and 496000 induced jobs could be created or preserved by 2year 100 billion green economic recovery program the program involves retrofitting buildings with energyefficient products and equipment extending the reach of mass transit and freight rail networks constructing smart electricgrid transmission systems increasing the use of wind and solar resources in power generation and developing nextgeneration biofuels of the 100 billion total 46 billion would be in the form of federal spending for such activities as public building retrofits mass transit and freight rail expansion and smart electrical grid development much of the remainder would be in the form of tax credits to encourage businesses and homeowners to retrofit commercial and residential buildings the authors acknowledge that not all of the green activities can contribute equally to shortterm green economic recovery program some strategies are clearly capable of delivering within year while others will require as long as two years to be implemented15 in december 2008 the apollo alliance coalition of labor environmental business and community leaders proposed the apollo economic recovery act it is an initial step toward achievement of 10year 500 billion program to create 5 million greencollar jobs which had been released in september 2008 the new initiative calls for federal spending of about 50 billion to create or maintain more than 650000 direct jobs and 13 million indirect jobs the derivation of these job creation figures is not always clear appearing to rely much of the time on spendingtojobs relationships estimated by other organizations eg surface
