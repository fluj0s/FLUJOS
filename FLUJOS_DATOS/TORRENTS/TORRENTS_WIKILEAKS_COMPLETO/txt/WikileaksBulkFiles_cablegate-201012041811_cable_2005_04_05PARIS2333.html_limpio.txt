pter prel fr subject gwot assessment embassy paris feedback ref state 60796 b 04 paris 8983 c paris 280 classified by deputy chief of mission alex wolff for reasons 14 bd 1 s summary usfrench cooperation on terrorism is mature and broadbased for number of reasons including the memory of terrorist attacks in paris during the 1980s the french bring significant expertise focus and determination to their ct activities and are valued partners for wide range of usg agencies ct cooperation with the usg is largely insulated from the daytoday political and diplomatic tussles that can make the french often difficult allies notwithstanding this solid foundation post has outlined three areas where we believe our ct objectives can be better served and proposes suggestions to implement these objectives end summary mature successful relationship 2 snf embassy paris comprises one of the widest range of usg agency representation anywhere in the world many of these agencies play role in the remarkably broad usfrance security and counterterrorism relationship in addition to states consular diplomatic security economic political and public diplomacy sections that each handle pieces of the terrorism portfolio other nonstate sections in paris that deal with the french on terrorism issues include the dea the defense attache doj liaison prosecutor immigration and customs enforcement ice located in paris and in the port cities of havre and marseilles legattfbi ncis osi roal transportation security administration tsa representative and the secret service significant portion of the work of the embassys est office is now counterterrorismrelated other nontraditional securityoriented offices also contribute to counterterrorism work for example the foreign agricultural service office liaises with french agriculture authorities on biosafety risks in addition usg personnel are assigned to interpol headquarters in lyon frances second largest city 3 s two reasons for this breadth of usg representation are 1 frances own outsized role internationally and within the eu on counterterrorism issues and 2 longterm institutional desire by the gof to maintain close relations with usg ct professionals in addition to this permanent usg presence delegations from the united states often visit france to discuss specialized aspects of ct two noteworthy recent examples were doenrcnscstate visit in january on the protection of nuclear facilities and radiological materials the visit has led to the development of the multiyear program to share best practices swap observers at nuclear security exercises and collaborate scientifically to improve passive security measures for nuclear facilities also in december 2004 thensecretary of health and human services tommy thompson led an hhsstate delegation to g8 meeting hosted in france to engage at deeper level on the threat of bioterrorism the ongoing work of the bioterrorism experts group includes such items as best practices in protection of the food supply information sharing on zoonotic diseases licensing issues on medical countermeasures sharing of information regarding vaccine availability and the sharing of national response plans france hosted two bioterrorism conferences in april in lyon the first interpol conference devoted to this subject and whosponsored meeting on biosafety and biorisks france participates actively in these fora and sends experts to ushosted biosafetybiorisk seminars in the us 4 s internationally france is longstanding contributor of military troops and assistance in afghanistan and french admiral is regularly in the rotation to command task force 150 multinational naval force that patrols the red sea and the persian gulf to interdict the movement of suspected terrorists from afghanistan to the arabian peninsula french special forces also operate closely with coalition forces in afghanistan it is key member of the uns counterterrorism committee and the g8s counterterrorism action group and it has supported and cosponsored where possible terrorist designations to the uns 1267 sanctions committee bilaterally france recently signed two updated agreements on extradition and counterterrorism cooperation and cooperates closely on container security initiative csi and airline security issues domestically france continues to hold in pretrial detention 6 of the 7 exgtmo french citizen detainees the seventh was declared not an enemy combatant by the department of defense all six will be charged with terrorist conspiracy which has maximum sentence of ten years most recently terrorism investigating judges and prosecutors successfully argued for the conviction of djamel beghal and five accomplices arrested in 2001 on suspicion of planning to bomb the us embassy in paris beghal and his five accomplices were convicted on march 15 and all received jail sentences other significant ct operations include the dismantling of local cell of french jihadists to iraq raid on and continuing investigation of the mek presence in france the dismantling of gicm cell and the neardestruction of eta support cells in the south of france additional examples are reviewed in ref b areas to improve 5 s as noted in ref c france often appears to react differently to terrorism and radical islam depending on its distance from it within its borders the gof reacts proactively with speed and firmness elsewhere in the world it is much more equivocal political and diplomatic considerations carry substantial weight and sometimes trump security considerations good example of this is continued french intransigence within the eu on hezbollah it sees the eus listing of hezbollah as bad idea for lebanons political stability and therefore it continues to hold firm line against listing despite growing openness within internal security circles to acknowledge that hezbollah has committed terrorist acts and should be considered terrorist organization an approach that combines convincing the gof of cases merits and where necessary isolating france diplomatically offers the best chance of success although in this particular situation it will prove difficult to overcome the firm conviction of president chirac and others that designating hezbollah is bad idea nevertheless frances intelligence and security services must be persuaded by the existing evidence that hezbollah is terrorist organization presenting the gof with evidence of hezbollah involvement in terrorism in the west bank and gaza is particularly important as the gof cannot overlook hezbollahs efforts to destroy the israelipalestinian peace process having the palestinian leadership weigh in with the french at high level would be important as well up to now the french have maintained that only the us and israel are pressing them on hezbollah while the palestinians remain in the background on the issue second france must be isolated within the eu clearinghouse number of eu countries hide behind frances strong opposition but if they are peeled away france may be more amenable in general france does not like to be seen publicly as blocking consensus fact that worked to our advantage in finally convincing the eu to designate hamas 6 s the embassy believes that gap in french ct planning is its development of masscasualty emergency response the gof understands they have improvements to make and have begun to conduct exercises to build and test their emergency response capabilities however france could benefit from observing the usg crisis simulation exercises post would recommend therefore for the invitation where possible for gof official to observe usg exercises and simulations one good recent example is the inclusion of two highlevel french officials as observers to the topoff 3 simulation in the us expanding on this worthy initiative washington might consider inviting french officials as observers to other similar simulations in the us and abroad to include usg training programs with other countries such as those referenced in jakarta 4212 the french can be prickly if given the impression that they need to be trained and in addition giving them decisionmaking roles is often best avoided one way to overcome these issues is to focus on professional exchanges and invite them to observe usgorganized emergency response simulations and allow them to translate best practices to the french system in addition post will work to procure invitations for the usg to observe frenchled crisis simulations 7 s as mentioned in 1 usfrench ct cooperation is largely removed from daily political and diplomatic pressures one reason for this is that gof counterterrorism is itself separated from the rest of the government frances intelligencerelated agencies and coordinating bodies of which the dst the rg the dgse and the sgdn are primary examples all deal with terrorism although the dst has primary role domestically but their investigations and cases are guarded carefully and rarely shared with the rest of the gof similarly the renowned terrorism investigating judges led by judge jeanlouis bruguiere operate in different world than that of the rest of the judiciary in short the gof counterterrorism community is highly professional but insular and centralized in paris because of this judiciary and police services not directly involved in counterterrorism but who may play an indirect support role have largely insufficient understanding of usg counterterrorism policy and the judicialinvestigative procedures that frame this policy to replace workinglevel and upper management frances counterterrorism community draws upon the available pool of judicial and security professionals many of whom have little understanding of the us its judiciallaw enforcement system and its law enforcement organizational structure and resource allocations we need to reach these judicial and security professionals as they begin their careers and not only when they enter the counterterrorism community sometimes with alreadyformed prejudices to this end post proposes approaching the national magistrate school other professional academies and programs for already serving law enforcement officials with offers to deliver lectures on us approaches to terrorism and law enforcement we would request assistance from washington in developing these proposals although in this case results would probably not be immediate in the long run the usg would have much to gain by exposing french judicial and security professionals to the us counterterrorism and law enforcement system at an early stage in their careers leach
