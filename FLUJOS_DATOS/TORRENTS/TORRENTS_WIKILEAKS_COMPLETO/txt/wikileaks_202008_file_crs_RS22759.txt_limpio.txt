provision in the house bill httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22759 is provision designed to curb what is sometimes termed treaty shopping that is the use of the taxreducing provisions of bilateral tax treaties by firms which are not actually residents of the countries party to the treaty the provision would raise an estimated 32 billion over 5 years and 75 billion over 10 years and incorporates the language of hr 3160 standalone antitreatyshopping bill introduced by representative lloyd doggett its context is this foreign individuals and firms who invest in the united states are generally subject to flat us withholding tax on interest dividend royalty and similar income paid to them by us payers income generally subject to the tax includes payments by uschartered subsidiary corporations to their foreign parents while the rate of the withholding tax is nominally 30 it is often reduced or eliminated under the terms of one of the many bilateral tax treaties which the united states like most developed countries has signed in some cases the payment subject to the withholding tax may be taxdeductible by the payer under the corporate income tax for example uschartered corporations that are owned by foreign parent firms are ordinarily subject to the us corporate income tax but are permitted subject to some restrictions to deduct the interest they pay to their foreign parents on intrafirm debt in such cases the only tax applicable to foreign investors us income is thus the withholding tax where the withholding tax is reduced by treaty little or us tax may therefore apply to the ussource payments the provisions proponents argue that in some cases foreign investors resident in countries where the withholding tax is not substantially reduced or eliminated can save taxes by arranging to receive their us income through an intermediate entity chartered in country whose us treaty does eliminate the withholding tax if the treaty country does not impose its own withholding tax or has treaty with the foreign parents home country the intermediate subsidiary can simply pass the payments on to its ultimate foreign parent without incurring additional taxes supporters of the provision have argued that it will close what they characterize as loophole that permits foreign firms to crs3 unfairly avoid us taxes1 the house bill provides that where the withholding tax rate on payment to an intermediate foreign entity is lower than the rate for direct payment to parent firm the higher of the two rates will apply the provisions opponents argue that the measure would abrogate us treaties and reduce employmentcreating foreign investment in the united states2 also members of the congressional taxwriting committees have expressed concern about the tax committees being relied upon to provide budget offsets for other committees3 the bush administration has stated that it strongly opposes the bills taxtreaty provisions and has threatened to veto the bill for this and other reasons4 on october 15 2007 chairman charles rangel of the house ways and means committee introduced an omnibus tax bill hr 3970 the tax reduction and reform act of 2007 containing among its provisions proposal similar to the treaty provisions of hr 2419 the rangel bill however contains modifications designed to reduce the possibility of conflict with existing tax treaties the remaining taxrelated revenueraising item in the house bill provides for shifting forward of corporate estimated tax payments increasing payments in fy2012 by httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22759 05 billion and increasing them by the same amount in fy2013 in addition the bill would increase revenues ie increase offsetting receipts by imposing conservation of resources fee on outer continental shelf oil and gas leases and by repealing royalty relief for oil and gas production granted by the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 the senate conservation agriculture and energy tax bill on october 25 2007 the senate finance committee reported bill s 2242 the heartland habitat harvest and horticulture act introduced the same day by senator max baucus

taken alone the committee bills tax cut provisions would reduce revenue by an estimated 133 billion over 5 years and 146 billion over 10 years8 the taxcut items fall into four groups containing provisions related to conservation energy agriculture and an agriculture disaster reserve fund the conservation provisions are together estimated to reduce revenue by 55 billion over 5 years and 72 billion over 10 years in general the provisions provide tax incentives for various activities to conserve forests wetlands wildlife and endangered species the single largest tax cut however is the tax credit noted above that shifts the budget cost of the existing us department of agriculture usda conservation reserve program crp from the spending side of the ledger to the receipts side by permitting recipients to elect tax credit in lieu of cash payments under the crp program it is likely that for most recipients the credit would exceed the conservation payments in value because the tax credit would be excluded from taxable income while payments from the crp are taxable9 the provision would reduce revenue by total of 38 billion which would occur in fy2009fy2012 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22759 the bills energy provisions are generally group of tax incentives to promote domestic fuel security taken from broader energy taxbill approved by the finance committee in june although there are several narrow revenueincreasing items in the group together the energy provisions would reduce revenue by an estimated net amount of 405 million over 5 years and 15 billion over 10 years the single largest tax cut 11 billion over 10 years and 282 million over 5 years is new tax credit for producers of cellulosic alcohol fuel production other tax benefits include extension of biodieselfuel tax credits that would otherwise expire and new tax credit for fossilfree alcohol production revenue raising items include fivecent reduction in the ethanol fuel credit the bills agriculture provisions are set of tax benefits related to farming businesses that would together reduce revenue by 23 billion over 10 years and by 771 million over 10 years the provisions include an expansion of an existing category of tax free bonds that can be issued by state and local governments to support firsttime farmers creation of new category of taxfree bonds that would support investment in certain types of rural infrastructure and more generous depreciationrecapture rules for single purpose agricultural property eg livestock barns and greenhouses the largest tax cut is more generous depreciation rules for farm machinery and equipment placed in service before 2010 the provision would reduce revenue by 15 billion over 5 years but by 7 description of the

negligible amount over 10 years this pattern occurs because the provision has the effect of advancing the timing of depreciation deductions the bill would create trust fund that would provide disaster relief to farmers and ranchers in the case of losses not large enough to qualify for crop insurance payments the funds cost would be 51 billion all in the bills first five years it would be funded by customs revenues revenueraising provisions the bills revenue raising provisions would together increase revenue by an estimated 133 billion over 5 years and 149 billion over 10 years the single largest item is provision designed to curtail the use of tax shelters codification of the judicial economic substance doctrine that has developed in court cases related to tax shelters in general terms the doctrine denies the use of tax reducing items eg tax deductions and credits generated by transactions that do not result in meaningful change in the taxpayers economic position in general the committee proposal integrates portions of the doctrine into the internal revenue code the committees provisions would not apply unless court determines the economic substance doctrine to be relevant but when such determination is made it would apply httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22759 twopart conjunctive test to transaction requiring that 1 the transaction change the taxpayers economic position in meaningful way an objective test and 2 the taxpayer has substantial nonfederaltax purpose for engaging in the transaction in addition the proposal would apply 30 penalty for tax understatements where economic substance is lacking10 proposals to codify the economic substance doctrine have been considered by congress for number of years the senate versions of both the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 and tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 pl 109222 contained economicsubstance provisions that were dropped in conference the current finance committee provision is similar to the previous proposals in broad outline for example its twopart test but differs in some details and is estimated to raise approximately onethird less revenue than the previous proposals11 several of the remaining revenueraising items apply to farm taxation including limitation on deductible farm losses restrictions on likekind exchange benefits and increased reporting requirements each in cases where the taxpayer receives agriculture program payments or commodity credit corporation loans an additional revenue raising item would change the effective date of existing restrictions on salelease back silo transactions involving us taxpayers and foreign entities not subject to us tax under current law deductible losses relating to such transactions would not be allowable for leases entered into after march 12 2004 the proposal applies the restriction to leases entered into on or before that date 10 us congress senate committee on finance heartland
