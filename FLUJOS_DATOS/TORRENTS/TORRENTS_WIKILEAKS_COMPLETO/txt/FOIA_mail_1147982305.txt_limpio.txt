from jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu to neil roberts cnrobertsplymouthacuk subject re ipcc chapter 6 draft date thu 18 may 2006 155825 0600 cc keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno xflowed hi neil thanks for your interest in providing feedback on the draft chap 6 second order draft since the ipcc has very strict rules about all this im going to ask them the ipcc to send you an official invitation to review along with the process formal but highly efficient to follow if you could send your comments in that way it would be great help weve been asked to keep everything squeaky clean and not to get comments informally thanks peck dear jonathan please excuse for writing direct but keith briffa suggested it would be simplest i have looked through the draft chapter 6 and find it an impressive document however bullet 4 on page 62 starting global mean cooling and warming strikes as incorrect and misleading whereas the mean rate of temperature change over the pleistocene may have been 10 times slower than that projected for the next century there is clear evidence that for specific major climatic transitions global or at least hemispheric temperature changes in the past have been at least as rapid as those projected by climate model simulations and incorporated in the last ipcc report the most obvious case in point is the global warming at the start of the holocene ca 115 ka bp russell coope more than 20 years ago showed from beetles that uk temperatures rose faster than could be dated within the errors of 14c dating subsequently this was confirmed by greeland ice cores based on layer counting full glacial to interglacial in less than 100 years and by the cariacos basin marine record i have worked on varved lake records from both the tropics roberts et nature 1993 366 146148 and the mediterranean roberts et the holocene 2001 11 719734 where this climate transition was accomplished in substantially less than century in short several independent lines of evidence show that the climate system has been capable of flipping from one metastable state to another very different one over timescales that could be experienced by single human lifetime this is not an unimportant conclusion in terms of the potential for nonlinear responses of future climate to ghg forcing i also looked for supporting argument for bullet 4 later in chapter 6 but found nothing of substance in short this particular bullet seems in need of critical reassessment before the definitive version of the next ipcc reprot emerges thanks in anticipation and best egards neil jonathan t overpeck director institute for the study of planet earth professor department of geosciences professor department of atmospheric sciences mail and fedex address institute for the study of planet earth 715 n park ave 2nd floor university of arizona tucson az 85721 direct tel 1 520 6229065 fax 1 520 7928795 httpwwwgeoarizonaedu httpwwwispearizonaedu xflowed
