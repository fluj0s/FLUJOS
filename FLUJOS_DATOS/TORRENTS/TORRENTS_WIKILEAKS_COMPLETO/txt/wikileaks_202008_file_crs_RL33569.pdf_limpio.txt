mechanism and framework for the systematic review and evaluation of past performance under sunset agencies fade into the sunset unless following oversight review the legislature acts affirmatively to continue their existence for more than three decades sunset bills have been introduced in every congress1 since 1997 representative kevin br ady and others have supported the creation of federal sunset commission modeled on the sunset commission in texas he reintroduced his bill in the 109th congress as hr 32822 in may 2006 the house leadership announced plans to bring sunset legislation

the federal agency sunset commission in hr 3282 hr 2470 and hr 5766 are not true sunset measures because they lack an actionforcing mechanism whereby agencies and programs would terminate automatically absent congressional action as w ould occur under hr 3282 although technically inaccurate both bills ar often referred to as sunset measures however4 on july 19 2006 the house government reform committee held hearing on hr 3282 and hr 57665 both bills went to markup the following day and the committee voted 1514 to report hr 3282 favorably to the house hr 5766 as amended was favorably reported by vote of 1512 both votes were largely along party lines all democrats voted against both bills one republican voted with the minority on each bill representative chris shays voted with the minority on hr 5766 and representative todd platts did likewise on hr 32826 supporters of the measures suggest that there are too many overlapping and ineffective federal programs that contribute to the growing federal deficit that congress lacks time for thorough oversight of all existing agencies and programs and that the commissions would assist cong ress in performing its oversight function

abolishment of statutorily created executive agency not through legislation passed in conformity with article 1 but at the discretion and in accordance with timetable imposed by twelvemember

agency following the review abse nt congressional reauthorization agencies performing similar or related functions would be scheduled for review at the same time then the commission would commence its annual reviews utilizing the 19 criteria specified in the bill in reviewin g and evaluating the efficiency and public need for each agency by september 1 of each subsequent ear the commission would report to the president and congress and recommend whether each agency reviewed that year should be abolished or reor ganized and whether functions of other agencies should be consolidated transferred or reorgani zed the fasc would also submit draft legislation to carry out the recommendations under the sunset provisions in the bill an agency would be abolished within one year of the commissions review unless the agency received statutory extension this means that following congressional approval of reauthorization bill the measure would have to go to the president in order to be signed into law if the president were to veto the bill twoth irds majority in both chambers would be necessary to override the veto and extend the life of the program or agency the possibility of popular program or agency be ing eliminated by president with the support of one third of the house and sena arguably represents significant transfer of power from congress to the executive branch the bill would allow the deadline for abolishing an agency to be extended for an additional two years by legislation enact ed by super majority of the house of representatives and the senate the commi ssion also would report to congress on all legislation introduced that would estab lish new agency or new program to be carried out by an existing agency hr 3282 would direct the comptr oller general of the government accountability office and the director of the congressional budget office in cooperation with the director of the cong ressional research service to prepare an inventory of federal progra ms within each agency for the purpose of advising and assisting congress and the commission in ca rrying out the requirements of the act although cons titutional concerns appear not to have played major role in consideration of hr 3282 in prior cong resses similar sunset commission bills have been questioned on constitutional grounds fo r example an advisory opinion from the department of justice provided for the hearing record in 1998 suggested that unless congress were to enact the schedul for review and rmination recommended by the commission the bill would violate separation of powers7 an advisory opinionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33569crs4 8 the opinion for example found that giving commission whose members were appointed by congressional leaders the power to apply directly for enforcement of its subpoenas in the united states district courts entails ex ecutive or enforcement powers that would render the commission members officers of the ited states who must be appointed in conformity with the appointments clause or otherwise violates the separation or powers daniel j bryant assistant attorney general department of justice letter to rep dave weldon chairman

on government reform on july 20 20 06 would add new chapter 10 to part i of title 5 of the us code part i pertains to the agencies generally and chapter 9 is titled executive reorganization federal review commission might be tablished through the issuance of an executive order or enactment of joint resolution that specifies the federal programs and agencies to be reviewed by the commission each review commission would have seven members appointed by the president four of whom would be sel ected after consultation with designated congressional leaders up to four members of congress mig ht be appointed to serve as nonvoting ex officio members the bill specifies qualifications for all commission members each person shall have expertise and experience in the particular programmatic area to be reviewed by the commission hr 5766 provides that within one year of enactment the president would submit to congress schedule under which additional fede ral review commissions would be established subsequently to review all federal agencies and programs in developing the review schedule the president would provide that agencies performing similar or related functions would be reviewed at or near the same time in its review work each commission woul d consider whether the missions and goals of the programs and agencies studied by the commission are being carried out as effectively and efficiently as possible the extent to which the programs and agencies duplicate or conflict with other ongoing activities and whether reorganization of the programs and agen cies would better enable the federal government to accomplish its missions nd goals the committee substitute offered by the chairman of the government reform committee added agency rule making to the list of factors to be considered in the frcs review whether existing rules promulgated by the agencies to carry out the programs derive from specific legislative authority are being carried out as efficiently as possible or duplicate or conflict with rules promulga ted by other federal agencies and whether any agency or program being reviewed in any manner violates the constitutional separation of powershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33569crs5 9 the author gratefully acknowledges the ssistance of crs colleague christopher davis in drafting previous version of this discussion on expedited procedures 10 such language requiring introduction of proposal from the president is common component of fast track procedures congressi onal leaders regularly co mply with the rule introducing the measure by request as matter of comity between the branches within one year after being estab lished the commission would report to the president on its assessment of operations effectiveness and efficiency of the programs and agencies which were reviewed the commission might also submit to the president legislative proposal to re organize consolidate abolish expand or transfer any of the programs and agencies just reviewed within 30 days after the commission reports the president would transmit to congress the assessment and any legislative proposal sub mitted by th commissi on along with the presidents recommendations regarding th assessment and proposal expedited congressional procedures9 hr 5766 mandates that congressiona l consideration of legislation implementing commissions recommendations occur under special fast track legislative procedures cong ress sometimes chooses to pply expedited legislative procedures of this type to its considera tion of specific measures because the regular legislative procedures of the house and senate are timeconsuming and do not guarantee that given measure or type of measure will be considered in timely fashion or at all it is noteworthy however that as introduced amended in committee and ordered reported favorably hr 5766 specifies fast track procedures only for the house of representatives with respect to the senate it reads language to be provided ordinarily members of ither house may choose to introduce legislation at any time that their chamber is in session durin g twoyear congress under hr 5766 the majority leader of the house or his designee would be required to introduce the bill within five legislativ days after receipt from the president of the draft implementing measure10 but committee referral of the bill would follow regular legislative procedures congress generally does not mandate that committee act on bill referred to it within specified time frame under hr 5766 if committee does not report the implementing legislation referred to it within 30 legislative days privileged motion would be in order debatable for up to 20 minutes to discharge the panels from further consideration the scheduling of vote on that motion would be at the discretion of the speaker but would have to occur within the next two legislative days upon report or discharge an implementation bill would be placed on the house calendar following the report or discharge of implementing legislation from committee hr 5766 would make in order privilege d motion to call up the legislation on the floor when member announced his inte ntion to offer such motion to proceed to consideration the scheduling of vote on that motion is at the discretion of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33569crs6 11 under hr 5766 however this motion to disc harge seems to be in order only if the committee has reported the measure favorably or been discharged in other words whether it is intentional or not the expedited proce dures in hr 5766 appear to permit committee to kill implementing legislation by reporting it adversely because in the house legislation is normally referred to every committee that has jurisdiction over measure to the extent feasible it is unclear under hr 5766 as it is currently drafted what happens if one committee of referral reports implementing legislation adversely and the others report favorably 12 such provisions are often included in fast tr ack statutes to prevent the need to resolve differences between the versions of bill passed by the house and by the senatespeaker but again must occur within the next two legislative days11 once the house has chosen to take up the implementing legislation by adopting the motion to proceed its consideration is in sense locked in it re mains the unfinished business of the chamber until disposed of other business cannot intervene it cannot be laid aside and it must be dispos ed of before other ma tters may be taken up in the absence of special rule dictating otherwise the house ordinarily debates measures under the onehour rule in th senate debate is ordinarily unlimited except by unanimous consent by the invoca tion of cloture or by some other special procedure such as that governing budget reconciliation hr 5766 would l imit house debate on the implementing bill to 10 hours the bill also would limit members ability to delay consideration of the implementing legislation by barring amendments and motions which would or dinarily be permissible under chamber rules at the conclusion of the time specified for debate the house would immediately vote on passage of the legislation expedited procedures sometimes stipulate that if before voting upon implementing legislation ither chamber receives imple menting legislation passed by the other chamber that second measure is not refe rred to committee but is voted on instead of the first chambers measure12 hr 5766 however does not specify any expedited elements after house pa ssage the omission of such automatic hookup procedures from hr 5766 leaves open the possibility that there will be need to resolve differences between the house and senate on implementing legislation as well as the possibility that implementing legislation will die at this final stage of the legislative process although fast track procedures such as those proposed in hr 5766 may be codified in law rather than contained in the rules of the house and senate they have the same effect as chamber rules and as result are often called rule making statutes the fact that an expedited pr ocedure is contained in statute does not mean that another law must be pa ssed in order to alter it the provisions can be changed for example by the adoption of special rule from the house committee on rules by suspension of the rules or by unanimous consent agreement it is important to point out however th at the house of representatives has the ability to change its rules more easily than is possible in the senate changing senate rules is virtually impossible without the widespread support of super majority of senators as result expe dited procedures of the type proposed in hr 5766 for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33569crs7 13 rep claude d pepper remarks in the house congressional record vol 134 july 7 1988 p 17071house if extended to the senate argu ably would bind the senate far more dramatically than they do the house simply put they would remove the right every senator possesses under the rule s to filibuster legislation and to delay or prevent final vote on its passage the house may nd often does ignore statutory expedited procedures by adopting special rule from the house committee on rules laying out alternative terms of consideration13 unless strong senate expediting provisions are added to hr 5766 the fast track procedures will arguably be of negligible value the expediting elements as currently written apply only to the house which does not need such provisions to work its will comparison of selected features in hr 3282 and hr 5766 table 1 provides an overview of selected features in the two bills the following discussion highlights some differences and similarities between the measures there are parameters in the langua ge contained in hr 5766 regarding time frame for the total duration of the reviews the provisions suggest multiple ad hoc commissions with each coming into existence pursuant to an executive order or joint resolution the bill would require the president to submit to congress schedule for establishment of frcs to review all federal agencies and programs in contrast hr 3282 stipulates that within year of enactment the sunset commission would submit review schedule to cong ress providing for each agency to be reviewed at least once every 12 years hr 5766 is also silent regarding the number of commissions that might be established to accomplish the reviews nothing in the bill appears to preclude the simultaneous existence of more than one frc in contrast hr 3282 envisages the sunset commission as an ongo ing institutional body with rotating membership with respect to membership hr 3282 provides for 12 member commission half of whose members woul d be appointed by house nd senate leadership hr 5766 provides for sevenmember commissi on appointed by the president with advice from congressional leaders lthough both bills would likely ensure bipartisan commissions in that bot h democrats and republicans would be appointed the membership would not necessa rily be equally bala nced the party of the president would probably enjoy at least 52 majority on each of the frcs under hr 3282 the fascs membership mig ht be skewed 84 if the same party controlled both chambers of congress as noted already hr 3282 contains an actionforcing mechanism whereas hr 5766 lacks such provision under h r 3282 each agency would be abolished year after the completion of the sunset review unless extended by law on

set for july 27 daily report for executives july 21 2006 p a22the recommendations of the commission wher eas expedited procedures are absent in hr 3282 some might s upport the incl usion of such procedures to facilitate consideration of bill for example to extend the life of an agency due to terminate for another two years as authorized in hr 3282 thereby allowing additional time for congress to act on reauthorization bill hr 3282 also would provide for compila tion of program inventory to assist the commission and congress in the sunset review process hr 5766 is silent regarding where the president might turn for assistance in devising the purviews and review schedule for frcs which he would be required to submit to congress within year after the creation of the first frc both bills would eventually sunset the commissions under hr 5766 each review commission would terminate 90 days after submission of its assessment and possible legislative proposal to the presid ent the sunset commission established under hr 3282 would remain in existe nce through several congresses and administrations but would terminate on december 31 2030 absent reuthorization finally one might keep in mind the possibility that hr 3282 and hr 5766 could conceivably both be enacted either as separate bills or combined in single measure chairman davis noted at the hearing on july 19 that the two bills as written could become separate title s of new bill for floor consideration thereby establishing the framework for bradys longterm commission as well as tiahrts ad hoc more focused commissions14 some however might view the provisions of the bills as possibly re dundant even if not incompatible funding to cover administrative expenses of operating two ongoing commission frameworks might arguably engender resistance to the extent that some are concerned with the bills individually for ceding too much power from congress to the executive branch enactment of both bills would serv to compound the power transferhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33569crs9 table 1 selected features in hr 3282 and hr 5766 feature hr 5766 as amended hr 3282 title of bill government efficiency act of 2006 abolishment of
