the landmark 1966 case graham v john deere co of kansas city the supreme court established an analytic framework fo r courts to determin nonobviousness the socalled graham test describes veral factors that must be assessed while the ultimate question of patent validity is one of law the 103 c ondition which is but one of three conditions each of which must be satisfied lends itself to several basic factual inquiries under 103 the scope and content of the prior art are to be determined differences between the pr ior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved against this background the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject matter is determined such secondary considerations as commercial success long felt but unsolved needs failure of others etc might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter sought to be patented as i ndicia of obviousness or nonobviousness these inquiries may have relevancy5 while single prior art reference c ould form the basis of finding of nonobviousness multiple prior art re ferences are often involved in the analysis in such situation the us court of appeals for the federal circuit federal circuit had developed an approach in wh ich an invention would be c onsidered obvious only if there was an explicit or implicit teaching suggesti on or motivation that would lead person of ordinary skill to combine multiple prio r art references to produce an invention6 such teaching suggestion or motivation tsm could have come from either 1 the references themselves 2 knowledge of those skilled in the art or 3 the nature of problem to be solved leading inventors to l ook to references relating to possible solutions to that problem7 because 103 of the patent ac t requires that an inventions obviousness be determined from the standpoint of person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made the tsm test was designed in part to defend against the subtle but pow erful attraction of hindsightbased obviousness analysis8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22669crs3 9 teleflex inc v ksr intl co 298 f supp 2d 581

teleflex the patents at issue in ksr international v teleflex pertain to an adjustable pedal system aps for use with automobiles having electronic throttlecontrolled engines teleflex inc holds an exclusive license for the patent on this device that allows driver to adjust the location of cars gas and break pedal so that it may reach the drivers foot ksr international co also manufactures an adjustable pedal assembly initially ksr supplied aps for cars with engines that use cableactuated throttle controls thus the aps that ksr manufactured included cableattachment arms9 in mid2000 ksr designed its aps to incorporate an electronic pedal position sensor in order for it to work with electronically controlled engines which are being increasingly used in automobiles in 2002 teleflex filed patent infringement wsuit against ksr after ksr had refused to enter into royalty arrangement asserting that this new design came within the scope of its patent claims in defense ksr argued that teleflexs patents were invalid because they were obvious under 103a of the patent act that someone with ordinary skill in the art of designing pedal systems would have found it obvious to combine an adjustable pedal system with an electronic pedal position sensor for it to work with electronically controlled engines10 the district courts opinion the us district court for the eastern district of michigan agreed with ksr that the patent was invalid for obviousness granting summary judgment in favor of ksr11 the court determined that there was little difference between the teachings of the prior art and claims of the patentinsuit12 furthermore the court opined that it was inevitable that aps would be combined with an electronic device to work with electronically controlled engines13 the federal circuits opinion teleflex appealed the decision to the federal circuit the appellate court vacated the district courts ruling after finding that the district court had made erro rs in its obviousness determina tion specifically the federal circuit noted that the district court had imp roperly applied the tsm test by not adhering to it more strictly the district court had reached its obviousness ruling without making findings as to the specific understanding or principle within the knowledge of skilled artisan that would have motivated one with knowledge of the i nvention to make the combination in the manner claimed14 the federal circuit expl ained that district courts are required to make such specific findings pursuant to federal circuit case law establishing the tsm standard15 in regard to the patent in the case the appellate court found that the prior art in adjustable peda l design had been focused on solving the constant ratio problem described as when the

solve the problem would not motivate person of ordinary skill in the art to combine the prior art teachings here the placement of an electronic sensor on an adjustable pedal17 the supreme courts opinion the supreme court granted certiorari on june 26 2006 to review the ksr case in which the central question before the court was whether the federal circuit had erred in cr afting tsm as the sole test for obviousness under 103a of the patent act18 on april 30 2007 the court unanimously reversed the federal circuits judgment holding that the tsm test for obviousness was incompatible with 103 and supreme court precedents19 associate justice anthony kennedy delivering the opinion of the court explained that the proper framework for court or patent examiner to employ when determining an inven tions obviousness is that set forth in the courts 1966 opinion graham v john deere co of kansas city that analytical framework provides an expansive and flexible approach to the question of obviousness that the rigid and ma ndatory tsm formula does not offer20 justice kennedy observed that the graham approach as furthe r developed in three subsequent supreme cour t cases decided within ten years of that case21 is based on several instructive principles for determin ing the validity of patent based on the combination of elements found in the prior art when work is available in one field of endeavor design incentives and other market forces can pr ompt variations of it either in the same field or different one if person of ordinary skill can imple ment predictable variation it is likely obvious under 103 and unpatentable if technique has been used to improve one device and person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that it would improve similar devices in the same way using the technique is obvious unless its actual application is beyond his or her skill22 justice kennedy then provided additional guidance for courts in following these principles to determine whether there was an apparent reason to combine the knownhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22669crs5 23 id at 174041 24 id at 1741 25 id 26 id at 1742 27 id at 1741 28 id in many fields there may be little discussi on of obvious techniques or combinations and market demand rather than scientific literature may often drive design trends 29 id 30 idelements in the manner claimed by the patent at issue courts should explicitly engage in an analysis that considers the following elements the interrelated teachings of multiple patents the effects of demands known to the sign community or present in the marketplace and the background knowledge possessed by person having ordinary skill in the art23 he further explained that court should not solely take into account the precise teachings of the prior art but rather can consider the inferences and creative steps that person of ordinary skill in the art would likely use24 the federal circuits tsm test and its mandatory application is contrary to graham and its progeny because it limits the obviousness analysis and is too formalistic justice kennedy argued25 in addition he believed that the tsm test hindered the ability of courts and patent examiner s to rely upon common sense26 in dicta the courts opinion appears to imply that the tsm test coul d have contributed to issued patents or unsuccessful challenges to the validity of certain patents that do not reflect true innovation granting patent protection to dvances that would occur in the ordinary course without real innovation retards progre ss and may for patents combining previously known elements deprive prior inven tions of their value or utility27 finally justice kennedy criticized the federal circuit for overemphasizing the importance of published articles and the explicit content of issued patents28 however justice kennedy allowed that ts m provides helpful insight that patent comprised of veral elements is not obvious just because each of those elements was independently known in the prior art29 this essence of the tsm test is not necessarily inconsistent with the graham analysis and thus he pr edicted that the federal circuit has likely applied the tsm test on many occasions in ways that accord with the graham principles it is the federal circuits rigid application of its tsm rule however that the court deemed was problematic in this case30 justice kennedy identified four specific legal errors committed by the federal circuit first the appellate court had held that courts and patent examiners should look only to the problem the patentee was trying to solve rather than ot her problems addressedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22669crs6 31 id at 1742 under the correct analysis any need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of invention and addressed by the patent can provide reason for combining the elements in the manner claimed 32 id 33 id when there is design need or market pr essure to solve problem and there are finite number of identified predictable solutions pe rson of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp if this leads to the anticipated success it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense 34 id 35 id at 174344 there then existed marketplace that created strong incentive to convert mechanical pedals to electronic pedals and the prior art taught number of methods for achieving this advance 36 for example in addition to undermining the foundation of the tsm standard the ksr decision explicitly rejected federal circuit precedent that had held that obvious to try did not constitute obviousness there are some instances when obvious to try could be used to prove obviousness the ksr court ruled id at 1742 existing patents that may be vulnerable to the obvious to try assertion could f ace the prospect of being invalidatedby the patents subject matter31 second the appellate cour t had assumed that person of ordinary skill trying to solve particular problem will be led only to those elements of prior art designed to solve the same pr oblem however common sense teaches that familiar items may have obvious uses beyond their primary purposes and in many cases person of ordinary skill will be able to fit the teachings of multiple patents together like pieces of puzzle32 the third error of the lower c ourt was its errone ous conclusion that patent claim cannot be prove d obvious by showing that the combination of elements was obvious to try instead justice kennedy not ed the fact that combination was obvious to try might show that it was obvious under 10333 the final error was the federal circuits adherence to rigid preventative rules to avoid the risk of hindsight bias on the part of courts and patent examiners becau such rules deny factfinders recourse to common sense34 as to the specific patent claim at issu in this case the court adopted the obviousness analysis of the district court and expressly held that the claim must be found obvious in light of the prior art35 concluding observations the ksr decision potentially may generate litigation over the validity of some pa tents issued and upheld unde r the federal circuits tsm standard the uncertainty over the enforceability of certain patents36 thus has ramifications for lawsuits between alleged patent infring ers and patent holders as well as between patentees and their licensees for example patent licensee may want to challenge the validity of the patent to avoid paying royalties or even the imposition of an injunction while the ksr court rejected tsm as the sole test for obviousness the court did not expressly invalidate it either instead the s upreme court explained th at courts and patent examiners in evaluating patents cl aimed subject matter for obviousness under 103 must use common sense ordinary skill and ordinary creativity in applying the graham factors and principles to the specific facts of the case
