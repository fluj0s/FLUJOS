using to reduce the need for ongoing welfare is referred to as diversion diversion is typically considered to be payment program or activity that is intended to divert applicants for temporary assistance for needy families tanf benefits from completing the application process and thereby becoming potentially eligible for monthly tanf assistance welfare diversion comes in variety of forms such as lump sum payments vendor payments supportive services and resource referral in addition applicant job search is used by some states as diversion activity sometimes it is not easy to identify what diversion is and what it is not procedure like eligibility screening may be form of diversion when it is carried out in certain manner while at other times it may merely be part of an eligibility review diversion payments generally are equal to several months benefits they usually are offered as onetime payment in lieu of extended cash benefits acceptance of diversion payment ordinarily makes family ineligible for tanf assistance for certain period of time according to the latest available reported data 28 states and the district of columbia provided lump sum diversion payments to tanf applicants 16 states and the district of columbia required tanf applicants to engage in active job searches before their application for tanf was approved and 15 states were using fairly aggressive form of resource referral under the final tanf regulations nonrecurrent shortterm benefits eg diversion for crisis situations provided for more than four months do not c ount as tanf assistance since diversion is not considered tanf assistance families receiving diversion aid are not subject to tanf work requirements time limits child support assignment or data reporting requirements this report discusses welfare diversion and state use of diversion strategies it will be updated periodically as new data and information become available

past 10 years many states have develope d policies that try to divert from cash welfare assistance1 applicants who are thought to need the least amount of state help in becoming self sufficient state diversion programs consist of one or more of the following three components 1 formal diversion assistance programs usually onetime cash payment made directly to the family or to vendor for expenses incurred by the family 2 applicant job search in which applicants for the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant program are required to participate in job search program and 3 resource referral whereby intakecase workers identify other forms of assistance that may be available to family such as child care assistance transportation assistance aid from family andor friends or referral to drug treatment program this report describes formal state diversion programs the source of information for table 1 and the appendix is the state annual report on the tanf block grant program for fy2005 2 in some instances the tanf state plans submitted to qualify for federal block grant funds were used to supplement incomplete information in addition this report includes information from state data reports and state internet sites on the numbers of families being diverted from tanf assistance however this information is sporadic and the terms used by the states are not always uniform readers should note that although applicant job search and resource referral are considered diversion strategies they are not considered diversion assistance in table 1 or the appendix g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 throughout much of its history cash welfare to families represented paradox for both policymakers and the public on the one hand policymakers wanted to provide minimum level of financial assistance to needy families however on the other hand they wanted to prevent those families from falling into dependency since the late 1960s concerns over the size and cost of the welfare systemand its effects on the parents and children that it serveshave led federal welfare policymakers to promote work as path to selfsufficiency during the early 1990s many states had moved forward with their ow n demonstrations and initiatives under waiver authority in title iva of the social security act ie referred to as section 1115 waivers to promote selfsufficiency of welfare families one method that some states used to promote selfsufficiency was to di vert individuals who were either jobready or had other sources of income from becoming welfare recipients by offering them onetime financial payment as an alternative to enrollment in the now repealed aid to families with dependent children afdc program 3 according to some observers states have historically tried to keep 1 cash welfare assistance in this report refers to bene fits under the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant or its predecessor aid to families with

accomplished by warding off requests for aid by not providing program information to the public omitting information about certain program benefits or services to persons who came to the welfare office with the intention of applying for assistance speaking to people in condescending or derogatory manner asking personal or embarrassing questions requesting unnecessary documentation and delaying application interviews in addition several states offered relocation assistance to certain afdceligible families under this relocation practice some families eligible for afdc benefits were encouraged to leave the state to pursue employment opportunities in other areas or were told that an inexpensive bus ticket to another state could result in the family receiving higher monthly afdc benefits 4 in 1996 policymakers concurred with assertions that for significant numbers of poor families receipt of cash welfare had become permanent state rather than temporary phase pl 104 193 the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 signaled the end of an era it was generally agreed that mandatory work requirements together with lifetime limit on cash welfare benefits would end welfare as we know it by moving parents from welfare to work encouraging responsibility and improving childrens lives under the 1996 law eligible lowincome families with children were longer entitled to cash welfare benefit afdc instead federal funds were sent to the st ates in the form of temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant under which states have had almost complete control over program eligibility and benefits the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 does not contain specific diversion provisions nor does it contain any prohibitions against the use of diversion programs thus states are able to include diversion programs among their array of welfare related strategies if they so choose some differences between past efforts at deterrence and current diversion practices include the following 1 states on widespread basis have formally incorporated diversion programs and activities into their tanf programs 2 diversion is viewed as helping families maintain their independence from welfare 3 diversion focuses attention on familys specific circumstances and needs during the past several years as part of their diversion activities several states kentucky washington florida south carolina arkansas colorado and michigan have offered relocation assistance to tanfeligible families as substitute for ongoing tanf benefits however unlike prior relocation practices states now appear to be focused on encouraging families to move to where they may be more likely to find jobs in many instances this may be within the state rather than out of the state 5 the number of families on afdctanf dropped from high of 51 million in march 1994 to 19 million in september 2005 during the march 1994august 1996 period many states were under section 1115 waivers testing innovative approaches to reducing the welfare rolls and promoting selfsufficiency these numbers however dont highlight the number of families that were diverted from the tanf rolls before 1999 there were only couple of studies pertaining to state diversion policies and practices this is longer the situation on ap ril 1 1999 the office of the assistant secretary for

expanding the requirements that families must meet in order to be eligible for tanf benefits and referring families to alternative resources diversion programs have the potential to dramatically alter state approaches to providing assistance to poor families with children families are diverted from receiv ing monthly cash tanf payments if they can be persuaded to be assisted through other means or persuaded to use other resources before the 1996 welfare reform law and some pre1996 state waivers when families applied for cash welfare benefits the emphasis was on determining their eligibility for assistance and completing their application now in many states cash assistance is viewed as last resort and diversion assistance is viewed as positive alternative to going on welfare in states with diversion programs or activities the primary emphasis is on determining what family needs to support itself this could be onetime cash payment to deal with an emergency or minor crisis support services such as child care transportation or health care benefits or help finding job these types of services and aid may enable family to maintain its selfsufficiency without actually going on welfare 12 diversion typically is designed to be program activity or payment that is intended to divert tanf applicants from ongoing tanf benefits and instead substitute shortterm cash assistance or other services to meet immediate needs diversion payments generally are equal to several months benefits their purpose is to help families meet temporary emergencies it is generally offered as onetime payment in lieu of extended cash benefits acceptance of diversion payment usually makes family ineligible for tanf assistance for certain period of time 11 according to tanf financial data combined

payments vendor payments supportive services and resource referral in addition applicant job search is used by some states as diversion activity sometimes it is not easy to identify what diversion is and what it is not according to nathan and gais an activity like igibility screening may be form of diversion when it is carried out in certain ways while other times it may simply be part of an eligibility review13 some staff view diversion as preventing applicants from becoming recipients others view it as helping applicants find other appropriate tools to remain independent of ongoing assistance g14g158g150g153g561g21g158g150g561g18g138g162g150g142g151g157g156g561 the onetime lump sum payment approach is designed to keep families with shortterm financial need who may not need ongoing assistance from entering the welfare system the lump sum payment may be in the form of cash voucher or vendor payment under the lump sum payment approach caseworkers screen tanf applicants to determine if lump sum payment can effectively address the immediate reason for the tanf application in some cases in order to receive the lump sum payment eligible applicants must have workrelated needs directly affecting their ability to obtain or maintain employment such as loss of transportation due to needed car repairs in other cases eligible applicants can have variety of shortterm or emergency needs such as overdue rent or utility bills or child care problems onetime cash payments can help families support themselves in number of ways such payments may enable families to get their cars repaired so they can get to work make overdue rent payments so they can avoid eviction from their homes or get through medical emergency that temporarily precludes work unlike emergency assistance under afdc which generally was provided to prevent destitution and homelessness among families particularly welfare families diversion aid is provided to families who just need modest boost in income to remain off the welfare rolls according to 1999 hhsfunded report by the ge orge washington university gwu center for health policy research states early efforts to divert families from the welfare rolls focused primarily on providing families facing shortterm crises with the financial resources needed to resolve those crises because of this early focus and the widespread adoption of lump sum payment programs these programs are often perceived as the primary mechanism through which families are being diverted from the welfare system however our case studies reveal that in practice lump sum payment programs are rarely used thus unlike broadly targeted applicant job search programs lump sum payment programs are unlikely to result in widespread diversion from the welfare system 14

to engage in job search activities before they can qualify for monthly cash assistance may enable some individuals to find jobs and be diverted from the welfare rolls the mandatory job search approach requires tanf applicants to engage in job search before applying for benefits and is designed to encourage individuals to find employment quickly to eliminate their need for cash assistance in some cases the tanf applicant is diverted from cash welfare because he or she finds job in some cases because the person already has income and does not have time to engage in any type of structured job search and in some cases the applicant finds the requirements of the program eg number of employer contacts formal meeting etc too stringent or stressful and he or she abandons the idea of tanf assistance according to 1999 gwu study work first programs have formed the core of most state efforts to build an employment focused welfare system these programs characterized by their emphasis on rapid entry into the labor market encourage recipients to take the first job that comes along expecting that their first job will not be their last and that it is far easier to move into better job from bad job than from job at all applicant job search programs take the work first concept to its logical extreme they seek to encourage or require families to look for employment immediately so as to obviate the need for them ever to receive assistance in the first place 15 g20g142g156g152g158g155g140g142g561g20g142g143g142g155g155g138g149g561 the availability of support services such as child care transportation assistance and health care benefits combined with food stamps but not tied to the receipt of monthly cash benefits may sometimes be enough to enable some families to maintain their selfsufficiency without going on welfare the resource referral approach encourages tanf intake workers to explore with the applicant other forms of assistance that may be available to them such as child care assistance transportation assistance aid from family andor friends referral to drug treatment programs etc this approach is seen as byproduct of the perspective that welfare is temporary lastresort option rather than the only course of action available to the family the referral approach does not guarantee that families will obtain the services or help that they need 16 according to 1999 gwu study among all diversion activities efforts to link applicants for cash assistance with alternative resources are the least common in our analysis of state efforts to divert applicants from tanf only seven states indicated they are maki ng concerted effort to explore alternative resources with applicants before proceeding with an application for tanf as tanf caseloads fall and the pressure of time limits mounts it is possible that more and more localities will explore ways to link applicants for assistance with alternative resources providing cash assistance only when all other avenues have failed in addition to being the least utilized option for diverting applicants from the welfare rolls linking families with alternative resources is also the least understood diversion strategy possibly because as our 15 ibid p v 16 ibid p 61

with alternative resources in very different ways17 readers should also note that in the late 1990s when many states began implementing diversion programs most applicants for welfare benefits viewed tanf food stamps and medicaid as package and thereby many families who were diverted from tanf or denied tanf benefits mistakenly believed that they were ineligible for food stamps and medicaid as well18 this perception has been corrected and it is now generally agreed that it is longer problem in fact during the period fy2000fy2005 food stamp participation increased 49 from 172 million in fy2000 to 257 million in fy200519 similarly although medicaid enrollment numbers for adults and their dependent children dropped in 1996 and 1997 they have been increasing since then the number of medicaid recipients adults and their dependent children was 248 million in 1995 dropped to 239 million in 1996 and to 226 million in 1997 increased to 269 million in 1998 and reached 378 million in

complained that more people were turned away informally than were formally denied assistance21 informal diversion results when program rules and requirements discourage families who might otherwise be eligible for tanf benefits from applying for them it is reported that some potential recipients of tanf are being diverted from pursuing their applications simply by learning of the stronger work and child support enforcement requirements at orientation and that other families who expect that they will be required to explore alternative resources even though they do not believe those resources can meet their needs may choose not to bother to apply for tanf benefits 22 according to 1998 hhsfunded study by the gwu center for health policy research 17 diversion as workoriented welfare reform

york found that new york citys job center staff illegally discouraged needy people from applying for food stamps medicaid and cash assistance in january 1999 13 of 31 welfare offices had been converted into job centers according to court documents the job centers required prospec tive applicants to go through series of steps including multiple interviews with agency staff and repeat visit to the job center before they got tanf application du ring this process job center staff actively discouraged prospective applicants from applying for assistance and encouraged them to look elsewhere for support such as through food pantries family members and charities b ecause the job centers also administer f ood stamps and medicaid new york citys efforts to divert needy families from tanf benefits resulted in the deterrence or denial of applications for food stamps and medicaid the january 25 1999 ruling barred new york city from converting any more welfare offices into job centers and

as response to program rules and requirements that are intended to impose stri cter set of expectations on recipients even though potential tanf recipient has not participated in those activ ities for example some families who know they will be expected to look for work immediately or almost immediately may choose to look for work and fi nd it on their own eliminating their need to apply for assistance other families may not apply for assistance because they anticipate that they will not be able to meet the higher expectations set forth by the new program others may choose not to apply because they assume they are longer eligible under the new program rules 23 2003 study found that each of the sites ram sey county minnesota san diego county california mercer county new jersey providence rhode island cook county illinois and bibb county georgia normally requires at least two visits to th office to complete th application process providing the opportunity for applicants to drop out of the process moreover most sites also include screening interview or program orientation these activities often completed on the day of the initial visit to the office allow for preliminary exchange of information that may convince applicants that they are likely to be found ineligible that they do not want to comply with one or more application requirements or that the expected benefits from going through the process are too small to be worth the trouble the sites that have implemented applicant job search requirements have introduced an activity that has increased the burden in time and cost for applicants in fact in the site with the most stringent job search requirement cook county 62 of the study sample either decided not to apply for tanf or did not complete the application processa proportion nearly twice that of most other sites24 most analysts agree that informal diversion is hard to detect because it can have either positive or negative consequences depending on the circumstances of the diverted families also the familys reason for accepting diversion assistance or for not pursuing tanf assistance may be ambiguous in that the family may be discouraged with the application process or the rules of the tanf program or the family may be confused about their options25

realize that diversion activities are an important part of state strategies to reduce dependency and that restrictive federal rules in this area could stifle the states ability to respond effectively to discrete family problems we also understand that subjecting families in diversion programs to all the tanf administrative and programmatic requirements would not represent an effective use of tanf or ivd child support enforcement resources for example it does not necessarily make sense to require that for single modest cash payment the state must open up tanf case collect all the casereco rd data which that entails require the assignment of rights to child support open up ivd case and start running federal timelimit clock 26 hhs further stated that much of the diversion aid is workfocused including supports provided to individuals participating in applicant job search and that the benefits to the families are non recurrent and shortterm in nature and therefore would not undermine the tanf provisions on work time limits or selfsufficiency pursuant to the final regulations hhs is collecting only aggregate level spending information on diversion programs and activities the exclusion of diversion activities from the definition of assistance means that hhs is not collecting disaggregated data ie detailed information on individuals such as age race and educational attainment on the diversion caseload persons who receive diversion aid are also excluded from the aggregate caseload count however because of the importance of some of these nonassistance approaches to selfsufficiency the final regulations added three new annual reporting requirements that concern diversion including requiring states to provide description of the nonrecurrent shortterm benefits they are providing beginning october 1 1999 states also were required to include 1 the eligibility criteria for these benefits together with any restrictions on the amount duration or frequency of payments 2 any policies they have implemented that limit such payments to families eligible for assistance or that have the effect of delaying or suspending eligibility for assistance and 3 any procedures or activities developed under the tanf program to ensure that individuals diverted from tanf benefits receive appropriate information about referrals to and access to medicaid food stamps and other programs that provide benefits that could help them successfully move into employment 27 although states do not need to report on the characteristics of diverted families since diversion is not considered assistance under the final regulations the aggregate spending data together with studies on state diversion activities provide some information on the use and effect of diversion programs

and caretaker relatives from applying for tanf benefits may not be acting in the best interests of families they contend that some crucial needs of diverted families may remain unmet and that diversion programs may inadvertently persuade lowincome families to accept larger upfront diversion payment rather than enrolling in the tanf program w ithout fully weighing the consequences 2002 urban institute study found that significant share 1734 of eligible persons representing 500000 to 1 million persons who were diverted from the tanf program could gain substantial income and important services by enrolling in tanf 31 moreover the author of 2003 report entitled which tanf applicants are diverted and what are their outcomes found that diverting from tanf relative to enroll ing in and leaving the program is associated with lower rates of employment and higher ra tes of food stamp program participation the author stated that this finding may indicate that many families diverted from tanf probably have longterm needs that are not met by diversion32 g21g157g138g157g142g561g23g156g142g561g152g143g561g25g142g149g143g138g155g142g561g6g146g159g142g155g156g146g152g151g561 based on the

state states are almost equally divided between allowing families to receive one diversion payment every 12 months and allowing families to receive one diversion payment in their lifetime most states prohibit tanf benefits to families that receive diversion assistance for period at least equivalent to the diversion payment and some states have longer ineligibility periods for more details on formal diversion programs see table 1 although the lump sum assistance approach represents the most common form of diversion activity the number of families assisted by such payments is relatively small the august 1998 gwu study points out that states can be characterized as making it easy for tanf applicants to be diverted where the lump sum payment program policies use relatively broad eligibility criteria allow lump sum payments to be used for more than just workrelated needs and do not impose onerous repayment requirements or other penalties on lump sum payment recipients states can also be seen as deliberately limiting the number of participants in their lump sum payment programs when the program policies use very specific eligibility criteria limit the use of lump sum payments to workrelated needs and impose onerous repayment requirements and automatic penalties 43 many observers contend that it is applicant job search programs rather than formal diversion programs that have the ability to impact large numbers of families and have more potential of diverting significant numbers of applicant families from applying for tanf benefits 43 description and assessment
