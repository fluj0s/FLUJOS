program under the clean water act summary the davisbacon act dba requires among other things that not less than the locally prevailing wage be paid to wo rkers employed under contract on federal construction work to which the united states or the district of columbia is party congress has added dba prevailing wage provisions to more than 50 separate program statutes in 1961 dba prevailing wage requireme nt was added to the federal water pollution control act pl 8788 now known as the clean water act cwa which assists in constructi on of municipal wastewater treatment works in 1987 congress moved from program of federal grants for m unicipal pollution abatement facilities to state revolving loan fund s rf arrangement in which states would be expected to contribute an am ount equal to at least 20 of srf capitalization funding the srfs were expected to remain as continuing and stable source of funds for construction of treatment facilities and congress specified that certain administrative and policy requirements incl uding davisbacon we re to be annexed from the core statute and would apply to treatment works cons tructed in whole or in part before fiscal year 1995 with srf assistance by october 1994 under the 1987 amendments it was expected that fede ral appropriations fo r srfs would end after 1987 congress variously reconsidered the cwa and the srf program but made further authorizations it did how ever contrary to expectation when the 1987 legislation was adopted continue to appropriate funds for srf pollution abatement projects thus conflict arose did the administrative and policy requirements associated with federal funding inter alia the prevailing wage requirement continue to apply if so or if not upon what legal foundation in 1995 the environmental protection agency pa ruled that prevailing wage rates davisbacon would longer be required on srf projects the building and construction trades department bctd aflcio protested what happened after 1994 is not entirely cl ear that is whether prevailing rates were actually paid in the spring of 2000 epa reversed its position and came to conclude that davisbacon did indeed apply following notice in the federal register and review of submissions from interested parties epa entered into settlement agreement with the bctd it would enforce dba rates on cwa projects effective july 1 2001 but then ep moved the effective date back to late summer and then to october th ereafter it seems epa was silent during recent years congress has incr easingly considered funding mechanisms

coverage and the state revolving fund program under the clean water act introduction in 1987 congress amended the clean water act cwa to provide for establishment of program of state revolv ing loan f unds srfs through which to finance local water pollution abatement proj ects pl 1004 the srfs were to be jointly funded by the federal government and the states w ith loans to be made and repaid in cyclical fashion the legislation included provision mandating that construction work performed with srf assistance would be covered by the prevailing wage requirements of the da visbacon act dba 1931 statute requiring payment of not less than the locally prevailing wage on certain federal and later federally assisted construction work1 by the mid1990s this system was exp ected to have changed once the srfs were in place federal funding for these waste water treatment facilities would pass through the srfs on revolving basis it was assumed that by the mid1990s the transition would be complete and that further federal ppropriations would be needed however federal presence would continue through the srfs as funds were recycled through loans and repayment in practice matters evolved somewhat differently although additional authorizing legislation was adopted af ter 1987 clean water act appropriations contrary to stated expectations continued given conti nuing federal funding some have argued federal requi rements governing administration of the program including labor standards s hould remain in place others have sought to set aside the various federal requi rements including the cwa davisbacon provision debate over davisbacon coverage under the cwasrf program is ongoing and has been the subject of several policy shifts on the part of the environmental protection agency epa first in 1995 epa ruled that davisbacon longer applied to cwasrf projects second in the spring of 2000 epa reversed itself and entering into settlement agreement with the building and construction trades department aflcio affirmed that the act would be applied to such projects effective july 1 2001 third epa then set back the effective date for davisbacon coverage to the fall of 2001 perhaps

regulatory complexities that have resulted it suggests the evolution of the davis bacon provision of the clean water ac t and traces the conf lict 19942008 as to whether dba wage standards shoulddo still apply to cwasrf projects finally it poses questions of policy how did th dispute develop how has it been resolved if indeed it has been and how might similar conflicts be avoided with more than 50 program statutes now covered by davisbacon prevailing wage provisions and with congress exploring variety of innovative funding mechanisms for public works how this issue is ultimately resolved could have wider implications background in 1948 congress enacted the federal water pollution control act setting in motion continuing initiative for restoring the health of americas water resources the act which would evolve into the clean water act started modestly mandating series of studies and limited projects gradually on an ad hoc basis the pollution abatement program became more ambitious with federal aid to states and local governments in 1972 the various initiativ and requirements were drawn together in more coherent manner other ame ndments followed in 1987 the most recent amendments congress made changes both with respect to policy and funding2 the davisbacon act 1931 had twofold thrust to promote stability within the construction industry and to protect construction workers from downward spiral in wages and working conditions in 1935 congress broadly restructured the davis bacon act reducing the coverage thre shold from 5000 to 2000 and extending the scope of the act to constr uction alteration andor repa ir including painting and decorating of public buildings or public wo rks to which the united states or the district of columbia is party3 gradually and with increasing frequency after the mid1950s davisbacon provisi ons were added to statutes in which the work was made possible through federal grants ans and other fina ncial arrangements4 linking davisbacon to the clean water act conflict developed early on between federal and stat responsibilities in 1956 congress adopted legislati on pl 84660 to provide for grants of up to 50 million year through 10year period to be used for matching grants to states and localities for construction of community sewagetreatment plants president eisenhower reluctantly signed the legislati on but later

1961 amendments and their aftermath in early 1961 president kennedy reve rsed the eisenhower policy on water pollution abatement and called for increased federal assistance to municipalities for construction of waste treatment facilities7 when new cwa legislation was reported in the house in april 1961 it provided inter alia that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on projects for which construction grants were to be made were to be paid wages as determined by the secretary of labor in accordance with the act of march 3 1931 as amended known as the davisbacon act8 the davisbacon provision was explained to members of the house representative john blatnik dmn ch air of the subcommittee on rivers and harbors stated that this was not an unus ual

be eliminate d thereby allowing the states greater flexibility and freedom mr stangeland did not specify the restricti ons he had in mind was this flexibility with respect to the types of projects and

capitalized by the federal government under pl 1004 at least two elem ents need to be considered first there is the language of s 1128 of the 99th congress the vetoed bill and of the conference report that accompanied it second there is the actual language of the new statute pl 1004 with respect to dba cove rage they differ in critical aspects when reporting s 1128 in the house in the 99th congress the conference report explained that the 16 administrative requi rements of section 602b6 including the davisbacon requirement section 513 of the cwa were not to apply to funds contributed by the state or to monies repaid to the fund32 senator george mitchell dme explained the measure in the senate in almost identical language33 but that language was not incorporated within the proposed legislation which in any event did not become law pl 1004 like s 1128 of the 99th congress states that treatment works to be constructed in whole or in part before fiscal year 1995 with funds directly made available by capitalization grants under this title must meet the requirements set forth in section 602b6 the 16 s pecific requirements which included the section 513 davisbacon provision the st atute did not say that davisbacon coverage would cease after 1995 when author ization would have terminated nor did it specify that section 513 davisbacon and the other enumerated requirements would not apply to recycled repaid funds it carried the program up to fy1995 and then was silent making reference to the first use concept where the davisbacon act was concernedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31491crs8 34 the 100th congress may arguably have seen need to reaffirm prevailing wage coverage taking coverage for granted or conversely it might have added specific language stating that after 1994 the dba woul d not apply to srff unded construction but it did not do so the target date was after all nearly seven years off and surely there would be time to revisit the act how much weight should be given the absence of language overturning longestablished public policy 35 an issue at least since the later 1950s major controversy erupted with the 1979 gao report the davisbacon act should be repealed us government accounting office hdr7918 washington us govt print off april 27 1979 the report led to hearings by three separate committees of congress projected administrative reform and litigation then continued in some degree into the clinton administrationthe issue of continuing dba coverage for the srf program appears to have sparked concern neither during the closing days of the 99th congress nor early in the 100th congress but there may have been continuing ambiguities the legislation projected direct fe deral role in the srfs continuing appropriations until fy1995 thereafter the program was still expected to continue on foundation of federal f unding did congress intend to drop the davisbacon requirement with others once the srfs were in place resting as they were on federal funding and was c ongress willing to acquiesce in the payment of wages lower than those prevailing in locality after fy199434 there may also have been the matter of disaggregation of sfr funding an abatement project commenced prior to 1995 with an srf loan would clearly be dbacovered what if work were to continue beyond 1995 through supplemental srf loans the entire project could be grandfatheredin and wholly subject to davisbacon or once 1994 had been reache d coverage could cease or coverage might be associated with each contract or subcontract depe nding upon the date on which contract was entered into or on which the work commenced could worksite be fragmented part covered and part exempt how were the various agencies to dis tinguish between cove red and noncovered funding construction grants under title ii had always required dba coverage but with federal funds now going first to sr fs capitalization grants and then being loaned out to local entities would dba still apply in the absence of specific policy from the congress and what about the first use doctrine given the very high visibility of da visbacon during this period some may wonder that the act was not major s ubject of debate where the cwa was concerned documents to this poi nt 1987 are remarkable

oversight senator chafee asserted that the states have actually lost ground as the construction grants prog ram is being phased out and affirmed that the states are starved for resources to carry out the act among other things the baucuschafee proposal would have set back the target date for termination of the federal role in the srfs from 1995 to 1998 and it appears would have extended through that period applicability of the existing specific requirements under section 602b6 including davisb acon coverage section 51337 hearings commenced on the baucuschaf ee legislation in the spring of 1991 but by that point number of things had changed concern with wetlands and combined sewer overflows csos and nonpoint source pollution had become the key issues especially the former the reagan administration had given way to the bush administration and epa administr ator william reilly now acknowledged municipal pollution abatement need into the i ndefinite future he stated that the costs of abatement were rising and that the states and municipalities are very often not in position to meet the many fe deral requirements we are imposing38 these problems may have overshadow ed concern about prevailin g wage standards except perhaps from the standpoint of keeping costs down though specific proposals were avoided for the moment it became increasingly clear that the federal government

assessment in march 1991 and in january 1992 gao released assessments of the initial operation of the cwasrf program stating that the wage requirement was the most controversial of the old title ii now title vi administrative requirements but it also found opinion mixed some arguing that dba could increase project costs significantly while others suggested that except for small or disadvantaged communities the increased costs associated with the title ii requirements may not be as substantial as critics aver44 in short its findings seem to have been ambiguous with little hard evidence upon

1995 mich ael cook of epa called the attention of his staff to confusion about appli cability to the srfs of the equivalency requirements includi ng the dba provision64 noting the language of the statute and making allowance for the ltered circumstance cook stated section 602b6 of the clean water act requires section 212 publiclyowned treatment works projects to comply with these statutory requirements if they are constructed in whole or in part before october 1 1994 with funds directly made available by capitalization grants consequently projects that began construction on or after that date do not have to comply with the requirements underscoring in the original cook explained various complexities fo r example with binding commitment for the project made prior to october 1 1994 or an ongoing project being incrementally funded the equivalency requireme nts could be expected to apply but where commitment or initiation of construction occurred on or after october 1 1994 the equivalency requireme nts do not attach to the project this would be true even though the project was funded w ith funds directly made available by capitalization grants equivalency funds65 there

imposes conti nuing independent obligation on the agency to ensure that davisbacon act requirements apply to any grants made under the cwa for treatment works including capitalization grants made under title vi of the cwa the language of cwa section 602b6 does not relieve the agency of this obligation furthe rmore as matter of policy the agency has determined that prevailing wage rate

capitalization grants and directly made available which given the history of the statute could become focus of litigation even were the settlement affirmed why had epa acquiesced to enforcement of the

equal to dba rates85 the effect and standing of section 513 riginally applicable to title ii and of section 602b6 of the new title vi remain ed in dispute raising the question as to whether the federal funding in questi on came from epa or from the cwasrfs section 513 the bctd stated applies to all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractor s on treatment works for wh ich grants are made under this act not all laborers and mechanics em ployed by contractors or subcontractors on treatment work by which grants are made by epa under this act that is it concluded the plain lang uage of section 513 is not as limited as epa claimed86 the bctd then turned to congressional inte nt there is question that in 1987 congress intended to disconti nue providing capitalization grants to the srfs after fy1994 however federal funding of capitalization grants to the states has continued unabated since fy199587 why would epa having taken very pub lic stand that the dba did not apply to srf work suddenly reverse itself if the bctd interpretation of the law is correct the statement speculated there is potentially substantial amount of back pay liability ar ising from failure to pay prevailing wages and benefits on cwa projects epa has wisely decided th at although its prior position rests on reasonable legal interpretation it is now persuaded of the appropriateness of the view that cwa section 513 imposes tinuing independent obligation on epa to insure that davisbac on act requirements apply to any grants made under the clean water act for treatment works including capitalization grants under title vi of the cwa88 new epa policy enunciated epas final settlement agreement with the bctd appeared in the federal register of january 25

reimposing the davisbacon act requirements may increase construction costs for many cwsrf recipients but the levels of those cost increases vary widely and are often insignificant although epa is interested in stream lining administrative requirements and reducing implementation costs state prevailing wage rate laws cannot substitute for the requirements of cwa section 513 the settlement however still contained the provision that were epa after the signing and publication of th settlement to fail to meet its obligations under the settlements terms the sole remedy of the building and construction trades department would be to reinstitute its request for ruling before the dol90 another reversal at epa interest groups had aligned on each side of the epabctd settlement if the trade

then with elabor ation epa moved it back again this time to october 1 200195 thereafter there was silence some considerations of policy conceived prior to the depression th davisbacon act 1931 was passed at the urging of the hoover ad ministration the in tent was to bring stability to the construction industry and at the same time to preven t construction wages from spiraling downward as part of the depressionera decline after the act was refined and expanded in 1935 subsequent amendmen t has been largely technical though the davisbacon principle has been exte nded to more than 50 program statutes review of the davisbacon statute almost from the beginning there was debate about the statute that quickly became symbolic organized labor supported the act as did many in industry for others from industry and elsewhere the davisbacon became target with support for or opposition to the act viewed as po litical litmus test arguments pro and have through the years been pursued with vigor the act with the related program provisions has been litigated extensively with individual words phrases and concepts becoming grist for the contending parties on each side congressional debate over davisbacon has been intermittent at least since the 1950s but it was more or less ongoing th rough the 1970s 1980s and into the 1990s not infrequently dba has surfaced as subject of consideration several times during single session of the congress and given what some perceive as the ambiguity of the statute and the difficulty of its implementati on one may reasonably expect that it will continue as part of the agenda of the congress and the courts davisbacon and the clean water act davisbacon prevailing wage coverage was added to what would become the clean water act in 1961 when congress created the cwasrf loan program in 1987 dba with other administrative requireme nts was made part of that program what happened after 1994 when srf author izations expired remains in question federal funding and admini strative requirements in 1987 congress decided to end new authorization fo r srfs after fy1994 almost immediately however there was recognition that furt her federal funding for srfs would be needed for the foreseeable future severa l proposals to that effect were consideredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31491crs26 96 for example the states presumably having accepted federal grants to capitalize the srfs are not free to convert these funds to an unrelated purpose of th eir own choice eg continuedpossibly because of more contentious issues wetlands for example they were not enacted but absent further authoriza tions congress continued to fund the srf program through the appr opriations process the program is ongoing so long as the srf program received federal funding w ith authorizations through fy1994 congress provided that db coverage continue given literal interpretation of the 1987 authorization tha t is that dba and other administrative requirements would apply only to treatment works construc ted in whole or in part before 1995 one could argue that any pr oject constructed afte r that time would not be dbacovered however one might also argue that congress intended to continue the initial srf program through the appropriations process and since appropriations continued to be made it might also be argued that the various administrative provisions including davisbacon in place in 1994 would continue until such time as congress intervened from this perspec tive there would have been change in the longstanding policy of dba covera ge of cwa and cwasrf projects and need for new statement of intent by the congress the concept to which the united states is party speaking generally davisbacon cove rage has taken two forms the act itself requires an agreement to pay not less than the locally prevailing wage rate be included in every construction contract in ex cess of 2000 to which the united states or the district of columbia is party italics added in the case of the clean water act dba prevailing wage requirement has been added to the statute with section 513 of the core act and with section 602b6 with respect to the srf program determination of what constitutes locally prevailing wage is left to the secretary of labor while the epa administrator is di rected to insure that all laborers and mechanics employed on covered work are paid wages at rates not less than those found by the secretary to be prevailing in narrow legal sense the concept of is party may be interpreted as requiring that the united states through its authorized agent be an actual signatory to construction contract mo re broadly in the case of federally assisted programs some may argue that the recipient of fede ral funds loan grant tax incentive by virtue of the receipt of such assistance becomes the facto agent of the federal government and thereby takes on variet of federally impos ed responsibilities the cwasrf is by and large federal program even where the federal government is not immediately signator to specific contract under its egis srfs were established at the initiative of the federal government and have been funded

welfare or support for the arts these restraints upon how the funds might be used flow arguably from the original character of the funding mechanism 97 here one might consider the concept of first use some have argued that federal funds loaned out and then repaid lose their federa l character and take on the character of the administrator of the program in this manner it is argued the federal government ceases to be party to programs it has initiated and f unded and which would not exist in the absence of federal role or presence 98 in its january 2001 settlement agreement epa stated the legal basis for reimposing the davisbacon act requirements is sound and as matter of policy it is proper for prevailing wage rates to apply to construction projects that are for all intents and purposes federallyassisted italics added federal register january 25 2001 p 7762 99 legislation introduced by senator mark hatfield ror and representative curt weldon rpa in the 104th congress s 1183

other assistance from the united states pursuant to statute that is enacted after the effective date of this act unless exempt or otherwise limited by federal law or b contains provision requiring the payment of prevailing wages as determined by the secretary of labor pursuant to this actongoing one might argue that the concept of being party to an ongoing program with the responsibilities that may enta il does not end simply because new federal funding is forthcoming and while the progra m continues to operate by virtue of the old funding97 the program even without new author izations is ongoing and it might be argued that the federal govern ment continues to be party to it that would seem on the surface to be implicit in the epa agreement to enforce the dba requirements prospectively and in the same manner as they applied before october 1 199498 such assumptions of course lay at the heart of the continuing dispute establishment of srfs in effect creates an intermediary between the source of the funding largely federal and the loan r ecipient to what extent is the continuing federal presence modified by the mechanism through which funding is made available for local abatement projects does the existence of the srfs render the federal government other than party to the construction99 the issue is legal philosophical and disputable the complexities of regulatory enforcement

the states concept sometimes associated with an antidavis bacon stance ward continued certainly states must be fully accountab for their use of federal dollars but an excessive overlay of mandates and

practice of ensuring the application of da visbacon where federal funds are provided for construction it added for the cl ean water srfs the most significant source of revenue in the state revolving funds is the federal capitalization grant as congress has done in 63 parate instances for fede rallyfunded construction the davisbacon act should apply to the reaut horization of the clean water srfs the committee went on to discuss the vari ed rationale for support of the davis bacon act to attract more experienced and better trained workers workers who are often more productive than workers w ith less training and experience that davisbacon work results often in the co mpletion of construction projects ahead of schedule reducing the overall cost of the project and offsetting any increased costs due to higher hourly wage rates107 conversely representative john mica rf l together with several others suggested strong opposition mr mica stated that the bill represents an important step forward for clean water but it also takes significant step backwards by mandating and expanding upon the past app lication of davisb acon act prevailing wage requirements in the srf program davisbacon he state d would add to the cost of public construction and have disproportionate impact on small rural and disadvantaged communities which can least afford to pay the higher cost of projects he stated that the act was discriminatory in that few small and minorityowned firms can afford to pay the higher wages that the davisbacon act requires as result he observed the are rarely awarded davisbacon contracts and many of them stop applying for those contracts he concluded there is precedent here for applying the davisbacon act to state funds108httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31491crs31 109

representative kathy castor dfl responded that some were unable to criticize the heart of this legislation that is authorization for an important part of the clean water act thus she suggested that the member from texas instead reverts to attacking portion of this legislation that is vital to workers across america the davisbacon provisions ca stor noted that it has become all too familiar from the other side of the aisle to attack workers across america she then affirmed that it is our policy in fact it is cong resss longstanding continuing tradition of applying prevailing wage requirements to federally funded construction projects studies have shown that by attracting more experienced bettertrained workers that wage requirements lead to higher productivity and they reduce overall costs which offset any higher wages castor argued that davisbacon protects communities by ensuring that wage determination is based solely on the local workforce costs the locally prevailing wage rate
