staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partner ofadec 9 for ofadec reasonable assurance could be t aken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreements 10 audit certificates for 2002 and 2003 were available however qualified opinions were expressed mainly due to the lack of physical invent ory reports this issue was subsequently addressed 11 ofadecs accounting records did not fully reflect the expenditure incurred and charged to the final spmrs expenditure incurred at the fi eld level totalling some us 70000 in 2003 had not been recorded and consolidated in the accou nting system instead ofadecs field officer maintained parallel manual accounting recor ds these records had not been subject to any independent verification nor had the expenditu re been properly authorised and approved the regional representation indicated that this has been discontinued and funds sent to the field are recorded in suspense account until ther are fully and adequately justified and approved 12 in the health sector oios assessed that c ontrols over the procurement and distribution of drugs should be strengthened the doctor was fully responsible for all the procurement and inventory activities this included the signing of purchase orders as well as the receipt and distribution of drugs to patients when the bills were received they were paid without any proper review and approval procedures oios highlig hted this as potential risk area and recommended that internal controls be strengthened to ensure procurement inventory and the subsequent distribution of drugs be appropriately s egregated and payments be properly approved the regional representation explained that appropri ate internal controls have been established with adequate segregation of duties observed 13 for incomegenerating projects internal c ontrols needed to be strengthened and the management of the activities required to be improve d for instance in 2002 from budget of us 6000 loans to three refugees absorbed almost half of the budget considerably reducing the amount available for others and overall reducing t he number of potential beneficiaries repayment was made by any of the beneficiaries and their whereabouts were not known ofadec explained that for 2004 reasonable ceiling has been established some us 150 for each refugee 3 b supply management procurement 14 major procurement activities were under taken during 2002 and 2003 unhcr procurement procedures were generally adhered to an d local committee on contracts lcc was established nonetheless oios recommended that the contract with the current travel agent be retendered given that the expenditure for trav significantly increased over the last two years for 2003 the office paid some us 128000 and for the ten months in 2004 the office had already disbursed some us 152000 as compared to us 54000 in 2002 this increase is due to dakar being the administrative place of assi gnment for many staff in the region 15 payments to the travel agent exceeded the lcc threshold and given the expected future travel trend the current contract should be reten dered and submitted to the headquarters committee on contracts coc for approval elements such as the provision of free pickup and dropoff services should be included in the tender particularly as significant overtime is regularly paid to drivers for late hours on airport duty the regional representation explained that some travel agents were recently consulted to comparing services offered in oios view however this is not sufficient and the regional re presentation should launch proper competitive bidding exercise and once the results have been obtained submit it to the coc for approval recommendation head2right the unhcr regional representation in senegal should undertake competitive bidding exercise for travel services nce the results are obtained it should be submitted to the headquarters committee on contracts for approval also to reduce the amount f overtime and unsociable working hours expected of drivers the of fer should include elements such as free pickup and drop serv ices rec01 b asset management 16 the assettrak system was generally uptod ate with physical inventories periodically carried out oios found however that asset data c ould not be relied upon as in many instances the book value of an asset was higher than the acqu isition value for example assettrak dated 11 october 2004 recorded vehicle with an acquisit ion value of us 21942 while its net book value was us 438778 almost 20 times other exa mples can be cited moreover nonspecial items with value of less than us 1500 had been recorded oios recommended that the value of assets be properly reflected in assettrak and nspecial items with value of less than us 1500 be excluded the regional representation indicated that correcti ve action would be taken to delete items with value of less than us 1500 recommendation head2right the unhcr regional representation in senegal should conduct an indepth review of assettrak data to ensure the acq uisition and net book value of assets are properly recorded in the s ystem rec 02 4 c security and safety 17 the regional representation was almost mos s compliant staff members had completed the mandatory cdrom security training h ad recently attended additional security training and conducted an evacuation exercise cctv cameras had been installed although not yet operational d administration 18 in the areas of administration and finance the regional representation generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review certain internal controls however needed to be strengthened 19 in july 2004 the regional representation paid dsa totalling some us 20000 to an international staff member for medevac in dakar t he staff members standard assignment length sal in guinea had ended on 15 september 20 03 and she had been siba staff in between assignments since that date and was awaiti ng her next assignment 20 the staff member was travelling to the usa where she had chosen to stay awaiting an assignment due to security reasons in the staff mbers recognized place of home leave the staff member transited in dakar and while she was t here she sought medical attention as her condition did not quickly improve she cancelled her trip to the usa and decided to stay in dakar the then human resources assistant at the re gional representation decided to cancel her initial travel authorisation pt8 to the usa nd to request approval for medevac in dakar the medevac was retroactively approved in pril 2004 and covered the period from 15 september 2003 through 4 april 2004 21 at this point without questioning the need for extended medevac over six months oios found that pt8 was issued in respect of the staff members medevac travel and that travel claim was submitted even though required for the calculation of the final entitlement oios observed that only an excel table was prepared showing an advance of some us 1300 the amount initially paid and the final calculatio n of dsa entitlement of some us 20000 the dsa advance should have been indicated on the back of the travel authorisation and the final dsa entitlements calculated on the basis of the pt 8 and the travel claim submitted by the staff member according to iom 8501 fom 8301 dated 12 november 2001 evacuees must be in possession of signed pt8 prior to undertaking devac travel that has been undertaken on oral instructions should be confirmed as soon as possible by the issuance of pt8 the medevac travel claim was settled without complying with this provision 22 oios is continuing to review this case and is followingup on the issue with dhrm and unhcrs medical service at headquarters recommendation head2right the unhcr regional representation in senegal should review the decision made by the former human resources assista nt to pay to staff member on medical evacuation dsa totalling us 20000 5 without proper travel authorisation pt8 and tr avel claim the representation should ensure that such weakness i n internal control does not reoccur rec 03 23 the rules and procedures for salary advanc to international staff members were not complied with from 2002 to 2004 senior internat ional staff member obtained several salary advances totalling some us 13500 the establishe d guidelines for the approval of advances of salaries for international staff at field duty stat ions clearly list the specific circumstances under which they may be approved in this case the reaso nneed for the advance was not given except for rental advance of us 7500 for the rental dvance oios noted that such an advance was not required under the terms and conditions of the lease and therefore should not have been approved 24 similarly the applicable rules for salary advances to local staff members were largely disregarded the majority of staff were been given emergency and special salary advances representing threemonth salary on recurrent ba sis in most cases the emergency nature of the advances was not indicated for example in march 2003 staff member was granted three month salary advance of us 3200 the justificati on given was simply to meet unforeseen commitments and the same reason was given the foll owing year for further advance of us 3500 one staff member received us 5000 advan ce for the purchase of furniture the regional representation explained that these instan ces of noncompliance were mistakes and misinterpretations of the relevant rules and that ppropriate actions have been taken to explain them to staff they further indicated that paym ent of this kind would be made again in oios view unhcrs rules and procedures are fairly specific on the requirements for advances and it is difficult to understand how they could be so easily misinterpreted 25 in the absence of unhcr representation i n mali monthly operational advances of up to some us 8500 were made to staff member stat ioned in mali oios noted that the documentation supporting the expenditure was not re viewed or approved by an officer with delegated authority the amounts were recorded dire ctly as expenditure in fmis moreover the new operational advances were made even though the previous ones had not been accounted for at the time of the review over us 30000 was outs tanding pertaining to various advances the regional representation explained that they had not iced that some expenditures and the relevant supporting documentation had not been prop erly handled efforts were being made to clarify the situation and to record expenditures w hich had not been processed the large outstanding amount was due to the repatriation oper ation for which higher level of funds was required the regional representation further indic ated that the team leader in bamako has been informed that proper controls needed to be est ablished 26 mobile telephones with international acces s and roaming facility were given to all international staff the mobile telephones were use d more frequently than the landline resulting in expenditure of some us 45000 in 2003 and 2004 despite this and until recently there were procedures for tracking calls or for the re covery of private international calls recent review of private calls made since 2002 showed that at least us 8500 was due to be recovered of which over us 6000 was due from one staff memb er alone the regional representation explained that appropriate measures had been taken to recover the costs of private calls and that all outstanding amounts would be reimbursed by end of december 2004 6 27 the 2004 performance appraisal reports pa r had not been initiated for staff members objectives setting had not been discussed despite the fact that the end of the reporting period was only two months away consequently mid term progress reviews had not been conducted the regional representation did not provide any rea for the noncompliance but indicated that pars were under review and would be uptodate by the end of 2004 v acknowledgement 28 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and
