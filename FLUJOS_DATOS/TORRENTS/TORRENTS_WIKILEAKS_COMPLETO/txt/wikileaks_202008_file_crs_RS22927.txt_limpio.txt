hanrahan resources science and industry division updated august 1 2008 abstract this report reviews the current status of agricultural negotiations for domestic support market access and export subsidies and their potential implications for us agriculture order code rs22927 updated august 1 2008 wto doha round implications for us agriculture randy schnepf and charles hanrahan specialist and senior specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division summary the world trade organization wto ministerial conference held in geneva httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22927 from july 21 to july 29 2008 failed in its attempt to resolve the remaining outstanding issues in the doha round negotiations prior to the collapse of talks negotiators had neared agreement on modalities framework specific formulas and timetables for reducing tradedistorting farm support tariffs and export subsidies that would significantly lower allowable spending limits for certain types of us domestic support eliminate export subsidies and allow us agricultural products wider access in foreign markets according to the latest draft of modalities and the current market outlook us domestic farm program outlays would appear to fit within proposed tighter limits without substantial modification however us trade officials had expressed concern that proposed modalities included too many exceptions for foreign importers to ensure an adequate balance between us domestic policy concessions and potential export gains the issue on which the ministerial eventually foundered was proposed special safeguard mechanism ssm that would allow developing countries like india and china to impose tariffs higher than negotiated tariff rates bound rates if imports surged absent an agreement on the ssm the trade negotiations collapsed whether or when doha round negotiations would continue is uncertain this report reviews the current status of agricultural negotiations for domestic support market access and export subsidies and their potential implications for us agriculture it will be updated if events warrant introduction wto multilateral trade negotiations have been ongoing since november 20011 the negotiations referred to as the doha development agenda dda or simply the doha round encompass four broad areas of trade reform agriculture nonagriculture market access nama rules and services this report focuses exclusively on agriculture 1 for more information see crs report rl32060 world trade organization negotiations the doha development agenda by ian fergusson crs2 where new disciplines are being negotiated in three broad areas domestic agricultural support programs export competition and market access often referred to as the three pillars of the agreement on agriculture doha round negotiations have attempted to maintain balance across the three pillars by simultaneously achieving concessions from exporters and importers alike in the form of tighter spending limits on tradedistorting domestic support elimination of export subsidies and new disciplines on other forms of export competition and expansion of market access by lowering tariffs increasing quota commitments and limiting the use of import safeguards and other trade barriers2 domestic support the wto categorizes domestic support programs by the degree to which they distort price formation in agricultural markets wto member countries have agreed to specific spending limits on the most highly marketdistorting domestic programs amber box programs while allowing member countries the ability to intervene in national agricultural policy by shifting their support to amsexempt categories such as the green box3 in addition certain marketdistorting programs are exempted from spending disciplines under special circumstances the blue box contains marketdistorting but httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22927 productionlimiting programs while the minimis exclusions one at the individual product level the other at the aggregate level comprise marketdistorting policies that are deemed benign because spending outlays are small relative to countrys overall agricultural sector in general wto trade negotiations have emphasized tightening spending limits on the most highly marketdistorting domestic programs while capping and reducing spending under the blue box and minimis exclusions tighter spending limits in aggregate and for specific products the current draft modalities propose cutting trade distorting domestic support simultaneously across three levels see table 1 for details first spending limits for each category amber box blue box and the two minimis exclusions would be reduced substantially second within each of these categories additional constraints would apply to support for any individual product ie productspecific limits third global spending limit referred to as the overall trade distorting domestic support otds encompassing the four categories of amber box blue box and the two minimis exclusions would be established at level substantially smaller than the sum of their limits in addition the qualifications needed for exemption status in the green box have been tightened additional changes to domestic support two other potential changes could have implications for us farm policy first blue box criteria would be expanded to 2 for current

commit to an otds bound of 15 billion compared with the modalities proposed range of 13 to 164 billion table 1 and the current bound of 482 billion conditional upon other countries expanding their offers of markets access for us farm exports on july 25 the united states accepted further proposed reduction in its otds to 145 billion as part of its conditional acceptance of negotiating proposal put forward by wto director general pascal lamy in an attempt to break negotiating deadlock what the draft modalities might mean for us agriculture under successful doha round agreement the united states would have to address any crs4 inconsistencies between its wto commitments and current us farm policy authorized by the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 the degree of changes to us farm policy needed to comply would likely hinge on market conditions if relatively high price environment continues as projected by usda and most market analysts then us amber box outlays could easily fall within the new limits with only modest changes however if market prices were to return to levels substantially below support levels then amber and blue box outlays could escalate rapidly and threaten to exceed spending limits4 many market analysts have also expressed concern that high revenue guarantees set by formula under new revenue support program average crop revenue option acre could lead to largerthanexpected outlays if market prices were to weaken substantially in the future but such an outcome would depend on the participation rate in acre which is still unknown revisions to the us dairy program under the 2008 farm bill appear likely to dramatically reduce annual dairy price support as notified to the wto dairy program changes coupled with reclassification of the ccp as blue box could provide additional flexibility in accommodating the tighter amber box limits however two commodities sugar and cotton could pose problems in meeting productspecific ams bounds httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22927 sugar was given higher loan rates in the 2008 farm bill while for cotton the draft modalities would impose larger more immediate cuts to allowable domestic support in addition cotton would confront much tighter blue box support limit market access formula tariff cuts the main approach to cutting tariffs in the modalities agreement is tiered approach based on the principle that higher tariffs have higher cuts developed country tariff cuts would range from 50 to 66 or 73 but subject to an overall 54 minimum average cut the cuts are made from legally bound rates which could be substantially higher than rates actually applied the range for developing countries would be twothirds of the equivalent tier for developed countries subject to maximum average cut of 36 leastdeveloped countries and socalled small and vulnerable economies would be exempt from any tariff cuts very recent new members of the wto also would be exempt from new market access commitments

2008 draft agricultural modalities by david blandford david laborde and will martin international center for trade and sustainable development ictsd june 2008 crs5 deviations from formula cuts some products would have smaller tariff cuts because of flexibilities that are provided for in the draft text foremost of these is the designation available to all countries of sensitive for limited number of products developed countries could designate 4 or 6 to be negotiated of products as sensitive and would apply tariff cuts that are onethird onehalf or twothirds of the modalities proposed formula tariff cut developing countries could designate 53 or 8 of products with the same deviations from formula cuts countries that choose to designate products as sensitive would have to pay for the designation with expanded market access under tariff quota where quantities inside the quota are charged lower or duty and the above quota tariff is determined according to the reduction formula the larger the deviation from the modalitiesproposed formula cut the greater would be the amount of inquota market access eg the maximum amount of inquota access would be 4 or 6 of domestic consumption if the full twothirds deviation is applied developing countries could also exempt some products from full formula tariff cuts by designating some products as special ie products deemed essential for food or livelihood security or rural development safeguards the draft modalities identify two options for the special agricultural httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22927 safeguard ssg whereby countries can reimpose tariffs if because of an import surge certain price or quantity triggers are met for developed countries the ssg would either be eliminated or the number of products eligible would be reduced developing countries could continue to use the ssg in addition the text provides for new special safeguard mechanism ssm that developing countries could apply to protect producers of special products when imports surged implications for the united states in general us agricultural exports would gain greater market access primarily in other developed countries recent study suggests that application of the tiered formula would reduce the average applied agricultural tariff faced by us agricultural exporters from 187 to 91 in the absence of sensitive and special product flexibilities and from 187 to 132 when such flexibilities are in effect5 although the sensitive product designation would limit the market access opportunities somewhat the number of such products would be limited also the higher tariff protection afforded by sensitive product status is partially offset by new or expanded quotas access talks gridlock on ssm proposals in contrast to potential market access gains under proposed tariff cut modalities india and china proposed modality for the ssm that would allow developing countries to impose tariffs 15 above bound rates if imports surged 10 above average trade levels the us counterproposal was for higher ssm trigger of 40 above average trade levels and tariff increases that would not exceed existing bound rates according to ustr the modality proposed by india and china would reduce existing market access for example ustr estimated that 10 trigger would have enabled china to invoke the ssm in eight of the last ten years for soybeans and india to restrict trade in six of the last nine years for palm oil 5 ibid crs6 export competition export subsidies the draft modalities on export competition would require developed countries to eliminate export subsidies by 2013 developing countries would have until 2016 all existing wto commitments concerning food aid technical and financial assistance in aid programs to improve agricultural productivity and infrastructure and financing of commercial imports of basic foods would be unaffected by the elimination of export subsidies export financing governmentsupported export financing would be limited by maximum repayment period of 180 days and would have to be selffinancing that is returns must cover all costs export financing includes direct financing support direct credits refinancing or interest rate support export credit insurance or reinsurance and export credit guarantees governmenttogovernment credit agreements and other forms of government support such as deferred invoicing and foreign exchange risk hedging international food aid all food aid transactions would be needsdriven fully in grant form not tied directly or indirectly to commercial exports of agricultural or other httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22927 products and not linked to market development objectives countries would refrain from providing inkind food aid which could have an adverse impact on local production or could potentially displace commercial sales food aid cash or inkind provided during an emergency would be put in safe box and be subject to more lenient disciplines monetization sale for cash of inkind food aid would be subject to stricter disciplines implications for the united states elimination of agricultural export subsidies has been longstanding objective of us trade policy the 2008 farm bill repealed legislative authority for the export enhancement program eep historically the largest us agricultural export subsidy program the draft modalities would require the elimination of the dairy export incentive program deip much smaller export subsidy program that was reauthorized in the 2008 farm bill the united states has already made changes in its export credit guarantee programs in response to an adverse decision in wto cotton case the intermediate guarantee program gsm103 has been eliminated riskbased interest rate determination has been established and the 1 cap on origination fees has been lifted to meet requirements laid out in the draft modalities the term for gsm102 shortterm guarantees six months to two years would have to be limited to six months to meet the selffinancing criterion in the draft modalities additional interest charges or fees could be required conforming to doha round modalities for food aid could entail some changes in us programs the future of doha round negotiations following the collapse of the ministerial wto member countries reiterated their commitment to completing the round for agriculture as well as for nonagricultural market access nama and services the nama and agriculture negotiating chairpersons will issue status reports of the progress made in the july 2129 2008 ministerial these reports would not have the standing of modalities but would only reflect the state of play including differences on issues that emerged during the ministerial consensus has yet emerged as to resumption of doha round negotiations
