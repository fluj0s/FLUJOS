health parity legislation including discussion of bills introduced in each congress and accompanying legislative action including hearings markups and floor votes the legislation is in response to concerns about the coverage of mental health benefits in group health plans which is often more restricted than the coverage of physical illness some advocates for people with mental illness str ongly support legislation that would require full parity citing research that shows the costeffectiven ess of treating mental illnesses on the other hand health plans and employers offering selfinsured plans contend that parity will cause significant increases in coverage cost generally the term full parity is used in this report to mean that the treatment limitations and financial requirements on mental health coverage are the same as those for coverage of physical illnesses treatment limitations include restrictions on number of visits or days of coverage or other limits on duration and scope of treatment financial requirements include deductibles coinsurance copayments and other costsharing requirements as well as annual and lifetime limits on coverage mental health parity legislation was first introduced in 1992 and the mental health parity act mhpa of 1996 was the first federal parity law the mhpa requires partial parity by mandating only that annual and lifetime dollar limits in coverage for mental health treatment under group health plans offering mental health coverage be less than that for physical illnesses it also provides an exemption to employers with 50 or fewer employees on june 17 2008 the president signed into law pl 110245 which extends mhpa through the end of 2008 about half of the states have passed laws requiring full parity for mental health coverage full parity legislation was first introduced in the 107 th congress and reintroduced in the 108th and 109th congresses but failed to pass expanded mental health parity legislation passed in the second session of the 110th congress following number of unsuccessful attempts pl 110343 in the first session of the 110th congress senator domenici introduced the mental health parity act of 2007 s 558 on february 12 2007 unlike previous versions of parity legislation this bill had the support of insurance companies and employers the congress ional budget office cbo scored s 558 and estimated that if enacted the bill would increase premiums by 04 on september 18 2007 the senate passed s 558 with an amendment by voice vote on march 9 2007 representative patrick kennedy introduced similar legislation the paul wellstone mental health and addiction equity act hr 1424 which was referred to three house committees on march 5 2008 the house passed hr 1424 by roll call vote house roll call

insurers often provide less coverage of mental illnesses compared to other medical conditions historically health plans have imposed lower annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental health coverage limited treatment of mental health illnesses by covering fewer hospital days and outpatient office visits and increased cost sharing for mental health care by raising deductibles and copayments the lack of parity ie equivalence in insurance coverage in part reflects insurers concerns that mental disorders are difficult to diagnose and that mental health care is expensive and often ineffective however the 1999 surgeon generals report on mental health concluded that mental illnesses are largely biologically based disorders like many other medical conditions it found that effective treatments exist for most mental disorders in 1996 congress enacted the mental health parity act mhpa to address concerns about the more restrictive coverage of mental health benefits in employersponsored group health plans the mhpa however is limited in its scope it does not compel insurers to provide mental health coverage for group plans that choose to offer mental health benefits the mhpa requires parity only for annual and lifetime dollar limits on coverage group plans may still impose more restrictive treatment limitations and cost sharing requirements on their mental health coverage congress recently extended the mhpa through december 31 2008 fullparity legislation was first introduced in the 107 th congress and reintroduced in the 108th and 109th congresses but it failed to pass despite bipartisan support from lawmakers under full parity plan must use the same treatment limitations and financial requirements in its mental health coverage as it does in its medical and surgical coverage1 passage of fullparity legislation is priority for groups that advocate on behalf of the mentally ill but is opposed by employer and health insurance organizations because of concerns that it will drive up costs in the first session of the 110th congress senator domenici introduced the mental health parity act of 2007 s 558 on february 12 2007 this bill was approved by the senate on september 18 2007 unlike previous versions of parity legislation the bill had the support of insurance companies and employers the congressional budg et office cbo scored s 558 and estimated that if enacted the bill would increase premiums by 04 representative patrick kennedy introduced full parity legislation the paul wellstone mental health and addiction equity act hr 1424 on march 7 2007 hr

federal and state action and economic impact by ramya sundararaman and c stephen redhead in june 2008 the negotiators in the house and senate reached compromise on the bill language further negotiations were held to develop offsets that were to be used to pay for the 34 billion that cbo estimated this legislation would cost over 10 years the compromise bill language passed in the house and senate as part of hr 1424 and was signed into law on october 3 2008 2 the final bill also provided funds to rescue the us financial system 1 treatment limitations include restrictions on the number of visits or days of coverage or other limits on the duration and scope of treatment financial requirements include deductibles coinsurance copayments and other cost sharing requirements as well as annual and lifetime limits on the total amount of coverage 2 pl 110343
