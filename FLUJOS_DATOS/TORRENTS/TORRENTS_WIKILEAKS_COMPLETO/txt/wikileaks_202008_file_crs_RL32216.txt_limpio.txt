included development of force structure plan comprehensive inventory of military installations and establishment of criteria for selecting bases for closure and realignment the secretary of defense submitted report to congress on march 23 2004 confirming the need for further brac round and certifying that an additional round of closures and realignments would result in annual net savings over period ending later than fy2011 on may 20 2004 the house of representatives voted 259 to 162 to delay base closings until 2007 in response to this action the white house immediately released statement declaring that the secretary of defense and other senior advisers would urge the president to veto any bill that weakened delayed or repealed the current base closure authority on october 8 2004 senate and the house conferees reached agreement on the national defense authorization act for fy2005 which included continued support of dods authority to conduct round of closures and realignments in 2005 senator john warner stated that it was essential to allow dod to complete its effort to reduce the size of its infrastructure on march 15 2005 the president appointed nine members to serve on the 2005 brac commission in doing so he consulted with leading members of congress in addition the president chose anthony principi to serve as the chairman of the new brac commission once formally inplace the commissions next step was to institute series of local dc area hearings to collect general information on dods force structure needs and goals it will be followed later by regional hearings at locations throughout the country at least one commissioner will be required to visit each base on dods designated list on may 13 2005 the pentagon announced that it would close 33 major us military bases and realign 29 others in move to consolidate forces and save almost 50 billion over 20 years the overall number of existing us major bases according to dod is 318 in addition 775

implementing the 2005 round introduction1 on november 15 2002 secretary of defense donald rumsfeld issued memorandum to senior staff regarding the implementation of the new base realignment and closure brac round authorized by congress in 20012 he emphasized that as part of the department of defenses transformation initiative new force structures must be accompanied by new base structure and added that brac 2005 should be the means by which we reconfigure our current infrastructure bases into one in which operational capacity maximizes both war fighting capability and efficiency3 he then directed that the process begin immediately it was in effect the formal launching of dods 2005 base closure implementation process4 the secretary of defense also revealed in his memo particularly important brac 2005 objective namely examining and implementing opportunities for greater joint activity as means of achieving more efficient base structure he explained that prior brac rounds had analyzed functions on unique servicetoservice approach and therefore did not benefit from joint examination of functions that cross services it would appear for example that dods network of research laboratories medical facilities maintenance depots and testing and evaluation facilities will become prime candidates for consolidation in the next round in respect to the selection process secretary rumsfeld declared that dod would not make any binding closure or realignment decisions prior to the submission of its final recommendations to the new brac commission in may 2005 it should be noted however that his statement left open the possibility if not likelihood of dod conducting internal nonbinding deliberations to underscore the importance of the new brac round secretary rumsfeld has created two office of the secretary of defenselevel groups to oversee and operate the brac 2005 process first of these is the infrastructure executive council iec 1 for prior information on brac rounds see crs report rl30051 military base closures agreement on 2005 round by david lockwood 15 pp 2 national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2002 pl 107107 sections 3001 3007 3 us

infrastructure steering group isg chaired by the under secretary of defense acquisition testing and logistics it will be responsible for the detailed direction necessary to conduct the brac 2005 analyses5 early requirements and developments in implementing the 2005 round dods first three requirements are 1 to develop force structure plan 2 to conduct comprehensive inventory of military installations and 3 to establish criteria for selecting bases for closure or realignment force structure plan in regard to the first the secretary of defense must develop force structure plan based on an assessment of the probable threats to the national security over 20 year period beginning with fy2005 he is also required to estimate the endstrength levels and the major military force units needed to meet such threats finally the secretary of defense must estimate the anticipated level of funding that will be necessary to carry out the plan comprehensive inventory second the secretary of defense is required to conduct comprehensive inventory of us military installations he must under the terms of the new brac law determine the anticipated need and availability of military installations outside the united states in addition the secretary of defense must give special consideration to any efficiencies that might be gained from the use of joint tenancy by more than one branch of the armed forces at military installation selection criteria third the secretary of defense must develop set of criteria for selecting bases for closure and realignment he must address broad range of military fiscal and environmental considerations likely to affect closure and realignment decisions in prior rounds dod assigned highest priority to four criteria related to military value an additional four included return on investment economic impact community infrastructure and environmental impact the eight selection criteria as proposed for the 2005 round are in almost every essential detail the same as those adopted and implemented in the three past rounds 5 see crs report rs21822 military base closures dods 2005 internal selection process by daniel else and david lockwood april 21 2004 6 pp crs3 the bolded sections of dods new draft criteria below reveal the pertinent additions as published in the federal register on december 23 2003 vol 68 246 pp 7422174222 military value 1 current and future mission requirements and impact on operational readiness of dods total force including the impact on joint warfighting training and readiness 2 availability and condition of land facilities and associated airspace including training areas suitable for maneuver by ground naval and air forces throughout diversity of climate and terrain areas and staging areas for the use of the armed forces in homeland defense missions at both the existing and potential receiving locations 3 ability to accommodate contingency mobilization and future total force requirements at both the existing and potential receiving locations to support operations and training 4 cost and manpower implications other considerations 5 extent and timing of potential costs and savings including the number of years beginning with the date of completion of the closure or realignment for the savings to exceed the costs 6 economic impact on existing communities in the vicinity of military installations 7 ability of both existing and potential receiving communities infrastructure to support forces missions and personnel 8 environmental impact including the impact of costs related to potential environmental restorations waste management and environmental compliance activities significant features of the new list include 1 reassertion of the overall importance of military value 2 increased emphasis on joint warfighting training and readiness and 3 dependence on local communities to support military missions brac developments 2003 in midjanuary 2003 two senior members of the house armed services committee representative gene taylor and representative joel hefley expressed crs4 the desire to either change or repeal the new base closure law pl 1071076 several months later on may 6 representative hefley chairman of the house armed services readiness subcommittee announced he would be receptive to postponement but would not offer an amendment7 on may 9 2003 the readiness subcommittee approved its part of the defense authorization bill hr 1588 in which it adopted an amendment by representative taylor to repeal the 2005 round few days later however the full house armed services committee voted to restore the 2005 closings the chairman representative duncan hunter argued that killing the baseclosing round would only lead to veto by the president and make the committee irrelevant8 on may 21 2003 the white house threatened to veto any bill if it included language delaying or cancelling dods ability to conduct another round of closures9 on may 22 2003 the house passed its defense authorization bill including provision that would exempt half of domestic bases from being closed the bill also would require the department of defense to maintain sufficient number of bases to handle surge in military forces in the event of future crisis in final conference action in early november 2003 the exemption initiative failed while the surge initiative succeeded hrept 10835410 also on may 22 2003 the senate passed its defense bill s 1050 it did not contain any significant domestic base closure language but did provide authority to create commission to review overseas bases in later conference action however the overseas bases initiative was dropped11 the issue nevertheless remained alive on november 4 2003 the military construction appropriations act for fy2004 section 128 provided for commission of eight members to review overseas bases it further stipulated that appointment of the members must be made later than 45 days after enactment of the act12 on june 4 2003 senator byron dorgan offered an amendment to repeal the authority for new base closure round in 2005 he said he could not think of worse time to consider such step senator trent lott cosponsor of the amendment concurred he explained that at this time we have not properly assessed our needs we are at war it sends terrible signal and it is bad for the economy

in opposition senator saxby chambliss said that putting off the brac 2005 round now will only prolong the anxiety in our communities surrounding our military installations14 in the final vote the amendment was defeated 42 to 53 margin that many might regard as surprisingly close in contrast letters sent to the committees by pentagon officials strenuously argued that dod was overburdened with an infrastructure that was simply longer needed to support the size of the us forces the secretary of defense stressed that brac provides the opportunity to configure our infrastructure to maximize capability and efficiency15 on july 1 2003 dod officials issued memo reorganizing its installations and environment office in anticipation of the impending 2005 base realignment and closure round it created new brac directorate that would identify which bases to eliminate in the past dod has acceded to the individual services recommendations on closures in the new round it appears the office of the secretary of defense is poised to exercise much greater degree of control16 the house defense appropriations bill for 2004 included provision that would close roosevelt roads naval station puerto ricos largest employer several members of congress insisted that without the livefire bombing range on vieques island there was little military value in retaining the military base17 the senates appropriations bill did not contain language for closing the base under section 8132 of the department of defense appropriations act for fy2004 pl 10887 the secretary of the navy was directed to close the naval station roosevelt roads not later than six months after its enactment which occurred on september 30 2003 virtually all the military activity at the naval station has ceased and military units and functions have been transferred to other installations located in the southeastern continental united states the act also required that the closure be carried out in accordance with the procedures and authorities contained in the relevant defense base closure and realignment act of 1990 as currently amended on december 23 2003 the pentagon issued its initial criteria for selecting bases for closure and realignment sending it to the federal register for public 13 congressional record daily ed june 4 2003 s7288 14 ibid s7292 15 ibid s7289 16 dubois reforms ie office in bid to

current and future capabilities cost and manpower location availability economic impact on communities ability to support personnel and environmental impact in addition the president was required to certify that there was need for new brac round and that there would be an annual net savings by the end of fy2011 brac developments 2004 dod implements selection criteria on january 6 2004 the department of defense requested commanders of installations in the united states its territories and possessions to gather information as part of the 2005 base closure round it stated however that information would be released to the public until after dod had delivered its list to the independent base closure commission in the spring of 2005 it also noted that in the past four completed rounds 85 of dods closures and realignments were approved by the commission19 on january 22 2004 senator kay bailey hutchison chairman of the military construction appropriations subcommittee sent letter to the pentagon stating that while military value is important to assessing the necessity of installations the dod should also conduct comprehensive study of us facilities abroad and determine whether existing base structures and locations meet the needs of current and future missions it would be unwise to close or realign domestic bases that may be needed for troops returning from outdated facilities abroad senator hutchison further stated that the dod should also consider how closing or realignment of installations affects our homeland security the current draft criteria very similar to that proposed in the previous brac rounds do not fully reflect the security of issues our country faces in the wake of september 11 2001 our nation is not dealing with the same threats as we were in 1995 and therefore we must develop new strategies to insure the military does not close base only to later realize its costly mistake20 on february 12 2004 the pentagon published its final criteria for the 2005 round the criteria were identical to the initial draft version leading some who took advantage of the opportunity to comment on the process to criticize the departments selection the principal concern among commentators regarding the final criteria seemed to be its overall vagueness representative sam farr raised the issue on the 18 68 federal register 246 dec 23 2003 pp

sen kay bailey hutchison homeland security overseas basing should be in brac criteria jan 22 2004 httphutchisonsenategovprl483htm crs7 same day in the house appropriations subcommittee hearings on military construction he stated that the criteria were so broadly constructed that they could suit almost any desired outcome21 in reply to this charge the pentagon explained that the inherent mission diversity of the military departments and defense agencies makes it impossible for dod to specify detailed criteria broad criteria allow flexibility of application across wide range of functions within the department22 the 2005 base closure law provided congress with the option of passing an act of disapproval regarding the final selection criteria it set deadline of march 1 2004 for undertaking such an action the deadline having passed without congressional action dods finalization of the selection criteria for closing bases automatically took place dod sends report to congress on march 23 2004 as part of the budget justification required by congress each year the secretary of defense submitted detailed report on the need for further brac round he also certified that an additional round of closures and realignments would result in annual net savings for each of the military departments beginning not later than fy201123 absent the certification the 2005 base closure round would have been cancelled in the report dod developed longrange force structure plan based on the probable threats to national security from 2005 to 2025 it also constructed comprehensive installation inventory arrayed by military department and by active and reserve component installations to assess the amount of excess infrastructure anticipated in fy2009 dod used the parametric analytical approach that it used in similar earlier 1998 assessment24 the dod report focused on major us installations across broad categories rather than the entire inventory which includes myriad smaller sites in addition dod weighed the anticipated continuing need for installations outside the united states as well as any efficiencies that might be gained from joint tenancy also dod used its experiences with prior rounds to assess the economic effects of base closures and realignments on communities in the vicinity of affected installations 21 us house of representatives committee on

fy2003 mar 2004 p 1 24 ibid p 2 crs8 the report estimated that dod possessed in aggregate 24 excess installation capacity it pointed out however that only comprehensive brac analysis can determine the exact nature and location of potential excess25 it then went on to explain that dod would conduct thorough review of its existing infrastructure in the coming year ensuring that all installations will be treated equally and evaluated on their continuing military value to the nation26 the release of dods report was followed on march 25 2004 by house armed services military readiness subcommittee hearing on base closures at which some members voiced strong opposition to the timing of the new round others were more conflicted wanting to support the war on terror on the one hand but also concerned about the many openended challenges facing dod and the country on the other27 on the same day the general accounting office issued report on the new brac round it stated that dods 2005 selection criteria followed framework similar to that employed in the four prior rounds it also said that the criteria were generally sound but pointed out that dod needed to consider in its analyses the absence of total agencyrelated and environmental costs28 congress considers brac delay on march 24 2004 representative solomon ortiz introduced legislation hr 4023 calling for twoyear delay in implementing new brac round his bill was supported by 30 cosponsors he said this is not the time to be shutting down bases he noted that the military had ongoing operations in iraq and afghanistan and might move troops home as it closes down bases overseas29 on march 25 2004 representative joel hefley chairman of the house armed services military readiness subcommittee conducted lengthy oversight hearing on brac the discussions revealed significant emerging bipartisan support for delaying the brac process on april 1 2004 the senate armed services subcommittee on readiness and management

chairman representative joel hefley expressed concern over the timing it would be bad mistake to do it in the middle of war he said on may 12 2004 the full house armed services committee addressed the base closure issue representative gene taylor offered an amendment to terminate the 2005 round the committee however adopted more moderate stand offered by representative joel hefley his substitute amendment called for delaying the round from 2005 to 2007 on may 18 2004 senator trent lott introduced an amendment to delay the 2005 brac round he explained that dod should first close its bases overseas before closing those at home the senator was supported by large number of bipartisan colleagues but he also confronted strong opposition from senator john warner and other key leaders the amendment was narrowly defeated by vote of 49 to 4731 two days later on may 20 2004 the full house voted 259 to 162 to delay base closings until 2007 in response to this action the white house immediately released statement declaring that the secretary of defense and other senior advisers would urge the president to veto any bill that weakened delayed or repealed the current base closure authority on september 23 2004 at senate armed services committee hearing on global force posture secretary of defense rumsfeld reiterated the threat of veto he further stated that the timing of the planned return of about 70000 us forces from overseas along with the scheduled brac round were inextricably linked32 in the same hearing senator john warner chairman of the defense committee warned that communities were already spending millions of dollars hiring experts to bracproof their installations to perpetuate the situation for two more years he stressed would be an enormous burden to communities on top of the high cost of keeping open bases longer needed33 30 senate committee on armed services subcommittee on readiness and management support military installation programs in

continued support of dods authority to conduct the 2005 base closure and realignment round senator john warner stated this administration priority is absolutely essential and necessary to allow the department to evaluate its infrastructure and to make smart decisions to support wellpostured 21st century military we must complete this crucial process over the next year in order to reduce aging excess infrastructure provide resources for the military where they need it the most and provide investment and development opportunities for the local communities that so strongly support our forces34 on the same day representative duncan hunter underscored four provisions of the law intended to improve the brac implementation process these included 1 prohibiting any revision of dods forcestructure plan or infrastructure inventory after march 15 2005 2 codifying the secretary of defenses criteria for selecting bases to be closed and realigned 3 repealing the authority of the secretary of defense to place installations in inactive status and 4 prohibiting the commission from changing the secretary of defenses selections unless at least two members of the commission visit the installation involved and at least seven members of the commission support the decision35 this last provision was intended to ensure that supermajority of brac commissioners prevailed36 community concerns about brac local efforts to prevent closures37 as result of the impending new round of base closures many community leaders have been searching for ways to protect nearby military installations in these efforts they have received much encouragement and financial support from their respective state and local governments millions of dollars are currently being spent to improve the infrastructure near bases with the intent of ensuring their survival the pentagon with an interest in paring down the military is looking at bases with only one or two missions or some other

communities under this arrangement are able to borrow the bond proceeds at low rates for projects that enhance the military value of facilities39 in another example nonprofit community organization in shreveport offered to build and refurbish more than 300 housing units at barksdale air force base at additional cost to dod the offer was made after many complaints about the inadequacy of its military housing in other cases state retention grants have been awarded to help local communities 1 establish links between military bases and state universities 2 utilize the potential for publicprivate partnerships and 3 consider exchanging military land with private developers in return for building new base facilities when asked for advice on how to prevent base closures one leading former defense official answered that the communities should emphasize existing strengths and new partnerships with the military our advice to the communities he said was always the same make sure the strengths of your facility are known40 addressing the encroachment issue of special concern to many communities as well as the department of defense is range encroachment it is the process whereby military base is progressively hemmed in by urban growth competition for air space protection of an endangered species and other factors such development can detract from bases desirability and thus make it target for future closure and realignment in the next round in the past the department of defense has regarded encroachment as local government issue over which it had little or control according to one pentagon official john leigh the federal government remained virtually powerless to intervene in local community growth issues however laws have been passed in the last few years that now require local jurisdictions to consider the impact of new growth on military readiness when making landuse decisions41 38 susanne m schafer fort should be safe sanford says associated press august

to loom large in 2005 base closure round inside defense august 13 2002 crs12 an october 2002 study by the national governors association drew attention to the rising problem of encroachment in many states condensed section of the study follows civilian encroachment is beginning to restrict or eliminate testing and training activities in many locations eighty percent of our nations installations are experiencing urban growth at rate higher than the national average residential and commercial communities are potentially exposed to artillery fire aircraft noise dust and worse yet accidents as urban growth and development increase near and around bases so do land use conflicts between mission activities and local communities for instance many military airports conduct night training exercises the city lights of encroaching development often compromise the effectiveness of night vision equipment making night training exercises impractical the extent of urban encroachment and its effect on operational activity of an installation is consideration in determining its future viability and such mission constraint can lead to activity reductions or even closures the resulting reduction in installation personnel and mission activities can jeopardize economic activity jobs and tax revenues encroachment puts local and state economies at risk42 the fy2003 defense authorization act pl 107314 included natural resource conversion provision that addressed the impact of land development on military installations the pentagon argued that environmental requirements placed serious limitations on the use of certain lands as result section 2881 authorized the secretary of defense to create conservation buffer zones outside its installations to help prevent urban sprawl while also providing habitat for endangered species environmental advocates have argued that dod needs to work more closely with developers and local officials who are likely to be focused on increasing the areas tax base the fy2004 defense authorization conference report requires the secretary of defense to conduct comprehensive study on the impact of various types of encroachment issues affecting military installations and operational ranges the report must be completed not later than january 31 200643 us overseas basing initiative on august 16 2004 the president announced that the pentagon would redistribute its overseas bases as means of achieving more agile and flexible force the initiative as part of global posture review came after three years of study and consultation in his statement the president made it clear he would retain significant military presence overseas but that he also intended to bring home 42 national governors association military installations pressured

employees over the next ten years44 opponents of the 2005 base realignment and closure plan have seized on the presidents announcement arguing that roughly onethird of the soldiers overseas will be returning home and that given the circumstances it would be premature to close domestic facilities key members of congress most notably senators kay bailey hutchison and dianne feinstein chair and ranking member of the senate appropriations subcommittee on military construction expressed their concerns in this regard on april 8 2003 these two senators sponsored bill s 949 to create bipartisan overseas basing commission obc45 its purpose was to assess the adequacy of the us military footprint overseas consider the feasibility and advisability of closing any current us installations and provide to congress recommendations for comprehensive overseas basing strategy that meets the current and projected needs of the united states46 on april 29 2003 the sponsors explained if we reduce our overseas presence we need statewide bases to station returning troops it is senseless to close bases on us soil in 2005 only to determine few years later that we made costly irrevocable mistake47 the two members of congress also said that the new commission would last for one year include eight congressionally appointed members and be completed for the opening of the 2005 brac process48 in july 10 2003 statement the white house threatened not to cooperate with an overseas basing commission saying that it was already looking at current and future force structure and basing needs congressional commission looking over dods shoulders it argued was unnecessary in spite of white house opposition however the obc became law when president george bush signed the fiscal year 2004 military construction appropriations act on november 22 2003 pl 108 132 the overseas basing commission was originally scheduled to report its findings by december 31 2004 as result of delays in

november 9 2004 the obc held hearing in which john hamre former deputy secretary of defense said that dod had not thought enough about how realigning forces abroad could be used strategically to shape the international environment in the coming decades he noted that the kinds of changes to the us military posture dod was contemplating at this time were driven primarily by operational expediency rather than strategy the problem he emphasized is that in order to be sustainable over the longterm us bases overseas must be part of an overall political diplomatic and strategic framework he did not feel that the administration had established an enduring framework for the new bases dod was contemplating49 six months later on may 5 2005 the obc unveiled its preliminary report regarding the pentagons global basing plans according to early press accounts the commission is concerned that the pentagon is pursuing global change too rapidly and that it is providing insufficient support in several other important aspects such as adequate airlift and sealift the need for heavy forces in europe and quality of life issues50 brac developments 2005 the 2005 brac commission the 2005 base realignment and closure statute entitled the president to nominate nine members to an independent base closure commission by date later than march 15 2005 he was also given the opportunity to ignore the directive with the result that the new brac round would have been cancelled51 the president however declined to exercise that authority52 in appointing members to the new brac commission the

ambassadors business leaders industry banking etc former house and senate staff members former white house staff members over period of two months from february 1 2005 to april 1 2005 the president and senior congressional leaders conducted review and ultimately approved the selection of nine commissioners to the 2005 base closure and realignment round speaker of the house j dennis hastert recommended former representative james v hansen of utah and samuel k skinner of illinois the latter formerly served on president george bushs chief of staff house minority leader nancy pelosi

president selected anthony principi of california to be the chairman of the 2005brac commission he was most recently vicepresident of the pfizer corporation in earlier years he served as the secretary of veterans affairs the chief counsel for the senate armed services committee and the senate veterans affairs committee and as top official with defense contractor lockheed martin in addition he is decorated vietnam war veteran the two other nominees selected by the president were brigadier general sue ellen turner usaf ret of texas and general james t hill usa ret of florida with its formal establishment the brac commission proceeded to conduct series of local dc area hearings to collect general information on dods force structure needs and goals for the brac process it will also conduct regional hearings at locations throughout the country to provide affected communities with the chance to express their views and concerns at least one commissioner it has been said will visit each base on dods designated list an additional round or two of hearings local and regional are possible before completion of the brac crs16 deliberative process after which the commission will send its final list to the president it should be noted that due to current brac law the commission can only add base to dods list under the following circumstances two commissioners must visit the installation and seven of the nine commissioners must reach agreement on the final decision53 in past rounds there appears to be evidence of such restrictions vote by simple majority of commissioners was sufficient to justify adding base to dods list debate on status of the national guard on march 24 2005 secretary of defense donald rumsfeld received letter from illinois congressional leaders stating that according to provision of federal law the pentagon could not close national guard bases without governors consent they called on the secretary to immediately stop any actions that might violate the law on april 12 2005 the department of defense sent letter to the illinois lawmakers rejecting their claim the letter stated that for brac to be truly comprehensive process and to achieve success the process must involve all installations including those used by the reserve components54 other sources have stated that the brac law and the law prohibiting the closing of national guard facilities appear to be unrelated with the swearingin of the new base closure commission on may 3 2005 the national guard issue resurfaced in its first set of hearings the chairman anthony j principi asserted that the debate over the governors legal authority would not slow his panels consideration of dods proposed list that it was an issue for the lawyers to decide55 dod lowers estimate of excess capacity on march 29 2005 secretary of defense donald rumsfeld acknowledged that the 2005 base closure and realignment round might be less extensive than initially expected at news conference he explained that dods previous estimate of excess capacity had been 20 to 25 percent but that it looks now like the actual number will be less than the lower figure of that range he said the change was due to the ongoing effort by dod to close military facilities overseas which in turn necessitates moving tens of thousands of troops back to us bases perhaps as many as 70000 even so secretary rumsfeld expects that the 2005 round of 53 sec 2914d 3 and 5 limitations on authority to add to closure or realignment lists pl101510 as amended 54 john m donnelly base closing commission brushes

effort made to block nominations on march 31 2005 senator trent lott placed hold on the presidents nomination of former secretary of veterans affairs anthony principi as head of the 2005 base closure commission it was also reported in the press that senator lott intended to place holds on each of the remaining brac commission nominees who had yet to appear before the armed services committee for their confirmation hearings57 staunch opponent of brac senator lott joined other lawmakers last year in bid to delay the 2005 round by two years his amendment to the senates fy2005 defense authorization bill was narrowly defeated by vote of 49 to 4758 on april 1 2005 president bush took the unusual step of announcing the recess appointment of all nine brac commission members thereby eliminating the requirement for senate confirmation59 senator john warner who heads the armed services committee supported the white house decision saying that such delays might otherwise complicate completion of the 2005 brac round base closure commission hearings on march 15 2005 the us senate armed services committee held hearing on the nomination of anthony principi to be the chairman of the base realignment and closure commission in his comments to the committee mr principi stressed that the new commission would be bipartisan that it would comply with the both the intent and spirit of the brac law and would seek all and any information needed from the department of defense to make the right decisions60 on april 7 2005 the house appropriations subcommittee on military quality of life held hearing on base realignment and closure and its relationship to dods global posture review61 in his opening remarks deputy undersecretary of defense phil grone underscored three key

chairman of the national intelligence council on threats to the united states over the next 20 years these threats included unconventional tactics such as sabotage terrorism information attacks and weapons of mass destruction used by terrorists insurgents and other non state enemies that might alter how the military fights its battles63 third hearing was held by the commission on may 4 2005

capitol hill it opened with the appearance of the secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and continued throughout the week with testimony from each of the military chiefs of staff and their subordinates number of significant elements have emerged from the hearings including the following the secretary of defense stated that the us military has only about 5 to 10 percent excess capacity once it takes into consideration the space it will need to accommodate 70000 troops returning from europe the pentagon had earlier estimated it had 20 to 25 percent crs20 more capacity than it needed the secretary explained that the upper figure was imprecise that it was unclear whether past recommendations included leased space or requirements for maintaining surge capacity64 the pentagon plans to consolidate military reserve and guard facilities into 125 new multicomponent armed forces reserve centers that would combine army navy air force and marine corps elements the army will close 176 army reserve centers and 211 army national guard facilities but it will build 125 multiservice reserve centers in places better suited to help its flagging recruiting efforts lt gen h steven blum chief of the national guard bureau stated that by closing or divesting ourselves of inefficient facilities and moving to places where we have better demographics and constructing join facilities i think we give better opportunity to the members of the reserve component make it more convenient and give them more choices65 this appeared to be the most contentious issue during the early hearings the pentagon plans to move thousands of military and civilian workers out of leased commercial highrise buildings near the pentagon in northern virginia and at other urban sites in order to provide increased security at bases around the country the department of defense has decided to shift significant numbers of us military forces and assets from new england and the mid west to the south and the farwest as quoted by one report the pentagon has apparently found its ideal environment proximity to the coasts for rapid deployment cheap and plentiful land and culture more tied to martial traditions66 on may 18 2005 representative jeb bradley and several other house armed services committee members attempted to halt the brac process by introducing bill that would have delayed base closings and realignments the amendment was defeated by voice vote the chairman of the house readiness subcommittee representative joel hefley sympathized with his colleagues but allowed that there was not much that they could do to alter the situation 64 vince crawley reserve hit hard by base closures marine corps times may 23 2005 65 eric schmitt pentagon seeks to shut dozens of bases across nation new

of 16 regional hearings beginning on june 7 and ending on july 14 chairman principi has stated that these visits will provide not only forum for the commissioners and its staff to learn details of what is happening at closing bases but also forum for them to understand the impact of brac decisions on the local communities involved on may 24 2005 the missouri delegation of congress sent letter to secretary of defense rumsfeld complaining about the absence of adequate information it said that the lack of material was hurting their ability to make case to keep bases open the pentagon replied that it had provided most of the important information and data with the exception of small amount of classified material that was undergoing dods security clearance process67 the following day representative bradley again attempted to postpone the 2005 round by submitting an amendment to the fy2006 defense authorization bill hr 1815 he recommended curtailing the next round until one year after certain conditions were met namely implementation of dods review of overseas military facility structure return of substantial number of us troops from iraq submission of dods quadrennial
