r212 dead horses lecture given on 15 january 1963 thank you sorry to keep you waiting theres an operating climate of emergency these days and sometimes the emergencies are great and sometimes they are small but theyre all emergencies and thats because they werent predicted thats what makes an emergency did you ever know that thats just failure to predict everything else is life all right well this is what the audience 15th 15th of january ad 13 saint hill special briefing course lecture number one all right well you probably came in here tonight to hear something clever thatll resolve all of your cases very easily and i regret to tell you that in the washington raid tonights lecture notes were seized well this isthis is lecture on the subject of routine 212 and there are several things in this lecture but amongst them is what to do about dead horses i finally taped this one life now becomes very easy for you if i make life much more easy for you youll collapse for lack of problems id hate to do that to you well let state the problem first very often you do represent or present time consists of or what are you upset about list those are all represent types of lists dont you see and the confounded thing behaves like wrong way to list they are very very difficult to complete very very very difficult to completeand they cycle and when i first noticed this why i didnt know whether to send for aspirin or the auditor how the devil could represent list be wrong way to how its not possible so ive actually been worrying about this and trying to do something about this here now for oh i guess about ten days or so ive been studying this above all other things very very hard because this was puzzler i vas poozled now wrong way to list cycles now somebodys going tosomebodys going to see right way to list sometime and its going to sneak up on an rs you know and before it gets to the rs its going to give dirty read and then itll rock slam and then they will see couple of dirty reads or something like that and then they wont see the dirty read for little while and then when they get up to the next rock slam so they say ahha that list is cycling the essence of cycling list is that the needle periodically goes clean its the fact the needle goes clean it isnt whether it rses or drs its the clean that you should concentrate on there needle goes clean beautifully clean very fine very nice very clean and you do another half page just to make sure that its good and clean and youve got complete list and all of sudden it isnt clean so you roll up your thetan sleeves and you go on and you list further and the next thing you know you got maybe dr maybe even an rs then it cycles out and it goes clean again how long will it keep doing this long time im afraid probably forever the needle will never go clean and stay cleanalways dirties up now this is quite periodic list which is right way to runs cycle as well and that cycle goes probably youre sitting there before you start to list youve probably got clean needle and itll go into dirty needle and then you get dirty read on an item or two and then you get rock slam and then maybe you get dirty read and thenthen youits kind of dirty needle that looks kind of messy and then after while you get another rock slam and then after while you get another rock slam never really goes clean and it goes on and on and you finally find yourself with less rock slams now this is in an oppose list and if you are listing wrong way to in an oppose list you will find that the frequency of rs is increasing and if youre listing right way to the frequency of rs is decreasing now wrongthis is quite marked on wrong way to list on an opposition this is an opposition list wrong way to every im only talking about opposition lists at this moment on wrong way to list youll have something like this youll have one rs on page one and couple of rses on page two and about three rses on page three and as far as you can tell up to this moment there is right way to or wrong way to because right way to list looks exactly the same way but lets go on and describe the right way to list now you see thats one rock slam on page one two on page two three on page three see thats either right way to or wrong way to you can tell by the needle tightening with just few items but this isnt this type of test im just talking about needle manifestation and if your list is wrong way to along about page four you have four slams and page five you have five slams and page six youve got six slams you get the idea the incidence of rock slam is increasing now oddly enough along with the increase of the incidence of rock slam the periods of clean needle are increasing see youre liable to get rock slam dirty read and clean needle see and dirty read and rock slam and dirty read and clean needle see youve got clean needles starting to show up here and the incidence of clean needles starts increasing but thats notimportant test the important test is and you can tell this by looking at any pcs list this is what is important because you think you are just going to be worrying about your auditing and you aint im worrying about your auditing right now see and its time for you to get it all down real good right now because you wont have any time to worry about your auditing after you get out of here every one of you is going to be worrying about other auditors cases now your own worry about cases that ends very soon up into the future youll have this bicycle so that you cannot only could ride it on pavement you can ride itride it on rutted street you can ride it on tightrope you can ride it on tightwire going between the poles of the two maintop peaks you could probably ride it backwards you know ride it standing on your head on the seat peddling with your ears that you wont be worrying about anymore because all of sudden itll all go straight and you will say bleahh there it is see one of the reasons is im finding you indicators indicators indicators indicators see im taking all your bugs out of it so you get maximal gain all the time see and youre learning those and youre very lucky youve made lot of boobs you know youve made lot of goofs you know how agonizing it can be you know better than to let somebody else make all those goofs see i come along and tell you how not to do those goofs boy thats important information see well youre going to be teaching somebody in santa ana county something of the sort or youve got coaudit running down there and youre trying to take care of it over the telephone they dont know these goofs are important they dont know what important goof is being made they have idea of the importance of goofs they dont know r2 bulls are more potent than auditing bulls see they dont know these things see they dont know these things see they havent lived through this see and under your direction theyve got to live through itand somehow or other without losing any pcs thats the important thing because in the field in r212 and in organizations with r212 unless youre very slippy and youre very quick and you dont let them go you see you guys it didnt matter you see you couldnt get out of here there was transport transportation has left england since the mayflower you know butbut somehow or anothersomehow or another youve got to keep it degoofed and youve got to ungoof cases so that you dont lose any and so forth because case can get awful sick on 212 you can put him awful well in hurry but he can also get awful sick man and he can feel like hes lost his last enemy he can feel terrible and it can just go out through the bottom of the floor you see just bong he was coming along fine then this person that the registrar said youhad too many pcs so they got somebody on the third week in the academy this is very illegal but it happens every now and then and this person in the third week in the academy was put on this hgc pc and the pc was doing fine and did fine up till wednesday and then when they went downdidnt appear wednesday and somebody went down to the hotel to find the pc and the pc cant get out of bed two black eyes swollen up like baseballs well youre going to have some bad moments and the questions you ask is was it wrong source was it listed wrong way to or was the list incomplete see those are the questions you askwrong source wrong way to or list incomplete see and what im telling you just now about this frequency of rs is your best friend it isnt the length of the list although you look at lists of forty fifty pages you say oh zutthlah horsefeathersto use an archaic expression thats just goof thats just wrong source or something stupid youve got list there and its thirteen pages in this guys folder see and its thirteenpage list and because you have been on the ball anybody you talk 212 to youve practically hung them up by the ears for not putting down the data in the folder the pcs name on each sheet we dont care about each page but certainly each sheet and the date it was listed see and the question that was listed and whenever he saw an rs on the meter put it down get the meter up close to him someplace while hes listing so he wont miss it ill show you how thisll probably be favorite method of auditing rs oh youve seen it yourself marvelous meter completely out of the auditors range he cant see if the thing is rsing while hes writing you know so anyway youve already impressed on these charactersi dont care if they were in coaudit or in the academy or the hgc or it was field auditor you wereyou were briefing in and training youvewe assume this youve already impressed on them with branding irons to keep the data keep all the papers together write legibly so somebody can read it you see youve alreadybecause thats your only saving grace if they havent done that cut your throat boy oooh you wont know nothing place because theyre going to goof just assume theyre going to goof see dont go off on the happy idea that nobodys going to goof because 90 percent of the time the first auditing on this is done with somebody who already rses someplace where itll do the most harm and hewellso lets say he has an item it isnt an ri or anything but he has an item which will come up someday known as an amanuensis as an oppterm its secretary and the mere fact of sitting there writing restimulates this horrible oppterm see to him and he somehow or another cant keep track of it all see and he starts to audit its sen you look for it in auditing you look here and you look there and eventually it turns up anyhow thats the kind of thing youre running into see so you impressed them on that now the only thing thatll save your bacon is that folder and you get ahold of that folder and its just about the first thing you look for increasing incidence of rs just look for list where there are more rses on the end of it than there are at the beginning of it and when i say the very beginning of it it takes the pc little while to groove into it and theres very seldom very much rs on the first page so were talking about the fourth page or fifth page in comparison to the second page is what you want to look for and you want to look at about the second page and along about the fifth pagelets say the fifth page was the end of the list oh you say look at that theres more rses why dont you turn it around and list it the other way the way you were supposed to well the terminal was gruesome killer and the pc said that couldnt be him so of course we had to say who or what would oppose gruesome killer otherwise it was too painful oh youre going to hear some man ive heard some beauts i started to collect them and then i was too busy writing up decent lists so i didnt bother to collect them youll hear something like this it isnt that i dont trust my fellow man the funny part of it is i wouldnt put them into their hands if i didnt think they could climb the hill all im trying to tell you is you got two hills to climb see just like i had two hills to climb get so i can do it and then get you to do it see youve got exactly the same hills to climb get so you can do it and get so the other fellow can do it get the other fellow to do it see youve got the same hills to climb well always be climbing these two hills see to some degree but the first one can be climbed and thats dusted off you know you can do it because there is finite end to routine 212 first time weve ever said that about process you realize that theres finite end to learning it there isnt some new rule going to turn up in the card game what im trying to give you now are indicators indicators im looking for things to look for im looking for things that explain certain oddities that you are running into all right now this frequency of rs the needle that keeps going cyclically clean is another part of this all right thats wrong way to now you get what i mean about it of course youve got it wrong way to you list it right way to actually the easiest way to test right way to or wrong way to is simply to list page or half page each way and find out which one tightened the needleand thats wrong take the one that loosened the needle always and the funny part of it is thats wonderful way to get accustomed to inspecting pcs appearances for skin tone thats marvelous you see its all trick of spotting then and now so youve got to have now to become then see youve got to look at them and say all right this is the start of listing how did they look you know and then list yourself half page and look at them again see those are the two points of comparison and you will very rapidly become accustomed to seeing what pc looks like if hes listing in such way as to cave in his bank it isnt just wrong way to that caves this in you see you can list the wrong item and cave it in you can take the wrong source and cave it in see almost anything you do wrong in routine 212 darkens the visage and skin tone of the pc mucks up his eyes does this that and the other thing to him its all facial and its very visible but it gives you good experience listing right way to and wrong way to youre picking out which one is which you just take these two opposings and figure out which one is which and inspect the pc very closely as you are doing that and you will actually see the pcs skin darken now oddly enough it wont lighten on the right way to list as fast as it darkened on the wrong way to its going to take maybe couple of pages of listing to get his skin back to where it was before you wrongway listed it nevertheless it gives you comparison gives you very good idea of it now you want to become an expert on this on skin tone and eye and so forth and the expertness is totally on selection of points of time you see you cant compare this piece of paper to this piece of paper see look at your axioms of knowledge there must be data of comparable magnitude for comparison one with another before you can know something you see you cant say this is big meter unless another meter exists to be smaller or bigger see you get this idea so you have data of comparison on case unless you mark moment in time zzzt and you say well thats how he looked you see you do this several times you do it for the overall process you do it for the right way youre listing you do it for this and that but you keep in mind how he lookedyou take good look at him you know you take photograph of himand you say there he is and now fifteen minutes later you compare that first there he is with how he is now see and you get thennow comparison is he lighter or is he darker those are the only questions you ask its as simple as that this is the doggonedest darkening mechanism you ever saw but i didnt say that he went black he actually doesnt go black he just goes darker because some pcs go yellow some go green some go gray some go black and the lightening process could possibly sometimes be confused within gray but you just have to get used to these things but frankly they get whiter and whiter which is very interesting thing youd have to have lot of sun lamps to keep up with it they go lighter and theres your best index and you should be able to get to be an expert on this so that youre supervising five six pcs in an hgc or youve got fifteen or twenty of them in coaudit just get practiced on this kind of thing its not very difficult trick and you say this is the beginning of the session just look all around and see how they all look and best way to do that is choose the one who looks worst you know and relate everything to him and you dont want these guys being listed backwards and upside down and out through the roof so after everybodys been industriously listing or doing whatever theyre supposed to be doing about half an hour passes by or something like that take look through the room and compare it to that first look you took see you see this guy over here he actually is not much greener but hes greener see so you take this bird and you know that its wrong source wrong way to or an incomplete list and you immediately make it your business to find out whats wrong over there see then you can keep everybodys head out of water this is terrific processing when done right and the righter its done the more terrific it is you cant oversell it done right see but boy you could sure shoot holes with it done wrong and youll hear people saying oh god so this is scientology oh oh god oh jeez never felt so bad in my life you know its wonder they keep on getting processed at all but you can do these things real wrong with 212 and you can really pull the rug out from underneath somebody and let make little comment here as we go by this until you get to be an expert or until somebody is expert dont let them process children why well actually the kids having hard time concentrating his attention and you could put kid off much quicker and thehis doggedness is not there he wont keep plowing into it hell just know he felt bad so he doesnt want anything more to do with it its just snap adjudication dont you see so dont let anybody who doesnt know 212 backwards process children make it an absolute requisite that they get perfect results on adults before they are ever let near child with that proviso 212 works on children around five six seven eight nine in that range i dont know about the five but we already know about the later it works like dream they just sit there and they just saw wood and they work right away and theyll list like mad and so forth theyre cute as bugs ear on this stuff quite remarkable they rs perfectly and so forth but dont goof them up because they wont sit still long enough afterwards to be patched up you see why so dont let anybody be processing kids until they do very very very flawlessly well on adults all right lets get back to this deadhorse proposition im talking about all this opposition listing and frequency of rs and frequency of clean and so forth just as rundown of what i was up against in the represent list imagine my embarrassment to find represent list doing the same thing as an opposing listslightly less violent in other words it wasnt with exclamation points that it was doing it like it does it in an opposition list but all the signs were there now here was my question how in the name of common sense can you have wrong way to represent list well the first thing youd say well who or what would represent scientology to you then your wrong way could be what does scientology represent to you i mean thats the same thing so that isnt contained in it what does scientology not represent to you the same thing what does scientology represent to you see ive just been going around in circles here for days thats why you havent seen very much of ive been wearing out rug ive been walking in small circles how in the name of god i wonti wont say what i really said ill tell you exactly what i said its this exactly goddamnit how the hell can represent list be backwards you know pow and id go back at it again you know and id take look at this thing and so forth and these lists can go on and on and on and on and on because it was hole in 212 you guys had discovered it you too have made discoveries anyway thats what i said and even though it was profane i dont want withholds from you its so preposterous it took about ten days to wrap it up and its so simple hehheh its so simple it was very little to do with the wordinghehhehheh flaw in man is that he does not know himself you ask this guy have you got any enemies name your enemies and he says oh joe bill pete blah bo blah zaaa blah blah and thuhh and thuhh and zaaa and zaaa and zaaa and dadadadada dah automaticity see always can name enemies you say all right name yourself he says names joe end of list in other words the person is much more capable of observing enemies than selves so he gets on stuck flow of listing terminals and youve got to fix his represent list so he will list he gets on stuck flow of listing opposition terminals dont you see stuck flow of listing enemies because theyre so easy to list and youve got to give him list wording which permits him to list terminals and that is the wrong way to represent list i think somebody ought to take their hat off its taken about ten days to figure this confounded thing out thats what it is you say what iswhat does scientology represent to you and he right away figures in terms of enemies so he lists oppterm oppterm oppterm oppterm oppterm oppterm once in while he accidentally puts terminal on itvery accidentally oppterm oppterm oppterm oppterm he lists oppterm oppterm and oppterm oppterm oppterm and oppterm and i cant think of any more really thats the end of the list and you didnt have any rses wheres the silly rses furthermore if you keep doing this you will see that the needle is going clean and then dirty and then clean and then dirty and every time you try to go down this silly represent list you find you cant make it it goes too dirty to be nulled so you abandon that list and say who or what does present time consist of or in present time who or what are you in contact with or anything like that so he leans back and he says oppterm oppterm oppterm oppterm oppterm oppterm oppterm and oppterm oppterm oppterm and you say where the hell are the rses and youll find once more the needle goes clean and dirty now if youre lucky youll have some rses on it and youll find one once in while its almost impossible to get one backwards hell list terminal every now and then and it rses not just because its terminal but hell list an rsing terminal frequently enough to give you some rses see but hell give you an interminable list and hes liable to get down to the end of it and feel rather badgered by the auditor and the process and because hes now on stuck flow against his enemies and you watch those faces go black or greenin other words theyll darken hell start to look older faces will darken see going on stuck flow dzuh dzuh dzuh eyeballs get big red as fire its very visual these manifestations are not really tiny theyre quite marked if you know what youre looking for and you say well we didnt get any list with thatuhwhat does present time consist of letslets do one nowlets be very smart uhuh lets see in present time what have you been reasonable about or something like this and hell say oh yeah and hell list that oppterm oppterm oppterm oppterm oppterm oppterm oppterm well its very simple the case that gives you wrong way tolooking represent listeven with rock slams on it you know it behaves like wrong way to opposition listor the case that gives you dead horses see thats the same case actually is merely somebody whose next item up is terminal isnt this idiotic the next available item on the case is terminal youve got nothing but lists of oppterms grim joke huh i think its kind of lucky i figured this one out in other words before you get the terminal off the stack he hasnt got prayer and yet hes listing oppterms so of course youre never going to get the terminal off the stack you understand so hell just go on plowing himself in and the more he lists oppterms why the more it plowed into the mass he gets and the unhappier he gets about the whole thing and the more mest he feels the more hopeless he feels because whats the bypassed item its the terminal he is being right this minute in the session thats the bypassed item you got this now you see the circumstances of the wrong way to list of how this thing looks like cycling list it takes forever you can never get it cleaned upthe wrong way to list of course you know the dead horse type of list this also takes in the skunk list you know it keeps running out to item see those oddball lists are all under this same heading on represent basis which is present time consist of or something like that the pc is being asked questions which result in oppterms whereas the pc next item up and his case isnt going to go anyplace past this itemthe next item youve got to find on the case to make it whiz is terminal and youre not asking questions that give you any terminals you only get opposition terminals supposing his terminal was bad boy you might as well be asking we dont know this terminal bad boy you see because we havent found it or anything but were busy listing represent list were asking in essence in present time to bad boy see what does life consist of and hell give you schoolteachers masters truant officers police juvenile delinquency squads see and he goes on and on and on and you wantjust to make my point here sometime youwhen youve patched up pc where this is occurring find the item see and go back and take look at his two or three earlier dead horses youll find out hes done nothing but list the same item theyre all what awhatever you found see you found rabid skunk employed by the government or something like that you see you know hed fallen low man and youll find this one you go back and look at those early deadhorse lists he was listing theyll all be what this thing opposed you actually have done its opposition list but because he couldnt get grip on it these things werent rsing properly or anything else that doesnt mean you take the early lists now and compare them to the later lists you just go on with 212 you oppose this thing now he knows where he is obviously he knows where hes going but of course in view of the fact that he cant see from the terminal point of view what is the enemy of the terminal he then just is giving you such randomness that it is fabulous this again is not an index of how you find this but in actual fact he doesnt know from what point of view to look at the enemy so then of course he cant give you the right enemies he can just give you all of existence and there are quite few items in all of existence some of you may have found this out well thats how you can get wrong way to represent list which is the confoundedest thing i think i ever had anything to do with it sounds impossible when you look at it as piece of chinese puzzle work it just sounds impossible how could you possibly have wrong way to represent list well you could say represent and not represent that unfortunately does not solve it it does to some degree but it wont immediately give you long stream of rses itll make the pc feel better what does present time not consist of may not give you rses but itll make the pc feel better see but you dont get your item and were trying to do 212 see were not trying to make the pc feel better or worse were just trying to get our items and get the pcs bank in some kind of condition to find goals on actually what were trying to do is clear away his ptps get out of the road his hidden standards and open the highball for 321 and mostmost casesin fact practically all caseshave got ptps and hidden standards and those that have been cleared have been cleared in spite of these and in at least one case i know ofafter the case had gone clear couldnt quite stay clear you know keep falling off of it about every two weeks the ptp had never been gotten out of the road in other words the technique was powerful enough actually to clear somebody without removing the ptp andbut boy it had really taken some doing she slams on lrh and hershes been getting less clear and less clear and less clear im problem to her shes committed some overts you see she deserted her post and intended to cave in the place down there before she got clear and then shes nevernever straightened this out you see whats happened but this is pretty tricky its almost impossible see to clear or audit pc sitting there with ptp 212 oddly enough can be run on person with another ptp than the one youre picking up and you can still get the item i know ive had that as subjective reality lately suzie hadnt been bothering to clean up any ptps on to run the session and just before the session you see i get fifteen twenty telegramskennedy threatening to commit suicide unless you you know that kind of thing and i come into session you knowptp and i try to get them off and put my rudiments in she pays attention to it and goes on and it all lists up and packages are perfectly all right although the pc gets little dispersed at times in other words youre auditing the central ptp so actually you can audit beyond and by and along with current ptps you see well man you cant run 321 currently with ptp particularly ptp of magnitude to find goal the pcs attention has got to be all there so you have to get the big the big the big ptp that is unknown to the pc actually he doesnt know what his present time problem is hell give you lots of present time problems but hell never tell you what it is that ones in his road and then the hidden standard you know what hidden standard is the individuals hidden standard is if scientology is answered by this you can get list of hidden standards by the way what would have to happen to you for you to know that scientology really worked that is yourthe perfect question that gives you whole list of hidden standards youll be surprised my left ear would have to stop burning actually every time this person has ever been processed they look at their left ear see to see whether or not it is still burning now if the left ear is still burning then they know the process hasnt worked but if their left ear is burning little less then they know the process has worked slightly and they give you all of their goals and gains straight off an index of the burning left ear im not joking youll find this in vast majority of pcs if you search for it what would have to happen to you for you to know that scientology really worked just for fun sometime and as an exercise to understand hidden standard little better you ought to take somebody and have him list few but of course if you dont complete the list hes liable to have an arc break but anyhow hell give you whole bunch of these things you know his stomach would have to stop hurting or something well actually this hidden standard is quite interesting it is circuit which is telling him what to think and thats the 100 percent definition of what hidden standard is its circuit that is telling him what to think and its got some kind of signal system rigged up you know it works if thats actually communicationtype system its quite involved its like an automatic trainstoppingsignal system put up by the baltimoreohio or something you know like train stops at section 83 and the brakes potential brake shoes and lights go on in all other sections in that particular zone and area and small man jumps up with flag and waves it in the nose of the engineer and knocks his coffee cup out of his hand all kinds of super systems you know theyre very complex hidden standard is not simple system its circuitry response you see that is an item in other words that he consults and he says to this item is it true and the item has signal system by which it tells him whether it is true or false and most people you are expecting to leap up in the air and tell you oh yes i understand scientology works have first had to ask one of these systems quite interesting they dont think at all they read the record on one of these systems the fdagive you rather degraded example they think the whole world is composed of two valences theres two valences the world is composed of victims and victimizers there are other items the fellow manufactures cars hes victimizer fellow buys ear hes victim so of course hes dead against industry because all industry or manufacturers or managers or something are baddies and all consumers are victims everybodys victim that isnt an emanator of some kind see and those guys are victimizers lacking any other than these two terminals of course they themselves are victimizers and the only thing that they will ever create is victim those people will never create anything but victim and the more power they get the more victims they create nothing ever works out you finally get communism socialism superliberalosis of some kind or another where youve got all of thethe whole country the population is victim see theyre all victims now fellow who stands on his own two feetthis solves lot of riddles by the waythe fellow who stands on his own two feet in such government is regarded asthere must be something very wrong with him in other words selfreliance the worker who wants job or likes his job or somethingtheres something wrong with him so they just move him aside he something wrong with him they just get rid of that one quick because there can be such terminal life is sort of dreary game that goes on between all of these victimizers who have to be stopped and all of these victims and theres nothing else goes on in life its one of the weirdest looking pictures you ever wanted to take look at thats dogooder in first second third fourth and overdrive and thats all the tune he plays and hes trying to protect everybody from himself he gets down to point where everybody is his own victim thats all theall the way anything categorizes and this gets to be very very very upsetting to these boys because they eventually can see purpose in life except making more victims you see or holding off more victimizers or something look at all the elements of life that are missing in this type of combination you see nobody ever likes to buy cars nobody ever likes to make cars you see all those elements are missing there might be billions hundreds of billions of other types of valences but they miss all these so it gets down to this twopole proposition of course theyre pushover for anybody who comes along and says the poor worker oh the workers are victims huh oh oh well yes well lets see if we cant cut their hours and raise their pay and that goes on but it goes over whole cycle and as these boys pass into charge they take away all the pay and give them twentyfour hours as their daily schedule theyve done it in russia and all over the world im just not talking through my hat i really got one into the bantu down in south africa they were talking about communism communism oh marvelous stuff this communism oh boy ugugugugugl you know and i said do you realize that you dont get paid for working in communism and he says is that so i said yeah i said they dont give you any salary and they thought about this and they walked around in circles about it and that was the end of communism in south africa thats why it isnt down there now the white manhes not quite that smart he doesnt grasp this that quick hes not quick like that he doesnt recognize that the end product of this sort of thing is pay of any kind whatsoever but the bantu he was plenty smart he grabbed that in hurry actually you could just see them unload off the bandwagon in all directions id get to talking to them on street corner you know or the back lot or something like this and they always bring up these burning questions and i let them have few data well of course thats dogooder gone mad hes got nothing but victims left the way to handle him of course is to sympathize with him you know you poor fellow you know fate has not permitted you to get ahead the way you shouldve and hell go right from the victimmaker valence in which he is in seehell go straight into the role of the victim hes defeated instantly thats valuable datum for you to know because youll run into them plenty the world just abounds with them the practically consists of nothing else theyve made all the main congo victims now now theyve got all of katanga katanga was the victim maker you see they made victims out of theout of katanga they fixed them but good and now everybody can be victim and you watch it the next boy that comes in there to take control will be real victim maker hell be honey this has nothing to do with whether or not you like humanity if you like humanity you leave that kind of politics alone you think im rabid tory if i talk like that im just as rabid on the subject of tories im whats called indiscriminate and unspecialized in the number of oppterms i can list now youve got to look this over and recognize that onethat the thing man is tuned up to see first is an enemy and when they go completely potty they can see nothing but enemies everything is an enemy ive seen little beetle crawling across the floor and wondered whether or not he rock slammed on pt see thatd make everythingwas an enemy you know probably thats true this probably is your last rung of case you say present time and it rock slams like crazy see that immediately tells you that youve got nothingyouve got nothing you could list as represent list see because they all depend on present time as an understood factor thatd be pretty grim wouldnt it youthey could only oppose and heres the type of question you would ask you see your dogooder never recognizes hes victim maker he loses that thats out of sight thats missing hed never put down victim maker youd have to ask him question you havent got victim to list from dont you see so you have to ask him questiona simple question like this iswho or what in present time would have your problems and hell put terminals now youve got numerous variations of this nobody recognizes what he is being as easily as what he is facing in other words terminals are harder to pick up than oppterms at the entrance to case so you get wrong way to represent lists and you get dead horses and you get skunks and thats the source of all of these and you must ask question which delivers into your hands terminals you have somebody rock slamming on reasonable people and the list doesnt go anyplace or it cycles theres something wrong with it its going to be an endless list there isnt anything going to wind up on it it doesnt rs if you did null it it skunks that kind of thing youre going to ask him who or what would object to reasonable people in other words you can swingyou understand that you can run represent either way see you havethats not an oppose thats rather opposetype question i wouldnt recommend it but im just trying to give you the idea you say in present time who or what would have your problems youve got to ask him who or what in present time would live the life you are living in present time who do peoplewho or what do people think you are youim trying to teach you the method of thinking not give you bunch of pat lines to list see youve got to ask him question see by which he will list terminals it could be as simple as this whos looking at you wouldnt say what are you that is looking at you know you could ask him for something like this youd say whos looking at or who might be looking at or something like this and this character that had laid dead horses like crazy wrong way to represent lists nothing could null the thing always skunks and so forth would lay you down probably very nice rock slamming list which would rapidly terminate in reasonable number of pages would have less rock slams on the last page than the first page would be very nullable and you would be able to take off from there its just the accident some cases have an opptermprobably the majorityhave an oppterm as the first item up in other words all this is you not only see the pc deal cards off the top of the deck you know hes just like hes dealing deck of cards as his items pockpockpocketa pocketapocketapock hell just deal them out well thats actually just like deck of cards the first one comes first pcs very often dramatize the next item to the one that you are calling in other words that card is ready to come up next so its being restimulated all right similarly packages come up the same way and you can get ahold of pcthe majority of pcs the first item up is an oppterm theyre bit overwhelmed dont you see so theyre being an oppterm and so forth and they name an oppterm and it comes up very easily thats the side of the package thats going to materialize so you take it from there and you list it out and you oppose it and everything is fine haha yeah but these other characters that have been giving you bad timeand theyre not few that list wrong way represents and cycling lists you see and skunks and dead horses and any one of these manifestations endless lists that wont null on representthese characters simply have terminal as the next one up and of course youre asking an opptermtype list question so you must ask terminaltype list question the crudest rendition of it would be who the hell are you bud that would be very crude but is in essence what it is you say what problems do you have in present time remember that you you you you see thattheres you there and thats an undifferentiated pronoun so you have to back up back of it and differentiate that pronoun you say who or what are you in some way or another whod have your problems youve listed deadhorse list ask him who or what would oppose all these things youd get valid list see give him the list so he could hold them youll get rock slamming list you get the idea theres too many tricks in this theres too many ways you could do this for to overburden you with rote i just want you to firmly get the idea of what this is all about and that is that the majority of pcs can deal off an oppterm and go sailing see and youve got that as rock slamming item its reliable you oppose it and 212 works gorgeously thats the majority of them the rest of them that youre going to have trouble with have got terminal there as the next one up and unless you ask for that type of list bang so you more or less count on the fact that theyre an opptermtype case until proven otherwise and all of sudden you find this case is oaaughumbarupp dead horsing havent seen any big rses doesnt look good to you do flip list something else give you an example one of them was who or what would you hold off its liable to get terminal on it yet all right lets reverse this list and do it the other way to who or what would hold off things thatd be good enough you see to get terminal on the list they all dont that smoothly translate but you do type of list that gives the terminal and you wont have any more dead horses and wrong way to lists and thats how you can have backwards represent list okay thank you
