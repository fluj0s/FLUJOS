letter to congressional leaders urging them to include state assistance in an economic recovery plan arguing that as of today states are facing cumulative budget shortfall of nearly 100 billion after already closing 53 billion gap to make matte rs worse state finances will continue to deteriorate in the coming months perhaps years because of state balanced budget requirements state lawmakers are being compelled to cut spending increase revenues and delay important infrastructure projects actions that will prolong and deepen the effects of the economic downturn the state fiscal situation is so critical that it threatens the viability of essential state programs and services particularly those assisting vulnerable populations most disadvantaged by the recession 13 the letter included list of recommendations for an economic recovery plan that was similar to the list submitted to presidentelect obama earlier some of the differences included the addition of public university facilities to the list of suggested infrastructure projects request for temporary waiver of state matching requirements for infrastructure projects to ensure that these projects get started quickly and to temper the pressure that unfunded federal mandates place on state budgets the nations legislative leaders urge you to appropriate the promised 40 percent of costs for special education 14

g346g561 g561argued that one of the most effective sets of mechanisms the federal government can use to speed recovery is investments in existing federalstate programs because these programs are on going and therefore the funds can be obligated quickly and expedited efficiently16 specifically nga recommended that congress temporarily enhance the federal medical assistance percentage fmap for at least two years because funding for fmap is particularly effective countercyclical tool that immediately allows governors to eliminate planned budget cuts required to meet balanced budget requirements and continue services for those with the greatest need invest in readytogo infrastructure projects that are cost effective creator of high paying jobs these investments should include broad array of infrastructure projects including airports highways transit systems clean water sewers and broadband and change the tax code to spur economic growth and avoid policies that preempt state authority shift costs to states or impose new unfunded mandates 17 as negotiations on presidentelect obamas economic recovery plan got underway nga issued more detailed proposal for economic recovery entitled economic recovery federal state partnership18 the report issued on november 13 2008 reiterated ngas earlier argument that one of the most efficient set of mechanisms the federal government can use to speed national recovery is investments in existing federalstate programs these mechanisms are effective because the programs are ongoing nd because statebystate funding allocations administrative procedures and staffs already are in place to quickly distribute any additional funds19 the report argued that the programs with the greatest potential to hasten the recovery include countercyclical programs where federal government funding can help prevent proposed budget cuts that states would be forced to make because of their balanced budget requirements infrastructure investments that create jobs and safety net programs that assist people in the greatest need unemployment insurance medicaid 20 specifically nga recommended that an economic recovery plan include 1261 billion for states 617 billion for three countercyclical programs 574 billion for eight job creation programs and 7 billion for three targeted benefits programs 21 16 ibid 17 ibid 18 national governors association economic

philadelphia that governor mark sanford rsc opposed the presidentelects economic stimulus plan because we are just putting off the day of reckoning problem created as consequence of too much debt probably will not be solved by issuing more debt32 in letter to the editor published in the washington post on september 26 2008 governor sanford opposed federal government intervention in the financial crisis an everexpanding scope of federal commitment and power is not what made this country great expanded power in one place comes at cost in other places american cornerstones such as individual initiative and an entrepreneurial spiritborn in free and open societies with private property rights and the rule of lawhave never fit particularly well within the context of an evergrowing federal government 33 he also called on taxpayers to admonish those in washington to get their own financial house in order washington is the master of creative and unsustainable finance with 50 trillion in unfunded promises34 although governor sanfords arguments were presented in opposition to federal intervention in the marketplace they could be applied to the provision of federal assistance to state governments those who advocate restraint in government intervention in the marketplace typically advocate restraint by all levels of government including state government as result

g351g561 g561that depending on how it is structured it could increase the size and scope of state government according to this view state governments ve by their own choice through their state constitutions or by statute designed their state policymaking process to force themselves to make budgetary tradeoffs when state revenue fails to meet expectations it could be argued that because states purposively devised these systems to operate in this fashion the federal government should not interfere depending on ones ideological view point what one views as state fiscal crisis that needs to be fixed could be viewed by another as states adjusting to changed economic circumstances and living within their means another possible argument against providing fiscal assistance for states in an economic recovery plan is that most states have accumulated rainy day funds for times of economic distress the nga and the national association of state budget officers study of state fiscal conditions reported that states had 508 billion in total yearend balances at the end of fy 2008 and 48 billion set aside for fy200935 it could be argued that these funds should be exhausted before any federal assistance is provided to states it could also be argued that states that failed to accumulate enough in their rainy day funds to cope with the current economic downturn should suffer the consequences of their actions others might argue that states could not have foreseen the extent of the current economic downturn and its impact on state revenue also the amount states have set aside for fy 2009 varies with alaska 89 billion and texas 12 billion accounting for 43 of the fy 2009 total ten states alabama arkansas florida kansas illinois massachusetts michigan nevada new jersey and wisconsin reported in november 2008 that they had fy 2009 budget balances below 2 of state expenditures and seven more arizona california hawaii kentucky minnesota pennsylvania and rhode island reported balances below 3 36 another possible objection to the inclusion of financial assistance to state governments in an economic recovery plan is that while many states are experiencing fiscal difficulty so is the federal government it could be argued that with debt now estimated at over 106 trillion the federal government is not in position to subsidize states for example nick ayers the republican governors associations executive director reportedly advocates including state assistance in an economic recovery plan but was quoted as saying that the five democratic governors recommendation to increase the plans cost to 1 trillion went too far calling it essentially bail out of these states general funds and that now is the time to focus on finding costeffective ways to provide essential services without burdening future generations with ever greater debt 37 also house minority leader john boehner reportedly met with presidentelect obama on january 5 2009 to discuss options for an economic recovery plan and expressed concern about wasteful spending that might be attached to tax relief simply put we should not bury future generations under mountains of debt 38 others might argue that depending on how the federal assistance was structured that the federal government is not subsidizing states but as 35 national governors association and national association

of possible congressional interest relates to the manner in which federal assistance might be allocated among states if congress decided to include federal assistance to states in any economic recovery plan should congress target federal assistance to states that are anticipating budgetary gaps in the next few years or should it not concern itself with how federal resources are allocated among states if federal assistance is to be targeted to states with greatest need what criteria should be used to measure that need for example west virginia based on per capita income is relatively poor state yet it is not anticipating state budget gap in the next two fiscal years california is relatively rich state yet it is anticipating budgetary shortfalls both this fiscal year and next should california receive proportionally greater share of federal assistance under the economic recovery plan than west virginia gao has made several recommendations on federalstate allocation issues during the last recession the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 pl 10827 provided states 20 billion in temporary federal fiscal assistance 10 billion in unrestricted federal assistance and 10 billion in additional medi caid payments congress asked gao to study the programs impact on states gao reported that the funds were intended to provide antirecession fiscal stimulus to the national economy and to help close state budget shortfalls due to the recession that began in march 2001 gao focused its analysis on the 10 billion in unrestricted federal assistance and concluded that the unrestricted funds were not targeted to take into account differences among states in the impact of the recession fiscal capacity and cost of expenditure responsibilities rather the funds were allocated to the states on per capita basis adjusted to provide for minimum payment amounts to smaller states 39 it argued that because recessions affect states unevenly targeting unrestric ted funds to states most affected and with less available resources could yield better results40 it recommended that in the future congress use change in state unemployment rates as proxy for the recessions impact on the state and change in gross state product as proxy for state fiscal capacity when allocating federal resources to provide states fiscal relief during economic downturns 41 gao also reported in its analysis of jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 that providing states fiscal assistance during econ omic downturns raised the question of moral hazard the potential availability of countercyclical fe deral funds could discourage state actions to prepare for the fiscal pressures associated with recession states can prepare their finances for fiscal stress and budget uncertainty primarily through establishing budgetary reserves budgetary reserves sometimes referred to as budget stabilization funds or rainy day 39 gao federal assistance temporary

could be used in times of fiscal stress42 another issue of possible congressional interest is the possible impact proposed staterun infrastructure construction projects might have on the timing of an economic recovery plans fiscal stimulus 43 gao reported in its analysis of the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 that the first distribution of fiscal relief funds to states occurred about 19 months after the end of the recession limiting its effectiveness as countercyclical program44 much of the discussion concerning the role states might have in an economic recovery plan reportedly involves their role in overseeing infrastructure construction projects nga s recommendations for example included eight job creation programs all involving infrastructure construction projects one of the criticisms of infrastructure projects as shortterm means to stimulate economic activity is the relatively long timeline associated with moving infrastructure projects from planning to actual use for example the national surface transportation policy and revenue study commission reported in december 2008 that federal funds are currently distributed to stat and local transportation agencies along with many procedural strings that lead to excessive delays particularly for larger projects the complex process of planning evaluating environmental impacts and arranging project funding can take as long as 15 years an unacceptably long time in the face of immediate and growing transportation problems and in st to the evershortening cycle of private sector and entrepreneurial decision making 45 it could be argued that the need for an immediate economic stimulus suggests that an economic recovery plan should focus on tax credits and other direct spending proposals that arguably could provide for more immediate fiscal stimulus than infrastructure spending states counter this argument by focusing on readytogo infrastructure projects however in recognition of the time it takes to move even smaller infrastructure construction projects from planning to construction ngas job creation proposals included targets requiring the expenditure of federal assistance within two years for example 68 of ngas proposed 189 billion for highway projects 45 of its proposed 8 billion for mass transit projects and 61 of its proposed 1 billion for airport construction projects was to be spent within two years others might argue that the nations economic difficulties are so extensive that including infrastructure spending in an economic recovery plan is appropriate because even if its stimulative impact on the economy is delayed it will reinforce the more immediate fiscal stimulus provided by other programs in the plan it could also be argued that the nations infrastructure needs are so profound that infrastructure spending should be included in an economic recovery plan even if that spending has delayed stimulative impact on the economy for example the national surface 42 ibid p 5 43 for further program analysis see crs report r40080 job loss and infrastructure job creation during the recession by linda levine 44 gao federal assistance
