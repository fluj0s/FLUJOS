nations met at the first summit of the americas envisioning plan to complete free trade area of the americas ftaa by january 1 2005 faced with deadlocked negotiations the united states and brazil the ftaa cochairs brokered compromise at the november 2003 miami trade ministerial it moved the ftaa away from the comprehensiv single undertaking principle toward twotier framework comprising set of common rights and obligations for all countries combined with voluntary plurilate ral arrangements w ith country benefits related to commitments so far defining this concept has proven elusive causing the ftaa talks to stall and the january 1 2005 deadline to be missed at the fourth summit of the americas held in november 2005 brazil argentina uruguay paraguay and venezuela blocked an effort to rest art negotiations and further action has not occurred this report follows the ftaa process and will be updated periodically background and negotiation process following the 1980s debt crisis much of latin america embraced broad economic policy reform that included major strides towa rd trade liberalization this trend raised the prospect of previously unrealized idea free trade area of the americas ftaa among 34 nations of the region latin americas trade reform was christened the new regionalism to reflect the evolution from an old system of closed subregional agreements that dominated in the postwar era to one based on more open and deeper commitments both within and outside the regi on examples include the north american free trade agreement nafta the southe rn common market mercosur the andean community of nations can the revitalized central american common market cacm and the dominican republiccentral americaunited states free trade agreement caftadr combined with unilateral bilateral and multilateral efforts these subregional agreements have fostered trade opening with average applied tariff rates for the region falling from 40 in the mid1980s to under 10 by

progress in latin americas trade liberalization the multiple free trade agreements ftas that this new regionalism cultivated also created complicated rules and discriminatory trading patterns the impet us to simplify this situation combined with the conviction that trade liberalization is cornerstone for broader reform and development initially generated widespread interest in an ftaa the united states has led the ftaa effort in expectation that it not only would open markets for us goods and services but would provide benefits to the entire region by 1 increasing latin american trade with the large us market 2 fostering reciprocal trade among latin american countries and 3 encouraging more foreig n direct investment in latin america1 the ftaa negotiation process is organize d into nine working groups responsible for market access agriculture investment services government procurement intellectual property rights subsidies antidumping and countervailing duties competition policy and dispute settlement the groups are directed by the trade negotiations committee tnc and each is chai red by different country on rotating basis there is also consultative group on smaller economie s committee on civil society to provide input from nongovern ment parties eg labor academia and environmental groups technical committ ee on institutional issues and joint governmentprivate sector committee of experts on electronic commerce draft ftaa texts are released in all four official languages with bracketed text reflecting areas of disagreement since 1994 there have been four summits and eight trade ministerial meetings the first draft of the ftaa was adopted at the quebec city summit in 2001 and second draft at the quito ministerial in november 2002 at that time brazil and the united states became cochairs of the tnc and were charged with guiding the negotiating process to completion the third draft text was accepted at the november 2003 ftaa ministerial in miami soon thereafter th negotiations stalled and the january 1 2005 completion deadline was missed exposing more clearly challenges to the negotiation process especially the need to resolve di fferences between the united states and brazil if the ftaa is to move forward the breadth of an emerging resistence to the ftaa became clearer at the fourth summit of the americas held on november 4 5 2005 in mar plata argentina amid dramatic and sometimes violent protests against president george w bush and the ftaa which was not scheduled as the major topic of this summit it became evident that the hemisphere was divided over how to pr oceed total of 29 countries supported renewing negotiations and the united states pushed to set specific date in 2006 brazil argentina uruguay and paraguay the merc osur countries rejected this idea arguing that the conditions for achieving balanced and equitable agreement did not yet exist venezuela went one step further lobbying to end any further effort on the ftaa and to unify resistence against us policies and presence in latin america the summit declaration called for time to explore problems in the ftaa process while awaiting the outcome of the world trade organization wto doha development round indicating that there was and still is unified visi on on how to proceed with the proposed ftaahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20864crs3 2 2004 simple average most

development ba nk washington dc march 2006major negotiation issues the ftaa began as commitment by 34 countries to consider comprehensive trade agreement that would be accepted as si ngle undertaking mean ing all parties would have to agree to it as whole this proved to be challenging task given that us priorities differ from those of key latin am erican countries maki ng balanced and mutually acceptable agreement difficult to define as short review of the negotiating issues suggests market access and trade remedy issues market access is one of the most difficult challenges because two of the larg est regional economies brazil and the united states have different priorities the united states has the lowest average tariff rate in the western hemisphere of 43 85 for agriculture and 37 for industrial goods but maintains high peak tariffs related to tariff rate quotas trqs on agricultural products it also subsidizes many agricultural produc ts and has applied antidumping duties to concentrated group of industrial products st eel that latin ameri can countries export by contrast brazil has much lower peak tariff rates but much higher average tariff rate of 109 102 for agriculture and 110 for industrial goods and relies on other trade barriers as well2 the united states therefore has focused its attention on eliminating tariffs broadly whereas brazil and other countri want to address peak tariffs and trqs latin american efforts to address us trade remedy laws and domestic support programs have focused specifically on opening the us market further to the regions agricultural steel and textile exports agriculture is protected sector but it is important for latin americas economic output employ ment income and exports historically it has proven to be the most difficult area to liberalize yet many latin american countries consider tackling us agricultural trade policies central to any discussion on market access the united states is open to discussing many agricultural issues but has made clear that it will not negotiate domestic agricultural subsidies in regional pact arguing that 1 it would hurt us exporters in th latin american market relative to other agricultural exporting countries that subs idize and 2 it would diminish the us multilateral bargaining position on subsidies in the wto talks the summit declaration addressed this issue indicating that progre ss on agricultural issues in the doha round appears necessary to resolve this major sticking point in the ftaa3 other trade barrier issues the united states is also interested in nongoods trade areas in which it is very competitive services trade for example is vital issue including such important sectors as financia l services transportation engineering and professional services intellect ual property rights ipr g overnment procurement and competition policy are also critical us issues ipr violations throughout much of latin america have hurt us producers and country has laws equal to the united states in protecting intellectual property ipr rules however have been criticized for increasing the financial burden on veloping countries and there are competing views as to whether greater ipr protection will increase or diminish levels of technology transfer and foreignhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20864crs4 4 see crs report rl33258 brazilian trade policy and the united states by j f hornbeckdirect investment competition policy is nother difficult area because of the need to change regulatory regimes covering domestic economic activity in government procurement many latin american countries including brazil are reluctant to open up their systems preferring instead to support if not protect domestic industry participation labor and environment provisions discussion of bor and environment issues is key for us support of many trade agreements but resisted by developing countries advocates for incl uding these issues argue that lower standards provide an exploitive and unfair competitive advantage lower costs for exporting and attracting foreign investment and that higher us sta ndards should not be challenged as disguised barriers to trade environmental advocates also point to the social impact of failure to enforce pollution abatement and resource manage ment laws the united states continues to set precedents of including relevant provisions in bilateral ftas including more stringent rules in ftas with peru colombia and panama that would require enforceable labor rights as defined in the fundamental principles of the international labor organization ilo the ftaa debate has yet to focus on this concern status of negotiations twotier ftaa four years ago formal ftaa negotiations st alled as the tnc cochairs brazil and the united states have continued to meet to discuss the details of framework for moving ahead but negotiators face huge challenge in trying to reconcile their divergent priorities when the ftaa negotiations began they were predicated on the assumption that all countries could gain from compre hensive and inclusive agreement one that would address everything from market access to trade remedies and rulesbased issues currently it is unclear how many countri may be ready to accept such broad obligations this issue is highlighted in the debate between brazil and the united states and formed the basis for the novemb er 2003 miami ministerial compromise brazils leadership role among developing countries is cornerstone of its foreign policy which for its trade strategy means ac ting as counterweight to us influence in the region4 tension between the united states and brazil heightened in may 2003 when brazil challenged three us policy initiatives first was us pursuit of subregional and bilateral trade arrangements which brazil suggested isolates mercosur in the context of the ftaa negotiations second brazil argued th at us refusal to address agricultural subsidies and antidumping disciplines in the ftaa affected its key export sectors third the us offer of differentiated market access gave brazil the least favorable treatment brazil responded with its three track proposal requesting the united states 1 conduct separate market access discussi ons with mercosur the 4 1 arrangement 2 jettison investment services governme nt procurement and ipr issues along with agricultural subsidies and antidumping per us wish to the doha wto round and 3 include some rulesbased issues in the ftaa discussions the united states rejected this so called ftaa lite

procurement and investment while prioritizing mercosur trade and domestic market developm ent although the private sector may be more open to engagement w ith the united states brazils economy is one of the least dependent in latin america on th us market and has us preferential arrangement at stake to protect eg caribbean basin initiative cbi therefore there is pressure to accept deeper ftaa in place of unilateral preferences and brazil has instead pressed to begin usmercosur market access talks6 usbrazil differences were the major f actor determining the outcome of the 2003 jointlyauthored ministerial declaration although the ministerial declaration reaffirms the commitment to complete comprehensive and balanced agreement it does so in the context of rather unorthodox compromis the declara tion states that countries may assume different levels of commitmentsw ith common set of rights and obligations applicable to all countriesand may also choose within the ftaa to agree to additional obligations and benefits the additional obliga tions may be defined in plurilateral negotia tions with countrys benefits being linked to the obligations it undertakes the trade negotiating comm ittee tnc was instructed to clarify the differences which so far has not been possible outlook the fourth and last summit of the ameri cas at mar plata in november 2005 was punctuated by violent protests against pr esident bush and us policy in general as well as failure to set date for restarting ftaa talks some interpreted this as sign of diminished us influence in the regi on which could bode poorly for any hope of resurrecting the ftaa in the near future the united states however remains committed to the twotier framework and is continuing to work with brazil to forge solution to the impasse in the meantime latin americas new regionalism is thriving in the form of growing number of bilateral and plurilateral trade deals many anchored to the economies of brazil and the united states the fact default approach to stalled ftaa the united states implemented caftadr on au gust 2 2005 and has c oncluded bilateral fta negotiations with peru approved by congress in 2007 panama nd colombia the ustr framework for negotiating these ftas relies on similar language for many of the chapters with detailed ma rket access and other schedules developed for each country this approach allows for considerable fl exibility in addressing sensitive products and disciplines within comprehensive agreement that includes many of the critical ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20864crs6 issues such as services trade investment government procurement intellectual property rights labor and environmenta l concerns but avoids any ntion of domestic subsidies and antidumping as well as this approach has worked on bilateral basis opinions differ on this but ftas are being implemented the united states has so far not been able to replicate it for the ftaa nor has brazil stood still in the regional integration game mercosur has four associate members and succeeded in c onsummating longawaited political and economic pact with the andean community in october 2004 brazil pushed the regional integration effort further on december 9 2004 wh twelve countries agreed to form the south american community of nations loose agreement calling for lower tariffs and improved political dialogue the most sign ificant development occurred on july 2 2006 when venezuela became the first country to join mercos ur as full member although its membership has not been ratifie d by all mercosur countries president chávezs staunch antiamericanism and determined opposition to an ftaa bodes poorly for restarting the negotiations at any point in time bolivia has since sought to join mercosur which would unite in one trade pact nearly all opposition to the ftaa as the ftaa negotiations continue to fl ounder the trade dynamics of the region appear to be shifting the region may be heading toward competitive if not bifurcated approach toward economic inte gration with the united states and its ftas on one side and an expanding mercosur customs union appr oach on the other those countries still not committed to either such as the cari bbean nations which support restarting the ftaa talks would seem to be in an aw kward middle position given that developing country trade preference programs such as the andean trade preference act atpa and the caribbean basin initiative cbi are due to expire during the second session of the 110th congress the us trade strategy for the region may be up for reconsideration particularly if the wto doha round fa ils to reach successful conclusion the ftaa was initially proposed to simplif trade relations with balanced comprehensive single undertaking in which ll countries would be treated equally this approach proved to be too difficult to reconc ile slowing progress and giving way to host of subregional agreements that will likely further complicate trade and investment decisions if not the ftaa negotiations themse lves the lack of movement has created an opportunity for antiftaa forces so that getting the ftaa back on track in 2009 or later is one of the major challenges to u slatin america trade policy recent political realignments in latin america suggest this task may only become more difficult
