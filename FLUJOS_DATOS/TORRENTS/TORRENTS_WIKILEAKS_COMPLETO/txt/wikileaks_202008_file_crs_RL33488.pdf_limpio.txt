boundaries updated may 13 2008 wendy ginsberg analyst in american national government government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33488changing postal zip code boundaries summary since the zip code system for identifying address locations was devised in the 1960s some citizens have wanted to change the zip codes to which their addresses were assigned because zi p codes are often not aligne d with municipal boundaries millions of americans have mailing addresses in neighbor ing jurisdictions the result can be higher insurance rates c onfusion in voter registration misdirected property and sales tax revenues for municipalities and changes in property values some communities that lack delivery post offices complain that the need to use mailing addresses of adjacent areas r obs them of community identity because zip codes are the cornerstone of the us postal services uspss mail distribution system usps has long resisted changing them for any reason other than to improve the efficiency of delivery frustrated citizens frequently have turned to members of congress for assistance in altering zip code boundaries in the 101st congress house subcommittee heard testimony from members city officials and the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office that usps routinely denied local requests for adjusting zip code boundaries in peremptory manner it considered three bills that would allow local governments to determine mailing addresses for their jurisdictions since then usps has developed zip code boundary review process that promises every reasonable effort to consider and if possible accommodate municipal requests to modify the last lines of an acceptable address andor modify zip code boundaries the process places responsibility on district managers rather than local postmasters to review requests for boundary adjustments to evaluate costs and benefits of alternative solutions to identified problems and to provide decisions within 60 days if decision is negative the process provides for an appeal to the manager of delivery at usps headquarters where review based on whether or not reasonable accommodation was made is to be provided within 60 days the boundary review process coupled with more flexible attitude on the part of usps than was formerly the case ffers enhanced possibilities of accommodating community desires one accommodation that can often be made is to allow the alternative use of more than one city name in the last line of an address while retaining the zip code number of the livery post office this can help with community identity problems though not with problems such as insurance rates or tax remittances being directed by zip code congressional constituent desiring zip code accommodation should be made aware of the boundary review proce ss requirements the constituent should be informed that simply having approached local postmaster and been told that an adjustment would be disruptive and impractical is not part of the process the local postmaster has power to make changes and may be unaware of the headquarters instructions to make every reasonable effort to reach an accommodation this report will be updated onl if there is change in the process for altering zip code boundarieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33488contents background 1 z i p c d s r w i d l u s d u t s i d u s p s 1

issueschanging postal zip code boundaries constituents often turn to members of congress for assistance in securing changes to zip code boundaries usually because their mailing addresses do not correspond to the geographic and po litical boundaries of their municipa lities jurisdictions1 this report explains why zip c ode boundaries often are not aligned with geographic political jurisdiction bounda ries describes the kinds of problems that occur because of the misalignment and discusses efforts by the us postal service usps and congress to address these problems background the post office department began dividing large cities into delivery zones in 1943 inserting two digits between the city nd the state in the lower address line in 1963 the whole country was divided into five digit postal delivery codes termed zip codes by the post office that corresponded to the post offices where final sorting of mail was done and from which tter carriers were dispatched to make deliveries the term itself originally trademarked and always capitalized was an acronym for zoning improvement plan mass mailers were first re quired to use zip codes in 1967 and today their use is ubiquitous almost all mail is sorted by machines and the basis for sorting is zip code which has now expanded to 11 digits allowing mail to be directed to unique delivery point or mail box most custom ers still know only their fivedigit codes the first three direct mail to large regional sorting facility where mail is sorted for distribution to specific deliv ery post office identified by the fourth and fifth digits for example the zip code for alturas the county seat of modoc county in the northeastern corner of california is 96101 the 961 directs mail to the processing facility in re nevada which is the distributi on point for some california post offices such as alturas cedarville 96104 fort bidwell 96112 nd likely 96116 distinguished by the last two digits of the code reno is also the processing facility for zip codes in neva da beginning with 894 895 and 897 zip codes are widely used outside usps the postal service has contended that the zip code systems only purpose is to facilitate the efficient and orderly delivery of the mail nevertheless zip code information is readily available to the public and both private and governmental entities have found it conveni ent and accessible tool fo r many purposes unrelatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33488crs2 to mail delivery postal service competitors like fedex and ups use the zip code but the zip code also has been adopted by nondelivery entities as geographic locator providing convenient if imperf ect means of targeting populations for performing demographic research setting in surance rates estimating housing values remitting state tax revenues back to localities and directing advertising messages because zip codes are based on the locati on of delivery post offices they often do not correspond to political jurisdiction boundaries this means that millions of americans receive their mail from post ffices in adjacent towns villages or neighborhoods and their mailing addresses reflect the name and zip code of those post offices rather than the jurisdictions where they actually live this situation was not uncommon when zip codes were first assigned 40 years ago and it has become more common since then particularly in rapidly growing suburban areas the boundaries of many jurisdictions have ch anged with growth annexation and the incorporation of new communities on the outskirts at the same time usps has sought to reduce rather than expand the num ber of post offices as its retail business model has changed and in order to concen trate expensive laborsaving investments rather than duplicate them in nearby facilities problems caused by misalignment with municipal boundaries the widespread use of zip codes for nonpostal purposes has exacerbated problems for those postal patrons whose mailing addresses do not match their actual towns or cities of residence and frequently for the municipalities as well the following is sample of the problems th at have been brought to congressional attention higher automobile insurance rates for drivers who live in the suburbs but are charged city rate s based on their zip codes residents who are confused about where to vote in municipal elections because they do not distinguish between their voting and mailing addresses sales tax revenues rebated by states to the cities where they are collected often being misdirected because they are collected by merchants with zip code s in different jurisdic tions or by merchants who mail their products to custom ers knowing only their zip codes individuals being sent jury duty noti ces when they are not eligible to serve based on their actual residences emergency service vehicles bein g misdirected by confusion over what town call has come from based on mailing address

neighborhoods complaining that their housing values are diminished becau their mailing addresses place them in less prestigious communities in addition community may lack livery post office and complain that the need to use mailing addresses from neighbor ing towns robs them of their community identity for example even though haddon township2 nj is an incorporated municipality with 2006 estimated popula tion of 14484 people it has delivery post office and its residents receive mail from six different nearby post offices each with different zip code the mailing address of the haddon township municipal building is 135 haddon avenue westmont nj 081083 congressional hearing registers concern these problems and others were aire d in 1990 hearing of house postal subcommittee4 ten members of congress descri bed zip code alignment problems in their districts and statements were received from many local governments as well as the national league of cities the h earing considered three bills hr 2380 hr 2902 and hr 4827 that would have allowe d local governments rather than the postal service to determine local addre sses or zip code boundaries as solution to the widespread problems usps expressed strong opposition to these bills and said that depriving usps of control over the most basic tool of the postal trade the mailing address would be disastrous5 usps boundary survey found that more than 11 million deliveries6 were served by carriers who cr oss municipal boundaries and estimated that if delivery boundaries were realigned to match municipal boundaries 1600 new postal facilities and 10500 new ca rriers would be needed7 also to be considered was the availability of additional zip codes in certain large areas at of the end of 1989 924 of the 1000 possible threedigit comb inations already had been assignedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33488crs4 8 ibid 9 zip code boundary hearing pp 3 38 49 95 and 97 10 us general accounting office conflicts between postal

us postal service postal operations manual section 43951 washington usps july 19 2007in 20 areas 90 or more of the 100 possible zip codes already had been assigned and in houston all 100 possible zip codes had been used8 these arguments may have proved persua sive because the legislation never advanced nor have similar bills introduced in later congresses however usps also earned some criticism because of its perem ptory denials of local suggestions and an approach to local suggestions that was variously characterized as cold and haughty cursory unresponsive stonewalling and uncaring9 t h government accountability office gao then the general accounting office examined postal case files on 26 municipal requests for zip code changes only 2 of which were approved by u sps gao reported that usps not only could do better job of providing facts and reasoning to ex plain its decisions in individual cases but also could do more to resolve problem s caused by conflicts between municipal and zip code boundaries10 postal service attempts to resolve problems current usps process for realigning zip codes in the years since the 1990 hearing and gaos investiga tion usps has made concerted effort to develop proce ss for the regular review of zip code boundaries under section 439 of the postal operations manual the manager of the districts address management system ms is responsible for reviewing zip code assignments in his or her areas and propos ing changes if opera tional and financial conditions justify them increased growth in geographic area is the most common precipitating factor in such changes rule of thumb is that the establishment of 25000 new deliveries11 or 55 carrier routes is the th reshold for review of the need for zip code change and possibly ne w delivery station because changes are invariably sensitive locally and often involve consid erable coordination and investment approval from the district manager the mana ger of operations programs support the manager of processing and distribution and the district manager of customer service and sales is needed before the proposal can be sent to the area regional office if the area manager of delivery programs support reviews and approves the proposal he or she then sends it to the office of address management headquarters in tennessee for final revi ew before changes can take effect12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33488crs5 13 us postal service postal operations manual section 439211most of the analysis required is base d on operational consid erations but one of the questions manager of the districts ams must ddress is whether municipal boundaries will be crossed nd another is whether muni cipal officials have been asked to comment on the revised boundaries the guidance require s that officials should consider municipal boundaries and custom er interests in all zone splits if zip code that is being considered fo r adjustment crosses municipal boundaries consult municipal offices before submitting the proposal and consider all reasonable solutions13 proposed changes must be sent to the area office by december 15 for change to take place in july of the following ear changes are made on or around july 1 because mail volume is at low point th concentrating changes around this time is advantageous for variety of operationa l purposes especially for large mailers who generate most of the mail volume because they can make the necessary changes to their mailing lists in one operation before the heavy autumn mailings begin process for consid ering community or municipality suggestions while the requirement for regular re view of zip code boundaries has long existed because it is an operational necessity the process for considering requests from municipalities and community groups for zip code changes dates to march 1991 not long after the congressional hearin g referenced above it has taken some time for the process to become settled practice and for usps to adopt willingness to consider requests for boundary adjustme nts that are based solely on community identity concerns key event was november 18 1999 directive to the vice presidents in charge of each of the nine postal areas from john potter now postmaster general then senior vice pr esident for operations and deborah wilhite senior vice president for government re lations and public po licy the memorandum noted that review of correspondence w ith the public on the issue of zip code changes has indicated need for general improvement the memorandum then emphatically reemphasized the expectation that usps would give careful objective consideration to community wishes even if they were based solely on identity considerations as indicated when the review process was first implemented in 1991 just saying does not make identity issues go away in fact growth and the increasing use of zip codes as database links and demographic tools tend to make them worse over time if you receive municipal identity request and reasonable means of full or partial ac commodation can be identified offer it apply the customer surv ey process and move on requests can be denied but only based on appropriate objective reasons that are consistent with the review process postal policy is to offer any reasonable administrative or operational accommodation that can correct or allevi ate the municipal identity concerns the objective is to find ways to say yes not excuses for saying do not deny request out of concern that other communities will want the samehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33488crs6 14 usps has continued efforts to notify its employees of the new zip code policy which also was posted on the usps internal website in 2006 in december 2 006 usps sent an additional email reminder of the new policy to the services delivery and retail departmentsthing others will make requests in the case of identity customers measure the postal service by its impact on their daily lives when mailing iden tities generate negative effects on our customers properties households and associations even when caused by third party actions they are perceived as bad service and intrusive bureaucracy emphasis in original14 what the process requires the boundary review process requires any municipality and community group seeking zip code change to submit the request in writing to the manager of the district there are 80 dist ricts with any rationale and justification the local postmaster is not the decision maker his or her only responsibility is to forward any request received to the distri ct level and provide any dditional information requested by usps for the evaluation the district manager is to identify all relevant issues and potential solutions to them quantify the specific operational impacts and feasibility of the request meet with the group of proponents to discuss issues and explain potential alternatives and provi determination within 60 days if the proposal is denied the district manager must advise the proponent group in writing giving the specific reasons for nial the response must be base d on the results of the analysis and must advise the proponent group of the appeal process if the request is feasible the process then requires formal survey of all of the customers who would be affected by the propos ed change this is an important step because it might reveal that the proponent group was an activist minority and most customers would prefer not to notify th eir correspondents change their magazine subscriptions replace their stationery go to different post office to pick up left notice mail or perhaps to adopt differe nt community identity simple majority of the survey respondents is adequate for approval finally there is process in place for customers to appeal to headquarters an adverse usps determination of communitys request for change in zip code boundaries when municipal iden tity issues are i nvolved any proponent may appeal an adverse decision to the manager of delivery operations except in cases where potential accommodation was not implemented because majority of affected customers did not support it in the survey within delivery operations at headquarter s an operations specialist who works full time on boundary review ppeals takes over the case file and investigates to determine whether the district provided reasonable accommodation to the proposed change having knowledge of situati ons all over the country and of various accommodations that have been implemented the operations specialist is in good position to judge whether the district manager has fully applied the spirit and letter of the 1999 guidance made available to pr oponent on request to find ways to say yes the manager of delivery operations must make final decision on the appeal within 60 dayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33488crs7 15 us postal service comprehensive statement on postal operations 1991 washington 1992 p 47 16 information provided by telephone on june 14 2006 crs made followup call to the national league of cities nlc on january 25 2008 nlc stated that it had further comments on the issue 17 usps internal memorandum to vice presid ents area operations proper treatment of appeals zip code boundary review process november 18 1999 p 2there is some evidence that the boundary review process is having some positive effect usps has not ke pt statistics on resolutions in recent years but it did report that in 1991 the first year accommodati ons were reached in 64 of the first 28 reviews to be completed15 steve burkholder the former mayor of lakewood co and former point person for the national league of cities on the issue told crs that he believed usps was open to constructive dialogue and sincerely interested in resolving problems and that if other c ities followed the boundary review procedure reasonable accommodation often could be reached16 possible accommodations to resolve zip code complaints the most common form of request to the postal service and to members of congress is for new zip code for specific area most postal patrons may not realize that new unique zip code usually accompanies the creation of new delivery post office they also may not realize that delivery post office as opposed to retail station is major investment requiring lots of space loading docks sorting equipment access to major transportation routes and negotiations with several unions over work assignments however usps believes that such requests are fundamentally identity issues and are made because customers perceive new zip code as the only means of achieving postal identity17 in fact other options are often available and much simpler to achieve sometimes when excess capacity exists fairly minor adjustments in carrier routes can be made that will solve at l east part of communitys boundary problem it is complicated to make changes in the status quo and therefore disincentive exists to do so but sometimes it can be accomplished w ithout unacceptable disruption compromise solution that does not involve changing usps delivery structure is to allow customers to use an alternative city name in the last line of their addresses while not changing the zip code for exam ple the rapidly growing city of windsor heights ia still lacks its own post office but usps sorting m achines will accept the use of windsor heights ia 50311 rather than requiring customers in that area to use des moines ia 50311 which is where their post office is located usps will also accept windsor heights as valid city name for zip codes 50312 and 50322 post offices in des moines and urbandale respectively that deliver the rest of

the residents race or economic level for more information see jack m gettentag and susan m wachter redlining and public policy new york nyu press graduate school of business administration 1980mail to windsor heights residents18 when large portion of the mail was sorted manually this option could have caused missorting and delayed mail but today almost all mail is sorted by computer it should be noted that this alternative can help ameliorate community identity issues but not issues arising from use of zip codes for demographic redlining19 another option that can address community identity concerns is for municipalities and individuals to use community designation on the second line above the street designation of their addresses since usps sorting technology pays attention only to the last two lines this does not disrupt delivery and does not require special permission finally usps routinely works with large mailers to improve their address files sorting in some cases to 11 digits rather than the zip codes 5 digits if mailers care it should not be difficult to refine muni cipal mailing lists to conform to political jurisdictions and eliminate errors based on crude use of the fivedigit code what can member of congress do when members office receives request for assistance in persuading usps that new zip code or new post office is needed in certain area the most important thing to ascertain at the outset is the underlying reason for the request if the constituents are complaining about poor livery service then the postal service is likely to take the complaints seriously determine if they have merit and look for causes if they do usps is customer service organization and realizes it cannot ignore allegations of shortfa lls in service expectations if indeed population growth or obsolescence of delivery facility is leading to service problems usps wants to know it and to resolve the problems including any that may be traced to the condition of delivery facility or conf usion over zip code boundaries although congress does not appropriate money for postal construc tion projects and there is role for congress in the process by which facilities investments are given priority member can expect that referral of service complaints to the usps government relations staff will get atte ntion and response though quite possibly more than the citizens would get by bringing their complaints to usps directly more likely the request has nothing to do with delivery service but rather stems from community identity issues and concern centers on the zip code constituents are frequently unaware of the boundary review process in many cases constituents or municipal officials have approached letter carrier or local postmaster and been told that an adjustment would be disruptive and impractical the local postmasterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33488crs9 20 us postal service postal operations manual section 439321 21 email response from usps

and may be unaware of the headquarters instructions to find reasonable soluti ons to external municipal requests20 when informed of the boundary review pr ocess and of the availability of formal appeal if satisfactory accommodation is not reached municipal officials and community groups should feel empowered to take the steps that the process requires while in the past usps tended to brush off complaints based on community identity issues the organizations internal policies as described above quite firmly state that cursory negative response is longer permissible even if an accommodation cannot be reached the requirement to ex plain fully the reasons why based on comprehensive review of operational and co st data is insisted on by headquarters full explanation at least defuses the argument that the constituents are dealing with an uncaring unresponsive bureaucracy that can only be brought to heel through congressional pressure occasionally members will be asked to introduce legislation to force usps to establish zip code boundaries in statute only once has such piece of legislation become law the postal accountability nd enhancement act of 2006 pl 109435 120 stat 3261 required usps to assign single unified zip code to serve as nearly as practicable each of the following communities 1 auburn township ohio 2 hanahan south carolina 3 bradbury california 4 discovery bay california those zip codes are currently active according to usps21 behindthescenes pressure however may be less effective on the postal service than it can be with other less independent agencies usps does not rely upon appropriations from congress for its operations22 and the postal reorganization act of 197023 has several provisions designed to shield it from political interference 39 usc 101 g finally constituent should not be advise d that he or she may simply substitute the preferred city name befo re the zip code in an address line without receiving usps permission to do so usps computers have internal checks that compare the zip code with the proper city name if the two do not match fault sequences come into play and mail very likely will be directed to the wrong delivery post office certainly causing delay and possibly causing the mail to be returned as undeliverable
