stokes black fears of barack obama assassinationby toby harnden in memphis last updated 245am bst 07042008 four decades after martin luther king was murdered black americans are torn between the hope that barack obama will reach the white house and the fear that he too could fall to an assassins bullet martin luther king standing with other civil rights leaders on the balcony and rev kyles in the same spot electing the first black president of the united states would be dramatic step in achieving dr kings dream of racial equality full coverage of the us elections 2008 alex spillius hillary clintons rocky road rupert murdochs daughter to hold obama fundraiser but the anniversary of the 1968 slaying of the civil rights icon at the lorraine motel in memphis is painful reminder of just how fragile that dream remains you know it an assassination of mr obama can happen the reverend billy kyles 73 who spent the last hour of dr kings life with him told the daily telegraph advertisement it has happened for blacks who have done less than get that close to the presidency the closer he mr obama gets to it we think in many cases that its more likely that its going to happen rev kyles pastor of the monumental baptist church in memphis for the past 49 years was with dr king and another preacher ralph abernathy who died in 1990 in room 306 of the motel for the hour before the assassination martin luther king had preached himself through the fear of death and that day he was different guy lighthearted he was telling jokes it was just three guys kind of hanging out shortly before 6pm he and dr king went out onto the balcony and looked out over the supporters gathered below i said guys come on lets go we have rally tonight i had just walked to go down the stairs i got about five steps and the shot rang out kerpow he looked around to see dr king on the floor watch martin luther king remembered wreath still hangs at the former lorraine motel i rushed to his side there was tremendous hole in the side of his face there was big wound under his shirt that i could not see and there was just so much blood i remembered my father dying and his colour changing in death i saw that same thing with martin luther king dr king was 39 mr obama 46 was given full secret service protection last may it was the earliest juncture for any presidential candidate since the practice was first introduced following the assassination of senator robert kennedy two months after dr king died from shot fired by james earl ray an escaped convict and racist the prospect of mr obama meeting similar fate is etched deep in the collective psyche of many american blacks particularly those old enough to remember the events of 1968 who overwhelmingly back the illinois senator over his rival hillary clinton for the democratic nomination mr obama tells anyone who raises the subject to stop worrying and take comfort in the knowledge that neither dr king nor senator kennedy had the secret service with them though his wife michelle has spoken of safety concerns the candidate himself plays them down partly for fear that some might be dissuaded from voting for him because of misguided notion of protecting him last month when his motorcade sped past dealey plaza where president john f kennedy was shot dead in 1963 mr obama said he was too busy focussing on the speech he was about to give even to register what had happened there obama is greeted by supporters in wyoming mrs clinton and john mccain the republican nominee are to travel to memphis for the 40th anniversary commemorations on friday mr obama was due to be campaigning that day in muncie the indiana town where on april 4th 1968 senator kennedy broke the news to stunned crowd that dr king was dead his campaign however has postponed the muncie event citing logistical issues at the main bus station in memphis city blighted by urban decay and split evenly between blacks and whites the grim prospect of mr obamas assassination was raised several times without prompting people say that if he makes it someone will have him killed said cheryle boyd 47 cleaner they say it would be the ku klux klan or maybe the mafia the ones that got john f kennedy im trying not to let it worry i pray that if he is elected then he serves his time and goes on with his life but hes black and if he wins the presidency over caucasian then it would be trouble theres some i know that has voted for hillary because they say that obama wouldnt last year gregory jiles 44 concrete factory worker said weve talked about it at work if hes elected then it would be beautiful thing for us to be able to vote for him is the opportunity of lifetime but if something happened to him it would prove that the united states hadnt moved forward at all sheryl goens 59 physical therapist said it would be very dangerous for obama to be elected he stands for lot of the same things martin luther king stood for plus the kennedys are backing him rev kyles urged people to overcome their anxieties you have to put those fears aside and let the secret service do their job the worry about an assassination he suggested was linked to the early assumption among many blacks that mr obama could not win the white house ive almost had to deprogramme my own mind i was saying hell run good race but he wont succeed but its kept lasting and lasting and lasting wow this is exciting one of the thrills i got was seeing people holding out little white babies for him to kiss what would dr king think of mr obamas campaign hed be jubilant and i am too i knew it would happen but i didnt know when and i wasnt expecting it this soon post this story to delicious digg newsvine nowpublic reddit fark related articles rupert murdochs daughter to
