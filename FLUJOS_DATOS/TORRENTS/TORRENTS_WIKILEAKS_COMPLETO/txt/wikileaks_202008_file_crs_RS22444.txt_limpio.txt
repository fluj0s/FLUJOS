wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22444 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rs22444 net neutrality background and issues angele gilroy resources science and industry division november 24 2008 abstract some policymakers contend that more specific regulatory guidelines may be necessary to protect the marketplace from potential abuses which could threaten the net neutrality concept others contend that existing laws and fcc policies are sufficient to deal with potential anticompetitive behavior and that such regulations would have negative effects on the expansion and future development of the internet while consensus on this issue has not yet formed the 110th congress continues to address the debate over net neutrality largely within the broader issue of telecommunications reform net neutrality legislation has been introduced in the house hr 5353 hr 5994 and the senate s 215 order code rs22444 updated november 24 2008 net neutrality background and issues angele gilroy specialist in telecommunications resources science and industry division summary as congressional policymakers continue to debate telecommunications reform major point of contention is the question of whether action is needed to ensure httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22444 unfettered access to the internet the move to place restrictions on the owners of the networks that compose and provide access to the internet to ensure equal access and nondiscriminatory treatment is referred to as net neutrality there is single accepted definition of net neutrality however most agree that any such definition should include the general principles that owners of the networks that compose and provide access to the internet should not control how consumers lawfully use that network and should not be able to discriminate against content provider access to that network concern over whether it is necessary to take steps to ensure access to the internet for content services and applications providers as well as consumers and if so what these should be is major focus in the debate over telecommunications reform some policymakers contend that more specific regulatory guidelines may be necessary to protect the marketplace from potential abuses which could threaten the net neutrality concept others contend that existing laws and fcc policies are sufficient to deal with potential anticompetitive behavior and that such regulations would have negative effects on the expansion and future development of the internet while consensus on this issue has not yet formed the 110th congress continues to address the debate over net neutrality largely within the broader issue of telecommunications reform net neutrality legislation has been introduced in the house hr 5353 hr 5994 and the senate s 215 this report will be updated as events warrant network neutrality as congressional policymakers continue to debate telecommunications reform major point of contention is the question of whether action is needed to ensure unfettered access to the internet the move to place restrictions on the owners of the networks that compose and provide access to the internet to ensure equal access and nondiscriminatory treatment is referred to as net neutrality there is single accepted definition of net neutrality however most agree that any such definition should include the general principles that owners of the networks that compose and provide access to the internet crs2 should not control how consumers lawfully use that network and should not be able to discriminate against content provider access to that network what if any action should be taken to ensure net neutrality has become major focal point in the debate over broadband or highspeed internet access regulation as the marketplace for broadband continues to evolve some contend that new regulations are needed and if enacted will slow deployment of and access to the internet as well as limit innovation others however contend that the consolidation and diversification of broadband providers into content providers has the potential to lead to discriminatory behaviors which conflict with net neutrality principles the two potential behaviors most often cited are the network providers ability to control access to and the pricing of broadband facilities and the incentive to favor networkowned content thereby placing unaffiliated content providers at competitive disadvantage1 in 2005 two major actions dramatically changed the regulatory landscape as it applied to broadband services further fueling the net neutrality debate in both cases these actions led to the classification of broadband internet access services as title i information services thereby subjecting them to less rigorous regulatory framework httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22444 than those services classified as telecommunications services in the first action the us supreme court in june 2005 decision national cable telecommunications association v brand x internet services upheld the federal communications commissions fcc 2002 ruling that the provision of cable modem service ie cable television broadband internet is an interstate information service and is therefore subject to the less stringent regulatory regime under title i of the communications act of 19342 in second action the fcc in an august 5 2005 decision extended the same regulatory relief to telephone company internet access services ie wireline broadband internet access or dsl thereby also defining such services as information services subject to title i regulation3 as result neither telephone companies nor cable companies when providing broadband services are required to adhere to the more stringent regulatory regime for telecommunications services found under title ii common carrier of the 1934 act4 however classification as an information service does not free the service from 1 the practice of consumer tiering that is the charging of different rates to subscribers based on access speed is not the concern access tiering that is the charging of different fees or the establishment of different terms and conditions to content services or applications providers for access to the broadband pipe is the focus of the net neutrality policy debate 2 47usc 151 et seq for full discussion of the brand x decision see crs

discussion of title i versus title ii regulatory authority see crs report rl32985 cited above crs3 regulation the fcc continues to have regulatory authority over information services under its title i ancillary jurisdiction5 simultaneous to the issuing of its august 2005 information services classification order the fcc also adopted policy statement outlining the following four principles to encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public internet 1 consumers are entitled to access the lawful internet content of their choice 2 consumers are entitled to run applications and services of their choice subject to the needs of law enforcement 3 consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network and 4 consumers are entitled to competition among network providers application and service providers and content providers fcc chairman martin has not called for their codification however he stated that they will be incorporated into the policymaking activities of the commission6 for example one of the agreed upon conditions for the october 2005 approval of both the verizonmci and the sbcatt mergers was an agreement made by the involved parties to commit for two years to conduct business in way that comports with the commissions september 2005 internet policy statement7 in further action att included in its concessions to gain fcc approval of its merger to bellsouth to adhering httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22444 for two years to significant net neutrality requirements under terms of the merger agreement which was approved on december 29 2006 att agreed to not only uphold for 30 months the fccs internet policy statement principles but also committed for two years to stringent requirements to maintain neutral network and neutral routing in its wireline broadband internet access service8 in perhaps one of its most significant actions relating to its internet policy statement to date the fcc on august 1 2008 ruled that comcast corp provider of internet access over cable lines violated the fccs policy statement when it selectively blocked peertopeer connections in an attempt to manage its traffic9 this practice the fcc concluded unduly interfered with internet users rights to access the lawful internet content and to use the applications of their choice while monetary penalties were imposed comcast is required to stop these practices by the end of 2008 comcast stated that it will comply with the order but it has filed an appeal in the us dc court of appeals separately in an april 2007 action the fcc released notice of inquiry wc docket 0752 which is still pending on broadband industry practices seeking 5 title i of the 1934 communications act gives the fcc such authority if assertion of jurisdiction is reasonably ancillary to the effective performance of its various responsibilities the fcc in its order cites consumer protection network reliability or national security obligations as examples of cases where such authority would apply see paragraph 36 of the final rule summarized in the federal register cite in footnote 3 above 6 see httpwwwfccgovheadlines2005html august 5 2005 fcc adopts policy statement on broadband internet access 7 see httphraunfossfccgovedocs_publicattachmatchdoc261936a1pdf it should be noted that applicants offered certain voluntary commitments of which this was one 8 see httphraunfossfccgovedocs_publicattachmatchdoc269275a1pdf 9 see httphraunfossfccgovedocs_publicattachmatchfcc08183a1pdf crs4 comment on wide range of issues including whether the august 2005 internet policy statement should be amended to incorporate new principle of nondiscrimination and if so what form it should take on january 14 2008 the fcc issued three public notices seeking comment on issues related to network management including the nowcompleted comcast ruling and held two february 25 and april 17 2008 public hearings specific to broadband network management practices network prioritization as consumers expand their use of the internet and new multimedia and voice services become more commonplace control over network quality also becomes an issue in the past internet traffic has been delivered on best efforts basis the quality of service needed for the delivery of the most popular uses such as email or surfing the web is not as dependent on guaranteed quality however as internet use expands to include video online gaming and voice service the need for uninterrupted streams of data becomes important as the demand for such services continues to expand network broadband operators are moving to prioritize network traffic to ensure the quality of these services prioritization may benefit consumers by ensuring faster delivery and quality of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22444 service and may be necessary to ensure the proper functioning of expanded service options however the move on the part of network operators to establish prioritized networks while embraced by some has led to number of policy concerns there is concern that the ability of network providers to prioritize traffic may give them too much power over the operation of and access to the internet if multitiered internet develops where content providers pay for different service levels the potential to limit competition exists if smaller less financially secure content providers are unable to afford to pay for higher level of access also if network providers have control over who is given priority access the ability to discriminate among who gets such access is also present if such scenario were to develop the potential benefits to consumers of prioritized network would be lessened by decrease in consumer choice andor increased costs if the fees charged for premium access are passed on to the consumer the potential for these abuses however is significantly decreased in marketplace where multiple competing broadband providers exist if network broadband provider blocks access to content or charges unreasonable fees in competitive market content providers and consumers could obtain their access from other network providers as consumers and content providers migrate to competitors market share and profits of the offending network provider will decrease leading to corrective action or failure however this scenario assumes that every market will have number of equally competitive broadband options from which to choose and all competitors will have equal access to if not identical at least comparable content despite the fccs ability to regulate broadband services under its title i ancillary authority and the issuing of its broadband principles some policymakers feel that more specific regulatory guidelines may be necessary to protect the marketplace from potential abuses consensus on what these should specifically entail however has yet to form others feel that existing laws and fcc policies regarding competitive behavior are sufficient to deal with potential anticompetitive behavior and that action is needed and if enacted at this time could result in harm crs5 the congressional debate the issue of net neutrality and whether legislation is needed to ensure access to broadband networks and services has become major focal point in the debate over telecommunications reform10 those opposed to the enactment of legislation to impose specific internet network access or net neutrality mandates claim that such action goes against the long standing policy to keep the internet as free as possible from regulation the imposition of such requirements they state is not only unnecessary but would have negative consequences for the deployment and advancement of broadband facilities for example further expansion of networks by existing providers and the entrance of new network providers would be discouraged they claim as investors would be less willing to finance networks that may be operating under mandatory buildout andor access requirements application innovation could also be discouraged they contend if for example network providers are restricted in the way they manage their networks or are limited in their ability to offer new service packages or formats such legislation is not needed they claim as major internet access providers have stated publicly that they are committed to upholding the fccs four policy principles11 opponents also state that advocates of regulation cannot point to any widespread behavior that justifies the need to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22444 establish such regulations and note that competition between telephone and cable system providers as well as the growing presence of new technologies eg satellite wireless and power lines will serve to counteract any potential antidiscriminatory behavior furthermore opponents claim even if such violation should occur the fcc already has the needed authority to pursue violators they note that the fcc has not requested further authority12 and has successfully used its existing authority in the august 1 2008 comcast decision see above as well as in march 3 2005 action against madison river communications in the latter case the fcc intervened and resolved through consent decree an alleged case of port blocking by madison river communications

mccormick president and ceo of the united states telecom association hearing on net neutrality before the senate commerce committee february 7 2006 cited above 12 fcc chairman martin has indicated that the fcc has the necessary tools to uphold the fccs stated policy principles and has not requested additional authority furthermore chairman martin has stated that he is confident that the marketplace will continue to ensure that these principles are maintained and is confident therefore that regulation is not nor will be required see chairman kevin j martin comments on commission policy statement at httphraunfossfccgovedocs_publicattachmatchdoc260435a2pdf however fcc commissioner copps in an april 3 2006 speech did express concerns over the concentration in broadband facilities providers and their ability and possibly even the incentive to act as internet gatekeepers and called for national policy on issues regarding consumer rights internet openess and broadband deployment see httphraunfossfccgov edocs_publicattachmatchdoc264765a1pdf for copy of commissioner copps speech crs6 exchange telephone company13 the full force of antitrust law is also available they claim in cases of discriminatory behavior proponents of net neutrality legislation however feel that absent some regulation internet access providers will become gatekeepers and use their market power to the disadvantage of internet users and competing content and application providers they cite concerns that the internet could develop into twotiered system favoring large established businesses or those with ties to broadband network providers while market forces should be deterrent to such anticompetitive behavior they point out that todays market for broadband delivery is largely dominated by only two providers the telephone and cable television companies and that at minimum strong third player is needed to ensure that the benefits of competition will prevail14 the need to formulate national policy to clarify expectations and ensure the openness of the internet is important to protect the benefits and promote the further expansion of broadband they claim the adoption of single coherent regulatory framework to prevent discrimination supporters claim would be positive step for further development of the internet by providing the marketplace stability needed to encourage investment and foster the growth of new services and applications furthermore relying on current laws and casebycase anti httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22444 trustlike enforcement they claim is too cumbersome slow and expensive particularly for small startup enterprises15 activity in the110th congress while consensus on this issue has not yet formed the 110th congress continues to address the debate over net neutrality largely within the broader issue of telecommunications reform house telecommunications and the internet subcommittee chairman markey strong advocate of net neutrality legislation in the previous congress introduced legislation hr 5353 to address this issue and held may 6 2008 hearing on the measure house judiciary chairman conyers introduced hr 5994 bill which establishes an antitrust approach to address anticompetitive and discriminatory practices by broadband providers as followup to march 11 2008 hearing on net neutrality held by the house judiciary antitrust task force standalone net neutrality measure s 215 has been introduced and referred to the senate commerce science and transportation committee where an april 22 2008 hearing on the future of the internet was held 13 the fcc entered into consent decree with madison river communications to settle charges that the company had deliberately blocked the ports on its network that were used by vonage corp to provide voice over internet protocol voip service under terms of the decree madison river agreed to pay 15000 fine and not block ports used for voip applications see
