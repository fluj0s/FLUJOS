future declines in nasas budget although not set in law congress and the white house had agreed to cap spac station funding at 21 billion annually and 174 billion total from fy1994 to completion of assembly this was done to add stability to the program and limit the amount of funds that went to iss versus other nasa programs concerns about russias ability to fulfill it s commitment to the program and the recent cost overruns have caused congress and the white house to abandon the cost caps the concern of many in congress is that in declining budget environment shifting additional funding to the space statio n would come at the expense of other nasa programs this concern is amplified by prospects for lower agency budgets in the outyears the fy1998 r equest had an outyear fy1999 level of 132 billion press report s indicate that the agencys budget reques t in fy1999 might be as low as 126 billion many agency observers question whether nasa in declining budget atmosphere can continue to fund new programs and initiatives let alone fund all ongoin g programs space station cost overruns and reports of lower than expected outyear budgets adds further credence to those concerns nasa asserts that its budget does fund balanced program and that efforts to undertake its missions faster cheaper and better have allowed the agency to increase the number of science missions
