care is needed for example when person needs assistance with bathing walking or transferring from bed to chair to be eligible for medicarecovered skilled nursing facility snf care physician must certify that the beneficiary needs daily skilled nursing care or other skilled rehabilitation services that are related to the hospitalization1 and that these services as pr actical matter can be provided only on an inpatient basis for example be neficiary released from the hospital after stroke and in need of physical therapy or beneficiary in need of skilled nursing care for wound treatment following surgical pr ocedure might be eligible for medicare covered snf care snf services may be offered in free standing or hospita lbased facility freestanding facility is generally part of nursing

payment the rapid growth of medicare payments to snfs during the 1990s focused congressional attention on the payment syst em from the inception of the medicare program in 1966 snfs were paid using reas onable cost reimburse ment in other words medicare paid snfs their actual costs of delivering care to medicare beneficiaries thus snfs had few incentives to control costs system that many regarded as inherently inflationary although there were limits on routine service costs10 there were limits on ancillary costs11 which the general accountability office gao and others noted helped fuel the large increases in snf costs in the early 1990s12 in response to escalating snf spe nding congress enacted number of provisions in the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 to control growth in this benefit chief among these provisions was the requirement to implement prospective payment system pps for snfs being paid through the fee forservice delivery system snf paymen ts made by medicare advantage for managed care enrollees are paid based on the terms negotiated between the medicare advantage plan and the particular provider and are not necessarily paid using the snf pps system snf pps in the bba 97 congress required the secr etary of health and human services to establish pps for snf care beginning july 1 1998 the new payment system was implemented on staggered basis beginning with the start of each snf cost reporting period13 on or after july 1 1998 nd phased in over three years14 under the snf pps snf receives daily paymen t that covers all the services provided that day including room and board nursi ng therapy and drugs as well as an estimate of capitalrelated costs15 any profits are retained by the snf and any losses must be absorbed by the snf thereby providing an incentive to deliver services as efficiently as possiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33921crs7 16 snfs use an assessment tool called the minimum data set mds to evaluate and record the health status and functional capab ilities of residents in nursing homesbase payment the daily base payment is based on 1995 costs that have been increased for inflation and vary by urban or rural location this federal per diem rate is adjusted for treatment type and care needs of the beneficiary based on the resource utilization group rug assignment of the beneficiary the beneficiary is classified into one of 53 rug categories each rug represents payment adjusted for case mix and is composed of three parts fo r rugs used to pay for the care of patients who require intensive therapy the three parts include nursing component b variable therapy component and c noncase mix ad justed flat rate component for rugs used to pay for the care of patients who do not require intensive therapy the three components are nursing component b flat therapy component and c noncase mix adjusted flat rate compone nt for 2007 the per diem base amounts range from 58310 to 15760 for urban facilities and from 60924 to 15670 for rural facilities patient ssessments are done at various times during patients stay16 and the rug category in which patient is placed can change with changes to the patients

affected by specific legislative provisions summary of the more recent legislative changes follows in response to concerns raised by th nursing home industry regarding adequacy of snf pps payments temporary payment increases were provided in the balanced budget refinement act of 1999 bbra 99 pl 106113 and the medicare medicaid and schip benefits improveme nt and protection act of 2000 bipa 2000 pl 106554 two of the three temporary increases expired september 30 2002 one from bbra 99 increased the snf base rate s 4 for fy2001 and fy2002 the second from bipa 2000 was 166 increase in the nursing component of the payment rate from april 1 2001 until september 30 2002 the dollar value of these two temporary increases was 14 billion in 200217 the expiration of these addons has been dubbed by some in the industry as the snf cliffs the third temporary increase from bbra 99 as amended by bipa 2000 increased payment rates by 67 for 14 rug groups for persons needing rehabilitation therapies and by 20 for 12 rug groups for certain patients needing complex care these addons were intended to correct for distortion in the payment system for rehabilitation therapy which had been paying by the number of minutes of therapy rather than by the patients clinical characteristics the costs of providing nontherapy ancillary services eg prescr iption drugs and the relative weights of basing payments on old data18 the addons expired with the implementation of the refinements to the casemix cla ssification system on january 1 200619 the medicare prescription drug improve ment and moderniz ation act of 2003 pl 108173 provided for temporary 128 increase in the pps per diem payment for any snf resident who is hivpositive or has acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids effective

medicare and medicaid services cms the agency that administers medicare within the department of health and human services has been c onducting research on refinements to the rugs to ensure adequacy of paymen ts in april 2000 the secretary proposed refining the rugs by adding payment cat egories to better compensate snfs for providing care to medically complex patie nts as well as to better account for the nontherapy ancillary service costs suc h as prescription drugs and respiratory therapy however the proposal was w ithdrawn when upon further analysis cms determined that the existing rugs di d better job than the proposed ones in describing differences in patient resour ce use later that year bipa 2000 required the secretary to study different systems for categorizing snf patients and to report to congress by january 1 2005 with th results and any recommendations for changing the snf pps statute reports published in 2002 and 2003 by the gao and medpac further emphasized the importance of refining th pps rug system both reports raised concerns that payment rates for certain ty pes of patients were not adequate because the patient classification system did not sufficiently account for the different care needs of patients they also noted that the therapy rugs were paid at levels that far exceed costs and were thus highly profitable for certain providers20 refining the rugs so that payments are better aligned w ith the actual resources used in caring for patients they asserted would eliminate incentives to care for one kind of patient over another

also authorized the incorporation of the office of management and budgets revised definitions for metropolitan statistical areas and combined statistical areas used to distinguish payment adjustments for snfs located in urban and rural areas the refined rug system became effective on january 1 2006 it is still too soon to know whether the refined case mix system is adequate or will warrant additional refinements spending the pps system was intended to help control spending on snf care and since its application the spending growth ra has slowed from 17 average annual growth rate between 1994 and 1998 prepps to 13 average annual growth rate between 2000 and 2004 postpps however spending on snf care continues to increase such expenditure growth may in part be attributable to growth in the number of snf admissions as well as growth in number of snf days between 1999 and 2003 the number of admissions increased from 18 million in 1999 to 24 million in 2003 this represents an average annual in crease of 7 exceeding the growth rate in the medicare population during that period ie 12 for part a21 spending growth may also be attributable to recent changes in the the rug classification system since the refinement of the payment system medpac has seen shift in the utilization of the higher rehabilitation casemix groups each of which is also attached to higher payment rate as result the program is now paying for more therapy and less for nursing and other items relative to prior years22 supply one indicator of payment adequacy is provider supply the number of snf providers nationwide remained rela tively steady between 1999 and 2004 medpac reports that freestanding snfs grew an average of 37 annually between 2000 and 2004 it also reports that forprofit fac

the concern that only about half of the nations seniors had health insurance and most of those only had coverage for inpatient hospital costs the new program which became effective july 1 1966 included continuedmedicare margins medpac also projects that the medicare margins measure of the difference between estimated costs and snf expenditures for freestanding snfs will be 11 in 2007 accounting for the full mb update sc heduled in medicare law significant variation exists across facilities with onequarter of all freestanding snfs having margins at or below 47 twoquarters or half having margins of at least 155 and almost one quarter havi ng margins of almost 2523 medpac also explains that margins vary by facility type with forprofit facilities earning much larger margins 18 while nonprof it facilities earn much smaller ma rgins 9 further margins are higher in rural facilities than they are in urban facilities access the office of inspector general oig of the department of health and human services conducted 2004 study to investig ate whether medicare beneficiaries have adequate access to needed snf care upon discharge from hospital among other questions through interviews with disc harge planners persons responsible for conducting patient assessments prior to hos pital discharge and assisting with post hospital placement when necessary the oi g found that 84 of discharge planners reported that they are able to place all of their medicare beneficiaries who need care in snf for 2001 survey 73 of di scharge planners reported successful placements oig also reported that it did not find rge ie greater than 1 change since its 2001 study in access to care among those be neficiaries in nine out of the 10 most common diagnostic groups and eight out of 10 of the most common rug payment groups however ninetyone percent of responders reporte d that beneficiaries with certain conditions experienced more lays these patients required intravenous antibiotics andor expensive drugs wound car ventilator or dialysis or patients having behavioral problems the surv ey responders suggested that among the explanations for these delays are the difficulties snfs sometimes have in providing the appropriate level andor type of care to certain patients they also suggested that snf reimbursement for intrav enous antibiotics and payment for expensive drugs or dialysis were inadequate and that snfs may not have the necessary equipment or appropriately trained staff to care for certain patients24 acute care versus longterm care since the programs inception in 1965 medicare has delivered acute care services to the elderly and certain persons under age 65 w ho have disabilities25 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33921crs12 25 continued coverage for hospital and posthospital services under part and doctors and other medical services under part b program was established to respond to the n eed for assistance in paying for hospital and posthospital care among the elderly and certain persons with disabilities at that time life expectancy among the elderly and persons with disabilities was lower than it is today and the demand for longterm car services on widespread basis was far less pressing in the more than 40 years since the program was estab lished demographic changes and advances in medical technology are just some of the factors that have contributed to longer life span for bot h populations and greater demand for long term care services including custodial nursing home care as posthospitalization be nefit covering greater than 100 days of skilled nursing home care medicares snf benefit does not cover longterm custodial care and is thus not considered longterm care benefit however since longterm custodial stays in nursing home or in communitybased settings are often triggered by acute care episodes and hospitalizations eg strokes or fa lls medicares snf coverage does play significant ro on the continuum of care for persons transitioning between higher level of i ndependence and the need for assistance with selfcare
