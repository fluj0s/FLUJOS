macroeconomic policy government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34428understanding stagflation and the risk of its recurrence summary the slowing of economic growth and the rising rate of inflation in early 2008 have given rise to concerns that the u s economy is at risk of an episode of stagflation stagflation describes an economy that is characterized by high rates of both unemployment and inflation the rm came into popular use in the 1970s to describe the economy at that time the unemployment rate reached 90 in may 1975 and high of 108 in november 1982 the rate of consumer price inflation reached 122 for the 12month period endi ng in november 1974 and 146 for the 12month period ending in may 1980 infl ation is currently about 4 and the unemployment rate is near 5 both well be low the rates in the 1970s that were cause for alarm nonetheless higher oil prices and turmoil in financ ial markets have led some to warn that stagfla tion may be in our future the key to understanding the nature of stagflation is the natural rate of unemployment that is the lowest rate of unemployment consistent with stable rate of inflation below that rate inflation tends to accelerate in the view of the natural rate model unemployment and inflation rates may be relatively high at the same time and they may even rise simultaneously for time particularly if inflation and the natural rate of unemployment are rising at the same time what is unlikely to happen however is for the unemployment rate to be high and for the inflation rate to continue accelerating if the unemploym ent rate is above th natural rate then cooling labor and product markets would be likely to reduce upward pressure on wages and prices stagflation in the 1970s coincided with tw large oil shocks large increase in the price of oil can have macroeconomic consequences in terms of higher inflation higher unemployment and lower output bo th the inflation and output effects of energy shocks are temporary however once prices adjust the economy returns to full employment and its sustainable growth path it is not the level of energy prices that affects economic growth and inflation but rather the change in energy prices thus if policymakers are concerned with th effect of energy prices on output and inflation they should focus more on rising ergy prices than high energy prices even if the high prices are permanent although stagflation is understood to be high rates of both inflation and unemployment it is not clear how high those rates have to be to merit the designation whether or not rates less than those obs erved in the 1970s constitute stagflation may be subjective matter recent unemployment and inflation rates are not nearly as high as they were in the 1970s some

inflation in early 2008 have given rise to concerns that the u s economy is at risk of an episode of stagflation in the best of times policymaker s hope to keep both the unemployment rates and inflation rate s as low as possible stagflati on in contrast may be the worst of times stagflation describe s an economy that is character ized by high rates of both unemployment and inflation stagflation is term that came into popular use in the 1970s to describe the economy at that time the unemployment rate reached 90 in may 1975 and high of 108 in november 1982 the rate of c onsumer price inflation reached 122 for the 12month period ending in novemb er 1974 and 146 for the 12month period ending in may 1980 many observers also associate this period of stagflation with large oil price shocks and some draw another parallel with the recent rise in oil prices inflation is currently about 4 and the unemployment rate is near 5 both well below the rates that caused alarm in the 1970s nonetheless higher oil prices and turmoil in financial markets have led some to warn that stagflation may be in our future1 the reason stagflation elicits particular concern is that it presents policy dilemma in that it may be difficult to find way to reduce inflation and unemployment at the same time typically inflation is seen as the result of growth in aggregate demand outpacing growth in supply and contractionary policy would seem appropriate to bring it under control rising ra tes of unemployment tend to result when demand growth falls short of growth in supply and so stimulative policy might be called for the policy dilemma arises because the two approaches are incompatible there are two views of stagflation on is that it is the result of economic policy errors the other view is that it is the result of external supply shocks such as oil price increases which may be beyond the influence of economic policy understanding what stagfla tion is requires an explanation of the nature of the relationship between infla tion and unemployment th is report discusses that relationship in order to provi some understanding of th policy problems in doing so it examines the us experience with st agflation in the 1970s it also examineshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34428crs2 2 aw phillips the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of money wages in the united kingdom 18611957 economica nov 1958 3 the difference between wage increases nd price increases is largely accounted for by changes in labor productivitysome of the research that has been done on the relationship between oil prices and economic performance the prevailing view before the stagflation of the 1970s the experience of the 1970s had much to do with changing the prevailing view of the relationship between inflation and unemployment prior to that it was widely believed that inflation and unemployment were unlikely to trend either up or down together simultaneously ra ther it was thought that there was tradeoff between the two and that they were more lik ely to move in opposite directions in famous article published in 1958 economist aw phillips claimed to have found evidence of an inverse relationship be tween the rate of increase in wages and the rate of unemployment comparing rates of increase in wages with unemployment rates in britain between 1861 and 1957 phillip s found that as the labor market tightened and the unemployment rate fell money wages tended to rise more rapidly2 because wage increases are closely correlate d with price increases that relationship was widely interpreted as tradeoff between inflation and unemployment3 the implication was that policymakers could maintain lower rates of unemployment by tolerating rates of in flation it also implied straig htforward policy implications for either macroeconomic problem high unemployment could be eliminated through expansionary monetary or fiscal policy and high inflation could be eliminated through contractionary policy the curve describing this tr adeoff became known as the ph illips curve stable phillips curve would mean that policymakers might choose the combination of inflation and unemployment rates that seemed most palatable and set it as the goal of macroeconomic policy the us ex perience of the 1960s seemed to provide evidence for the existence of such trad eoff and encouraged those who held this view figure 1 plots annual us civilian unemploym ent and consumer price inflation rates together for the 1960s these data ggested that there was tradeoff for the united states and that policymaker s could choose from among number of combinations of unemployment and infla tion rates depending on their relative distastes for the twohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34428crs3 4 see richard g lipsey the relation be tween unemployment and the rate of change of money wages in the united king dom 18621957 further analysis economica feb 1960 pp131 figure 1 inflation and unemployment 1960 to 1969 source department of labor bureau of labor statistics the theoretical explanation for the downwardsloping line describing the trade off relied on the simple relationship between supply and demand as long as aggregate demand is growing more rapidl than the economys capacity to produce the unemployment rate will tend to fall and vice versa furthermore demand in excess of supply will tend to push up both wages and prices so that rising prices tend to be correlated with falling unemployment4 the lesson of the 1970s the experience of the 1970s led to the wi despread dismissal of the view that there was an exploitable tradeoff between inflation and unemployment much of the 1970s was characterized by simultaneous in creases in inflation and unemployment rates the phenomenon came to be known as stagflation because of sluggish rates of growth which led to rising unemplo yment rates and accelerating inflation it became evident that policymakers did not ve the option of settling for higher rate of inflation in exchange for lower rate of unemployment figure 2 shows what happened to the relationship between the civilian unemployment rate and consumer price in flation beginning in 1970 it seems clear that any tradeoff that may have ex isted during the 1960s as was shown in figure 1 was temporaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34428crs4 5 see milton friedman the role of monetary policy the american economic review vol 57 1 mar 1968 pp 117 also edmund phelps phillips curve expectations of inflation and optimal em ployment over time economica aug 1967 pp 254281source department of labor bureau of labor statistics as it happens this breakdown in the appa rent tradeoff between inflation and unemployment was anticipated in the 1960s two economists milton friedman and edmund phelps suggested that there had to be more to it than simple tradeoff between inflation and unemployment th ey predicted breakdown of the phillips curve they argued that while monetary or fiscal policy might be conducted in such way as to realize particular combination of unemployment and inflation in the short run it would not necessarily be sustainable combination5 this new argument contended that the tradeoff along the phillips curve was dependent on the fact that unexpected increases in the price level would reduce real wages reduction in real wages would tend to increase the demand for labor and push down the unemployment rate rise in prices could still result in lower unemployment as phillips had suggested but only until workers realized that the purchasing power of their wages was falling this new view argued that there was not just single phillips curve but unique phillips curve for every different possible expectation of inflation figure 2 inflation and unemployment 1970 to 1982httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34428crs5 6 the term natural rate was originally applied in similar way to interest rates by turnof thecentury economist knut wicksell see m blaug economic theory in retrospect homewood il richard d irwin inc 1962 pp 562563 7 some economists use more clinical term for the natural rate the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment or nairu at times the natural rate is more casually referred to as the fullemployment rate of unemployment 8 for clarity and simplicity this discussion ignores the effects of productivity growth on wagesan unexpected increase in the rate of inflation would temporarily reduce the rate of increase in real wages and contribute to decrease in the unemployment rate faster rate of inflation causes workers to underestimate the effects of rising prices on their money wages and unemployment declines due to fall in real wages but unless workers never catch on an unlikely prospect at some point they will adjust their wage demands to reflect the higher rate of inflation this increase in real wage demands will tend to reverse the drop in the unemployment rate due to the inflation surprise in the long run in this model the unemployment rate tends toward level that represents an equilibrium between th supply of labor and demand for it this level was dubbed the natural rate and it is the rate of unemployment consistent with stable rate of inflation6 if the inflation rate is zero then the natural rate is also the unemployment rate consistent with stable price level 7 in the absence of deliberate policy changes wage adjustments would always be working to move the economy to its natura l rate of unemployment either from higher rate or lower one depending on the conduct of econo mic policy however the adjustment to the natural rate can either be assisted or hindered according to the natural rate model fiscal or monetary policy may shift the economy from one point to another along th original phillips curve only as long as workers fail to appreciate changes in the pri ce level or the rate of inflation higher rate of inflation would not mean permanent decline in the unemployment rate eventually other things being equal expectations would adjust and the unemployment rate would tend to return to its natural rate if policy attempted to push unemployment below the natural rate the rate of inflation would wind up permanently higher after workers raised their expectation of inflation and there would be new tradeoff consistent with that higher expected rate of inflation any shortterm tradeoff between inflation and unemployment would now involve higher rates of in flation than before this process of shifting the trade off could continue as long as policymak ers keep trying to push the unemployment rate below its natura l level as discussed below policymakers can choose short term tradeoff only if the natura l rate can be accu rately estimated for example suppose that the unemploymen t rate is 5 and the inflation rate is 3 in addition suppose that workers are fully aware of the inflation rate and fully expect that their wages will increase at the same rate8 now suppose that policy seeks to lower the unemployment rate by tolerating more rapid rate of inflation say the inflation rate rises to 5 which means that nominal wages that are rising at 3 rate are falling at 2 rate in real terms those falling real wages increase thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34428crs6 demand for labor and the unemployment rate will fall below 5 but as seems likely eventually workers will realize that inflation has accelerat ed and adjust their wage demands to match as wages rise again and catch up with prices the demand for labor will slacken and the unemployment rate will tend back to 5 as figure 2 shows when the terms of the tradeoff shifted in the 1970s the line moved in clockwise pattern in the natural rate model the clockwise cycling of unemployment and inflation is due to the combination of expectations adjustments and policy changes unemployment falls and inflation rises when policymakers by pursuing stimulative monetary or fiscal policies attempt to exploit the tradeoff at first the rise in inflation may be unexp ected but as inflation expectations adjust and wage demands rise to maintain their purchasing power the unemployment rate tends to go back up contractionary polic ies designed to combat higher inflation cause unemployment to rise further but also cause price increases to moderate finally as contractionary policy comes to an end and unemployment begins to fall inflation continues to fall as expectations adjust downward the implication of shifting tradeoff is th at in the long run there is tradeoff between inflation and unemployment although unemployment can temporarily be pushed below the natural rate through ex pansionary policy policymakers cannot opt for an unemployment rate below the natural rate of unemployment and stay there is stagflation trap stagflation is relative phenomenon it has cardinal definition it is simply understood to be period of high unemploym ent and inflation rates as relative notion it would seem to be represen ted by the upper right hand area of figure 2 where exactly in that figure stagflati on starts and stops however is subjective references to stagflation in the popular press seem to suggest that it is viewed as kind of trap that ntiment may be rooted in the 1960s view that there was tradeoff between inflation and unemplo yment and that policy could not hope to reduce one without raising the other if the natural rate mode l is correct concerns that stagflation is trap are mistaken stagflation is generally understood to be state of high unemployment and inflation rates it can be more precisely described in the context of the natural rate model in the view of the model unemployment and inflation rates may be relatively high at the same time and they may even rise simultaneously for time particularly if inflation and the natural rate of unemployment are rising at the same time what is unlikely to happen in this model is for the unemployment rate to be high and for the inflation rate to continue accelerating if the unemployment rate is above the natural rate then cooling labor and product markets woul d be likely to reduce upward pressure on wages and prices once slowing inflation rate came to be appreciated by workers and was taken into account in their wage demands demand for labor would pick up and the unemploym ent rate would tend to fall escaping high inflation environment cannot be accomplished without cost however if individuals come to expect high inflation while the economy is at the natural rate of unemployment then the onl way to reduce inflation would be to usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34428crs7 9 robert gordon the timevarying nairu and its implications for economic policy journal of economic perspectives vol 11 1 winter 1997 pp 1132contractionary policy and mporarily push the unemploymen t rate above the natural rate most economists believe that the reason the double dip recessions of the early 1980s were the deepest since the great pression was because the fed decided to use contractionary policy to reduce the infla tion rate because the inflation rate was so high long and deep recession was nece ssary to reduce inflationary expectations what is the natural rate of unemployment although the model may be useful on its own it would be of more value if the natural rate of unemploymen t could be known with some confidence it probably cannot be estimated with any precision and it may also be the case that it varies over time because it is determined by labor ma rket conditions and policies that change over time9 most economists believe that the reason the united states was stuck in stagflation in the 1970s was because the natural rate d risen from this perspective since policymakers were unable to recognize the rise until after the fact they directed policy to an unemployment rate that was unsustainably low recent experience can also illustrate the effects of changing natural rate beginning in early 1994 and continuing in to 1995 the federal reserve in order to prevent an acceleration in the rate of in flation engineered three percentage point rise in shortterm interest rates this tightening of monetary policy began at time when the actual civilian unemployment rate was above 6 more recent economic experience suggest s that the natural rate is below 6 in september 1994 the civilian unemploymen t rate fell below 6 and with the exception of brief interruption from 2002 through the middle of 2003 it has remained below 6 between 1992 and 2005 consumer price inflation remained below 35 that the unemployment rate has been so low for so long with significant rise in the inflation rate has c onvinced many that the natural rate has fallen since the 1980s and that unemployment rates below 6 are compatible with long run stable rate of inflation it is wo rth noting however that since mid2004 the unemployment rate has been below 55 and since late 2005 has been below 5 while the inflation rate has picked up th at might be reason to believe the natural rate is currently at or above 5 if the natural rate is now somewhere between 5 and 6 it would be unlikely for inflation to continue to accelerate if the unemployment rate were to rise above 6 inflation tends to exhibit considerable inertia and thus ma be slow to respond to an economy that is slowing down for that reason there may be period of time where both the unemployment and inflation rates are relatively high it is unlikely however that both would rise over prolonged period supply shocks the effects of oil prices the preceding discussion suggested that stagflation was partially the result of errors of policy not necessarily deliberate ones but perhaps the result of uncertaintyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34428crs8 10 products with high menu costs are those wh ich are costly to reprice and therefore have sticky prices restaurant nus periodicals and catalog items are examples of products with high menu costs 11 if rising energy prices affect the econom through this transmission mechanism then falling energy prices should have the opposite effect on the economy they should temporarily lower inflation and raise output all else equal many of the studies to follow find that this is not true howeverregarding how low the unemployment rate could go without eventually resulting in accelerating rates of inflation external ev ents beyond the direct influence of policy may also play role however stagflati on in the 1970s coincided with two large oil shocks due to the central role energy plays in the functioning of our economy and its unusual price volatility changes in energy pr ices tend to have greater shortterm impact on the economy than changes in the prices of most other goods energy shocks can have macroeconomic consequen ces in terms of higher inflation higher unemployment and lower output histori cally energy price shocks have proven particularly troublesome for the us economy sharp spikes in the price of oil have preceded nine of the 10 postwar rece ssions but since the current economic expansion began in 2001 energy prices have spiked on several occasions economic theory suggests that economies suffer from recessions due to the presence of sticky prices if markets adjusted instantly then recessions could be avoided whenever economic conditions changed price and wage changes would automatically bring the economy back to full employment in actuality however there are menu costs10 information costs uncertainty and contracts in our economy that make prices sticky as result adjustment takes time and unemployment and economic contraction can result in the interim when oil prices rise suddenly it directly raises the energy portion of inflation measures such as the consum er price index energy prices make up about 9 of the consumer price index as result the overall inflation rate is temporarily pushed up since other prices do not instantly adjust and fall if other energy prices rise at the same time as has often been the case then the effect on overall inflation will be magnified because energy is an important input in the production process the price shock raises the cost of production for many industries transportation accounts for majority of oil consumption in the united states but hydrocarbons are also used for heating and industrial uses such as the pr oduction of plastics because other prices do not instantly fall the overall cost of production rises nd producers respond by cutting back production which causes the cont raction in output and employment all else equal there may also be adjustment costs to shifting toward less energy intensive methods of production and these could temporarily ve negative effect on output typically the effect on output occurs over few quarters11 the effects described thus far can be t hought of as occurring on the supply side of the economy oil shocks may also aff ect aggregate demand when energy priceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34428crs9 12 this point is not always explicitly made in the time series analyses reviewed below which tend to end their estimates at the last time lag that yields statistically significant results or arbitrarily cut off the estimates after few lags to meet statistical criterion concerning the limit on the number of variables allowedrise they involve an income transfer fro m consumers to producers since producers are also consumers aggregate demand is likely to fall only temporarily as producers adjust their consumption to their now higher incomes this adjustment is likely to be less or to take longer when the income recipients are foreigners than when they are americans since the united states is net importer of oil the net effect on us aggregate demand depends on how foreig n oil producers use their increase in wealth the adjustment to the wealth transfer from c onsumer to producer is transmitted through the international balance of payments how the increase in oil prices affects the current account deficit measure that pr imarily consists of the trade deficit depends in turn on how foreign oil producer s decide to use this purchasing power if they use it to purchase us goods then us exports would increase and there would be little effect on the current account ficit if they use it to purchase us assets whether corporate stocks treasur bonds or by simply leaving the revenue in us bank account then it would repres ent an inflow of foreign capital to the united states which would increase the cu rrent account deficit the purchase of us assets would stimulate total demand in the united states through lower interest rates possibly with lag or the foreign oil producers may use their increased wealth to purchase other countries goods or assets in which case the adjustment process in the united states could take longer second effect on demand can be expected to occur because the rise in energy prices will probably push up th overall price level because other prices do not fall immediately in the face of decline in mand the increase in the price level will reduce the real value of the available amount of money in the hands of buyers and this reduction in the value of money will also reduce spending third effect on demand can occur if the rise in energy pr ices increases uncertainty and causes buyers to defer purchases this effect is also likely to be of short run nature the magnitude of all three effects will depend on how much energy prices rise and how long they remain high both the inflation and output effects of energy shocks are temporary that is once prices adjust the economy returns to full employment and its sustainable growth path12 this observation yields an important insight it is not the level of energy prices that affects economic growth and inflation but rather the change in energy prices thus if policymakers are c oncerned about the effect of energy prices on output and inflation they should focus mo re on rising energy prices than high energy prices even if the high pri ces are permanent the only permanent macroeconomic effect of higher energy prices is their negative effect on the terms of trade the terms of trade is measure of standard of living that refers to the labor and capital embodied in us exports that can be exchanged for the labor and capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34428crs10 13 see crs report rl32591 us terms of trade significance trends and policy by craig k elwellembodied in foreign imports13 it means that the united states has to give up more of the goods it produces than previously to obtain barrel of oil permanently higher energy prices lead to onetime permanent decline in the terms of trade and the standard of living of us consumers all else equal policy implications historically formulating an effective policy response to oil shocks has been difficult expans ionary fiscal or m onetary policy increases aggregate demand and inflationary pressure s in typical downturns monetary and fiscal policy can safely become expansionary without triggering significant increase in inflation because the fall in demand reduces inflationary pressures in oil shocks policymakers must be simultaneously concerned with the fall in economic activity and the rise in prices by tackling one problem they risk exacerbating the other for example if policymakers use expansionary fiscal or m onetary policy to offset the fall in output prices may rise further and inflationary expectations could become embedded key concern for policymakers is whether the rise in prices remains isolated in energy prices or whether they spread to other g oods often referred to as core inflation this was the problem in the 1970s when in flation which was already rising before the oil shocks continued to accelerate fo llowing the oil shock of 1973 until it reached double digits in 1974 once the public cam to expect higher inflation the subsequent expansionary policy measures had less and less of positive effect on aggregate demand making any tradeoff between inflation and unemployment less and less favorable following the second oil shock of 1979 federal reserve that was determined to stamp out doubledigit inflation chose instead to tackle the inflationary pressures caused by the oil shock by raising interest rates this decision exacerbated the effect on output contri buting to the most severe economic contraction since the great depression although the rise in inflation in the 1970s is often attributed to the oil shocks some economists have disputed that assertion as well if prices were perfectly flexible then rise in oil prices could not raise the overall price level unless it was accommodated by expansionary monetary policy otherwise other prices would fall as much as oil prices had risen to keep inflation constant since prices are not perfectly flexible it may be that higher oil prices temporarily cause overall inflation to rise even without monetary accommodati on but unless oil pr ices are continuously rising shock cannot cause inflation to ri on an ongoing basis for inflation to keep rising at some point excessi ve monetary expansion is needed another reason why policy responses have been unable to prevent oil shocks from leading to recessions historically is because policy changes are hampered by lags in policy recognition imple mentation and effec tiveness because oil shocks are typically unpredictable events policy cannot be modified far enough ahead of time to prevent downturnhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34428crs11 14 ben bernanke mark gertler and mark watson systematic monetary policy and the effects of oil price shocks brookings papers on economic

brookings papers on economic activity 1 1997 p 146 to address this criticism bernanke et also run simulations in which the federal funds rate is held constant but expectations are assumed to adjust more quickly under this scenario output still rises and inflation rises slightly more quicklyis stagflation caused by oil price shocks or monetary policy despite the remarkable historical coinci dence between oil shocks and recessions strain of research has suggested that th ere might nonetheless be some third force responsible for the recessions in particular the research has tr ied to separate the effects of the oil shocks on the economy fro m the effects of simultaneous changes in monetary policy as the last section suggests policymakers do have the option of ignoring the inflationary effects of th shock and concentrating on its economic effects in that sense the downturn can be seen as caused by policy not the shock itself some of the research has concluded that had it not been for the changes in monetary policy the oil shocks would have had little effect on economic growth ben bernanke now chairman of the fe deral reserve and his coauthors were interested in finding out what effects m onetary policy changes had when they were unanticipated14 they chose to study oil shocks because these are one of the only macroeconomic phenomena that most economists would agree are both unanticipated and not the result of domestic policy first they estimated the effect of 10 increase in the price of oil when monetary policy responds as it has historically they estimated that over 24 months gdp would fall by 31 and prices would rise by 009 relative to baseline to separate the effects of the oil shock from the effects of the change in monetary policy they then estimated counterfactual example where monetary policy does not respond to the oil price increase which they represented with constant federal funds rate in th is case gdp was estimated to rise by 13 and prices by 013 they conc luded that oil price shocks have very little negative effect on the economy rather it is the monetary response to oil shocks that leads to the historical coincide nce between oil shocks and recessions15 the work of bernanke et raises an interesting conceptual question while the effects of oil shocks and m onetary policy can be statisti cally separated can they be separated in reality bernanke et attribute the tightening of monetary policy following oil shocks as the feds response to the increase in inflationary pressures that oil shocks are commonly believed to cause commenting on the bernanke paper sims points out that the assumption that monetary policy could remain unchanged in response to an increase in infl ationary pressures is not reasonable one it is unlikely that private individuals would have reaction to an unsustainable policy making the statistical separation of oil price effects from monetary effects problematic16 this would suggest that one can reasonably question whether there is practical distinction between attributin g recession to an oil shock or attributing it to the monetary response to an oil shockhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34428crs12 17 james hamilton and ana maria herrera oil shocks and aggregate macroeconomic behavior the role of monetary policy journal of money credit and banking april

consequence of more restrictive monetary policy designed to reduce inflation and inflationary expectations 20 see crs report rs22371 the pattern of interest rate s in 20062008 does it signal an impending recession by marc labonte and gail makinenhamilton and herrera pursue this line of reasoning in critique of the bernanke paper17 although bernankes regressions can be mechanically interpreted to imply that monetary policy could prevent r ecession hamilton and herrera point out that these regressions would imply that the federa l funds rate would ve to have been an improbable 9 percentage points lower in 1973 to prevent recession it is unlikely that private individuals ex pectations would have rema ined unchanged in light of such significant policy change hamilton and herrera also argue that bernanke et underestimate the effects of oil shocks because they use too short lag length bernanke et assume that changes in oil prices affect the economy for the next seven months whereas hamilton and herrera suggest lag length of at least 12 months would be more ppropriate since many work s find the largest economic effects of oil price changes come after three and four quarters in particular by using longer lag than bernanke they find that countering oil shocks with expansionary monetary policy has much larger effects on inflation since monetary policy affects inflation with significant lag barsky and killian present compelling analysis shown in figure 3 that oil shocks did not cause the recessions si nce the 1970s the difference in timing between the official onset of the recession preceded the rise in oil prices18 the 1980 recession follows closely on the heels of the price increase but the 19811982 recession was preceded by only small increase in oil prices19 the 2001 recession began after oil prices had risen and alr eady started to fall again although economic research suggests the rise in prices may ffect the economy with lag but in the 1973 and 19901991 recessions the recession bega n as dated by the national bureau of economic research before the oil pr ice increased these two experiences are noteworthy because both recessions are closely associated in peoples minds with geopolitical events linked to oil the oil embargo and the gulf war respectively this is not to suggest that those recessions were not made worse by the oil shocks furthermore wellknown predictor of recessions the yield curve inversion preceded the oil shock in 1973 1978 and 1989 suggesting that the seeds for the subsequent recessions may ve been sown elsewhere20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34428crs13 source robert barsky and lutz killian oil and the macroeconomy since the 1970s journal of economic perspectives vol 18 4 fall 2004 conclusion stagflation is reminder that economic analysis and economic policy have room for improvement even without the compli cation of oil price shocks it may arise because policy is based on both imperfect information and an imperfect understanding of the economy economists note that the beginning of the upward trend in inflation preceded the first oil shock the full effects of change in monetary or fiscal policy are felt some time after the fact and that lag is uncertain and may vary from one occasion to another the effects of oil price increases or any other external shock to the economy also take time to be fully realized although policy may not be able to prevent episodes of stagflation from occurring there may be enough understandi ng of the underlying causes to avoid making conditions substantially worse although increases in inflation may initially be driven by forces that are out of polic ymakers hands such as oil shocks in the long run high inflation cannot persis t without monetary accommodation by the federal reserve most economists believe that stagflation would not have lasted as long as it did in the 1970s if the fed had raised rates sooner and believe that fundamental shift in fed policymaking towa rd an emphasis on price stability explains why stagflation has not occurred since th 1970s experience with stagflation is seen as the worst of both worlds expansionary policy that delivered high inflation but failed to deliver low unemployment and the lesson that many economists have figure 3 real price of us crude oil imports and recessions

analytical valuetaken from that experience is skepticism that activist or finetuning policymaking can deliver economic stability while stagflation is understood to be high rates of both inflation and unemployment it is not clear how high those rates have to be to merit the designation the 1970s and early 1980s are the prime hi storical example of stagflation the unemployment rate reached 90 in may 1975 and high of 108 in november 1982 the rate of consumer price infla tion reached 122 for the twelve month period ending in november 1974 and 146 for the twelve month period ending in may 198021 whether or not rates less than those constitute stagflation remains subjective matter at the moment both inflation and unemployment rates are well below what they were in the 1970s episode recent unemployment and inflation rates are not nearly as high as they were in the 1970s some economists however fear that the recent expansion in monetary and fiscal policy at time when unemployment is low but rising and energy prices are rising could lead to ne w bout of stagflation in the near future it remains to be seen whether the recent loosening of polic marks shift away from an emphasis on price stability
