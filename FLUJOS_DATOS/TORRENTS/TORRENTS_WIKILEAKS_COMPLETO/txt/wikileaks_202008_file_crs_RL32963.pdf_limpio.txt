and closures brac is now underway the defense base closure nd realignment act of 1990 base closure act as amended establishe s mandatory procedures to be followed throughout the brac process and identifies criteria to be used in formulating brac recommendations however judicial review is unlikely to be available to remedy alleged failures to comply with the base closure acts provisions synopsis of the relevant law regarding the availability of judicial review in this context is included below the actions of the secretary of defense secretary and the independent brac commission c ommission are not considered to be final agency action and thus cannot be judicially reviewed pursuant to the administrative procedure act apa even if court determined that the actions of the secretary and thecommission were final agency action the court would likely consider the case to fall under one of two apa exceptions to judicial review 1 when statutes preclude judicial review or 2 when agency action is committed to agency discretion by law the presidents actions cannot be judicially reviewed under the apa because the president is not an agency covered by the statute claim that the president exceeded his statutory authority under the base closure act has been held to be judicially unreviewable because the base closure act gives the president broad discretion in approving or disapprovi ng brac recommendations thus courts would likely allow the brac process to proceed even if the department of defense th commission or the president did not comply with the base closure ac

round for 2005 which is now underway3 the brac process involves comp lex statutory sc heme under which numerous governmental entities play role in recommending bases to be closed or realigned brief summary of the major steps in the process is illustrated in figure 1 on the following page in addition to establishing the basic framework for the brac process the base closure act sets forth variety of selection criteria and mandatory procedures such as the requireme nts that certain information be disclosed and that certain meetings be made open to the public this report analyzes whether judicial revi ew is available when plaintiffs allege that the department of defense dod the independent brac commission commission or the president has either 1 failed to comply with procedural requirements of the base closure act or 2 failed to properly apply specified selection criteria in making brac terminations congress could employ numerous strategies to attempt to enforce the base

the administrative procedure act apa provides for judicial review of final agency action8 unless either of two exceptions applies 1 when statute precludes judicial review or 2 when agency action is committed to agency discretion by law9 determining the finality of agency action in dalton v specter members of congress and other plaintiffs sought to enjoin the secretary of defense secretary from closing military installation during previous brac round because of alleged s ubstantive and procedural violations of the base closure act10 specifically plaintiffs alleged that the secretarys report and the commissions report were subject to judicial revi ew under the apa11 in dalton the supreme court held that the issuances of the secretarys report and the commissions report were not judici ally reviewable actions under the apa because they were not final agency actions12 the court explained that the core question for determin ing finality of agency action under the apa is whether the agency has completed its decisionmaking process and whether the result of that process is one that will directly affect the parties13 because the base closure act established process under which the presid ent takes the final action that affects military installations see figure 1 on the previous page the actions of the secretary and the commission did not directly affect the parties14 thus the court held that they were unreviewable under the apa15 the dalton decision affirmed the analysis in cohen v rice in which the first circuit stated that the presidents statutory right to affect the brac process meanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32963crs4 16 see id 17 cohen 992 f2d at 38182 18 see bennett v spear 520 us 154 178 1997 citing dalton 511 us at 478 19 see dalton 511 us at 466 46871 accord

in judgmentthat previous steps of the brac process were not final16 s t h cohen court explained under the 1990 act the president is not required to submit the commissions report to congress in addition the 1990 act gives the president the power to order the commission to revise its report and in the final analysis the president has the power to terminate base closure cycle altogether via second rejection of commission report17 in addition subsequent supreme court decision described the brac reports as purely advisory and subject to the abs olute discretion of the president thus making them nonfinal agen cy action for apa purposes18 importantly the dalton court applied its analysis of finality under the apa to both substantive claims applying improper selection criteria and procedural claims eg failing to make cer tain information public19 therefore the lack of finality in brac actions taken by the secretary or th commission bars judici review of such actions under the apa20 statutory preclusion of judicial review four justices concurred in the dalton courts judgment that judicial review was not available under the apa but argued in separate concurring opinion that the court should not have decided the issue of whether the agency actions were final21 the foundation for this argument is that under the apa judi cial review is not available if statutes pr eclude judicial review22 justice souter writing for these four justices argued that the text structure and purpose of the act compel th conclusion that judi cial review of the commissions or the secretarys compliance with it is precluded except for certain environmental objections to base closure implementation plans23 souters opinion concluded that congress intended for brac ac tions to be quick and final or for action to be taken at all24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32963crs5 25 id at 479 48283 souter j concurring in judgment 26 5 usc 701a2 27 see natl fedn of fed employees v united states 905 f2d

contention that congress generally intended to preclude judicial review under the base closure act25 statutorilymandated strict time deadlines for making and implementing brac decisions the allornothing base closing requirement at the core of the act congressional frustration resulting from previous attempts to close military bases nonjudicial opportunities to asse ss any procedural or other irregularities ie the opport unities for the commission and the comptroller general to review the secretarys recommendations the presidents opportunity to consider procedural flaws and congresss opportunity to disapprove the recommendations the temporary natu re of the commission the fact that the act expressly provides for judicial review regarding objections to base closure imple mentation plans under the national environmental policy act of 1969 n epa that are brought within narrow time frame but the act does not explicitly provide for any other judicial review importantly whether the supreme court applies the rationale of the dalton majority or justice souters dalton concurrence the court would likely decide not to review the brac actions of the s ecretary or the commission under the apa in the 2005 round agency actions committed to agency discretion by law under the apa judicial review of agency action is not available if agency action is committed to agency discretion by law26 even if the actions of the secretary or the commission were held to be final agency action which would be unlikely given the dalton decision courts might cons ider those agency actions to be committed to agency discretion by law thus making them judicially unreviewable27 because there is strong presumption that congress intends judicial review of administrative action clear and convincing evidence of contrary congressional intent must exist in order for this exception to judicial review to apply28 the issue of whether actions of the secretary or the commission under the base closure act are committed to agency discretion by law has not been adjudicated by the supreme court instead several supreme court cases have addressed this issue in nonbrac contexts and one dc circu it case addressed the applicability of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32963crs6 29 heckler v chaney 470 us 821 830 1985 30 id emphasis added the supreme court has also stated that the exception in 5 usc 701a2 applies when there is law available for the court to apply see webster v doe 486 us 592 599 1988 however in the brac c ontext the base closure act provides the relevant law thus the critic question is whether that law contains meaningful standard as required by heckler see heckler 470 us at 830 31 natl fedn 905 f2d at 405 see heckler 470 us at 830 the criteria used during the brac round at issue in national federation were substantially similar to those being used in the 2005 brac round compare base closure act 2913 with natl fedn 905 f2d at 402 32 natl fedn 905 f2d at 40506 33 idexception to the base closure act th cases are analyzed in the following paragraphs in heckler v chaney the supreme court explained that the exception for agency action being committed to agency discretion applies if court would have meaningful standard against which to j udge the agencys exercise of discretion29 the court continued saying that if judicially manageable standards are available for judging how and when an agen cy should exercise its discretion then it is impossible to evaluate agency action fo r abuse of discretion as provided for in 5 usc 70630 in national federation the dc circuit found that the criteria dod and the commission use for making brac deter minations do not provide judicially manageable standards as required by the heckler test31 the dc circuit articulated the rationale for its finding the subject matter of those criteria is not judicially manageable because judicial review of the decisi ons of the secretary and the commission would necessarily involve secondguessing the secretarys assessment of the nations military force structure and the military value of the bases within that structure we think the federal judiciary is illequipped to conduct reviews of the nations military policy32 based on this finding the national federation court held that application of the selection criteria to military installations during the brac process is agency action committed to agency discretion by law thus making it judicia lly unreviewable under the apa33 more recently the supreme court observed that this exception has generally applied in three categories of cases 1 cases involving national security 2 cases where plaintiffs sought judicial review of an agencys refusal to pursue enforcement actions andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32963crs7 34 see lincoln v

squarely within any of those three categories the supreme court might adopt the dc circuits construction of the exception from national federation were it to construe the exception in the context of brac review of presidential action under the apa in dalton the supreme court held that the presidents approval of the secretarys brac recommendations was not judicially reviewable under the apa because the president is not an agency35 although the apas definition of an agency does not explicitly include or exclude the president36 the court had previously held that the president is not subject to the apa due to separation of powers principles37 base closure act claims the dalton court distinguished between two types of potential claims 1 claims that the president exceeded his statutory authority and 2 claims challenging the constitutionality of the presidents actions38 the court stated that not every case of ultra vires conduct by an executive official was ipso facto unconstitutional39 in dalton the lower court had held that the president would be acting in excess of his statutory authority under the base closure act if the secretary or the commission had failed to comply with statutorilyrequired procedures duringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32963crs8 40 dalton 511 us at 466 474 41 id at 47475 see the following section of this report for an analysis of potential

judgment 49 id at 47677previous stages of the brac process40 on appeal the supreme court characterized this claim as statutory claim not as constitutional claim41 the court assumed arguendo that some statutory claims against the president could be judicially reviewable apart from the apa42 however it stated that statutory claims are not judicially reviewable apart from the apa when the statute in question commits the decision to the discretion of the president43 according to the court the base closure act did not limit the presidents discretion in any way44 thus the presidents authority to pprove the brac recommendations was not contingent on the secretarys and commi ssions fulfillment of all the procedural requirements imposed upon them by the base closure act45 therefore the issue of how the president chose to exercise hi s discretion under the ba closure act was held to be judicially unreviewable46 justice blackmun concurring in part and concurring in the judgment attempted to narrowly define the scope of the dalton decision47 he considered the decision to be one that would allow judicial review of claim 1 if the president acted in contravention of his statutory authority eg adding base to the commissions brac recommendations list or 2 if plaintiff brought timely claim seeking direct relief from procedur violation eg cla im that commission meeting should be public or that the secretary s hould publish proposed selection criteria and allow for public comment48 however justice blackmuns argument th at plaintiffs could seek relief from procedural violation of the base closure ac t appears to directly conflict with chief justice rehnquists opinion on behalf of the dalton majority which stated the presidents authority to act is not contingent on the secretarys and commissions fulfillment of all the procedural requirements imposed upon them by the base closure act nothing in 2903e requires the president to determine whether the secretary or commission committed any procedural violations in making their recommendations nor does 2903e prohibit the president from approving recommendations that are procedurally flawed49httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32963crs9 50 id at 47275 51 id at 473 see youngstown sheet tube co v sawyer 343 us 579 1952 52 id citing youngstown 343 us 579 indeed justice jacksons youngstown concurrence also attempted to articulate several categories of presidential action 1 when the president acts pursuant to an express or implied author ization of congress his authority is at its maximum 2 when the president acts in absence of either congressional grant or denial of authority and 3 when the pr esident takes measures incompatible with the express or implied will of congress his power is at its lowest ebb for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of congress over the matter youngstown 343 us at 63738 jackson j concurring using justice jacksons framework the dalton case would fall within the first category because the base closure act granted the president discretion in approving or disapproving the brac recommendations see dalton 511 us at 47275 53 natl fedn 905 f2d at 40405constitutional claims as mentioned in the preceding section of this report the dalton court explained that claims that the president acted in excess of his statutory authority differ from claims that the president unconstitutionally acted in the absence of statutory authority50 specifically the court distinguished the issues in dalton from those in youngstown sheet tube co v sawyer landmark case on presidential powers51 the court said that youngstown involved the conceded absence of any statutory authority not claim that the president acted in excess of such authority52 because the base closure act provides statutor authority to the president the dalton court did not find it necessary to examine the constitutional powers of the president eg the presidents powers as commanderinchief litigant could also challenge the constitutionality of the base closure act itself for example in national federation plaintiffs unsuccessfully argued that the 1988 base closure act violated the nondelegation doctrine and the separation of powers doctrine53 however the base closure act has not yet been held unconstitutional by any federal appellate courts
