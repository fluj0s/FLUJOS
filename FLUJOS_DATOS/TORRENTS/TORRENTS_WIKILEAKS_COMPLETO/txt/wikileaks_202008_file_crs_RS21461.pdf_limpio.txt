act of 1945 historically insurers have relied on the acts limited exemption from federal antitrust law to engage in c ooperative activities that allow th em to identify and measure risk including joint collection sharing and analysis of loss cost data and development of standardized policy forms much of the policy debate cerns whether narrowing the exemption from antitrust law would alleviate or aggravate the current problem of high premiums and insurance coverage availability during the 108th congress several bills hr 448 hr 1116 and s 352 have been introduced to modify the mccarranferguson act to ensure that commercial insurers do not engage in anticompetitive ratemaking in the medical malpractice insurance market to the detriment of cons umers these bills do not address other antitrust laws but is limited to pricefixing bidrigging and market allocations and only in connection with the provision of medical malpractice insurance this report provides an overview

recent american medical association ama survey of 50 states some 18 states have serious medical malpractice liability insurance problem1 the search for solution to the medical malpractice liability insurance problem has been frustrated by lack of consensus ove r which suggested causes are more central to the problem the scarcity and limitations of da ta and contradictory results in different empirical studies that seek to examine whether medical malpractice reforms implemented by the states following the liability insuran ce crises in the 1970s and 1980s have had their intended effects on premiums at present however the medical malpractice insurance debate is focusing on the extent to which instability of the medical malpractice liability insurance market is result of 1 inherent management problems that are driven by the profitability cycle of the insurance industr or 2 outofcontrol medical litigation frivolous lawsuits and high jury awards that have resulted in dramatic increase in the frequency and severity of paid claims both sets of vi ews have strong proponents and very different proposed solutions profitability cycle of the insurance industry proponents of limiting certain insurance company pricing and accounting practices stress the insurance profitability cycle and the manner in which insurance comp anies respond to it they point to cash flow characteristics and rising interest rates that attracted new insurers into then profitable medical malpractice line in the late1980s and early1990s these insurers pursued as much business as they could in order to have more funds to generate investment income competiti on intensified as many insure rs were convinced that they could attract only the good business at wer prices and make up for any losses with investments that appeared to be steadily rising in value in this view competition created an environment of underpricing of th actual risks of the insurance from this scenario has come the argument that the problems of availability and affordability in the medical malpractice in surance segment are attributable to poor investments and that insurers are now employing certain alleged anticompetitive practices to force premiums up and recover investment as well as insurance losses these practices ranging from the methods of setting rates in the industry ie pricefixing to collectively withdrawing capacity ie restri cting supply are allegedly made possible by the industrys antitrust exemption provide d under the mccarranferguson act of 19452 as result some observers have called fo r modification of th insurance industrys federal exemption from antitrust laws medical litigation another approach that is supported by insurance industry representatives and physician groups is ba sed on the proposition that the current medical malpractice liability insurance crisis is caused by outofcontrol medical litigation frivolous lawsuits and high jury awards that have

monitor report examining todays malpractice problem the controversial search for solutions medical liability monitor aug 2002 p 6 4 according to the head actuary in the department of insurance for the district of columbia the joint development of rates does not apply to mo st medical malpractice insurers because these firms tend to rely on their own companys statew ide or national loss cost data to support their actuarial estimates and rate request submissions in state and do not rely on the loss cost data of other insurers or rating agencies like insura nce services office iso to pool historical loss data to derive pure premium insurers argue that this is prima facie evidence that medical malpractice insurers do not collude in the setting of rates discussion february 25 2003 5 for many insurable lines insurers rely on in formation from the iso which pools forecasts and make results available to companies at cost for use as they see fit it does not however apply to medical malpracticeindividual physicians at the core of the argument is the belief that the tort system functions unevenly and in equitably in resolving medical negligence cases3 medical litigati on they argue needs predictable and c onsistent context supporters of this argument view tort reform as the solution and they want the medical litigation process to be simplified procedural laws streamlin ed incentives to protracted and complicated litigation eliminated improvements to the courts case management role with regard to complex multiparty litigation nd the implementation of alte rnatives to litigation such as arbitration mediation nd nofault compensation system coupled with medical review boards to regulate quality of care proponents of the litigation explosion ar gument state that medical malpractice insurers do not jointly set rates4 thus they argue the assertion that insurers benefit from the mccarranfergusons exemption to collude in the setting of rates is simply not correct5 medical malpractice liability insurance market structure the medical malpractice insurance market consists of three separate types of insurers 1 traditional commercial multiline propertycasualty insurers that seek to earn profits 2 hospitaland physicianowned insurers including multistate physician malpractice groups like phico in pennsylvani and pie medical mutual in ohio that started in the mid1990s and expanded their bus iness outside their state of domicile that focus on longterm market stability and affordably priced coverage and 3 alternative risk transfer entities that include selfinsur ance and pooling captives and risk retention groups that provide coverage as service to their parent organizations the market in which medical malpractice insurers operate is composed of five separate customer markets physicians hospitals managed care organizations nursing homes and allied health care ie nonmd practitioners to provide an alternative to traditional commercial insurers following the difficult insurance cycles of the 1970s and 1980s number of states have created medical malpractice insurance joint underwriting associ ations juas jua is

obtain coverage some states have also tablished patient compensati on funds to provide coverage to physicians in excess of the coverage limits of malpractice insurance policy physicians can be assured that in the even t their coverage limits are exceeded there will be money available for damage s in medical liability cases these funds are administered by the state insurance department others are administered by quasilegislative entity the fund is financed through fees or surcha rges levied on all healthcare providers but in some states like new york the fund receive s money from the state budget additionally selfinsurance trust funds are often used by large hospitals and health maintenance organizations hmos to selfinsure all or part of their risk and the product liability risk retention act of 1981 was enacted to pe rmit the creation of risk retention groups corporate entity and purchasing groups that pr ovide or obtain liability insurance for the owners of the group in terms of market share physicians and hospital captives account for roughly 50 to 60 of the malpractice insurance business commercial insurers account for 30 and juas and other arra ngements account for the remaining 10 the mccarranferguson act of 1945 in1944 the us supreme court revers ed itself in the landmark case of united states v southeastern underwriting association 6 when it held that the sale of insurance across state lines was interstate commerce and therefore subject to the federal antitrust laws the 1944 decision meant that insurance sales underwriting ratemak ing and investment practices were subject to federal antitrust laws and to any other federal laws that conflicted with state insuran ce regulation realizing that appropriate underwriting and riskassessment for the business of insura nce depended upon legitima joint activities such as the collection of industrywide ss data residual market mechanisms and pools for jumbo risks that might have been cha llenged under federal an titrust laws congress enacted the mccarranferguson act the ac t did not reference an particular industry segment it referred generally to the business of insurance the mccarran act did three things section 1 of the act reaffirmed the power of the states to tax and regulate the business of insurance section 2 declared that acts of congress except those specifically relating to the business of insurance did or would not invalidate state laws regulating or taxing the business of insurance and that the federal antitrust laws specifically the sherman act the clayton act and the federal trade commission act did not apply to the business of insurance as long as such business was regulated by state law section 3b declared however that boycotts and acts of coercion or intimidation remained subject to federal antitrust law thus under current law the regulation of the business of insurance in the united states is carried out at the state level the business of insurance is substantially exempt from federal antitrust statutes and collective activities may qualify for an antitrus t exemption but the activity in question must not be an act or agreement to boycott coerce or intimidatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21461crs5 7 see statement of lawrence smarr president of physician insurers association of america before the us senate judiciary committee and

other industry when profitability is good insurers actively compete by lowering rates and expanding coverage in order to increase premium and investment income or retain market share but when times are bad the antitrust exemption allows insurers to collectively raise premiums without fear of prosecution legal challenges involving alleged pricefixing by insurers are typically dismissed by the courts because of the industrys special exemption from the antitrust laws supporters of mccarranferg uson reform point to cong ressional testimony relative to the liability crisis of the mid1980s as evidence that the industrys antitrust exemption has allowed insurers to engage in collusion with respect to ratemaking8 in 1991 congressional testimony rega rding the liability crisis of the mid1980s the then assistant attorney general of new york indicated that insurers had engaged in wide range of pricefixing schemes and concluded that the shar p swings within the industry as whole were not the result of mere coincidence but rather evidence of lockstep mentality and an absence of real competition furthermor he stated although there were thousands of insurers in the market the direction of the market was set by only few companiesand the smaller insurers followed the price increases nd market withdrawals of the largest competitors some members of congress have noted that the median market share of the top two medical malpractice writers within state totals 592 on average and inferred the continui ng relevance of the 1991 statement9 they support modification of the act to ensure that insure rs do not engage in pricefixing bidrigging or market allocation arguments against modifying the act insurance industry representatives and mo st state regulators oppose modification of the act arguing that the factors that precip itated the malpractice insurance crisis ie litigation the economy insurers and physicians have nothing to do with the industrys limited exemption from federal antitrust law and that modifying the act will not lead to reductions in the price of insurance or an ex pansion of coverage if anything they argue modifying the act would only create uncertainty for insurers and regulators about what types of joint activities are permissible it could for example threaten insurers ability to pool historical loss cost data which is necessary to actuarially sound pricing in addition they contend disagreements over what pricefixing is and when it is illegal could lead to massive litigation regulators note th at medical malpractice insurance rates are subject to state prohibitions on excessive in adequate or unfairly discriminatory rates the national association of insurance commissioners naic has maintained that there is evidence that indicate medical malpractice insurers have engaged or are engaging in price fixing bid rigging or market allocation
