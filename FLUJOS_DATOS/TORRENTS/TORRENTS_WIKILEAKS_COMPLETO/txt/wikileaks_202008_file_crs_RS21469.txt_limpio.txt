congressional policymakers have supported the ntias mandate and objectives through the appropriations process the recent history of the ntia budget fy2000fy2007 is as follows appropriations for fy2008 will be included once the final bill has been passed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21469 table 1 ntia funding fy2000fy2009 in millions of dollars request appropriations fy2000 723 529 fy2001 4230 1004

clinton administration requested additional funding for digitizing existing public broadcasting transmissions and construction of new public digital broadcasting facilities while the final appropriations did not match the clinton administrations request of 423 million it represented substantial increase in ntias historical budget congress has generally maintained consistent funding for ntia in its appropriations regardless of the request for fy2009 the bush administration has proposed continued reduction in the ntia budget primarily reflected in eliminating ntias program to construct and maintain public telecommunications facilities the administration also sees ntia having larger role in national emergency planning see below programs and budgets until fy2004 the ntia budget had three major components salaries and expenses information infrastructure grants programs and public telecommunications facilities planning and construction however the infrastructure grants program was eliminated in fy2005 in both fy2006 and fy2007 the bush administration requested ending httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21469 funding for the public telecommunications facilities planning and construction program salaries and expenses this portion of the ntia budget includes funding to maintain ongoing programs for domestic and international policy development federal spectrum and related research for fy2009 the bush administration has requested 192 million according to the administration this would sustain current efforts to provide basic research analytical and management topics of interest to the us telecommunications and information sectors of the economy other administrative and policy responsibilities that fall to ntia but are not separate program functions include domestic and international telecommunications policymaking the ntia advises the president vice president and secretary of commerce on international telecommunications treaties and represents us positions and policies at international conferences such as the world radio conference held by the international telecommunication union the ntia also advises the executive branch on ways to implement the 1996 telecommunications act pl 104104 further competition in telecommunications and develop technology neutral telecommunications policies at the same time it has produced series of reports on the digital divide in america who comprises this divide and what policies may help close the divide2 the ntia also is overseeing the transition of the management of the internet domain name system to the private sector3 2 digital divide commonly refers to those who have access to the internet and those who do not while some contend that the digital divide is political not policy issue the ntia has published

program that the bush administration has requested funding for comes out of the 2005 deficit reduction act that law and new ntia program called for the creation of digital transition and safety public

equipment and services nationwide the public broadcast system had mandate to convert all of its television broadcasts to digital by may 31 2003 the corporation for public broadcasting has reported that most but not all of its public broadcast members have that goal for fy2009 the bush administration has requested zero funding to close out existing digital construction and conversion projects and to end ntias role in this area the bush administration is seeking to place all funding for construction of public broadcasting facilities and conversion of analog broadcast to digital in the federal funding for the corporation for public broadcasting so it can expedite digital conversion technology opportunity program top in fy2005 the bush administration requested the termination of ntias information infrastructure grants program called the technology opportunity program top congress agreed with this request and eliminated funding for this program8 top was competitive meritbased matching grant program that was started in fy1994 to provide emerging telecommunications and information technologies to grant recipients in new and innovative ways9 the bush administration and congress agreed that this program had httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21469 successfully served its purpose of creating new pilot programs in areas not served or underserved by telecommunications and internet technologies while some policymakers have called for new funding for this program new legislation authorizing appropriations has been introduced to date conclusions policymakers continue to examine the proper role of ntia in supporting its programs and policies as well as the overall budget for ntia to support its mission according to some the telecommunications act of 1996 set into law deregulatory environment that requires less not more federal direction of telecommunications and information technology use the explosive growth of the internet since the mid1990s has reached nearly every part of america and internet access is virtually ubiquitous therefore beyond budget issues the role of ntia has changed in some policy areas two important issues facing ntias administration of public telecommunications policy are domain name registration and use of spectrum regarding domain names the expiration of the department of commercentia mou with icann on september 30 2006 has led to speculation over whether and how the mou might be renewed it also has raised concerns over the extent to which if at all ntia might ultimately relinquish control over icann and the domain name system second some are concerned that ntia is seeking to develop larger and broader policy role in spectrum management as result of losing funding in other program areas such as the top program and perhaps eventually the ptfpc program because spectrum and its use is an important alternative to terrestrial communications transmission and reception federal policy regarding its use 8 before 2000 the top program was called the technology information infrastructure assistance program tiiap 9 the top program was funded between 17 million to 21 million in the years preceding its termination for more information on the funding history of this program see httpwwwosecdocgovbmibudget06bibntiapdf viewed june 27 2007 crs6 and applications is an important national issue some question whether ntias evolving role in spectrum management is being fully coordinated with other federal institutions such as that of the federal communications commission10 second important issue is the role of ntia in the auction and management of spectrum the third ntia program that is administered by ntia but not directly funded by appropriated money comes out of the 2005 deficit reduction act that law pl 109 171 called for the creation of digital transition and safety public fund which would provide funding for further use of the electromagnetic spectrum by offsetting receipts received from the auction of licenses to use the older analog spectrum for other purposes the initial auction was held on january 24 2008 the receipts from the auction will fund the following programmatic functions at ntia perhaps the most notable and receiving the most public attention is digitalanalog converter box program to assist consumers in meeting the february 2009 deadline for receiving television broadcasts in digital format congress is watching this transition period and ntias role in it very closely concerns about changes in ntias mission and objectives also has been raised regarding the bush administrations elimination of funding for the top program and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21469 reducing funding for the ptfpc program the administration contends that the efforts of the former will be picked up by the private sector and the latter by the corporation for public broadcasting some still contend that it is not clear whether all of the possible areas of information infrastructure development have been saturated through the top program or if not yet saturated whether industry will find it profitable to provide the last mile11 of telecommunications and internet connections in areas not yet served for public telecommunications and facilities planning and construction an issue may arise as to whether the corporation for public broadcasting has the resources to administer facilities construction program the ultimate question may be whether this change will fundamentally affect the pace at which national broadcasting is converted to digital transmission 10 to alleviate these concerns the bush administration has announced that the assistant secretary of ntia will chair an interagency committee the policy and plans steering group which will seek to implement the presidents november 30 2004 spectrum policy initiative httpwwwntiadocgovntiahomegalleryppsg01242005htm viewed june 27 2007 11 the last mile is term that applies when an entire telecommunications
