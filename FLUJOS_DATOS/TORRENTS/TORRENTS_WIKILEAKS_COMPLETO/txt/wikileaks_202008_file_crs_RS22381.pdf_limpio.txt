conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities nasa opened its doors on october 1 1958 almost exactly year after the soviet union launched the worlds first satellite sputnik in the five decades since nasa has conducted farreaching prog rams in human and robotic spaceflight technology development nd scientific research nasa is managed from headquarters in wash ington dc it has nine major field centers ames research center moffett field ca dryden flight research center edwards ca glenn research center cleveland oh goddard space flight center greenbelt md johnson space center near

fy2007 budget for fy2007 nasa requested 16792 billion in new budget authority for fy2006 the agency received 16623 billion when adjusted for two acrosstheboard rescissions totaling 128 transfer of 27 million from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and suppl emental appropriation of 350 million for recovery from hurricane katrina the ne t requested increase for fy2007 was 1 or 32 if the onetime hurricane funding was excluded the house provided 16709 billion hr 5672 109th congress while the senate appropriations committee recommended 17797 billion of which 1040 b illion would

overall decrease for the account and the sum of the specified program increases and decreases notes rt research and technology comparisons with years before fy2006 are difficult at anything less than the total agency level because of repeated changes in nasas budget structure the only major such change for fy2007 is the new crossagency support programs category which consists of the education

space exploration often referred to as the moonmars program the president directed nasa to focus its efforts on re turning humans to the moon by 2020 and some day sending them to mars nd worlds beyond twelve u s astronauts walked on the moon between 1969 and 1972 humans have visited mars the president also directed nasa to fulfill its commitments to its partners in building the international space station iss russia japan ca and 10 european countries the president added only 1 billion to nasa s budget plan to implement the vision out of the estimated 126 billion that would be needed for fy20052009 the rest is tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22381crs4 1 quoted in nasa will protect cev station against flatbudget squeeze aerospace daily and defense report january 11 2007be redirected from other nasa activities to free funds for the vision the space shuttle program will be terminated in 2010 rather than in 2015 or ter as was planned prior to the 2003 loss of the shuttle columbia and us use of the iss will end by fy2017 key issue created by the vision is whether nasa should be voted solely to human space exploration or should retain its commitment to scien ce and aeronautics under the vision nasa is to develop new spacecraft called orion formerly the crew exploration vehicle nd launch vehicle for it called ares i formerly the crew launch vehicle with an earthorbit capability by 2014 and the ability to take astronauts to and from the moon later than 2020 nasa st resses however that this is goas youcanpay program with its pace set in pa rt by available funding cost estimate for the vision as whole has not been provided by nasa the implementation plan released on september 19 2005 estimates that it will cost 104 billion to return astronauts to the moon not including robotic missions or 20 billion to use orion to service the iss nasa plans at least two robotic missions to the moon the first in 2008 to provide data on potential landing sites nasa created the exploration systems mission directorate esmd to implement the moonmars program the fy2007 budget request and its outyear projections proposed shifting about 15 billion out of esmd to help pay for shortfalls in the space shuttle and iss programs in order to fund orion and ares i other esmd activities were significantly cut including project prometheus to develop space nuclear power and propulsion systems and microgravity research on the iss final congressional action on the fy2007 budget reduced funding for esmd by further 750 million relative to the request these reductions put pressure on the schedule for orion and ares i key congressional issues the major issue facing congress as it debated nasas fy2007 budget request was how to implement the vision deba over nasas fy 2005 and fy 2006 budgets answered the question of whether the vision should be adopted the 2005 nasa authorization act pl 109155 directs nasa to establish program to accomplish the goals set out by the president howeve r that law and nas as fy2006 appropriations act pl 109108 em phasize that nasa should have balanced set of programs that include not only those related to the vision but science and aeronautics as well exacerbating the dilemma of how to maintain this balance w ithout significant longterm budget increase nasa is contending with the costs of returning the space shuttle to flight status completing the iss and overruns in number of science progra ms dr griffin has stated that i will do everything i can to keep orion and ares i on schedule that will be right behind keeping shuttle and station on track and then after that well fill up the bucket with our other priorities1 impact on nasas science programs the fy2007 request proposed taking 31 billion from the science mission directorate smd over the fi veyear period fy20072011 relativ to projections in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22381crs5 fy2006 budget most of that about 2 billion was to cover shortfall in the space shuttle and iss budgets the proposed budget for smd increased by 15 in fy2007 and 1 in the subsequent f our years less than the projections given in the fy2006 budget and less than the rate of inflation in addition the fy2006 initial operating plan showed that nasa shifted 176 m illion from smd to esmd in fy 2006 and took the entire congressionally directed genera l reduction for the science ae ronautics and exploration account 90 million from smd nasa official s stressed that funding for space science during the 1990s and early 2000s grew at ra faster than the total nasa budget and stated that sustaining such increases was not possible they also said that science programs accounted for 32 of nasas b udget in the fy2007 request significantly more than the 24 allocated to them in 1992 the requested budget would have delayed or deferred several space science programs because of budget constraints among these were two space telescopes the space interferometry mission and the terrestrial pl anet finder several robotic mars probes dedicated mission to study jupiters m oon europa research on new space propulsion and spacecraft power sources and the gl obal precipitation mission funding for research and analysis which provides grant funding to individual investigators would have been cut 15 funding was requested for the sofia airbor ne infrared telescope on the other hand the request did include fy 2007 funding for missions such as the james webb space telescope robotic ma rs probes to be launched at each of the next three launch opportunities 2007 2009 and 2011 the juno probe to study jupiter the glory spacecraft to study atmospheric aerosols and solar irradiance and dedicated land remote sensing satellite to continue the landsat series information on all these programs is available on nasas website at httpsciencehqnasagovmissions the house provided 75 million more than the request for science 50 million more for research and analysis 15 million to initiate planning for europa mission and 10 million for continued deve lopment of the terrestrial planet finder the senate appropriations committee recommended an increase of 315 million and directed nasa to fund sofia through reprogramming request the final appropriation after adjusting for full cost simplifi cation was reduction of 216 million impact on aeronautics the fy2007 budget request for the aeronau tics research mission directorate was consistent with the outyear projection for fy2007 in the fy2006 request but the structure and content of the program changed significantly in february 2005 nasa proposed transforming the largest element of the aeronautics program vehicle systems by placing more emphasis on barrierbreaking demonstrations and focusing resources on smaller number of research areas among the topics to be eliminated from the restructured program were hypersonics rotorcraft and most of subsonic aeronautics this pr oposal drew strong criticism from the house and senate committees with oversight over nasa in late 2005 nasa reshaped its plans for aeronautics in manne r that it described as consistent with direction received fro m our committees the new plan which was reflected in the fy2007 request refocused the program on core competencies in subsonic supersonic and hypersonic flight including rotorcraft the form er vehicle systemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22381crs6 program was renamed f undamental aeronautics to reflect its new character the other two programs aviation safety and airspace systems had their content reorganized fourth program the aeronautics test program was created to ensure the availability of aeronautics test facilitie s such as wind tunnels whose continued viability has been under pressure for several years aeronautics research supporte rs have expressed continuing concern over the programs downward funding trend the impact of that reduced funding on the nasa workforce has also been an issue for congress the new national aeronautics research and development policy require d by the fy2006 appropriations act and issued by president bush as an executive order on december 20 2006 came too late to influence action in the 109th congress an amendment to the senate fy2007 budget resolution samdt 3033 to sconres 83 increased the recommended funding for nasa aeronautics by 179 million the hous provided an increase of 100 million house report language directed nasa to report on its response to the national research councils decadal survey of aeronautics released in june 2006 the senate ppropriations committee recommended an increase of 35 million the fi nal appropriation afte r adjusting for the full cost simplification accounting change was an increase of 361 million the space shuttle and the in ternational space station construction of the iss suspended after the columbia disaster was resumed in september 2006 nasa plans 13 shuttle flights in 20072010 to complete iss construction plus one mission in 2008 to service the hubble space telescope nasa has also allocated 500 million over five years to help privatesector companies develop lowcost space transportation systems that could service the iss after the shuttle is retired the gap between the end of shuttle flig hts in 2010 and the planned availability of orion in 2014 raises several issues some an alysts are concerned that placing fixed termination date on the shuttle may create schedule pressure similar to that identified as contributing factor in the columbia accident some question whether the united states should be dependent on russia to launch us astronauts to the iss during the gap period major concern is how nasa will retain its skilled workforce during the transition from shuttle to orion especially if orion s schedule slips and the gap lengthens some also question is whether completing the iss is worth the cost which is about 2 billion per year plus 4 billion per year for the shuttle considering the modest research agenda that remains following the vision speech the president directed nasa to narrow the program of research on the iss to include only what is needed to accomplish the vision alternatively some want to restore the iss research program the 2005 nasa authorization act pl 109155 for example directs that 15 of iss research spending be used for nonvisionrelated re search fulfilling us commitments to its international partners is seen by some obser vers as sufficient rationale for continued us involvement in the iss others find this argument inadequate the house provided 41 million less for expl oration capabilities than was requested for fy2007 including 33 million less for the iss pr ogram in light of the uncertainties surrounding the nature and scope of the science to be conduc ted on the iss the senate appropriations committee recomme nded the requested amount the final appropriation after adjusting for full cost simplif ication was an increase of 32 million
