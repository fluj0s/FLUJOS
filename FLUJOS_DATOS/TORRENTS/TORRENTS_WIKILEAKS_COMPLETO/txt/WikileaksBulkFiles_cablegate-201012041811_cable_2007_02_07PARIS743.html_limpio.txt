political ministercounselor josiah rosenblatt for reaso ns 14 b and d summary 1 c during meeting with codel tanner on february 22 french mfa political director gerard araud reviewed the current state of the bilateral relationship commented on natos continuing purpose and compared frances and britains historically distinct orientations towards the us he also discussed afghanistan and iran two outstanding cases of usfrench cooperation on afghanistan araud highlighted frances continued participation in nato operations but called for more explicitly defined political strategy for reaching desired endstate on iran he emphasized the need for continuing pressure on iran through p5 unity which is impacting on ahmadinejads weakened position and which offers the only hope for negotiated outcome end summary natos purpose 2 c mfa political director gerard araud hosted codel tanner in paris for the annual discussions of the nato parliamentary assembly npa economic committee with the oecd to meeting and luncheon on february 22 ambassadors stapleton and morella also attended both sides saluted the historical links and continuing cultural and economic ties between the us and france along with our wideranging diplomatic cooperation araud took the opportunity of the visit of the us members of the nato parliamentary assembly to offer in his typically plainspoken fashion thumbnail history of usfrench relations since world war ii including our different approaches to nato recalling an cold war bromide araud said that natos original purpose had been to keep the germans down the russians out and the americans in its current purpose is for the newer central european and baltic members given their fear of russia rational or not to keep the americans in for other members nato provides way to meet their defense without having to pay for it araud decried the abysmally low defense spending by the european allies among the europeans only the french and the british come close to carrying their weight an exception which can be explained by their history as global powers and their residual desire to exert influence transatlantic ties the cases of britain france and germany 3 c taking up this theme araud offered the codel historical disquisition on the differences between frances and britains postwar relationship with the us britain for its part tries to ride the tiger influencing us policy behind the scenes this is what they have tried to do on iraq with what success we might ask france on the other hand tries to defend its interests tries to exist as an independent player the us often views this simply as opposition or antiamericanism which it isnt were trying to exist and to exercise our right to have our own opinion including on how to address international crises that means that we may agree in some cases as on iran where we work extremely closely coordinating daily in others as in iraq we disagreed and still do this is not antiamericanism its france developing its own analyses and exercising its own policy stepping back araud recalled that the 1956 suez crisis had marked the end of both france and the uks great power aspirations each however drew different lesson from their joint failure us opposition to the suez operation which together with the soviet unions threat to use nuclear weapons had scuttled the anglofrench operation had led the british to conclude that nothing was possible without the americans and that their influence would have to be applied through the us by being at its side and having its voice heard as americas most trusted ally the french took distinctly different course that of autonomy and independence as symbolized in its decision few months after suez to create its own nuclear force germany was case apart for historical reasons with military that was totally integrated into nato it was americas model ally now things are changing for the first time since ww ii during the iraq crisis germany opposed the us while the british and french conception of their own roles the special relationship and independenceautonomy respectively still apply germanys is now question mark afghanistan paris 00000743 002 of 003 4 c in the back and forth that followed arauds presentation ambassador stapleton noted that we describe the current state of the relationship as normal characterization which arauds historical synopsis supported its relationship we value said the ambassador and we certainly do not take the french for granted rep john tanner dtn agreed on the value of diversity of opinion reaffirming strong us support for nato he pointed to afghanistan as the alliances defining issue the us appreciates frances support in this crucial battle congressman paul gillmor roh vicepresident of the npa noted the importance of the nato to the us frances commitment of resources to defense and the commonality of interests in our joint effort in afghanistan note congressmen tanner and gillmor earlier met with french television and print media to push for strengthened allied support in afghanistan end note araud agreed citing the recent dispatch of the french aircraft carrier charles gaulle to the region which will allow france to increase its participation in airstrikes in afghanistan however frances concern is lack of political strategy concerning afghanistan point chirac tried to make at the riga summit perhaps frances proposed contact group wasnt the right solution said araud as it raises the question of neighboring countries roles and afghanistans as well but at the end of the day success in afghanistan will be political and we are simply not convinced we have political strategy an endgame in view roadmap to success if what we are doing simply amounts to killing taliban every spring some of us five years from now will have tired of this thats our concern were not criticizing nato which is doing its job its the political strategy thats missing for example iran is natural ally in the fight against the taliban and there is the drug problem which affects you us and russia were concerned about where were going iran 5 c responding to congressman dennis moores dks question about the french view of iran araud underlined how closely the us and france have been working together over the past four years he distinguished iran from north korea criminal regime which doesnt care about the suffering of its people iran on the other hand is sort of democracy proud country where public opinion counts for something and which doesnt want to be seen as pariah state this complex reality calls for dual policy readiness to negotiate but in context of international pressure during the negotiation of unscr 1737 difference opened up between the us and the eu3 said araud with the us seeking stronger text while the europeans insisted on one that could be supported by the p5 araud contended that now the us agrees retrospectively that the europeans were right on insisting on unanimous outcome one that could not be interpreted as the west ganging up on iran unsc unanimity and especially chinas vote sent powerful message of irans isolation impacting strongly on iranian public opinion araud admitted that mercantile factors were driving some especially the russians while the french treasury is furious about us warnings to european banks about their operations with iran said araud those efforts work theyre very effective araud commented that the us military option is taken very seriously in iran as recounted to him by wellknown french journalist bernard guetta who recently returned from tehran the iranians are terrified they take the us military threat seriously people dont want it another important factor is ahmadinejads growing weakness he was elected because he wasnt corrupt he promised housing and good administration but he hasnt delivered and there was his recent defeat in the municipal elections that said although the music has changed the words havent the iranians continue to refuse to suspend enrichment therefore we must keep up the pressure and the pressure is working so now we must work on second sanctions resolution and keep the door open to double suspension deal with iran we havent failed emphasized araud according to guetta he said many people close to supreme leader khamenei had incredibly violent things to say about ahmadinejad whom they regard as an upstart they want him out the subdued celebration of revolution day including ahmadinejads speech in which he did not mention the holocaust was significant araud also pointed to recent press interview with velayati in which he affirmed that the holocaust was historical reality we have two to three years concluded araud to work on this before iran gets the bomb we will and must continue to work on this together including with the russians and chinese 6 u codel tanner did not have the opportunity to clear this cable before departing paris please visit paris
