introduction to the federal budget process by robert keith and allen schick also see crs report 97865 points of order in the congressional budget process by james v saturnothe budget reconciliation process house and senate procedures introduction overview of the budget reconciliation process the congressional budget act of 1974 established the congressional budget process1 under the act the house and senate are required to adopt at least one budget resolution each year2 the budget resolution which takes the form of concurrent resolution and is not sent to the president fo r his approval or veto serves as congressional statement in broad rms regarding the ap propriate revenue spending and debtlimit policies as well as guide to the subsequent consideration of legislation implementing such policies at agency and programmatic levels budget resolution policies are enforced through variety of mechanisms including points of order3 the house and senate budget committees which were created by the 1974 act exercise exclusive jurisdiction ove r budget resolutions and are responsible for monitoring their enforcement in developing budget resolution the house and senate budget committees use various sources of budgetary informa tion and analysis including baseline budget projections of revenue spe nding and the deficit or surplus prepared by the congressional budget office cbo budget resolution typically reflects many different assumptions regarding legislative action expected to occur during session that would cause revenue nd spending levels to be changed from baseline amountshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs2 4 direct spending is provided mainly in substantive law under the jurisdiction of the legislative committees in contrast to discretionary spending which is provided in annual appropriations acts under the jurisdiction of the house and senate appropriations committees most direct spending programs are entitlements such as social security medicare federal civilian and military retirement and unemployment compensation 5 the use of omnibus legislati on is not unique to the budget reconciliation process in the case of most omnibus measures however the rm is not used in the legislations title as is often done with respect to reconciliation measures during the past decade or two the terms omnibus or consolidated omnibus have been applied to some annual appropriations acts these measures have c onnection to the reconciliation process for examples of the application of this term to annual appropriations acts see crs report rl32473 omnibus appropriations acts overview of recent practices by robert keithmost revenue and direct spending4 however occurs automatically each year under permanent law therefore if the committees with jurisdiction over the revenue and direct spending programs do not report legislation to carry out the budget resolution policies by amending existin g law revenue and direct spending for these programs likely will continue without change the budget reconciliation process is an optional procedure that operates as an adjunct to the budget resolution process the chief purpose of the reconciliation process is to enhance congresss ability to change current law in order to bring revenue spending and debtlimit levels into conformity with the policies of the budget resolution accordingly reconcilia tion can be potent budget enforcement tool for large portion of the budget reconciliation is twostage process first reconciliation instructions are included in the budget resolution directin g the appropriate committees to develop legislation achieving the desired budgetar outcomes if the budget resolution instructs more than one committee in chamber then the instructed committees submit their legislative recommendations to their respective budget committees by the deadline prescribed in the budget reso lution the budget committees incorporate them into an omnibus budget reconcilia tion bill without making any substantive revisions5 the second step involves consideration of the resultant reconciliation legislation by the house and senate unde r expedited procedures among other things debate in the senate on any r econciliation measure is limite d to 20 hours and 10 hours on conference report and amendments must be germane and not include extraneous matter the house rules committee typically recommends special rule for the consideration of reconcilia tion measure in the house th at places restrictions on debate time and the offering of amendments in cases where only one committee has been instructed the process allows that committee to report its reconciliation legislation directly to its parent chamber thus bypassing the budget committee in so years budget resolutions included reconciliation instructions that afforded the house and senate the option of considering two or more different reconciliation bills once the reconciliation legislation called for in the budget resolu tion has been approved or vetoed by the president the process is concluded c ongress cannot develop another reconciliationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs3 6 see crs report rl30714 congressional action on revenue and debt reconciliation measures in 2000 by robert keith 7 on december 15 1975 the senate considered amended and passed hr 5559 the revenue adjustment act of 1975 which reduc ed revenues by about 64 billion pursuant to directive in the second budget resolution for fy1976 the measure was not regarded as reconciliation bill when it was considered by the house but it was considered under reconciliation procedures in the senate presid ent gerald ford vetoed the measure later in the year and the house sustained his veto the remarks of senator russell long and the presiding officer on page 40540 and the remarks of senator edmund muskie and others on pages 4054440550 in the congressional record vol 121 dec 15 1975 regarding the status of hr 5559 as reconciliation billbill in the wake of veto without first adopting another budget resolution containing reconciliation instructions as an optional procedure reconciliation has not been used in every year that the congressional budget process has been in effect beginning with the first use of reconciliation by both the house and nate in 1980 however reconciliation has been used in most years in three years 1998 for fy1999 2002 for fy2003 and 2004 for fy2005 the house and senate did not agree on budget resolution congress has sent the president 19 reconciliation acts over the years 16 were signed into law and three were vetoed and the vetoes not overriden table 1 provides list of these 19 reconciliation acts not every reconciliation measure considered by one chamber has been considered by the other chamber or been regarded as reconciliation measure when considered by the other chamber in 2000 for example the house considered and passed several reconciliation measures but they were not considered by the senate6 in 1976 the senate considered hous epassed revenue b ill under reconciliation procedures although the measure had not b een considered as reconciliation bill in the house the bill later was vetoed7 conversely in 1984 the house and senate agreed to deficitreduction legislation that had been considered as reconciliation bill by the house but not the senate the b ill the deficit reduction act of 1984 was signed into law by president ronald reag an pl 98369 but was not designated as reconciliation measure historical development the budget reconciliation process reflects complex set of rules procedures and practices employed by the house and senate like other complex processes of the house and senate such as the annual appropriations proce ss the reconciliation process has been marked by significant change over time the house and senate have adapted reconciliation procedures to fit changing political and budgetary circumstanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs4 table 1 reconciliation resolutions and resultant reconciliation acts fy1981fy2005 fiscal yearbudget resolution

congressional research service the framers of the congressional budget act of 1974 anticipated that changes might be made from time to time in the budget reso lution and reconciliation processes that it established in an effort to provide limited procedural flexibility the act contains provision referred to as the elastic clause originally framed as section 301b2 the elastic clause authorized the hous and senate to include in budget resolution at their discretion an other procedure which is considered appropriate to carry out the purposes of this act the clause later was redesignated as section 301b4 and revised to read the concurrent resolution on the budget may 4 set forth such other matters and require such other procedures relating to the budget as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this act the house and senate have used author ity under the elastic clause to modify reconciliation procedures over time in many significant ways including advancing the use of reconciliation to the spring budget resolution and extending the reconciliation time frame from one year to multiple ears while some innovations in reconciliation procedure were dropped others persis ted and eventually were incorporated into the 1974 act as require d elements of reconciliation procedure two of the most significant change s in reconciliation procedure involved advancing its use to the spring budget re solution and extending its time frame from one year to multiple years paralleling the changes in budget resolution scheduling and time frame as originally framed the 1974 act re quired the adoption of two budget resolutions each year the first budget resolution to be adopted in the spring set advisory budget vels for the upcoming fiscal year the second budget resolution to be adopted on september 15 just before the start of the new fiscal yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs6 on october 1 set binding budget levels for the year reconcilia tion was established as an adjunct to the adoption of the second budget resolution congress and the president could use reconciliation procedures to quickly make any adjustments in existing law or pending legislation that were required to achie ve budget policies as they changed between the adoption of the spring and fall budget resolutions action on any required reconciliation legislation was expected to be completed by september 25 in the early 1980s the house and senate abandoned the practice of adopting second budget resolution choosing instead to adopt single budget resolution in the spring of each year although the schedule often slipped sometime s markedly this change in practice formally was incor porated into the 1974 act by the balanced budget and emergency deficit contro l act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 december 12 1985 99 stat 10371101 the growing prominence of the spring budget resolution was indicated by the decision in 1980 to use it to initiate reconc iliation procedures for fy 1981 reconciliation procedures were used again the following year as an adjunct to the adoption of the fy1982 budget resolution in the spring but the budget resolution and reconciliation time fra was extended to three years fy1982fy1984 although figures for the latter two years were considered to be planning levels these changes occurred for several reasons including the belief that an advancement in the reconciliation schedule was needed to allow committees more time to develop their reconciliation recommendations and to allow the house and senate more time to consider them on the floor and reconcile their differences in conference and that an extended time frame would prom ote more effective and lasting changes in budgetary policy while discouraging evasions of enforcement in addition to the changes made with respect to the timing and scheduling of reconciliation the 1974 act has b een amended to bar in the senate the inclusion of extraneous matter in reconc iliation legislation see later discussion of section 313 of the act known as the byrd rule althoug h section 313 operates as rule of the senate it has also dramatically affected the development of reconciliation legislation in the house and at times been sour ce of friction between the two chambers other significant changes in reconciliation practice have derived from the changing political and budgetary environment or changes in precedent and have not relied upon the elastic clause initial actions under reconciliation for example focused on deficitreduction efforts cons equently the procedures were employed to achieve spending reductions and revenue increases on ne t basis in the latter part of the 1990s particularly when large surplu ses emerged in the federal budget for the first time in decades the focus of rec onciliation action was sh ifted to reducing revenues which continued into the 2000s most recently for fy2006 reconciliation directives entail reductions in both revenues and spendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs7 underlying authorities of the reconciliation process the principal authorities underlying the reconciliation proce ss are set forth in two key sections of title iii congressional budget process of the congressional budget act of 1974 section 310 2 usc 641 establishes th basic reconciliation procedures and section 313 2 usc 644 establishes sena rule aimed at preventing the inclusion of extraneous ma tter in reconciliation gislation the text of section 310 and sec tion 313 is provided in appendix and appendix b respectively in addition other provisions in title iii have bearing on the reconc iliation process section 300 2 usc 631 for example lays down the timetable of the congressional budget process indicating that congress should complete action on any required reconciliation legislation by june 15 during session section 301 2 usc 632 contains pr ovision authorizing the inclusion in budget resolution of reconciliation direc tives in subsection b2 deferred enrollment procedure to used in connection with reconciliation in subsection b3 and other appropriate ma tters and procedures under the elastic clause in subsection b4 section 305 2 usc 636 sets forth in subsection b senate procedures for the consideration of budget resolutions whic h by virtue of reference in section 310e also apply to the consideration of reconciliation measures except for the time limit on debate points of order pertaining to the enforcement of timing requirements substantive budget resolution policies and the jurisdiction of the house and senate budget committees that could apply to the consideration of r econciliati on measures are found in sections 302 303 and 311 additi onal points of order that could apply to reconciliation measures dealing with budgetary legislation not subject to appropriations and unfunde d mandates are set forth in t itle iv of the act finally section 904 2 usc 621 note imposes threefifths vote requirement on waivers and appeals of the ruling of the chair with respect to certain points of order under the act section 310 of the congressional budget act of 1974 section 310a of the 1974 act provides for the inclusion of reconciliation directives in budget resolution the dir ectives shall to the extent necessary to effectuate the provisions nd requirements of such reso lution specify the total amounts by which spending revenues th public debt limit or combination of these elements are to be changed the direc tives take the form of instructions to each appropriate committee to make changes in the laws under its jurisdiction to achieve the specified budgetary results under section 310b when only one committee in the house or senate is subject to reconciliation directives it reports its recommendations directly to itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs8 chamber when two or more committ ees in the house or senate receive reconciliation instructions each committee submits its recommendations to its respective budget committee the budget committee incorporates the recommendations of ll of the instructed committees without any substantive revision into an omnibus measure which it then reports to its chamber the subsection refers to reconcilia tion resolution which is concurrent resolution directing the clerk of the house or the secretary of the senate to make changes in legislation that has not yet been enrolled reconciliation resolution is intended to be used with deferred enrollment procedure see discussion below but the house and senate instead have always used reconciliation bills section 310c known informally as the fungibility rule grants some flexibility to committees subject to reconciliation directives pertaining to both spending and revenues this provision pplies principally to the house ways and means committee and the senate fina nce committee because they exercise jurisdiction in their chambers over tax legislation generally some other committees exercise jurisdiction over matters such as certain fees involving budgetary transactions that are treated as revenues in essence the fungibility rule deems either committee to be in compliance with its r econciliation directives if its recommended legislation does not cause either the spe nding changes or the revenue changes to exceed or fall below its instruction by more than 20 of the sum of the two types of changes and the total amount of change s recommended is not less than the total amount of changes that were directed section 310d imposes requirement in the house and senate that amendments be deficit neutral but suspe nds the requirement if declar ation of war is in effect the subsection provides that in the senate motion to strike always is in order notwithstanding the deficitneutrality requirement further the subsection authorizes the house rules committee to make in order amendments to achieve compliance with the reconciliation instructions in th event one or more of the instructed committees fail to submit recommendations senate procedures for the considera tion of budget resolutions are made applicable to the consideration of rec onciliation measures by section 310e except that the 50hour debate limit pplicable to budget resolutions is reduced to 20hour limit for reconciliation bills section 310f is intended to enforce in the house the june 15 deadline for completing action on reconciliation legislation as indicated in the timetable in section 300 it does so by barring the c onsideration in july of an adjournment resolution providing for the traditional augu st recess if the house has not completed action there is comparable pr ovision in the act for the senate finally section 310g prohibits the consideration of any reconciliation measure including special reconcilia tion measure under section 258c of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 see discussion below that contains recommendations with resp ect to the social security programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs9 8 see section 7 in the conference report second concurrent resolution on the b udget fiscal year 1981 to accompany hconres 448 hrept 961469 nov 19 1980 p 9section 313 of the congressional budget act of 1974 section 313 of the 1974 act is informally known as the byrd rule after its chief sponsor senator robert c byrd the byrd rule originated on october 24 1985 as amendment 878 as modified to s 1730 the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act cobra of 1985 the senate adopted the amendment by vote of 960 in this form the byrd rule applied to initial senate consideration of reconciliation measures but short while later its coverage was extended to conference reports senator byrd explained that the basi c purposes of the amendment were to protect the effectiveness of the reconciliation process by excluding extraneous matter that often provoke d controversy without aiding deficit reduction efforts and to preserve the deliberative character of the senate by excluding from consideration under expedited procedures legislative matters not central to deficit reduction that should be debated under regular procedures the rule achieves its purposes by defini ng six categories of extraneous matter in reconciliation legi slation and several exceptions thereto and providing points of order against any such matter the byrd rule and its operation is discussed in more detail in the section of this report dealing with initial consideration in the senate during the first five years that the by rd rule was in effect from late 1985 until late 1990 it consisted of two separate components 1 provision in statute applying to initial senate consideration of reconciliation measures and 2 senate resolution extending application of portions of the st atutory provision to conference reports and amendments between the two chambers veral modifications were made to the byrd rule in 1986 and 1987 including extendi ng its expiration date from january 2 1987 to january 2 1988 and then to september 30 1992 but the two separate components of the rule were preserve d in 1990 these components were merged together and made permanent when they were incorporated into the 1974 act as section 313 there have been furthe r changes in the byrd rule since 1990 procedural provisions in budget resolutions pursuant to authority granted in sec tion 301b of the 1974 act including the elastic clause the house and senate have on occasi on included procedural provisions in budget resolutions that aff ect the reconciliation process several examples are discussed below in 1980 the second budget resolution for fy1981 contained bar against house or senate consider ation of

five years and the second five years covered by the most recently adopted budget resolution any increase in direct spending or reduction in revenues resulting from such legislation must be offset by

spending ie entitlement and other mandatory spending including offsetting receipts made in annua l appropriations acts be scored against the appropriations committees section 302b allocations of sp

directives the fundamental purpose of reconciliation directives is to compel committees to develop legislation to ach ieve certain goals reflected in the budget resolution that require changes in existing law or pending legislation to be realized directive to committee represents an expression of the intent of the parent chamber that the specified legislative action be carried out reconciliation directives and the budget resolution policies that underpin them are expressed in terms of highly aggreg ated dollar amounts and do not determine the budgetary outcomes for individual accounts programs or activities decisions at these levels remain the prerogative of the committees with jurisdiction over spending and revenue legislation in few rare instances howev er reconciliation directives have been couched in pr ogrammatic terms in the fy1981 budget resolution for example the senate appropriations committee was instructed to limit appropriations for fiscal year 1981 subsid ies to the us postal service to particular level as part of the reconciliation directives14 in response to parliamentary inquiry on may 19 1982 how ever the senate presiding officer advised that reconciliation directives may not specify that the instructed committee must achieve its changes from certain ty pes of programs or in specific ways15 nonetheless the budget committees may indicate particular options or assumptions that would allow an instructed committee to meet its spending or revenue reconciliation directives partly to garner credibility and support for the budget resolution and partly to infl uence the subseque nt policy debates reconciliation directive to committee usually consists of several components 1 an identification of the house or senate committee being instructed 2 the type of budgetary changes that are in tended to be achieved by changes in laws bills and resolutions within the instructed committees jurisdiction together with specified amounts 3 the fis cal year periods to which the changes apply and 4 deadline by which the instructed committees must submit their recommendations to their respective budget committee or if singly instructed report them to their chamber each dollar amount of change fo r fiscal year time period is regarded as separate directive committee instructed to achieve savings in direct spending outlays of 100 million for the first fiscal year and 800 million for fivefiscal year period for example is considered to be subject to two different directives given that the language authorizing rec onciliation directives refers to changes such directives may properly recommend bot h increases and decreases in revenues spending and the debt limit see further discussion belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs14 16 congress and the president create new budget authority through the enactment of laws agencies incur obligations that is financia l liabilities through such means as employing personnel entering into contracts and submitting purchase orders within the framework of available budget authority finally outlays sometimes referred to as expenditures ensue when obligations are liquidated or paid off th rough such means as ectronic fund transfers the issuance of checks or the disbursement of cash outlays levels not budget authority levels are compared to revenue levels to termine the level of the deficit or surplustypes of directives section 310a of the 1974 act enumerates three different types of budgetary changes that reconciliation directives may require 1 spending in the form of new budget authority for the budget year and thereafter budget authority initially provided for prior fiscal years new entitlement authority and credit authority 2 revenues 3 and the statutory limit on the public debt in addition section 310a provides that rec onciliation directives may combine any of the three types of changes including direction to achie ve deficit reduction representing combination of spendi ng reductions and revenue increases the type of budgetary changes incl uded in the reconciliation directives determines the type of legislation that will result after the first several years of experience with reconciliation spending dir ectives have applied almost exclusively to direct spending also known as mandato ry spending rather than discretionary spending direct spending which is under the jurisdiction of the legislative committees of the house and senate funds entitlements nd other mandatory programs eg medicare unemploy ment compensation federal employee retirement largely on permanent basis discretionary sp ending which mainly funds the ongoing operations of federal ag encies falls under the jurisdiction of the house and senate appr opriations committees and is provided in annual appropriations acts under current practice reconciliation directives for direct spending generally refer to changes in outlay levels16 while such directives usually specify the dollar amounts by which outlay levels are to be changed for time the house budget committee specified the total outlay level that should occur after the required changes had been made therefore th amount of changes involved had to be calculated by comparing baseline levels to the levels expected to occur following reconciliation in the course of complying with directive to change spending committee may recommend changes in offsettin g collections or offsetting receipts within its jurisdiction offsetting collections which include many user fees are treated as negative spending reconciliation directives have sometimes been used to affect discretionary spending levels although this is not the usual practice initia lly reconciliation was used to directly change the levels of discretionary spending the house appropriations committee in the fy1981 budget resolution and the senate appropriations committee in the fy1981 and fy1982 budget resolutions were instructed to reduce spending for the fiscal year already in progress in order to comply with these instructions the co mmittees recommended resc issions of annual appropriations that already had been enact ed the rescissions were considered separately from the reconciliation legislation for those yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs15 more expansive and indirect atte mpt to reduce discretionary spending through the reconciliation process occu rred in 1981 the fy1982 budget resolution included reconciliation directives that in part required legislative committees to reduce authorizations of appr opriations the intent behind this approach was to set in place reduced authorization levels over threeyear period that would reduce spending levels in the annua l appropriations acts considered in each of those years this approach was widely regarded as having unnecessarily complicated the reconciliation legislation and strained relationships between the authorizing committees and the appropriations committees the house and senate budget committees have not returned to this pproach except occasionally on much more selective basis in the senate such nguage probably would be judged extraneous under the byrd rule on the ground that it does not affect outlays due to the dispersal of spending jurisdiction to almost every standing committee of the house and senate nearly ever one of them has been involved in reconciliation at least once directives to change revenue levels have been less complicated generally in that they have not differentiated between different sources of revenue such as individual incomes taxes corporate income taxes or excise taxes on occasion revenue reconciliation directiv have been accompanied by directives to change outlays because some taxrelated changes such as increases in refundable tax credits are scored as outlays conversely in some in stances changes in spending programs may affect revenue levels as mentioned previously reconciliation directives may also instruct committee to achieve level of deficit reduction reflecting combination of spending reductions and revenues increases at the committees discretion in the reconciliation process compliance with reconciliation directives is judged on net basis or on the basis of the bottom line consequently directives to reduce spending or increase revenues in or der to achieve defi cit reduction generally may include sweeteners that increase spending and reduce revenues so long as the required amount of defic it reduction is accomplished as practiced by the house and senate reconciliation instruction to reduce spending or increase revenues includes target that is minimum amount of spending reduction or revenue increase floor similarly reconciliation instruction to increase spending or redu ce revenues includes target that is maximum amount of spending increase or revenue reduc tion ceiling for years the public debt limit has been codified in section 3101b of title 31 united states code periodic adjustments in the debt limit take the form of amendments to 31 usc 3101b usually by striking the current dollar limitation and inserting new one while most adjustments to the debt limit have been increases in some instances the debt limit has been reduced or extended at its current level for specified interval for example pl 455 of the 79th congress 60 stat 316 june 26 1946 reduced the debt limit from 300 billion to 275 billion as budget surpluses reemerged following worl d war ii while the debt limit has been adjusted in reconciliation gislation in most instances congress employs anotherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs16 17 for more information on this topic see crs report rs21519 legislative procedures for adjusting the public

the debt limit17 from time to time budget resolutions ve included contin gent reconciliation directives under contingent directiv the amount of changes in spending or revenue that committee is directed to ach ieve may be adjusted at later time upon the happening of contingency th fy1998 budget resolution for example provided for an adjustment in the senate finance co mmittees rec onciliation directives as well as the committees spendi ng allocations and other budget levels to accommodate fiveyear childrens h ealth initiative of up to 16 billion the adjustments were made contingent upon the committee reporting reconciliation legislation with an excess of outlay savings so that the additional spending on the childrens health initiative would be deficit neutral18 in at least one instance reconcilia tion directives to committee became effective without any adju stment upon the happening of contingency the fy1996 budget resolution contained directiv to the senate finance committee to reduce revenues by 245 billion over seve n years upon the certification by the congressional budget office that spending reconciliation legislation would lead to balanced budget by fy2002 under the budget resolution if cbo did not certify balanced budget the reve nue reconciliation directives to the committee would not become effective and the revenue reducti ons could not be included in the final reconciliation bill19 multiple directives the house and senate typically use multiple directives in terms of the number of committees instructed and the types of budgetary changes designated when initia ting the reconciliation process whenever the house and senate included spending reconciliation direc tives in budget resolution more than one house and senate committee received them except for the fy2002 and fy2004 budget resolutions in these two cases the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee received instruc tions regarding outlays in order to accommodate the outlay effects of certain changes in revenue laws the number of house and senate committees given spending reconciliation directives in budget resolution ranged from one for both chambers both in the fy2002 and fy2004 budget resolutions to 14 for the senate and 15 for the house both in the fy1982 budget resolutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs17 reconciliation directives to change th statutory limit on the public debt are made only to single committee in each chamber because the h ouse ways and means committee and the senate finance committee exercise sole jurisdiction in their chambers over this matter while reconciliation directives to change revenue levels principally invol ve the ways and means committee and the finance committee other committees sometimes receive ch instructions as well as stated previously the ways and means committee and finance committee exercise jurisdiction in their chambers over the tax code and revenue s generally but some other committees exercise jurisdiction over matters such as certain fees involving budgetary transactions that are treated as revenues when reconciliation directives require different types of budgetary changes the committee recommendations affecting revenues spending or the debt limit as appropriate may be incorporated into single omnibus measure or considered as separate measures depending on how the directives are fashioned in the fy1998 budget resolution for example the sena finance committee received twopart reconciliation directive in section 104a section 104a5a instructed the committee to reduce outlays by 40911 billion for fy2002 and 100646 billion for fy1998fy2002 and section 104a5b inst ructed the committee to increase the statutory limit on the public debt to not more than 5950 trilli on seven other senate committees received an instruction to reduce spending or the deficit in section 104a in sepa rate provision section 104b the finance committee was instructed to reduce revenues by not more than 205 billion in fy2002 and 85 billion for fy1998fy2002 accordingly in response to its directives the finance committee could develop reconc iliation legislation reducing spending and raising the debt limit for inclusion in an omnibus bill and reducing revenues in separate bill under current procedures in the sena only one reconciliation measure of each type of budgetary change is allowed t hus budget resolution may create as many as three reconciliation bills one for spending one for revenues and one for the debt limit the reconciliation directives however may not lead to two reconciliation bills for spending or two for revenues or two for the debt limit in the case of the fy2006 budget resolution for example the di rectives to eight senate committees to reduce direct spending and to the senate finance committee to reduce revenues and increase the debt limit are expected to result at most in three reconciliation measures spending bill revenue bill and debtlimit bill house practices in this regard allow fo r greater latitude in the development of multiple reconc iliation measures reconciliation measures may mix together different types of reconciliation changes and more than one reconciliation measure involving particular type of budgetar change may be provided for under the reconciliation directives the fy1997 budget resolution for example provided for the potential consideration of three separate reconciliation measures in the house including welfare and medicaid reform and tax relief act medicare preservation act and tax and miscella neous direct spending reforms act as explained by the house budget committeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs18 20 see the conference report on the fy1997 budget

time the budget resolution is under consideration budg et resolutions sometimes include revised figures for the current year which is the fiscal year in progress at the time the budget resolution is under consideration currentyear levels are not reflected in tables 1 and 2the house conferees note that the multireconciliation process provides maximum flexibility to achieve the chan ges in spending and the tax relief assumed in this conference report for example any of the spending or revenue changes assumed in the first bill could if not enacted be achieved in the third bill20 given that the senates flexibility in packaging reconciliation legislation is relatively more constrained unde r its current practices compared with past ones the house is more constrained in its choice of reconciliation packaging as well consequently reconciliation procedure in the house as flexible as the one proposed for fy1997 may longer be practicable impact of directives on the deficit or surplus during the period covering fy1981 th rough fy2006 the house and senate adopted 18 budget resolutions containing reconciliation directives the budget resolutions for fy 1985 fy 1989 fy 1992 fy1993 and

budget resolutions through fy1998 were intended to reduce the deficit in the net the directives in budget resolutions since then through fy2006 while part of an overall budget re solution policy to improve the budgetary posture over time on their own terms proposed reducing the surplus or increasing the deficit in the net by virt ue of revenue reductions the reconciliation directives to house and senate committees during this period generally were of comparable scope although there were some significant differences in particular years table 2 and table 3 present information on the reconciliation directives to house committees during this period to illustrate the relationship taken generally by the house and senate between reconciliation and deficit reduction as table 2 shows all 18 of the budget re solutions recommended policies that assumed an improvement in budgetary posture from the budget year to the final fiscal year covered either by changing deficit into surplus seven instances reducing deficit to lower level eight instances or increasing surplus to higher level three instances21 for example over fiveyear time frame the budget resolution for fy1991 called for deficit of 64 billion in the first year and surplus of 156 billion in the final year the budget reso lution for fy1994 called for deficit of 254 billion in the first year and deficit of 202 billion in

example nine of the 12 instructed committees submitted their reconciliation recommendations to the budget committee after the september 22 deadline34 all of the tardy submissions were included in the reconciliation measure reported by the budget committee in this case as in the past it does not appear that the late submissions caused any procedural consequences35 in several instances one or more of the instructed committees did not submit any legislative recommendations in at least two years 1981 and 1995 the house rules committee made in order amendments that provided language within the

the house budget committee the house budget committee plays significant if not substantive role in the development of reconciliation legislation when two or more committees are directed to recommend legislative changes pursuant to reconciliation directives as mentioned above when two or more committees are involved each committee is required to submit its legislative recomme ndations to the budg et committee by certain date as specified in the reconc iliation directives contained in the budget resolution section 310b2 of the 1974 act provides that when the budget committee receives all the legislativ recommendations from the directed committees it is required to report to the house reconciliation legislation carrying out all such recommendations w ithout any substantive revision in practice this administrative f unction has entailed incorporating the committees recommendations as separate titles into an omnibus reconciliation measure the budget committee has perform ed this function formally by conducting markup of the reconciliati on legislation at the end of the markup the budget committee orders reported the omnibus rec onciliation legislati on containing the instructed committees submissions as an original bill during the markup amendments are not c onsidered as in the case of standard committee markup because of the prohibition ag ainst any substantive revision to the instructed committees recommendations the budget committee however traditionally has entertained motions to direct the budget committee chairman to request that the rules co mmittee make in order certain amendments in 1997 for example during the markup of hr 2015 the ba lanced budget act of 1997 committee members made 11 motions to direct the budget committee chairman to request

has been equally divided between the chair and th ranking minority member of the budget committee in cases when the reconciliation measure was reported by one committee such as in recent years with the ways and means committee the special rule has divided the time for general debate equally between the chair and ranking minority member of that committee the special rule providing for the

special rules for the consideration of reconciliation measure have made in order very few floor amendments in fact many special rules allowed one floor amendment only usually an amendment in the

by special rule was 10 in 1989 hres 249 for hr 3299 in every instance that floor amendment was made in order by the special rule debate on the amendment was limited by the rule as well debate on

committee for the 109th congress inserted by chairman grassley in the congressional record daily ed vol 151 jan 25 2005 at pp s425s426initial consideration in the senate the initial consideration of reconciliation measures in the senate is potentially complex process that parallels hous action in some respects but differs significantly in others four aspects of senate action at this stage of the reconciliation process are addressed in this section 1 the development of legislative recommendations by the instructed committees 2 the preparation of an omnibus measure by the senate budget committee 3 floor consideration of reconciliation legislation and 4 the operation of the senates byrd rule development of legislative recommendations by the instructed committees the reconciliation directives containe d in the budget resolution as finally agreed to by the house and senate inform each instructed senate committee as to the type and scope of the legislative recommendations it must develop in order to comply with the directives in addition the rec onciliation directives include deadline for the submission of legislative recommendations to the budget committee or the reporting of legislation directly to the senate whether committee has been instructed to submit legislative recommendations to the senate budget committee for inclusion in an omnibus reconciliation measure or has been instructed to report reconciliation measure directly to the senate it develops its recommendations in generally the same ma nner as it develops other legislation50 in doing so the committee must adhere to the pertinent requirements in the standing rules of the senate as well as it own committee rules including rules regarding the reporting of measure or matter51 relationship with the budget committee prior to the commencement of work by the instructed committees on their reconciliation recommendations the senate budget committee usually sends set of guidelines to the chairman and ranking member of each committee the guidelines summarize the applicable procedural requirements stemming from the budget resolution containing the reconciliation directives and pertinent provisions of the congressional budget act of 1974 and provide additiona l information on related ma tters such as scoring conventions that will be used to evalua the reconciliation recommendations the budget committee also may advise each instructed committee on drafting considerations eg the number of the title or titles in the measure for the committees recommendations to avoid confusion when compiling the committee recommendations into single measurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs57 52 senate finance committee revenue reconciliation act of 1997 to accompany s 949 srept 10533 june 20 1997 p 2 53 see crs report 98246 reporting measure from senate committee by thomas p carr which discusses the requirements under senate rule xxvi paragraph 7a1 and 3in most instances the instructed committees maintain an ongoing relationship with the budget committee during the process of developing their legislative recommendations at least informally at the staff level consultations occur between the committees to foster clear understanding of procedural requi rements to assess potential compliance issues with the aim of avoiding them and for other reasons in addition the instructed committees regularl consult with cbo and if appropriate the joint committee on taxation jct on the budgetary implications of policy options and other budgetrelated assessmen ts and seek appropriate guidance and support from the parliament arian legislative couns and other offices hearings markup and re porting or submission of recommendations while committees typically are afforded certain amount of flexibility in conducting their legislativ activities senate rule xxvi entitled committee procedure lays out basic requirements with regard to such matters as the scheduling of meetings and hear ings quorums openness and voting and reporting requirements as in the case of other legislation instructed committees often hold hearings prior to marking up their legislative recommendations the senate finance committee for example held multiple hearings at the full committee and subcommittee level before marking up revenue reconciliation measure on june 19 1997 over period spanning from february 4 through june 5 of that year the committee held 10 full committee and two subcommittee hearings on topics related to the reconciliation recommendations covering such matters as the status of the airport and airway trust fund individual re tirement account proposals capital gains and losses the administrations fy1998 budget and tax proposals related to education health care and small business52 committees may proceed by marking up bill that already has been introduced the most common approach however is for the committee to originate legislation in the markup such as by considering ch airmans mark whic h may be altered by the adoption of amendments in committee before an instructed committee can submit reconciliation legislation to the budget committee or report it directly to the senate it must meet to consider and approve the legislation incl uding relevant amendments and motions that may be offered and then order the legi slation reported by majority vote majority of the committee must be physically present in order to vote to report the legislation otherwise point of order may be ra ised on the senate floor to prevent its consideration53 committee

committee or conference committee if the measure directly or indirectly amends the internal revenue code and has widespread applicability to individuals or small businesses committee submissions to the budget committee usually consist of four required elements in addition to the legislative text the submission includes the committee report language the cbo or jct estimates and transmittal letter signed by the chairman of the instructed committee in many instances the ranking member of the instructed committee signs the transmittal letter as well like committee reports on other measures the committee report language accompanying reconciliation legislation ma include additional supplemental or dissenting views which allow committee memb ers individually or as part of group to amplify their views register their concerns or express their dissent regarding part or all of the legislation in the case of 1995 reconciliation legi slation for example eight minority members of the budget committee signed statement collectively expressing their views54 on occasion the cbo or jct estimates may not be prepared in time for inclusion in the committees submissi on and are omitted but usually become available in time for inclusion in the budget committees report on the omnibus reconciliation measure on other occas ions the instructed committee may include cbo or jct estimates that are preliminary and are revised later while committee that is participating in the development of an omnibus reconciliation measure must submit its legislative recommendations to the budget committee it may also publish them separately or report them as parate legislation altogether senate committee actions that led to the enactment of two reconciliation acts in one year during the 105th congress

omnibus measure by the senate budget committee in the course of preparing an omnibus reconciliation measure the budget committees task usually is described as ministerial function under section 310b2 of the 1974 act after receiving the legislative recommendations of the instructed committees the budget committee must report omnibus reconciliation legislation carrying out the recommendati ons without any substantive revision ensuring accuracy and completeness although this task may be described correctly as be ing ministerial the budget committee still is faced with several issues at this point first the budget committee must endeavor to ensure that all responses from instructed co mmittees are complete and accurate as indicated previously the budget committee secures any cbo or jct estimates that were not prepared in time for inclusion with the committee submissions or secures final estimates in pl ace of preliminary ones in order to ensure accuracy the b udget committee from time to time has made technical corrections in the submissions at the request of the instructed committees in the case of reconciliation legislation in 1996 dealing with welfare reform for example both of the instructed committees asked the budget committee to make corrections in their previous submissions on july 9 1996 chairman richard lugar and ranking member patrick leahy of the senate

s12589with technical corrections to four provi sions in the june 28 submission attached58 similarly on july 15 chairman william roth of the finance committee sent letter to chairman domenici notifying him that the july 11 submission inadvertently included change to the child care section of the bill which was not actually made by the committee59 the budget committee indicated that it had made the changes requested by both committees it was the instructed committees and not the budget committee that had the authority to make these changes dealing with tardy responses second issue faced by the budget committee is what to do if one or more committ ees does not submit its recommendations by the deadline the initial practice of the senate was to extend the deadline when the budget committee felt that such action was warranted this practice was motivated by the view that including tardy committee submissions could taint the reconciliation measure thereby causing it to lose its privilege and the protection of expedited procedures in 1985 for example the senate extended the september 27 deadline set in the fy1986 budget resolution to october 1 by unanimous consent in order to accommodate the banking housing and urban affairs committee60 in some instances the deadline was extended in series of tightly constrained steps in 1986 for example the deadline of july 25 set in the fy1987 budget resolution was extended to 600 pm on july 29 to 1200 noon on july 30 and then to 330 pm on that same day july 3061 finally the deadline has been extended by larger margins the july 28 deadline in the fy1988 budget resolution was extended to septem ber 29 and then to october 1962 under more recent practice the budget committee may be afforded some discretion in awaiting the responses of ta rdy committees in order to include them in the omnibus reconciliation measure while the budget resolution provides deadline for the submissions by the instructed committees it does not impose reporting deadline on the budget committee under section 310b2 of the 1974 act the budget committee is obliged to report the omnibus reconciliation measure only upon receiving all such recommendations consequently the budget committees obligation to report does not ripen until all recommendations ve been received even tardy ones63httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs61 64 senate budget committee balanced budget reconciliation act of 1995 sprt 10436 october 1995 p 3 65 the fungibility rule was established by the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 december 12 1985 99 stat 1037 1101 continuednonetheless the budget committee is expected to report the omnibus reconciliation measure in reasonably prom pt manner accordingly when faced with lingering delay in the responses by one or more instructed committees it may choose to report the omnibus reconciliation measure wit hout the responses and seek remedy for the omissions during floor consideration evaluating compliance third task facing the budget committee at this stage of the reconciliation process and perhaps the most important one is evaluating compliance by the responding co mmittees compliance may be judged by several criteria first and foremost the budg et committee assesses whether each instructed committee has met the goals laid out in the reconciliation directives in the case of each committee the timated levels of spending changes nd if appropriate revenue changes and debtlimit changes that would be achieved for each time period are measured against the instructed levels although the budget committee and each instructed committee receives cost estimates from cbo and the jct it is the budget committees res ponsibility and prerogative to assess committee compliance on the basis of spending or revenue levels in measuring compliance the budget committee sometimes will make adjustments to the estimates provided by cbo or the jct one such adjustment which occurred in 1995 involved change in the enactment date assumed by cbo which shortened the time ava ilable in fy1996 for the sale of the naval petroleum reserves as consequence of this chan ge cbo judged that the sale could not be completed in fy1996 and reduced the savi ngs attributed to the armed services committee accordingly as explained by the senate budget committee the fy1996 budget resolution assumed an october 1 1995 enactment date and the reconciliation instructions to committees were based on this enactment date due to the delay of some of the committees submissions and other factors cbo is currently using november 15 1995 enactment date as result some committees followed the assumptions in the budget resolution and still failed to meet their fiscal year 1996 reconc iliation instruction because of this change in the assumption on the enactment date however if committee follows the assumptions in the budget resolution and fails to meet its instructions for fiscal year 1996 solely because of an assumption on the enactment date the senate budget committee will hold the committee harmless and will score the committee as achieving its instruction therefore with this adjustment the armed services committee has complied with the budget resolutions reconciliation instructions for fy199664 second criterion for determining comp liance involves the fungibility rule which is set forth in section 310c of the 1974 act65 the purpose of the rule is tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs62 65 continued section 201b of the 1985 act b eginning at 99 stat 1040 set forth substitute for title iii of the congressional budget act of 1974 including new section 310c compliance with reconciliation directions 99 stat 1054 originally section 310c set forth reporting requirements for when single committee in each house and when multiple committees in each house are given reconciliation directions and defined the term reconciliation resolution this subject matter was moved to section 310b by the 1985 act the new section 310c originated in conf erence although both the house and senate initially passed versions of the act containing changes in the reconciliation process this particular change was not included in the versions that passed each body 66 senate budget committee budget process law annotated sprt 10349 october 1993 p 168 annotations by william g dauster chief counselallow some flexibility in the response of committee instructed to change both spending and revenues the fungibility rule may not apply if revenue and spending changes are reported in separate reconciliation measures pursuant to separate directives in sum the fungibility rule 1 applies to any senate or house committee that is subject to reconciliation di rectives in budget resolution requiring it to recommend reconciliation legislation changing both spending and revenues 2 deems any such committee to be in compliance with its r econciliation directives if its recommended legislation does not cause either the spe nding changes or the revenue changes to exceed or fall below the directives by more than 20 of the sum of the two types of changes and the total amount of changes recommended is not less than the total amount of changes that were directed and 3 authorizes the chairman of the senate budget committee to file appropriate adjustments in the levels in the budget resolution and committee spending allocations thereunder upon the exercise of the rule and requires any committee receiving re vised spending allocations to promptly report section 302b suballocations the operation of this rule in the senate was described in 1993 in print of the senate budget committee as follows for an example of the rule in operation take the case of budget resolution that instructs committee to achieve 3 million in outlay reductions and 7 million in revenue increases for total of 10 million in deficit reduction by virtue of this section that committee may permissibly achieve outlay reductions as low as 1 million 3 million minus 20 percent of 10 million or 2 million as long as it achieves total of at least 10 million in deficit reduction by also achieving at least 9 million in revenue in creases alternatively the committee may achieve revenue increases as low as 5 million 7 million minus 20 percent of 10 million or 2 million as long as it achieves total of at least 10 million in deficit reduction by also achieving outlay reductions of at least 5 million66 in its current form the fungibility rule authorizes the chairman of the senate budget committee to file changes in budget resolution levels and committee spending allocations thereunder whenever the rule is exercised and to require thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs63 67 see section 13207c of pl 101508 104 stat 1388618 and 619any committee receiving revised spending llocations promptly report section 302b suballocations67 as senate and house rules grant jurisdiction over revenue matters primarily to the senate finance committee and house ways and means committee respectively these are the two main committees to which the fungibility rule applies finally third criterion for assessing committee compliance with the reconciliation directives is the senates byrd rule which is discussed in detail below briefly the rule bars the inclusion of matter in reconciliation legislation that is extraneous to the purposes of the reconciliation directives the parliamentarian also plays role in assessing compliance with reconciliation directives determining whether provisions from the instructed committees are within their respective jurisdictions further the parliamentarian determines as threshold matter whether the assembled submissions from the instructed committees constitute reconcilia tion bill and thus whether the bill may be considered under the expedited pro cedures of the r econciliation process while the budget committee must report the legislative recommendations submitted to it the committee need not nece ssarily issue written report beginning in the late 1980s the practice of the nate budget committee has been to report omnibus reconciliation bills without wr itten report the purpose of this practice is to avoid both budget committee rule providing for time to submit additional and minority views and the sena rule requiring legisla tion accompanied by written report to lay over for period of time before floor consideration the budget committee usually issues committee print explaining the legislation in lieu of report the budget committee because it must report an omnibus reconciliation bill without any substantive revision may not resolve any substantive issues on non compliance at this point the budget committee may however in concert with the leadership evaluate strategies for reme dying the noncompliance on the senate floor through one or more managers amendments or by other means floor consideration debate and amendment the basic contours of senate procedure for the consideration of reconciliation measures are shaped by section 310 of the 1974 act in par ticular section 310e provides that the provisions of section 305 of the act which establish procedures for the consideration of budget resolutions and conference reports ther eon in the senate shall also apply to the consideration of reconciliation measures and conference reports thereon in one important ex ception 20hour limit on debate is set for reconciliation measures instead of the 50 hour limit applicable to budget resolutions the timetable for the congressional budget process set out in section 300 of the 1974 act indicates that congress should co mplete action on any requiredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs64 68 see senate action on s 2885 and s 2939 nd on hr 7765 in the second session of the 96th congressreconciliation by june 15 wh ile section 310f of the act is intended to enforce this deadline in the house by barring the cons ideration in july of an adjournment resolution providing for the traditional augu st recess if the house has not completed action the act does not contain any comparable provision for the senate like other budgetary legislation reconc iliation measures generally must be in compliance with budget enforcement pro cedures in the 1974 act and included in annual budget resolutions in particular spending levels in the measure must not cause any committees spending alloca tions under the budget resolution to be exceeded section 302 revenues levels in the measure must not drop below the revenue floor established in the budget resolution section 311 and policy or procedural matters within the budget committees jurisdiction can be included section 306 or the bill will be subject to points of order under these sections that require threefifths vote to waive patterns in the consideration of senate and house legislation during the period from 1980 2004 c overing budget resolu tions for fy1981fy2005 the senate completed action on total of 19 reconciliation acts stemming from reconciliation directives in budget re solutions for 17 different years see table 7 in all but three of these years the senate considered single reconciliation measure in response to the reconciliation directives in the budget resolution in the three remaining years the senate considered two different reconciliation measures each year resulting in the actment of five reconciliation acts one act in 1980 for fy1981 and two acts each in 1982 and 1997 for fy1983 and fy1998 as general matter the senate initially considers single senatenumbered reconciliation measure either an omnibus reconciliation act reported by the budget committee or reconciliation act reported by the finance committee following the completion of debate and am endment the senate positions itself for conference with the house by taking up the housepassed reconciliation measure striking all after the enacting clause and inserting the text of the senatepassed measure this procedure is especially important with respect to reconciliation measures that affect revenues due to the requirement in the constitution that revenue measures originate in the house by passing housenumbered bill in the final instance the senate abides by the constitutional require ment after the senate considers the senatenumbered bill the 1974 act would allow an additional 20 hours to consider the housenumbered bill but the senate usually considered the housenumbered bill by unanimous consent different patterns of legi slative action have occurred as well in 1980 for example the senate budget committee reported two different original senate bills carrying out revenue and spending reconciliation instructions and the senate considered each of them separately following their consideration the senate incorporated both of the measures in to the housepassed

reconciliation acts that each became law69 three of the four measures were original senate bills reported by the budget committee two bills or the finance committee one bill but in the remaining instance the finance committee reported housepassed bill instead of an original senate bill70 in 2001 and 2003 the finance committee reporte d original senate bills carrying out revenue reconciliation instructions but the senate did not consider them instead the senate considered housepa ssed reconciliation bills under an accelerated schedule71 the senate usually completes initial action on reconciliation measures over period of two to four days in 1980 the senate devoted only one day each to the initial consideration of two reconciliation bills but in 1985 it considered reconciliation measure for eight days initiating considerati on and controlling time although not explicitly stated in the 1974 act reconciliation measures are privileged measures accordingly the motion to proceed to the consider ation of reconciliation measure is not debatable in practice most reconciliation measures are laid before the senate by unanimous consent reconciliation measure does not need to lie over on the calendar for one legislative day but if such legislation is accompanied by written report the report must be available for 48 hours before the measure can be considered as stated previously the usual practice of the b udget committee since the late 1980s has been to report omnibus reconcilia tion bills without written report issuing committee print in lieu of report the finance committee has been instructed to report legislation directly to th senate on several occasions in recent years sometimes issuing written report and sometimes not doing so reconciliation legisla tion is subject to 20hour debate limitation debate on first degree amendments is limited to two hours and deba on second degree amendments and debatable motions or appeals is limited to one hour in practice debate time may vary from these limits pursuant to unanimous consent agreements control of time under the 20hour limit is equally divided between and controlled by the majority leader and the minority leader or their designees the chairman and ranking member of the budget committee usually are designated tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs72 72 as stated before section 305b2 of the 1974 act is made applicable to reconciliation legislation by section 310e of the actserve as floor managers and to control the time with respect to amendments and debatable motions and appeals time is divided equally and controlled by the senator who proposed the amendment and the majority manager or if the majority manager favors the amendment the minority manager not all actions pertaining to rec onciliation measure are counted under the 20 hour time limit debate on the measure ll amendments thereto debatable motions and appeals and time used in quorum calls except for those th at precede rollcall vote is counted under the limit but time used to read amendments to vote or to establish quorum prior to rollcall vote is not counted absent unanimous consent agreement to the contrary therefore it is possible especially with the consideration of large number of amendments under votearama situation discussed below for consideration to extend well beyond 20 hours conversely because the time for debate may be reduced by yielding back time by unanimous consent or by nondebatable motion the consid eration of reconciliation measure may not consume the full 20 hours restrictions on amendments and motions to recommit there are several restrictions on the cons ideration of amendments fi rst as provided in section 305b2 of the 1974 act amendments must be germane the germaneness requirement also applies to am endments to budget resolutions72 while certain amendments are per germane eg an amendment to strike or to change numbers or dates the germaneness of an amendment typically is determined on caseby case basis if point of order is raised once matter has been stricken from the measure by amendment the matter can longer be used to justify germaneness conversely matter added to the measure by amendment can be used as the basis for additional amendments to be deemed germane an important exception to the germaneness requirement is made in connection with motion to recommit with instru ctions intended to bring committees recommendations into full compliance lthough the motion itself must be germane the amendment reported back by the instructed committee is not subject to germaneness requirement this practice recognizes the fact that in order to make the changes in spending or revenues necessary to achieve full compliance it may be necessary to address matter not included in the instructed committees original recommendations section 310d prohibits the considera tion of any amendment that would cause the reconciliation measure to reduce outlays by less than the amount instructed or would cause it to increase revenues by ss than the amount instructed unless the resulting deficit increase is offset the prohibition does not interfere however with motion to strike regardless of th at motions effect on the deficithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs73 section 310g bars the consideration of any reconciliation gislation including any amendment thereto or conference report thereon that contains recommendations with respect to social security for pur poses of these provision social security is considered to include the oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi program established under title ii of the social security act it does not include medicare or other programs blished as part of that act finally section 313 the senates byrd rule prohibits the consideration of any reconciliation legislation incl uding amendments that include extraneous matter see discussion below one provision of the by rd rule buttresses the prohibition against considering recommendations ffecting social security set forth in section 310g each of the restrictions discussed above requires an affirmative vote of three fifths of the membership 60 senators if seats are vacant to waive or to appeal the ruling of the chair an amendment fashioned to avoid one restriction still may run afoul of another an amendment may be germane for example yet violate the byrd rule because it has budgetary effect and therefore is extraneous motions to recommit as previously indicated afford means of bringing committee recommendations into full complia nce section 305b5 of the 1974 act prohibits any motion to recommit except for motion to recommit with instructions to report back within more than three days in practice such motions usually require the instructed committee to report back forthwith while the committee named in the instructions may not be am ended the legislative language included in the instructions is amendable in two degrees if not necessary to bring committee into compliance the amendments proposed by motion to recommit must be germane votearama the number of amendments offered to reconciliation measures generally has increased over the history of the reconciliation process only few amendments were offered to the earliest reconciliation bills but dozens of amendments have been offered to reconciliation bills in recent years when the 20hour debate limit has been reached senators may continue to consider amendments and motions to recommit with instructions and to take other actions as well but they ma not debate them unless nimous consent is granted the circumstance under which debate time on reconciliation measure or budget resolution has expired but amendments and motions continue to be considered has come to be known as votearama as general matter accelerated voting procedures sometimes are put into effect under votearama scenario allowing two minutes of debate per amendment for explanation and 10minute limit per vote during the consideration of the thr ee most recent reconciliation measures in 2000 2001 and 2003 the senate considered 162 amendments and motions to recommit 38 in 2000 59 in 2001 and

submissions of committees included such things as provisions that had budg etary effect that increased spending or reduced revenues when the reconciliation instructions called for reduced spending or increased revenues or that violated another committees jurisdiction reconciliation procedures and other expedited procedures that limit debate and restrict the offering of ame ndments run counter to the l ongstanding practices of the senate applicable to most legislation in which senato rs may engage in extended debate and freely offer amendments many senators were willing to surrender customary freedoms with respect to deba and amendment in order to expedite reconciliation legisl ation but they sought means of confining the scope of such legislation to its budgetary purposes in 1985 and 1986 the senate adopted the by rd rule named after its principal sponsor senator robert c byrd on tem porary basis as means of curbing these practices the byrd rule has been extended and modified several times over the years in 1990 the byrd rule was incorporated into the 1974 congressional budget act as section 313 nd made permanent77 in general point of order authorized unde r the byrd rule may be raised in order to strike extraneous matter already in the bill as reported or discharged or in the conference report or to prevent the incor poration of extraneous matter through the adoption of amendments or motions point of order may be raised against single provision or two or more provisions in the bill usually as designated by title or section number or by page and line numbe r in amendments offered thereto or in motions made thereon or against an entir amendment or amendments the chair may sustain point of order as to all of the provisions or amendments or only some of them the maker of the point of or der defines the scope of the provision or provisions being challengedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs76 78 in the senate many points of order under th cba of 1974 require threefifths vote of the membership to waive or to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair most of these threefifths waiver requirements are temporary but in the case of the byrd rule it is permanent section 503 of the fy 2004 budget resolution hconres 95 108th congress adopted on apr 11 2003 extended the expirati on date for the temporary requirements to sept 30 2008 79 for an example

provisions or amendments 3 extend for specified nguage through consideration of the conference report as well as initial consideration of the measure or amendment and 4 be made prior to the raising of point of order thus making the point of order moot while the point of order itself is not debatable the motion to waive is debatable subject to the time limits for debatable motions when reconciliation measure or c onference report thereon is considered the senate budget committee must submit for the record list of potentially extraneous matter included therein79 this list is advisory however and does not bind the chair in ruling on points of order determinations of budgetary levels for purposes of enforcing the byrd rule are made by the senate budget committee definitions of extraneous matter subsection b1 of the byrd rule provides definitions of what constitutes extraneous matter for purposes of the rule some aspects of the byrd rule require considerable judgment regarding its application to complex legislation as the senate budget committee noted in its report on the budget resolution for fy1994 extraneous is term of art80 in the most general terms the rule bars the inclusion of matter that is not related to the purposes of the reconciliation processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs77 provision is considered to be extrane ous if it falls under one or more of the following six definitions 1 it does not produce change in outlays or revenues2 it produces an outlay increase or revenue decrease when the instructed committee is not in compliance with its instructions 3 it is outside of the jurisdiction of the committee that submitted the title or provision for inclusion in the reconciliation measure 4 it produces change in outlays or revenues which is merely incidental to the nonbudgetary components of the provision 5 it would increase the deficit for fiscal year beyond those covered by the reconciliation measure and 6 it recommends changes in social securitythe last definition complements the ban in section 310g of the 1974 act against considering any reconciliation legislation that contains recommendations pertaining to social security while successful point of order under the last definition in the byrd rule would excise the offending provision successful point of order under section 310g would defeat the entire bill exceptions to the definition of extraneous matter subsection b2 of the byrd rule provides that senate originated provision that does not produce change in outlays or revenues shall not be considered extraneous if the chairman and ranking minority members of the budget committee and the committee reporting the provision certify that the provision mitigates direct effects clearly attributable to provision changing outlays or re venues and both provisions together produce net reduction in the deficit or the provision will or is likely to reduce outlays or increase revenues 1 in one or more fi scal years beyond those covered by the reconciliation measure 2 on the basis of new regulations court rulings on pending legislation or relationships between economic indices and stipulated statutory tr iggers pertaining to the provision or 3 but reliable estimates cannot be made due to insufficient data subsection b3 of the byrd rule pr ovides an exception to the definition of extraneousness on the basis of committee jurisdiction for certain provisions reported by committee if they would be refe rred to that committee upon introduction as separate measure additionally under subsection b1a provision that does not change outlays or revenues in the net but wh ich includes outlay decreases or revenuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs78 increases that exactly offset outlay increas or revenue decreases is not considered to be extraneous the byrd rule has been applied to 19 reconciliation measures considered by the senate from 1985 through 2004 in 42 of th 55 actions involving the byrd rule opponents were able to strike extraneous matter from legisl ation 18 cases or bar the consideration of extraneous amendments 24 cases by raising points of order nine of 41 motions to waive the byrd rule in order to retain or add extraneous matter were successful the byrd rule has been used only four times during consideration of conference report on reconciliati on measure twice in 1993 once in 1995 and once in 1997httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs79 81 the rejection of the conference report ccurred by house approval of special rule providing for its rejection 82 see deficitreduction bill

housesenate differences on reconciliation measures under the usual practice the house and senate initially consider and pass their own reconciliation measures in addition reconciliation m easures are complex and in many instances quite lengthy legislati on accordingly these factors effectively guarantee that the house and senate bills will be different the two chambers must however as with all legislation agree to the same reconciliation measure in the exact same form before it can be sent to the president for the most part the house and senate employ the usual gislative procedures and pr actices under their rules to resolve differences on reconciliation meas ures although the congressional budget act of 1974 specifies some aspect s of procedure at this stage as with other complex legislation th house and senate typically use conference as the means of developing an agreement on reconciliation legislation in the case of all but one of the 19 reconciliation measures ultimately submitted by congress to the president the house and senate convened conference on the measure and conference report was issued in the one instance in which conference was not used the two chambers passed identical legislation and there were differences to resolve in re sponse to reconciliation directives in the fy1984 budget resolution the senate pa ssed housepassed reconciliation bill without amendment clearing it for the president the pattern with regard to conference procedure on reconciliation measures has been for the senate to consider one or two senate bills initially then to take up and amend the housepassed bill in orde r to proceed to conference table 8 provides information on house and senate actions on conference reports on reconciliation measures the one exception to the pa ttern occurred in 1982 in response to reconciliation directives in the fy1983 budget resolution the senate initially considered and went to c onference with the house on housenumbered bill hr 4961 which became the tax equity nd fiscal responsibility act of 1982 the house and senate also may use an amendment exchange instead of conference in order to resolve differences regarding legislation or as fallback procedure when conference agreements are not completed successfully in the case of reconciliation legisl ation amendment exchanges are seldom used the conference report on the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 for example was rejected by the hous on december 19 1985 by vote of 20515181 between december 19 1985 and march 20 1986 the house and senate exchanged amendments nine times before their disagreements were resolved82 in addition successful point of order raised under the byrd rule against the conference report on the balanced budget act of 1995

act insists on its amendment thereby expressing its disagreement with the recommendations of the first chamber then the second chambe r requests conference with the first chamber in order to resolve the disagreement in the case of reconciliation legislation the senate has ways been the second cham ber to act with respect to setting up conference after conference has been requested and agreed to each chamber appoints conferees upon the appointment of conf erees by both chambers the conference committee may then convene to carry out its work in the senate these steps usually are merged together into single unanimous consent request in the house conferees are not necessarily appointed at th time that the other actions occur83 in instances where there is unusual controversy or complications in entering into conference each of the three required steps may entail separate motion and vote the house in few cases used special rules reported by the house rules committee to go to conference in the house it is the prerogative of the speaker to appoint conferees while in the senate the usual practice is for the full senate by unanimous consent to authorize the presiding office to appoint them conferees can be appointed to consider the entire matter in conference or only for limitedpurposes general conferees negotiate over the entire bill and any amendments and limitedpurpose conferees negotiate only on portion of the matter in conference designated at the time of appointment both types of conferees are appoint ed on omnibus reconciliation measures members of the house and senate budg et committee are appointed as general conferees and the chairman and ranking mber serve as floor managers of the conference report members of the committees that submitted reconciliation recommendations make up the rest of the conference committee the conferees from the legislative committees have the respons ibility of resolving differences in the legislative language within their committ ees jurisdiction while the conferees from the budget committees work to facilitate the conference actions generally and promote timely resolution of policy disagreements from time to time when member must drop out of conference pro ceedings replacement may be appointedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs81 when conference committee deals with reconciliation measure that was reported to each chamber by single co mmittee the conferees usually are chosen from the legislative committees membership sometimes matter within the jurisdiction of committee in one chamber that did not receive reconciliation in struction may be before th conferees because of the action of the other body therefore chamber may include conferees from more committees than were instructed in the budget resolution conferences on reconciliation measures sometimes i nvolve only few members from each chamber the house and sena appointed three conferees each for example on the marriage tax relief nd reconciliation act of 2000 in many instances however the wide range of issu encompassed by reconciliation and the large number of conferees appointed to address them leads to the creation of subconferences the largest conference on reconciliation measure the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1982 involve d 184 representatives and 69 senators and relied upon 58 subconferences the subconferences are established inform ally by agreement of the conference leaders members of the legislative co mmittees involved in the conference typically are assigned only to the subconferences that deal with matters within their committees jurisdiction the general c onferees from the budget committees also are assigned to subconferences but they do not directly negotiate the resolution of the pending legislative issues these proce dures are informal in the senate for under the senate rules senate conferee is conferee for all purposes and majority of all senate conferees must sign the conf erence report to conclude the conference regardless of the purposes for which the senate appointed the conferees motions to instruct conferees when the house and senate prepare to go to conference on measure it is not uncommon in either chamber for one or more motions to be considered that instruct conferees instructions to conferees may encourage them to take particular position on an issue or set of issues but neither chamber regards the in structions as binding the conferees in any way in the house the motion to instruct can be offered at three separate times in the legislative process 1 prior to the appoi ntment of conferees 2 after the conferees have been appointed for 20 calendar days and 10 legislative days but before they report to the house 3 and after the conf erees have reported in conjunction with motion to recommit the conference report only one motion to instruct conferees is allowed prior to the appoin tment of conferees and only one in motion to recommit conference report in contrast the practi ce of the house is to admit multiple 20day motions to instruct members of the minority party are accorded preference in recognition to offer motions to instruct in the first two instances but are not accorded preference in recognition to offer the 20day motion motions to instruct conferees are not as common in the senate as in the house in part because senators generally have more opportunity than representatives to be heard on measures and to let their view s on conference negotiations be known inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs82 84 crs report rl31840 congressional budget resolutions motions to instruct conferees by robert keiththe senate motions to instruct can only be offered prior to the appointment of conferees but senators also instruct thei r conferees through simple resolutions and amendments to legislation motions to instruct conferees have been made to reconciliation measures just as they have been made to budget resolu tions in the case of budget resolutions motions to instruct conferees have been made regularly in the house but infrequently in the senate84 with respect to reconciliation measures however such motions have been made regularly in the house and on occasion in the senate some examples of the circumstances under which motions to instruct conferees were made in each chamber are discussed below motions to instruct in the house in the house the first motion to instruct conferees on reconciliation measure occurred the first year that reconciliation was us ed on september 18 1980 the house agreed to such motion with respect to the conference on hr 7765 by vote of 30073 in 1997 mo tions to instruct conferees were made in the case of both reconciliation bills that year motion offered by representativ john spratt ranking member of the budget committee on july 10 1997 to the balanced budget act of 1997 hr 2015 was approve d by vote of 414 14 but motion offered the same day by representative charles rangel ranking member of the ways and means committee to the taxpayer relief act of 1997 was rejected by vote of 199233 motions to instruct in the senate the senate considered single motion to instruct conferees in 1981 and 1989 the first such motion insisted that funding for the head start program be set at specified levels for fy1982fy 1984 while the second instructed the senate conferees not to accept any house language that would not result in savings or in revenue increases during consideration of the balanced budget act of 1995 the senate on november 13 1995 considered four different mo tions to instruct conferees adopting three of them and tabling the other motions to instruct conferees may be amended on july 14 1993 for example motion to instruct house conferees on the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 was amended by an amendment in the nature of substitute by vote of 235 183 the motion to instruct as amende d was agreed to by vote of 4150 conducting the conference and reporting the conference agreement procedures relating to the conduct of c onferences between the house and senate on legislation are relatively informal and conferees are granted considerable latitude in resolving the chambers differences the chairmanship of the conferencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs83 committee is determined by the conferees who usually select the chairman of the budget committee in the case of omnibus reconciliation bills or the chairman of the house ways and means committee or the senate finance committee when those committees were instructed to report separate rec onciliation legislation by tradition the chairmanship of the conference alternates between the house and senate when the conferees reach agreement with respect to their disagreements on reconciliation measure they submit conference report explaining the agreement the report consists of two separate items 1 the conference report which explains the actions proposed by the conferees to resolve the disagreements between the two bodies including the recommended legislativ text and 2 the accompanying joint explanatory statement also referred to as the managers statement which explains the actions of the conferees with regard to the particular policy issues that they addressed often in great detail the conference report reflects the agreement of majority of the conferees of the house and majority of the conferees from the senate each of the conferees that supports the conference report signs signature sheet fo r both the conference report and the joint explanatory statemen t any conferee who does not support the agreement is not required to sign the sign ature sheets and usually does not do so for conference report to be valid in the house majority of the members from each chamber who were appointed to negotiate each provision must sign the report limitedpurpose house conferees sign only for the portion of the agreement they were given authority to negotiate for conference report to be valid in the senate majority of all house conferees nd majority of all senate conferees must sign the report regardless of whether or not any of the conferees were appointed for limited purposes the conference report and joint explanatory statement are published as house report and printed in the congressional record although conference report may be published as senate report too the senate usua lly defers such action consideration of the conference report conference reports are privileged matters in both the house nd senate and may be called up for consideration as priority matter motions to proceed to the consideration of conference report are not debatable in the house conference reports typically are considered for one hour but in the senate conference reports may be debated for up to10 hours the house usually considers conference reports on major legislation under the terms of special rule in recent years the special rule has provided blanket waiver of all points of order against the conference report and in some instances more than the typical hour of debate time in 1997 for example special rules extended the debate time on the conference report on the balanced budget act of 1997 to 90 minutes under hres 202 and ex tended the debate time on the taxpayer relief act of 1997 to two and onehalf hours under hres

types of measures in one key respect the byrd rule which applies only to reconciliation measures allows for extraneous matter to be stricken from conference report pursuant to the successful ra ising of point of order typically when point of order is successfully raised against conference report in the senate the conference report is defeat ed pursuant to the byrd rule however the senate may remove language from the conference repor t without causing the remainder of the conference report to be rejected in that case under the byrd rule the senate recedes and concurs with further amendment that effectively deletes the offending matter the house and senate may reach final agreement on the measure by resolving their disagreement on the further senate amendmen t as occurred in connection with the balanced budget act of 1995 the senate sometimes will use unanimous consent agreements to customize procedures during the consideration of conference report and agreements reached during initial consideration of reconciliati on measure often are made applicable to the consideration of the conference report as well in july of 1997 for example the senate considered two reconciliation measures under unanimous consent agreement that had been entered into on may 21 of that year at the time the fy1998 budget resolution was under consideration85 the agreement suspended the application of one component of the byrd rule under certain circumstances during both initial action on the reconciliation measures and during consideration of the conference reports effectively allowing longterm tax cu ts in one act to be offset by longterm spending reductions in the other one chamber may recommit the conference report to the existing conference committee if the other chamber has not yet acted on the report this situation occurred in 1982 during house considerati on of the conference report hrept 97 750 on the omnibus budget reconciliati on act of 1982 on august 17 1982 the house recommitted the report to the confer ence by vote of 266145 subsequently the conference committee reported second ag reement hrept 97759 which both chambers accepted once chamber acts on the conference report the conference committee formally is dissolved and cannot resume c onsideration of the measure if either chamber disagrees to conference report the matter is left in the position it was in before the conference was asked but in the stage of disagreement86 at this point the chambers may dispose of the matter in disagreement by motion or send it to further conference in the case of rec onciliation legislation further conference never has been convenedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33030crs85 enrollment and tec hnical corrections the house and senate often consider measures pertaining to the enrollment of complex and lengthy legisla tion either to expedite the enrollment or to make technical corrections title 1 section 107 of the united states code requires that measures be enrolled on parchment paper in order to expedite the enrollment of the measure thereby speeding up its presentation to the president the requirement in 1 usc 107 sometimes is waived upon certificati on by the house administration co mmittee that true or accurate enrollment is prepared by the enactment of joint resolution on july 31 1997 for example the house nd senate agreed to hjres 90 which waived the enrollment requirements with respect to the two reconciliation measures hr 2014 and hr 2015 the measure became pl 10532 111 stat 250 on august 1 1997 second the house and senate may make technical co rrections in measure prior to enrollment by adopting concurre nt resolution directing the clerk of the house or the secretary of the senate as appropriate to make the necessary changes enrollment correction measures may originate in either the house or senate and often have been used in connection with the reconciliation process technical corrections were made for example in the

principally through the issuance of statements of administration policy saps which the office of management and budget maintains for the current administration on its website httpwwwwhitehousegovomb saps take on more significance if congressional action is at significant variance with the presidents recommendations in such instances his advisers may use sa ps to raise the possibility or likelihood of presidential veto if policy adjustments acceptable to the administration are not made in the legislati on see discussion below in view of the significance usually ttached to reconcilia tion legislation the president often signs such legislation into law in an official signing ceremony attended by members of cong ress cabinet members and other executive officials involved in the process that culminated in the enactment of the legislation any official statement issued by the president upon the signing of the measure as well as any remarks made during the event are included in

dec 6 1995 p 1presidential veto three of the reconciliation acts sent to the president by congress were vetoed all by president bill clinton87 in each instance republican majorities in congress fashioned reconciliation meas ures proposing significant policy changes that were fundamentally at odds with pres ident clintons policy agenda when an administration is engaged with congress in the formulation of budgetary legislation the saps may be used to motivate congress to adopt policies favored by the administration and to dr op policies that it does not favor the language of the saps may be modulated to present the mix of encouragement and veto threat considered appr opriate with respect to particular issue encompassed by the legislation for example the sa p might express the concern of senior administration officials and indicate the possibility that they might recommend to the president that he veto the bill if the offending provisions are retained or not appropriately modified in the case of the three reconciliation act s that president clinton vetoed the saps clearly communicated his opposition the sap issued on july 27 1999 pertaining to senate action on the ta xpayer refund and re lief act of 1999 for example stated the administration strongly opposes the package of tax cut proposals contained in s 1429 if bill compassing these proposals were to pass the congress the president would veto it the bluntness of the wording left congress doubt regarding how the president would react to such bill if it were presented to him when the president vetoes bill he retu rns it to the house of its origin with message notifying the chamber of his ac tion and explaining the basis of his objections the veto message together with the vetoed bill is printed as house document

procedures under the act were incorporated into the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 as amended as ne w part c of title x sections 10211027 reconciliation measures were included in the several type s of budgetary legislation subject to line item veto authority in 1998 the line item veto act was nullified by the supreme court in clinton v city of new york 524 us 417 199890 the case involved actions taken by president bill clinton pertaining to rec onciliation legislation enacted in 1997 the reasoning behind the supreme courts d ecision is characterized as follows the court rejected the argument that the presidents power to cancel items was mere exercise of discretionary aut hority granted by congress instead the cancellation authority represented the repeal of law that could be accomplished only through the regular legislative process including bicameralism and presentment in the two cancellations th at reached the court congress did not pass resolution of disapproval as result the court concluded that the president has amended two acts of congress by repealing portion of each91 the act authorized the president to cancel any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority any item of new direct sp ending or any limited ta x benefit in an act if such cancellation will reduce the deficit not impair any essential government functions and not harm the national interest the president could exercise this authority only within five days of signing an act into law if he chose to lineitem veto any provisions in an act he was required to notify congress in special message each cancellation d to be separately identif ied by its own reference number congress could consider under expe dited procedures set forth in the act special legislation to
