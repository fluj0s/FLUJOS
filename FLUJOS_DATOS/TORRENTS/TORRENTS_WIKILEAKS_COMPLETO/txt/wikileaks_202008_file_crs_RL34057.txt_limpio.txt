environmental policy resources science and industry division ozone air quality standards epas march 2008 revision summary epa administrator stephen johnson signed final changes to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone on march 12 2008 the proposal appeared in the federal register on march 27 naaqs are standards for outdoor ambient air that are intended to protect public health and welfare from harmful concentrations of pollution by changing the standard epa has concluded that protecting public health and welfare requires lower concentrations of ozone pollution than it previously judged to be safe this report discusses the standardsetting process the specifics of the new standard and issues raised by the administrators choice and it describes the steps that will follow epas promulgation the ozone standard affects large percentage of the population nearly half the us population currently lives in ozone nonattainment areas the term epa uses for areas that violate the standard 140 million people in all as result of the standards strengthening more areas will be affected and those already considered nonattainment may have to impose more stringent emission controls the revision lowers the primary healthbased and secondary welfarebased standards from 008 parts per million ppm averaged over 8 hours to 0075 ppm averaged over the same time using the most recent three years of monitoring data 345 counties 54 of all counties with ozone monitors would violate the new standards only 85 counties exceeded the preexisting standards thus the change in standards will have widespread impacts in areas across the country the 345 counties that would exceed the standard are shown in figure 2 of this report the revision follows multiyear review of the science regarding ozones effects on public health and welfare the new standards will set in motion long and complicated implementation process that has farreaching impacts for public health for sources of pollution in numerous economic sectors and for state and local governments the first step designation of nonattainment areas is expected to take place in 2010 with the areas so designated then having 3 to 20 years to reach attainment the new standards raise number of issues including whether the choices for the primary and secondary standards are backed by the available science not only are the administrators choices weaker than those proposed by his scientific advisers but the administrative record makes clear that in part they were dictated by the white house over the objections of epa whether the standards should lead to stronger federal controls on the sources of pollution is another likely issue current federal standards for cars trucks power plants and other pollution sources are not strong enough to bring all areas into attainment thus requiring local pollution control measures in many cases epa the states and congress may also wish to consider whether the current monitoring network is adequate to detect violations of more stringent standard only 639 of the nations 3000 counties have ozone monitors in place with half of those monitors showing violations of the new standards questions arise as to air quality in unmonitored counties contents introduction 1 what are naaqs 1 the naaqs process 2 the ozone standard 3 the primary standard 3 the

administrator signed revisions to the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ozone the revisions appeared in the march 27 2008 issue of the federal register1 because they have widespread implications for public health and for the pollution control measures that will be imposed on sectors of the economy the revisions released in proposed form in june 2007 have stirred congressional interest and led many members of congress and state and local officials to comment on the administrators proposal the clean air and nuclear safety subcommittee of the senate environment and public works committee held hearing on the proposal july 11 2007 the house oversight and government reform committee plans hearing april 24 2008 this report provides background on naaqs the process used to establish them the preexisting ozone standard and epas revisions as well as information regarding the revisions potential effects what are naaqs as defined in section 109 of the clean air act naaqs are standards that apply to ambient outdoor air the act directs epa to set both primary and secondary standards primary naaqs are standards the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the epa administrator are requisite to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety secondary naaqs are standards necessary to protect public welfare broad term that includes damage to crops vegetation property building materials etc2 naaqs are at the core of the clean air act even though they do not directly regulate emissions in essence they are standards that define what epa considers to be clean air once naaqs has been set the agency using monitoring data and other information submitted by the states identifies areas that exceed the standard and must therefore reduce pollutant concentrations to achieve it after these nonattainment areas are identified state and local governments have three years to produce state implementation plans which outline the measures they will implement to reduce the pollution levels and attain the standards depending on the severity of 1 73 federal register 16436 2 the clean air acts definition of welfare is found in section 302h of the act crs2 the pollution ozone nonattainment areas have anywhere from 3 to 20 years to actually attain the standard epa also acts to control many of the naaqs pollutants wherever they are emitted through national standards for products that emit them particularly mobile sources such as automobiles and emission standards for new stationary sources such as power plants thus establishment or revision of naaqs sets in motion long and complicated implementation process that has farreaching impacts for public health for sources of pollution in numerous economic sectors and for states and local governments the pollutants to which naaqs apply are generally referred to as criteria pollutants the act defines them as pollutants that endanger public health or welfare and whose presence in ambient air results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources3 six pollutants are currently identified as criteria pollutants ozone particulates carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and lead the epa administrator can add to this list if he determines that additional pollutants meet the acts criteria or delete them if he concludes that they longer do so the act requires the agency to review each naaqs every five years that schedule is rarely met but it often triggers lawsuits that force the agency to undertake review in the case of ozone the previous review of the naaqs was completed in 1997 the american lung association filed suit over epas failure to complete review in 2003 and consent decree established the schedule epa ultimately followed4 the naaqs process reviewing an existing naaqs is long process that is described elsewhere in more detail5 to summarize briefly epa scientists review the scientific literature published since the last naaqs revision and summarize it in report known as criteria document the review process for ozone identified 1700 scientific studies on topics as wideranging as the physics and chemistry of ozone in the atmosphere environmental concentrations patterns and exposure dosimetry and animalto 3 authority to establish naaqs comes from both sections 108 and 109 of the act this definition of criteria pollutants is found in section 108 the authority and procedures for controlling the sources of criteria pollutants are found throughout titles i ii and iv of the act pollutants that are less widely emitted are generally classified as hazardous air pollutants and are regulated under different section of the act section 112 4 the schedule was set by consent decree that settled lawsuit filed by the american lung association american lung association v leavitt ddc 03778 modified consent decree approved 121604 epa agreed that it would propose whether to retain or revise the ozone standard by june 20 2007 and take final action by march 12 2008 5 for discussion of the process and of changes to it that epa is now implementing see crs report rl33807 air quality standards and sound science what role for casac

exposures and climate and effects on manmade materials second document that epa prepares the staff paper summarizes the information compiled in the criteria document and provides the administrator with options regarding the indicators averaging times statistical form and numerical level concentration of the naaqs to ensure that these reviews meet the highest scientific standards the 1977 amendments to the clean air act required the administrator to appoint an independent clean air scientific advisory committee casac casac has seven members largely from academia and from private research institutions in conducting naaqs reviews their expertise is supplemented by panels of the nations leading experts on the health and environmental effects of the specific pollutants that are under review these panels can be quite large the ozone review panel for example had 23 members casac and the public make suggestions regarding the membership of the panels on specific pollutants with the final selections made by epa the panels review the agencys work during naaqssetting and naaqsrevision rather than conducting their own independent reviews the ozone standard the ozone standard affects larger percentage of the population than any of the other naaqs nearly half the us population currently lives in ozone nonattainment areas 140 million people in all6 since the standard has been strengthened as result of the current review more areas will be affected and those already considered nonattainment may have to impose more stringent emission controls the primary standard the preexisting primary healthbased standard promulgated in 1997 was set at 008 parts per million ppm averaged over an 8hour period allowing for rounding epa considered areas with readings as high as 0084 ppm 84 parts per billion to have attained the standard the review just completed found evidence of health effects including mortality at levels of exposure below the 008 ppm standard as result both epa staff and the clean air scientific advisory committee casac recommended strengthening the standard according to casac there is scientific justification for retaining 6 for information on the nonattainment areas including maps and population data see epas green book at httpwwwepagovoaroaqpsgreenbkindexhtml crs4 the current 008 ppm primary 8hr naaqs7 the panel unanimously recommended range of 0060 to 0070 ppm for the primary 8hour standard epa staff also recommended strengthening the standard in wording not quite so direct the staff stated the overall body of evidence on ozone health effects clearly calls into question the adequacy of the current standard they recommended considering standard level within the range of somewhat below 0080 parts per million ppm to 0060 ppm8 based on these recommendations and his own judgment regarding the strength of the science the administrator proposed to tighten the primary standard to level within the range of 00700075 ppm in june 2007 and ultimately chose to finalize the standard at 0075 ppm 75 parts per billion9 the revision will add large number of counties to those showing nonattainment as shown in figure 1 using 20042006 data the latest available 85 counties had monitors showing violation of the 008 ppm primary standard figure 2 shows what happens when the standard is strengthened to 0075 ppm again using 20042006 data under the new standard 345 counties more than four times as many show violations epa notes that nonattainment designations will not actually be made until 2010 at the earliest and will use data for the period 20062008 given the trend toward cleaner air in recent years and regulations on both mobile and stationary sources that will be taking effect in the next few years the agency expects the number of counties exceeding the standard to be less than indicated by these projections nevertheless because strengthening of the standard will result in some perhaps substantial number of additional areas being designated nonattainment and will mean that current nonattainment areas may have to adopt additional pollution control measures in order to reach attainment numerous industry groups are reported to have challenged the scientific conclusions in meetings with administration officials10 7 letter of rogene henderson chair clean air scientific advisory committee to hon stephen l johnson epa

epa also assessed the secondary public welfare naaqs for ozone which was identical to the previous 008 ppm primary standard ozone affects both tree growth and crop yields and the damage from exposure is cumulative over the growing season in order to provide protection against ozones adverse impacts epa staff recommended new seasonal 3month average for the secondary standard that would cumulate hourly ozone exposures for the daily 12hour daylight window termed w126 index the staff recommended standard in range of 7 21 parts per millionhours ppmhrs casacs ozone panel agreed unanimously that the form of the secondary standard should be changed as the staff suggested but it did not agree that the upper bound of the range should be as high as 21 ppmhours11 the administrators june 2007 proposal was in line with the staff recommendation 721 ppmhrs but his final march 2008 choice was to duplicate the new primary standard he set secondary standard at 0075 ppm averaged over 8 hours rejecting the advice of both casac and his staff the secondary standard carries deadline for attainment and has never been the subject of penalties or sanctions for areas that failed to meet it unless they also violated primary standard nevertheless there appears to have been substantial disagreement between epa and the white house over the form in which this standard should be set the preamble to the final regulation repeats the arguments for new form of standard the w126 index concluding the casac based on its assessment of the same vegetation effects science agreed with the criteria document and staff paper and unanimously concluded that protection of vegetation from the known or anticipated adverse effects of ambient o3 ozone requires secondary standard that is substantially different from the primary standard in averaging time level and form ie not identical to the primary standard for o3 henderson 200712 the preamble also cites comments the agency received from the national park service that the nps supports both the conclusion that seasonal cumulative metric is needed to protect vegetation and that the w126 is more appropriate metric and it adds epa agrees with these comments13 nevertheless the agency appears to have lost this argument the preamble states that on march 11 2008 the president concluded that consistent with administration policy added protection should be afforded to public welfare by strengthening the secondary ozone standard and setting it to be identical to the 11 letter of rogene henderson chair clean air scientific advisory committee to hon stephen l johnson epa administrator march 26 2007 p 3 available at httpyosemiteepagovsabsabproductnsffe915e916333d776852572ac007397b5 filecasac07002pdf 12 73 federal register 16498 13 ibid p 16499 crs7 new primary standard the approach adopted when ozone standards were last promulgated this policy thus recognizes the administrators judgment that the secondary standard needs to be adjusted to provide increased protection to public welfare and avoids setting standard lower or higher than is necessary14 the statement that the policy recognizes the administrators judgment is not epas wording it is direct quotation from the white house office of management and budget15 controlling ozone pollution controlling ozone pollution is more complicated than controlling many other pollutants because ozone is not emitted directly by pollution sources rather it forms in the atmosphere when volatile organic compounds vocs react with nitrogen oxides nox in the presence of sunlight the ozone concentration is as dependent on the temperature and amount of sunshine as it is on the presence of the precursor gases ozone is summertime pollutant in general other factors being equal cool cloudy summer will produce fewer high ozone readings than warm sunny summer there are also complicated reactions that affect ozone formation in general lower emissions lead to less ozone particularly lower emissions of vocs but under some conditions higher emissions of nox lead to lower ozone readings this makes modeling ozone air quality and predicting attainment more difficult and contentious than the modeling of other air pollutants most stationary and mobile sources are considered to be contributors to ozone pollution thus there are literally hundreds of millions of sources of the pollutants of concern and control strategies require implementation of wide array of measures among the sources of vocs are motor vehicles about 40 of total emissions industrial processes particularly the chemical and petroleum industries and any use of paints coatings and solvents about 40 for these sources combined service stations pesticide application dry cleaning fuel combustion and open burning are other significant sources of vocs nitrogen oxides come overwhelmingly from motor vehicles and fuel combustion by electric utilities and other industrial sources costs and benefits of control epa is prohibited from taking cost into account in setting naaqs but to comply with an executive order the agency generally produces regulatory impact 14 ibid p 16497 15 letter from susan dudley administrator office of management and budget to stephen l johnson administrator us epa march 13 2008 at httpwwwregulationsgovfdmspubliccomponentmainmaindocketdetaildepa hqoar20050172 item 7178 note the date on the letter is apparently incorrect as the letter was received march 12 2008 crs8 analysis ria analyzing in detail the costs and benefits of new or revised naaqs standards the agency released an ria for the final standards on march 14 the major conclusions regarding benefits and costs were also included in text slides dated march 12 that were posted on the agencys website16 the ria shows wide range of estimates for benefits from low of 2 billion annually to high of 19 billion annually in 2020 costs of implementing the standard were estimated to range from 76 billion to 88 billion annually also in 2020 the benefit range is so wide that it is difficult to reach any general conclusions regarding whether projected benefits exceed costs or vice versa the public health benefits of setting more stringent ozone standard are the monetized value of such effects as fewer premature deaths fewer hospital admissions fewer emergency room visits fewer asthma attacks less time lost at work and school and fewer restricted activity days17 an epa fact sheet that accompanied the standards states that the benefits of an 0075 ppm primary standard might include the avoidance of 260 to 2300 premature deaths annually in 202018 other annual benefits in 2020 would include preventing the following 380 cases of chronic bronchitis 890 nonfatal heart attacks 1900 hospital and emergency room visits 1000 cases of acute bronchitis 11600 cases of upper and lower respiratory symptoms 6100 cases of aggravated asthma 243000 days when people miss work or school 750000 days when people must restrict their activities in the ria the agency notes that there are significant uncertainties in both cost and benefit estimates19 among the uncertainties are unquantified benefits the effects of reduced ozone on forest health and agricultural productivity for example and unquantified disbenefits reduced screening of uvb radiation and reduced nitrogen fertilization of forests and cropland the benefits will also vary depending on which of the precursor pollutants nonattainment areas choose to control the ria also states of critical importance to understanding these estimates of future costs and benefits is that they are not intended to be forecasts of the actual costs and benefits of implementing revised standards20 if past experience is any guide this is likely to mean that costs will not be as great as they are projected to be 16 the ria is at httpwwwepagovttnecasriahtml the text slides are at httpwwwepagovgroundlevelozonepdfs2008_03_text_slidespdf 17 for full discussion of these variables and their monetized values see chapter 6 of the ria at httpwwwepagovttnecasregdatarias6ozoneriachapter6pdf 18 final revisions to the national ambient air quality

agencys words technological advances over time will tend to increase the economic feasibility of reducing emissions and will tend to reduce the costs of reducing emissions21 benefits meanwhile will remain difficult to quantify in part because of the difficulty of quantifying and valuing lives lost prematurely due to exposure to pollution issues the major issues raised by the new standards concern whether the administrator has made appropriate choices ie whether his choices for the primary and secondary standards are backed by the scientific studies the administrators choice for the primary standard is weaker than any part of the range proposed by casac the secondary standard does not follow the form that casac unanimously recommended in explaining the administrators choice for the primary standard the preamble stresses the uncertainty that the administrator found at lower levels of ozone exposure the administrator noted that at exposure levels below 0080 ppm there is only very limited amount of evidence from clinical studies indicating effects in some healthy individuals at levels as low as 0060 ppm the great majority of the evidence concerning effects below 0080 ppm is from epidemiological studies the epidemiological studies do not identify any brightline threshold level for effects at the same time the epidemiological studies are not in and of themselves direct evidence of causal link between exposure to o3 and the occurrence of the effects22 thus he concluded that within his proposed range of 0070 to 0075 ppm the choice was essentially policy judgment taking into account the uncertainties that remain in interpreting the evidence from available controlled human exposure and epidemiological studies at very low levels the administrator notes that the likelihood of obtaining benefits to public health with standard set below 0075 ppm o3 decreases while the likelihood of requiring reductions in ambient concentrations that go beyond those that are needed to protect public health increases the administrator judges that the appropriate balance to be drawn based on the entire body of evidence and information available in this review is standard set at 007523 casac in letter to the administrator dated october 24 2006 appeared to disagree with this conclusion the letter states furthermore we have evidence from recently reported controlled clinical studies of healthy adult human volunteers exposed for 66 hours to 008 006 or 004 21 ibid p es10 22 73 federal register 16476 march 27 2008 23 ibid p 16483 crs10 ppm ozone or to filtered air alone during moderate exercise adams 2006 statisticallysignificant decrements in lung function were observed at the 008 ppm exposure level importantly adverse lung function effects were also observed in some individuals at 006 ppm adams 2006 these results indicate that the current ozone standard of 008 ppm is not sufficiently healthprotective with an adequate margin of safety it should be noted these findings were observed in healthy volunteers similar studies in sensitive groups such as asthmatics have yet to be conducted however people with asthma and particularly children have been found to be more sensitive and to experience larger decrements in lung function in response to ozone exposures than would healthy volunteers24 in past years the administrator has generally chosen standards within casacs ranges but not always recent example being the naaqs for particulate matter promulgated in october 2006 that standard is currently being challenged in the dc circuit court of appeals25 it would not be surprising if the new ozone standard is also challenged in setting the secondary standard as described earlier the administrators choice also disregarded the advice of casac and apparently epas staff as well the preamble contains epa statements both opposing and supporting the final form of the standard and it appears to indicate substantial involvement by the white house office of management and budget in the final days before promulgation other issues will undoubtedly be raised as affected industries state environmental agencies public interest and environmental groups and the congress review what epa has promulgated including the potential impacts of the new standards on public health and on the economy in looking at potential impacts epa projected air quality to the year 2020 incorporating the expected reductions in emissions from slew of federal regulations including the clean air interstate rule cair the clean air visibility rule the tier 2 auto and light truck emission standards several rules affecting diesel engines and some state and local measures even with these controls the agency projected that 28 counties in 10 states counties that include some of the nations biggest cities would violate the 0075 standard in 202026 furthermore most nonattainment areas will not be given until 2020 to attain the standards for most the deadline will be 2013 or 2016 based on the degree to which pollutant concentrations exceed the new standard this suggests mismatch between the full impact of federal regulations on specific categories of emission sources and the requirement that local areas demonstrate attainment this mismatch could support case for stronger federal controls on the sources of ozone precursors or reexamination of the attainment deadlines 24 letter of dr rogene henderson chair casac to epa administrator stephen l johnson october 24 2006 at httpyosemiteepagovsabsabproductnsf

standard by robert esworthy and james mccarthy 26 for map showing the 2020 projections see epas briefing materials at httpwwwepagovgroundlevelozonepdfs20070621_mapspdf crs11 another issue arises from close inspection of epas maps ie whether the current monitoring network is adequate to detect violations of more stringent standard only 639 of the nations 3000 counties have ozone monitors in place with 345 of them 54 showing violations of the new standard using current data how confident is the agency that the 2400 counties without monitors would all be in attainment for the past three years the presidents budget has requested significant reductions in grants to states and local governments for air quality management which includes funding for monitoring27 given these reductions increasing the number of monitors would appear to be task that the agency views as falling on state and local government resources the current monitors are generally found in urban areas because of the larger population potentially affected and because most of the sources of ozone precursor emissions are located in such areas but as noted earlier ozone is not emitted directly by polluters it forms in the atmosphere downwind of emission sources thus rural areas can have high ozone concentrations unless they are located substantial distance from any urban area in addition to the potential health impacts of ozone in rural areas the controversy over the setting of the secondary ozone naaqs might suggest need for additional monitoring in rural areas 27 for additional information see crs
