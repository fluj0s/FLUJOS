belarus has close historical and cultural ties to russia efforts to establish political and economic union between the two countries have had substantial public support in belarus ne vertheless the pace of inte gration between belarus and russia remains slow in large part becau of lukashenkos refusal to undertake economic reforms current russian policy to ward belarus appears to be focused on gaining control of belaruss economic assets particularly oil and natural gas pipelines while reducing the costs of s ubsidizing the belarusian economy this russian policy was evident in conflict in late 2006 and early 2007 over russian energy supplies to belarus which ende d in sharp reduction in russian energy subsidies to the lukashenko regime in recent years us officials have criticized lukashenko as europes last dictator they have also expressed cerns about belaruss arms sales and other ties to rogue regimes the united states pursues policy of selective engagement which limits ties to the regime while pr oviding modest support to prodemocracy organizations in belarus the united st ates and the european union have imposed sanctions on belarusian leaders in march 2008 belarus wit hdrew its ambassador from washington it successfully pressed the united states to recall its ambassador and sharply reduce the size of its embassy in minsk in response to what belarus perceived as tightening of us sanctions nevertheless the eu and the united states are interested in improving ties with belarus partly due to concerns about the countrys future in the wake of sharp russi an energy price increases and the regional implications of russias milita ry assault on georgia in august 2008 in october 2008 the eu suspended travel ban on l ukashenko and other belarusian leaders congress

belarusian president aleksandr luka shenko snuffed out belaruss modest progress toward democracy and free mark et economy in the initial years after the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 and cr eated an authoritarian regime his regime in rhetoric and policies throwback to the soviet era is an anachronism located among central europe integrated into euroatlantic institutions ukraine that has made strides in democratization and russia that is increasingly authoritarian but moving forward with economic modernizati on those advocating stronger us role in trying to bring democratic change to belarus say that the country is important to the united states b ecause as what us officials have called europes last dictatorship belarus is an obstacle to the us goal of making europe whole and free another concern is bela russ support for pariah regimes including through arms sales political and economic situation lukashenko was first elected as president of belarus in 1994 on populist anti corruption platform he dominates the belarusian political scene controlling the parliament government secur ity services and judiciary through large presidential administration and substantia l extrabudgetary resources he has reduced potential threats from within his regime by frequently removing or transferring officials at all levels often claiming they are incompetent or corrupt former regime figures who move into opposition are singled out for pa rticularly harsh punishment his tight control over an unreformed ec onomy has prevented the rise of powerful oligarchs as occurred in ukraine and russia the l ukashenko regime also controls almost all of the media which it uses to burnish lukashenkos image and attack real and imagined adversaries luka shenko is known for his political unpredictability and for making rambling and rhetorically colorful public statements1 the state departments country re ports on human rights for 2007 judged belaruss human rights record to

to monitors from the organization for secu rity and cooperation in europe osce the elections failed to meet osce standards for free and fair elections the observers noted many serious shortcomings in the ections including harassment arrests and police violence against opposition campaign workers including the beating and arrest of presidential candidate aleksandr kazulin kazulin was later sentenced to five and half years in prison for hooliganism and disorderly conduct charges us and european officials denounced as politically motivated the observers also noted that the rgely governmentcontrolled media was heavily biased against opposition candida tes domestic election observers were arrested and almost oppositi on figures were included in the administration of the elections resulting in vote count that wa s not transparent the observers said that the kgb belaruss security service issued statements just before the vote associating opposition and civil society groups with terrorism and charged that they were plotting violent uprising2 belarusian election offici als announced that lukashenko had won the election with over 82 of the vote his cl osest opponent opposition leader aleksandr milinkevich won only 6 milinkevich and other opposition candidates denounced the vote as fraudulent and called for massive demonstrations to force the authorities to hold new free and fair election more than 10000 persons attended the first demonstrations in the capital minsk th size of the protests soon dwindled however the regime refrained fro m massive violent crackdown on the demonstrators but scores of persons were arrested incl uding opposition campaign leaders russian leaders praised the conduct of the electi on and congratulated lukashenko on his victory opposition groups and leaders in belarus ve so far posed little threat to the lukashenko regime after th presidential election demons trations organized by the opposition over such issues as social policy and eventual eu membership for belarus achieved only modest turnout less than th roughly 10000 who gathered to protest the presidential election the oppositions weakness is in large part due to the regimes repression but divisions over ideology and the conflicting personal ambitions of its leaders ve also been factors in august 2008 lukashenko freed opposition leader aleksandr kazulin and two other jailed opposition figures meeting c ondition set by the united states and eu for improving relations that all political prisoners in belarus be freed the united states and eu also

elections but noted some minor improvements in such areas as access for osce observers and par ticipation of few opposition re presentatives in district election commissions the observers said the vote was wellconduc ted but that many observers rated the vote count as bad or ve ry bad including cases of falsification of vote totals media access for oppos ition candidates was also very limited3 economic situation belaruss economy is the most unreformed in europe according to most observers lukashenko has re fused to privatize all but few stateowned firms or collective farms however belaruss economy appears to be doing quite well at least on paper belaruss gross domestic product grew by reported 104 in the first half of 2008 belarus has so far avoided the hyperinfla tion it suffered during the 1990s however inflation is rising due in part to increased cost of energy supplies from russia and relatively loose monetary policies consumer price inflation in july 2008 was 163 on yearonyear basis the official unemployment rate in 2007 wa s 12 although experts belie ve the real figure was substantially higher because the very low amounts offered as unemployment compensation mean that few belarusians bother to register for benefits real wages continue to rise rapidly by 84 in june 2008 on yearonyear basis there are several explanations for belaruss apparent economic success belaruss ec onomy s been buoyed by exports to growing russia and until recently belarusian refineries have prof ited from refining cheap russian crude oil and exporting it to western countries in addition many experts doubt that belarusian statistics are tirely accurate production figu res may be exaggerated by officials to avoid punishment by luka shenko for not meeting planned targets growth in industrial producti on is made possible by subsidies to ailing state firms wage and pension increases are mandated by the government collective farms are also propped up by subsidies although pr ivate plots held by peasants are more productive prices of key c onsumer goods are controlled lukashenkos policies have provided low but stab standard of living for many belarusians and are key reason for the public support that he enjoys particularly among older and rurally based belarusians however it is unclear how long lukashenko can continue such polic ies without cheap energy supplies from russia lukashenko has made some adjustments in his policies to compensate for the reduction in russian energy subsidies si nce 2007 belarus has restructured and privatized some state firms albeit in nontransparent manner firms have been sold to investors from russia but also countries such as rkey and germany social benefits for vulnerable groups have been tr immed subsidies have

loans from foreign banks increased in late 2007 russia extended to belarus 15 billion stabilization loan it is ne gotiating another 2 billion loan from russia as well as 500 million loan from venezuela4 so far belarus has coped relatively well with initial energy price increases but further sharp price hikes could deva state the countrys unreformed economy economists point to rising inflation worsening current account deficit and increasing foreign debt as warnings of futu re problems however it appears unlikely that lukashenko will make the more t horough economic reforms that the country needs as they may undermine the basis of his power relations with russia belarus has close historical and cultural ties with russia efforts to establish political and economic union between th two countries have had substantial public support in belarus however the pace of integration between belarus and russia remains slow as russian presid ent putin was openly contemptuous of lukashenkos grandiose rhetoric about integration lukash enko has apparently feared at times that russia would try to re place him with more pliable figure which may be factor in frequent personnel ch anges in the belarusian leadership efforts to move forward on economic union although given rhetorical support by lukashenko have been stymied by be laruss reluctance to adopt the russian ruble which would cede control over mone tary policy to moscow for its part russian policy toward belarus appears to be focused on gaining control of belaruss key economic assets while limiting subsidies to the unref ormed belarusian economy after the collapse of the soviet uni on russias stateowned natural gas firm gazprom supplied belarus with natural gas at russian domestic prices providing large indirect subsidy to the lukashenko re gime about 20 of russias natural gas exports to europe flow through belarusian pipelines in late 2006 gazprom strong ly pressured belarus to sell to it control of the beltransgaz natural gas firm which contro ls the pipelines and other infrastructure on belarusian territory and other key belarusian energy firms or face the quadrupling of the price belarus would pay for russian natural gas belarus would face cutoff in supplies on january 1 2007 if it did not agr ee to pay the higher price just hours before the deadline however the two sides reached agreement that averted gas shutoff belarus agreed to pay 105 per 1000 cubic meters in 2007 more than double the 4648 it paid in 2006 moreover pr ices are scheduled to rise steadily over the next few years reaching world mark et levels in 2011 belarus agreed to sell gazprom majority stake in beltransgaz in 2007 the first 125 stake was sold to gazprom for 625 million gazprom will pa the same amount for additional 125 shares each year from 2008 through 2010 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32534crs5 after settling the gas dispute the two c ountries were soon em broiled in conflict over oil supplies in addition to receiving cheap natural gas be larus also benefitted from inexpensive and dutyfree crude oil supplies that are processed at belarusian refineries the bulk of these refined products were then sold to eu countries at hefty profit in january 2007 russia moved to sharply reduce this subsidy to the belarusian economy russia imposed tariff on oil exports to belarus belarus retaliated by increasing transit fees for russian oil supplies to western europe when russia refused to pay belarus cut off oil supplies to western european countries angering their governments belarus and russia ended the crisis by agreeing that belarus would raise its export duty on crude and refi ned oil products to western europe to match that imposed by russia russia would then exempt belarus from most of the new russian oil export duty belarus agreed to hand over to russia 70 of the proceeds that it receives from its exports of refined oil products to the western market this figure will be gradually increased to 85 in 2009 russias effort to increase capacity at its oil terminal at primorsk may cause it to reduce its use of the druzhba pipeline which runs through bela rus to poland and western europe in august 2007 gazprom threatened to cut off natural gas supplies to belarus unless it paid 456 million debt for previous deliveries crisis was averted when minsk settled the debt belarus continues to ask russia to moderate future energy prices which may double in 2008 belarus also wants moscow to increase the transport fees it pays to belarus for use of its pipelines to europe so far without success to hedge his bets lukashenko has called for diversifi cation of belaruss energy supplies by imports from such count ries as venezuela iran and azerbaijan as well as development of coal reserves and nuclear power plant within belarus lukashenko has pointed to close military c ooperati on between the two countries and belaruss geographical pos ition between nato and russia as reasons for russia to subsidize energy supplies to belarus belarus is member of the russiandominated collective security treaty organization csto which russia hopes to make into counterweight to nato influence russian and belarusian air defenses are closely integrat ed but not formally unified russia has supplied belarus with uptodate air defense equipment although they do not have joint armed forces regional task force of belarusi an and russian ground forces conducts joint military exercises small number of russian troops remain in belarus in part to run naval radio station and an early warning radar station in august 2008 russias ambassador to belarus warned that russia would likely deploy modernized iskandar short range missiles and strategic bombers to belarus in response to us plans to deploy an antiballistic miss ile system in poland and the czech republic he ruled out the stationing of nuclear weapons in belarus however lukashenkos initial response to russia s military assault on georgia in august was remarkably muted perhaps reflecting fear that the move would presage greater russian pressure on belarus however after substantial russian prodding lukashenko offered

called fo r closer economic ties with the eu he has condemned eu criticisms of his regime as interference in the countrys affairs since 1997 the eu has followed policy of limiting its official
