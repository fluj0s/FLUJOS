central asian states and problems with terrorism summary for years the united states has actively engaged in efforts to improve human rights conditions in the peoples republic of china prc the us congress has passed numerous pieces of legislation that censure and in many cases impose sanctions against the prc for violations of human rights and religious freedoms but some analysts maintain that the ev ents of september 11 2001 have complicated the situation for us policymakers who seek to pressure the chinese government to improve its human rights record these complications relate particularly to chinas northwestern xinjiang uighur autonomou s region xuar and its large population of uighur muslims various reports allege that some uighur groups are engaged in terrorist activity in xinjiang and thr oughout central asiainc luding afghanistan the chinese government has been making such claims since the later 1990s and chinese officials have launched series of crackdowns against muslim activists in the xuar human rights groups complain th at the prc is using the international campaign against terrorism as pretext to intensify its crackdowns on uighurs in the xuar analysts point out that number of uighur groups are reportedly associated with such elements as the islamic movement of uzbekistan hizbuttahrir jamaat iislami and tableegi jamaat groups that are allegedly involved in subversive activities throughout central as ia additionally various reports suggest that links exist between the alqaedataliban forces and some uighurs and other central asian groups operating in chin and central asia these alleged linkages have been major source of consternation among ch inese and central asian officials who argue that the taliban movement in afghan istan has helped to bring about rise in radical islamic militancy and greater instability in the region additionally some analysts point out th at the september 11 attacks adversely affected plans of the newly formed regional organization known as the shanghai cooperation organization sco made up of china russia tajikistan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan and kazakhstan some analysts thought that the sco had the potential to be vital player in the posttaliban regional security and rebuilding arrangement especially since the sco member states have been combating terrorism extremism and separatism the socalled threeevil forces in central asia and xinjiang during the past few years however the united states has seized the initiative on this issue and has formed global coalition including key sco member states this suggests that in the interim at least china and the sco may play reduced role in the region as long as the usled coalition is engaged in the antiterrorist war on august 26 2002 us deputy secretar of state richard armitage made surprise and controversial announcement that the united states would now consider the east turkestan islamic movement eti m as terrorist group although chinese

as they relate to uighur muslims in xinjiang china also has reportedly stepped up its suppression of uighur muslims following the attacks in the united stat on september 11 2001 policy question for the united states is how to balance the antiterrorist campaign with traditional concerns over human rights in china s western region and how to react s hould beijing use the threat of terrorism to abrogate rights of aut onomy in xinjiang as provided for in chinas constitution in the past the united states had warned chinese officials that the antiterror campaign should not be used to suppress legitimate political dissent among chinas own muslim populations in as visit to beijing in december 2001 for instance the state departments top counterterrorism expert francis x taylor said that washington did not believe muslim paratists in china who supported an independent east turkesta n were part of the gl obal antiterror network but on august 26 2002 us deputy secret ary of state

republic of east turkestan during the chinese civil war 19451949 but selfrule came to an abrupt end when communist troops entered xinjiang in 1949 the chines government immediately began to consolidate its control over xinjiang by sending retired ethnic han chinese soldiers into xinjiang to form new units ca lled production and c onstruction corps bingtuan2 the chinese government has continued to resettle the xinjiang area with ethnic han chinese migrants and with other ethnic minority groups this has exacerbated tensions with the uighurs who have witnessed the han population in xinjiang once mere 6 to 7 percent ba lloon to approximately 40 to 45 percent of xinjiangs total population3 fearing continued cultural marginaliza tion and religious persecution uighurs have become increasingly virulent in their protests against chinese rule in xinjiang as result of these protests and in creased violence in april 1996 the prc government launched series of new crac kdowns and controversial strike hard yan da campaign to reestablish order in xinjiang this has resulted in number of uighur leaders being killed jailed or driven into exile4 the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 and the establishment of independent states by the former soviet central as ian republics encouraged some uighurs in their aspirations to reestablish an indepe ndent homeland according to some analysts familiar with the region many uighurs in xi njiang felt that having their own state cuts to the core of their ethnic identity and ultimate survival as culture5 furthermore other minorities in

government led by president islam karim ov was dealing with an increasing threat from islamic fundamentalists looking to tablish radical islamic st ate in uzbekistan china feared that all of these events which i nvolved islamic funda mentalist elements would spread to xinjiang and radicalize the uighur groups in xinjiang however the one event that would prove the most pr oblematic to china and the entire central asian region was the fall of kabul afghanistan to the taliban militia in september 19968 the taliban movement has been accused by leaders in beijing and secular leaders throughout central asia of spread ing its radical views of islam into many parts of central and south asia leading in some cases to rise of islamic fundamentalist groups and activity including bombing assassinations and other acts of terror and subversion in particular china and the central asian states over the years have charged that the taliban and their close associate osama bin laden have been funding arming and training number of uighurs kyrgyz kazakhs and uzbeks in camps located inside afghanistan9 in 1996 china russia tajikistan kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan formed group known as the shanghaifive to serve as bulwark against the spread of islamic fundamentalist subversion it was initially designed to be an informal grouping to discuss ways to resolve old border dis putes and fortify common borders against terrorist and separatist ac tivity however the groups members soon decided they needed to cooperate more thoroughly to d eal with what they called the three evil

2001that now that the united states is taking on global terrorism particularly in the central asian region the shan ghai cooperation organization is beginning to feel bit overshadowed and marginalized11 surprisingly to some russia tajikistan uzbekistan kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan are all providing robust support for the usled counterterrorism effort analysts say that with the united states now monopolizing the agenda on antiterrorism in the region the chinese are starting to fear that major component of their central asian geopolitical strategy is being gradually neutralized12 us policy implications the attacks on september 11 2001 and the usled retaliation in afghanistan has wideranging policy implications for us china policy in the short term and may cause number of policy shifts and challenges in the long term one of the most difficult challenges is how the united states will balance its need to create broad based multistate coalition to fight against terrorism with traditional american obligations to protect and defend religious freedoms and human rights according to number of analysts china russia and the central asian states in exchange for lending support and coope ration to the us in the fight against global terrorism may want support for their campaigns against groups they view as terrorists and reduction in the level of criticism over what the united states views as human rights abuses13 this may anger religious and human rights activists who may view it as capitulation of american values and prin ciples although it may be important to review and reformulate those policies to make it easier to fulfill the requirements and goals of multistate coalition some policy makers argue that an equally important consideration for us policymakers pursuing the campaign against terrorism is ensuring that the terrorism campaign does not give blank check to authoritarian regimes pursuing their own domestic agendas of civil political and religious repression there is also the question of whether the usled campaign against international terrorism should apply to gr oups seeking religious and political rights in authoritarian countries on the one nd it may appear that some uighurs ties with extremist groups could justify cr ackdown by beijing similar to that occurring in other countries on the other hand th political unrest by some uighurs could be logical response to suppression of their constitutional rights and the settlement of traditional uighur lands by ethnic chinese the policy dilemma for the united states therefore is the degree to which it may decline to react to possible human rights violations against uighurs in xinjia ng in return for chinese cooperation in the campaign against terrorism in the months leading up to the even ts of september 11 2001 the united states and china seemed headed toward becoming strategic competitorsor evenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31213crs5 14 there are number of existing sanctions

munitions including helicopters and helicopter parts and satellites for launch by chinese launch vehicles shortly after the september 11 attacks several media reports hinted that in exchange for chinese support and cooperation in the war on rrorism some of these sanctions would be eased or dropped 15 the washington post china vows to help in terror fight by mike allen and philip p pan october 19 2001adversaries before sept ember 11 2001 sinous relations were plagued by number of controversial issues such as na tional missile defense us weapons sales to taiwan the ep3 spy plane collision chinese missile exports to pakistan and elsewhere and continued criticisms over chinas violations of human rights and religious freedoms but the tragedy of september 11 2001 seemed to have pushed sinous relations in diffe rent direction the chinese began to stress common interest in combating terrorism and us policy makers began bu ilding broadbased multinational coalition against terrorism that would include the prc some see the antiterrorism campaign as new potential framework for more constructive and cooperative relationship despite this new cooperativ environment and concessions that some in the foreign policy establishment consider as necessary to form the multistate coalition against terrorism the bush administration has also shown willingness to stress the values and principles of human rights and religious freedoms par ticularly with regard to china although the united states has lifted some sanctions against nations that are cooperating in the war on terrorism eg pakistan neither the bush administration nor congress which has oversight authority on the waiving of sanctions placed on the prc has shown an inclination toward extending waiver of any existing sanctions placed on the prc14 china reportedly expects the united states to moderate criticisms over the prcs handling of uighur separatism in xinjiang however at the apec summit in shanghai in october 2001 president bush made statement that was interpreted as strong reminder that the us does not approve of chinas policies toward ethnic minorities and does not intend to forgo its responsibilities to support human rights and religious freedoms bush stated that the chinese should not attempt to use the war on terrorism as an excuse to persecute minorities15 china nevertheless insists that there are number of uighur groups that are actively involved in cross border terrorism and that it has the right to combat what it views as terrorism within and around its borders also china and the sco are being overshadowed by the us presence and leadership in central asia at the moment but beijing may attempt to reassert its influence as power broker in the region when the fighting in afghanistan has died down by revitalizing the sco mechanism however the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and the usled re taliation has caused range of geopo litical realignments

number of sco members immediately pled ged full support and cooperation to the united states this apparent geopolitical realignment combined with the possibility of longterm us troop deployment in ce ntral asia may raise concerns among the military and political elites in beijing that the united states is engaged in strategy of long term containmentor encircle ment of china on both its eastern and western borders analysts caution that the prc has not lost its resolve to extend its sphere of influence into central asia nor has it abandoned its geopolitical strategy of using the sco as its primary vehicle to achieve this goal this could mean an increase in the possibilities for competition between china and the united states over influence in central asia history and composition of uighur movement by the 14th century ethnic uighurs turkic speaking people from central asia were fully converted followers of islam they lived in ancient cities of great wealth and learning like tashkent in modern da uzbekistan and kashgar in modern day xinjiang western china however between the mid1700s and the mid1800s china conquered most of the uighur hom eland the ethnic manchu of northern china16 and czarist russian empires annexed th entire region of central asia by the late 1800s turkicspeaking peoples from we st and east turkestan were eventually brought under the sovereignty of these two empires although the uighurs reestablished east turkestan just after world war ii chinese communist forces reincorporated east turkestan into china at the end of the chinese civil war and east turkestan became known as the xin jiang uighur autonomous region the name was supposed to reflect the large degree of autonomy granted by the prc to uighurs in the constitution however some uighurs allege that the name is only symbolic and that little autonomy and righ ts are enjoyed by uighurs presently in 1991 central asian muslims such as the kazakhs uzbeks tajiks turkmen and krgyzethnic groups of the former soviet republicsfinally won their independence and set up sovere ign states for the first time in several hundred years they governed their own independent homel

arms procurement and training for some uighur groups in their struggle against prc rule18 although the uighur opposition to chinese rule has existed in many forms throughout history it has become more violent in recent years although some uighurs have been trying to attain inde pendence for number of years they have remained largely out of the view of mainstream media and have gained relatively little support from the interna tional community some analysts argue that this is because the uighur community lacks single charismatic leader like tibets dalai lama and because the uighur resist ance groups are largely fractured and disorganized and lack the ability to gain the full attention of key states such as britain and the united states19 other analysts and human rights activists argue that the reason that the uighur resistance m ovement has trouble gaining robust support and international atte ntion is because it lacks well funded lobby effort such as that of tibet and taiwan for advocating its cause in the west these analysts point out that uighurs are generally extremely poor nd geographically isolated in corner of the world that is largely forgotten and overwhelmingly populated by muslims20 analysts also argue that beijing has kept international attention away from the uighur resistance movement by severely restricting access to xinjiang uighur autonomous region21 according to these analysts the prc did not want to cast any light on the brutal tactics that police have used to stamp out the resistance to chinese rule22 however the events of september 11 2001 have turned the attention of many analysts and journalists to the uighur stru ggle in particular there appears to be interest in number of repor ts about alleged links betw een some uighur groups and

to some analysts most of these groups and associ ations have consistently advocated p eaceful means to gain their independence from the prc human rights issues in xinjiang although for number of years the p rc government has claimed that some uighur groups are linked to terrorist gr oups in central asia until recently the allegations were viewed by many in the west as mere propagandaor as an excuse to persecute political dissidents in xinjiang according to some analysts and rights activists one reason that chinese allegati ons against uighurs have been so highly disregarded by many in the west is that beijing is prone to group all uighurs into the terrorist category in the wake of september 11 however noted increase was reported in the number of accounts by out side sources about uighur violence in xinjiang and some of the acc ounts make claims similar to those that have been made by the prc over the past five years however since the terrorist attacks on the united states number of

especially the turkic speaking uighur muslims of xinjiang54 according to turdi ghoja of the uyghur american association the prc is taking advantage of the global war on terro rism to indulge in killing torturing and imprisoning uighurs in xinjiang without causing too much criticism from the international community55 recently high commissioner for human rights mary robinson in meeting with prc leaders stressed that the war on terrorism must not infringe on the human rights of chinas muslims robinson told prc officials that since the september 11 attacks her office has seen rise in allegations of summary executions imprisonment and to rture of uighurs which is considered serious violation of the principles embodied in the united nations covenant on civil and political rights and the universal declaration of human rights china is signatory of both documents56 additionally china has drawn criticism from number of uighurs and human rights advocates because it consistently fails to live up to its own constitutional provisions governing autonomous regions57 for example amnesty international cites several instances of uighurs being detained merely for being relatives or friends of political prisoners or fugitives or they say uighurs could be detained and held without charge for number of months just for rousing suspicions that they are involved in acts deemed harmful to the national security of the state58 chinese vice premier qian qichen denies these allegations and insists that china strictly distinguishes the separatists from the rest of the 10 million chinese muslims

11 in the days and weeks after the terrori st attacks on the us in september 2001 china has reportedly become increasingly c oncerned that its strategy for expanding its presence and influence in the centra l asian region through the sco mechanism is in jeopardy61 they point out that the us effort s to build and lead an international coalition against terrorism particularly in central asia have been swift and effective the us appears to have completely seized the initiative from the newly formed sco regional grouping and has provided sco members with an unanticipated alternative for addressing the issue of regional terrorism62 indeed the willingness and level at which number of sco member states have offered their support and cooperation to the united states is disturbing to number of beijin gs elites several western diplomats and asia specialists note that many in beijing are deeply concerned that washington could so quickly project its power into central asia and even develop close working relations with chinas closest ally in the region pakistan63 the new great game the prcs reported plan s to expand its influence throughout central asia may be put on hold because

immediate signal to china that the time was ripe to capitalize on washingtons perceived ambivalence toward the region although the united states had delivered around 15 billion in aid to the region between 1992 and 1998 this assistance was acco mpanied by pressure on the central asian states to establish plur alistic and democratic societies on the other hand the central asian states were mo re concerned about security and consolidation of their secular governments in the wake of incr eased islamic fundamentalism than they were with democracy and pluralism in their societies66 china which was much less concerned about democracy nd pluralism saw an opportunity for example china provided military and technical aid to uzbekistan kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan china also increased trade and economic ties with most of its western neighbors hoping to ensure access to valuable cent ral asian oil and natural gas resources67 additionally beijing was using the sco to develop closer ties to moscow than it had enjoyed at any other time ce the sinosoviet split in the late 1960s most of these relationships were further enhanced by the signing of the declaration of the establishment of the shanghai cooperati on organization the shanghai covenant on the suppression of terrorism separatism and extremism and the sinorussian friendship pact signed this past summer in moscow68 an important component of this process was the development of potential sinorussian counterweight to closer ties between russia and the united states this potentially significant gain for china was undermined by the geopolitical nd policy shifts following the september 11 attacks at the same time many in china believe that heightened us awareness of possible threats posed by islamic fundamentalist groups could serve chinese interests69 however since september 11 the eagerness of some member states to assist the united states bilaterally in the war on rrorism raises number of questions about the future
