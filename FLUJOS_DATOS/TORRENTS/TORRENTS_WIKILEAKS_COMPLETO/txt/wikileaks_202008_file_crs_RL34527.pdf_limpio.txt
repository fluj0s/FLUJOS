clearance and nomination in the first stage the white house selects and clears prospective appoi ntee before sending formal nomination to the senate there are number of steps in this stage of the

senators are constitutionally entitled by virtue of the advice and consen t clause noted above to provide advice to the president regarding his selection the extent of this entitlement is matter of some debate4 as practical matter in instances where senators perceive insufficient prenomination consultation has occurred they have sometimes used holds to block senate confir mation for those nominations5 during the clearance process the candidate prepares and submits several forms the public financial disclosure re port standard form sf 278 the questionnaire for national security po sitions sf 86 and the white house personal data statement ques tionnaire the office of th counsel to the president oversees the clearance process which often includes the collection and review of background information by the federal bur eau of investigation fbi internal revenue service irs office of government ethics oge and an ethics official for the agency to which the candidate is to be appointed if c onflicts are found during the background check oge and the agency ethics officer may work with the candidate to mitigate the conflicts once th office of the counsel to the president has cleared the candidate the nomination is ready to be submitted to the senate the selection and clearance stage has often been the longest part of the appointment process there have been at times lengthy delays particularly when many candidates have been pr ocessed simultaneously such as at the beginning of an administration or where conflicts needed to be resolved ca ndidates for higher level positions have often been accorded priority in this process in an effort to reduce the elapsed time between new pres idents inauguration and the appointment of his or her national security team amendments to the presidential transitions act of 19636 enacted at the end of 2004 encourag presidentelect to submit for security clearance potential nominees to highlevel national security positions as soon as possible after the election7 separate provision of law enacted as part of the federal vacancies reform act of 1998 ngthens during presidential transitions the potential duration of temporary appointment by at least 90 days8 although this provision might give some additional flexibility to an incoming president it might also lengthen the appointment process for some positions by

effort to circumvent their constitutional role some senateconfirmed positions such as many of those in the executive departments may also be temporarily filled under the vacancies act9 senate consideration in the second stage th senate alone determines whether or not to confirm nomination10 the way the senate has acted on nomination has depende d largely on the importance of the position involved existing political circumstances and policy implications generally the senate has shown particular interest in the nominees views and how they are likely to affect public policy11 two other factors have sometimes affected the scrutiny with which nominees personal and professional qualities have been examined whether or not the presidents party controlled the senate and the degree to which the president became involved in supporting the nomination the senate confirmation process has been centered at the committee level committee nomination activity has generally included inve stigation hearing and reporting stages as part of investigatory work committees have drawn on information provided by the white house as well as information they themselves have collected some committees have held hearings on nearly all nominations others have held hearings for only some hearings provide public forum to discuss nomination and any issues related to the program or agency for which the nominee would be responsible even where confir mation has been thought to be virtual certainty hearings have pr ovided senators and the minee with opportunities to go on the record with particular views or commitments senators have used hearings to explore nominees qualifications articulate policy perspectives or raise related oversight issues committee may discontinue acting on

favorably unfavorably or without r ecommendation if the committee elects not to report nomination the nate may under certain circumstances discharge the committee from further consideration of the nomination in order to bring it to the floor12 the senate historically s confirmed most but not all executive nominations rarely however has rejection occurred on the senate floor nearly all rejections have occurred in committee either by committee vote or by committee inaction rejections in committee have occurred for variety of reasons including opposition to the nomination inadequate amount of time for consideration of the nomination or factors that may have nothing to do w ith the merits of the nomination if nomination is not acted upon by the senate by the end of congress it is returned to the president pending nominations also may be returned automatically to the president at the beginning of recess of 30 days or longer but the senate rule providing for this return is often waived13 appointment in the final stage the confirmed nominee is given commission signed by the president with the seal of the united states affixed thereto and is sworn into office the president may sign the commission at any time after confirmation or not at all once the appointee is given the commission and sworn in he or she has full authority to carry out the responsibilities of the office

each recess presidents have occasionally used the recess appointment pow er to circumvent the confirmation process in response c ongress has enacted provisions that restrict the pay of recess appointees under certain circumstances becau most potential appointees to fulltime positions cannot serv without salary the president has an incentive to use his recess appointment authority in ways that allow them to be paid under the provisions if the position falls vacant while the senate is in session and the president fills it by recess appointment the appointee may not be paid from

exceptions must be followed by nomination to the position not later than 40 days after the beginning of the next session of the senate15 for this reason when recess appointment is made the president generally submits new nomination for the nominee even when an old nomination is pending16 these provisions have been interpreted by the department of justice to preclude payment of an appointee who is given successive recess appointments to the same position17 although recess appointees whose nominati ons to full term are subsequently rejected by the senate may continue to serve until the end of their recess appointment recurring provision of the funding bill for the department of the treasury and other agencies may prevent them from being paid after their rejection18 temporary appointments congress has provided limited statutory authority for the temporary filling of vacant positions requiring sena confirmation it is expected that in general officials holding pas positions who have been designated as acting are holding their offices under this authority or other st atutory authority specifi c to their agencies under the federal vacancies reform act of 199819 when an executive agency position requiring confirmation becomes vacan t it may be filled temporarily in one of three ways 1 the first assistant to such position may automatically assume the functions and duties of the office 2 the president may direct an officer in any agency who is occupying position requiring senate confirmati on to perform those tasks or 3 the president may select any officer or employee of the subject agency who is occupying position for which the rate of pay is equal to or greater than the minimum rate of pay at the gs15 level and who has been with the agency for at least 90 of the preceding 365
