products v psks inc successfully asked the supreme court to soften the longstanding treatment of resale price maintenance rpm vertical imposition of direct minimum price restraints as per automatic and not capable of being justified antitrust offense rpm had been so analyzed since the court decided in 1911 that manufacturer of patent medicines could not lawfully agree with retailers of its products on the prices at which those products would be sold dr miles medical company v john d park sons company 220 us 373 such agreements the court had said in dr miles constituted both unlawful restraints of trade under the common law and violations of the sherman acts prohibition against contracts or combinations in restraint of trade 15 usc 1 leegins practice of entering into contracts with its retailers of the brighton line of leather products to set the prices at which the dealers would resell those products wa s challenged by discounting retailer whose replacement shipments were terminated the trial court found per violation of section 1 2004 wl 5254322 and the court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed that decision 171 fedappx 464 2006 leegin argued in the s upreme court that because rpm may sometimes be proconsumer might for example allow the retailers to profitably provide extra services desired by some consumers the practice should not be conclusively presumed unreasonable without elaborate inquiry as to its precise harm or business justification for its use agreeing with leegin the court overruled dr miles stating that allowing rpm to be analyzed as rule of reason violation pursuant to which the procompetitive effects of judicially determined antitrust violation are weighed against the anticompetitive results of the challenged activity should be allowed notwithstanding the risks of unlawful conduct it cannot be stated with any degree of confidence that rpm always tends to restrict competition 551 us ___ 127 sct 2705 2709 2007 quoting

different levels of the supplymarketing chain it generally entails an agreement via formal contract or otherwise between manufacturer and retailer that the dealer will charge some specific price for the manufacturers products as such the agreement is considered conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of section 1 of the sherman act1 the practice particularly when floor has been set under permissible resale prices minimum rpm has been considered per violation of the antitrust laws2 since 1911 when the court decided in dr miles medical company v john d park sons company3 that such imposition and agreement was not analytically different from an agreement among the dealers themselves to fix their prices thus depriving consumers of the advantages of competition imposition of maximum resale prices ceiling on permissible resale prices as opposed to floor below which price is not permissible or some other agreement which may affect price but does not require any specific level or term on the other hand has more recently been analyzed under the more lenient rule of reason standard4 significant inroads in the law of vertical restraints generally were made by three cases decided in the 1970s and 1980s first in continental tv inc v gte sylvania inc the court distinguished between vertically imposed price and nonprice restraints specifically overruling barely 10 yearold and very contentious case5 the sylvania court concluded that it was appropriate given the complex market impact of nonprice vertical restraints to return to the rule of reason analysis for evaluating them 433 us at 51 52 59 then in two dealertermination cases the court further clarified its thinking on the proper dividing line between per vertical price restraints and rule of reason nonprice restraints it required the plaintiff in monsanto v sprayrite service corp to provide evidence of activity on the part of the manufacturer and the nonterminated dealer that tends to exclude the pos sibility that they were acting independently 465 us 752 764 1984 finally in business electronics corp v sharp electronics corp the court determined that neither 1 all of those agreements which affect price because nearly all vertical agreements do nor 2 all of those which contain the word price should be treated as per violations per illegality should be reserved for only those restraints that include some express or implied agreement on price or price levels 485 us 717 719 728 1988 having distinguished between the proper analysis of vertically imposed price and nonprice restraints the court in 1997 imposed further and more direct delineations in the law of vertical 1 15 usc 1 section 1 as are all of the other sections of the antitrust laws is almost constitutionally brief and has been judicially interpreted over the years in thousands of pages of case law 2 pursuant to per analysis court need not look any further than that the action occurred to find violation there can never be any justification ie it isnt possible to convert per offense into reasonable action see n 5 infra with eg it was necessary because 3 220 us 373 1911 he reinafter referred to as dr miles 4 pursuant to the rule of reason despite the finding of an antitrust violation the court may engage in balancing analysis that allows it to consider the reasonableness of the violative action ie whether its competitive harm is outweighed by the procompetitive results if any 5 433 us 36 1977 overruling united states v arnold schwinn co 388 us 365 1967 which had held manufacturerimposed franchiselocation

although maximum rpm might be used to disguise arrangements to fix minimum prices we believe such conduct can be appropriately recognized and punished under the rule of reason notwithstanding that the per treatment of maximum rpm had been in effect for approximately 30 years justice oconnor noted the court had never been confro nted with an unadulterated maximum rpm arrangement and so found the conceptual foundations of that rule to be gravely weakened6

erosion of its precedents in the law of vertical restraintsrpm divided 54 court overruled dr miles the final barrier to the rule of reason treatment of minimum rpm justice kennedy joined by chief justice roberts and justices scalia who had authored the business electronics opinion supra note 1 thomas and alito stated that vertical retailprice agreements have either procompetitive or anticompetitive effects depending on the circumstances in which they were formed and the limited empirical evidence available does not suggest that efficient uses of the agreements are infrequent or hypothetical 127 sct at 2709 therefore the opinion continued per rule should not be adopted for administrative convenience alone such rules can be counterproductive increasing the antitrust systems total cost by prohibiting procompetitive conduct the antitrust laws should encourage and per rule cannot be justified by the possibility of higher prices absent further showing of anticompe titive conduct the antitrust laws primarily are designed to protect interbrand competition from which lower prices can later result ibid in apparent anticipation of its decision to overrule dr miles notwithstanding the doctrine of precedent known as stare decisis which counsels that prior judicial precedents generally should not be upset the opinion devoted number of pages to presentation of its justifications after acknowledging that we do not write on clean slate for the decision in dr miles is almost century old justice kennedy set out the reasons the majority felt it appropriate to abandon stare decisis in this case 127 sct at 2720 his justificat ions included first the fact that even though concerns about maintaining settled law are strong when the question is one of statutory interpretation precedents involving the sherman act present lesser compulsion the general presumption that legislative changes should be left to congress has less force with respect to the sherman act

experience so too does the sherman acts prohibition on restraints of trade evolve to meet the dynamics of present economic conditions 127 sct at 2720 third it would create chronically schizoid statute to have an evolving rule of reason that takes into account new circumstances and new wisdom but leaves an immovable per line that remains forever fixed where it was9 fourth there is ample evidence in economic literature that the per rule is not appropriate for use in any rpm context fifth both the department of justice and the federal trade commission ftcthe antitrust enforcement agencies with the ability to assess the longterm impacts of resale price maintenancehave urged that the distinctions between classes of rpm be abandoned10 finally prior to reviewing its decisions in the cases described in the background portion of this report as well as others it considered relevant the court quoted from 2000 opinion to note that we have overruled our precedents when subsequent cases have undermined their doctrinal underpinnings11 addressing pskss argument that when congress repealed the authorization for state fair trade laws12 it was essentially ratifying the per rule the court replied this is not so the text of the consumer goods pricing act pl 94145 did not codify the rule of per illegality for vertical price restraints it rescinded statutory provisions that made them per legal congress once again placed these restraints within the ambit of 1 of the sherman act congress intended 1 to give courts the ability to develop governing principles of law in the commonlaw tradition 13 the leegin case therefore was remanded to the 5th circuit which in turn remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with the supreme courts opinion 498 f3d 486 5th cir 2007 the dissent written by justice breyer and joined by justices stevens souter and ginsburg took issue with the majoritys justification for its departure from ordinary considerations of stare decisis 127 sct at 2725 although the lawfulness of particular practices is often determined pursuant to the rule of reason they acknowledged there are some practices whose likely anticompetitive consequences are either so serious with so few possible justifications or whose justifications are so difficult to prove that this court has imposed rule of per 9 127 sct at 2721 quoting national society of professional

supra p 2 that the rule of reason should be used to analyze all instances of rpm between the filing of that brief and oral argument in the case william baxter then assistant attorney general in charge

all or nearly all of the time 127 sct at 2726 the upshot of ample economic evidence that rpm can result and has resulted in increased consumer prices14 as well as the other side of the argumentthat rpm can be beneficial to consumers15leads justice breyer to ask such questions as how often are harms or benefits likely to occur how easy is it to separate the beneficial sheep from the antitrust goats 127 sct at 2729 moreover the dissent continued while it is rational to allow economic discussions to inform antitrust analysis there is significant difference between recognizing that economics is discipline which necessarily contains conflicting views and abandoning the necessity for antitrust law to be administered in such way as to provide adequate certainty in the content of rules and precedents to be applied by the courts and used by lawyers advising their clients 127 sct at 2729 the special advantages of brightline rule they suggested also might include the potential unfairness and impracticality of pursuing certain potentially criminal offenses 127 sct at 2731 in its reply to the majoritys assertion that the consumer goods pricing act had not codified the per rule of rpm but rather had merely intended 1 to give courts the ability to develop governing principles of law in the commonlaw tradition the dissent emphasized that congress did not prohibit this court from reconsidering the per rule but enacting major legislation premised upon the existence of that rule constitutes important public reliance upon that rule and doing so aware of the relevant arguments constitutes even stronger reliance upon the courts keeping the rule at least in the absence of some significant change in respect to those arguments 16 finally the dissent argued every relevant factor

assertion that it is more properly to be considered in the realm of commonlaw adjudication therefore the court should accord the deference due stare decisis concerning cases involving statutory interpretation second although the court does sometimes overrule cases that it decided wrongly only reasonably short time ago dr miles is nearly century old not to mention that in overruling dr miles this decision also serves to overrule every case that has followed or applied it 14 including that from the department of justice and the ftc both of whom advocated rule of reason approach in this

with dr miles creates or maintains an unworkable legal regime fourth overruling dr miles unsettles the law to far greater degree than keeping it would fifth the considerable reliance upon the per rule of dr miles that has led to the involvement of property or contract rights in rpm cases argues against overruling that case sixth overruling rule of law that has become embedded in our national culture as has the per rule for rpm is both improper and unwise accordingly justice breyer concluded the only safe predicitions to make about today s decision are that it will likely raise the prices
