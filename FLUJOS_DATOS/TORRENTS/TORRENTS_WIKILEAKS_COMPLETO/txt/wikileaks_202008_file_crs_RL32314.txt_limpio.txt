specialists in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division us thailand free trade agreement negotiations summary president bush and former thai prime minister thaskin on october 19 2003 agreed to negotiate bilateral free trade agreement fta six negotiating rounds took place the most recent january 1013 2006 in thailand us trade officials had hoped to conclude the negotiations by early 2006 but the negotiations were suspended by thailand in february 2006 due to bangkoks political crisis after 18 months of negotiations the two sides were wide apart on number of issues such as financial services liberalization and number of other sensitive issues combined with considerable public opposition to the fta in thailand the bush administration may be hard pressed to complete the negotiation before trade promotion authority expires in mid2007 while the thai government appointed by the military after thailands september 2006 coup remains committed to concluding an fta with the united states it also plans to submit any agreement to the 242 national legislative assembly nla for approval step that deposed prime minister thaskin maintained was not required at this date however there are plans date or venue to resume the negotiations in the notification letter sent to the congressional leadership thenus trade representative robert zoellick put forth an array of commercial and foreign policy gains that could be derived from the agreement the letter stated that an fta would be particularly beneficial to us agricultural producers as well as to us companies exporting goods and services to thailand and investing there mr zoellick also alluded to sensitive issues that would need to be addressed trade in automobiles protection of intellectual property rights and labor and environmental standards thailand has been viewed as strong candidate for an fta with the united states its economy has shown relatively healthy growth in recent years rising by 62 in 2004 and 45 in 2005 yet thailand maintains relatively high tariff and nontariff barriers on number of products and services secondly an fta with thailand would allow us exporters to gain access to thai markets similar to that obtained by other countries through bilateral and plurilateral agreements with thailand third usthailand fta would likely induce other countries to seek trade liberalization agreement with the united states countries that form ftas agree at minimum to phase out or reduce tariff and nontariff barriers ntbs on mutual trade in order to enhance market access between the trading partners the usthailand fta is expected to be comprehensive seeking to liberalize trade in goods agriculture services and investment as well as intellectual property rights other issues such as government procurement competition policy environment and labor standards and customs procedures are also on the negotiating table the usthailand fta negotiations are of interest to congress because 1 an agreement would require passage of implementing legislation to go into effect 2 an agreement could increase us exports of goods services and investment with particular benefits for agricultural exports and 3 an agreement could increase competition for us importcompeting industries such as textiles and apparel and light trucks thereby raising the issue of job losses this

usthailand fta the bush administration notified congress on february 12 2004 that it intends to begin free trade agreement fta negotiations with thailand this notification which follows an october 19 2003 announcement by president bush and former thai prime minister thaskin of their agreement to launch negotiations allows for talks to begin within 90 days or by midmay 2004 after required consultations with congress two negotiating sessions took place in 2004 and third was held april 48 2005 in thailand the fourth and fifth sessions were held july 15 2005 in montana and september 2630 2005 in hawaii the sixth was held in thailand from january 1013 2006 but thailand suspended negotiations on february 24 2006 when it was decided that new election would be held in april since the april election decision has been made yet to resume the negotiations due to ongoing political turmoil the april election was invalidated by the constitutional court and new general election is to take place this fall in the notification letter sent to the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader thenus trade representative robert zoellick put forth an array of potential commercial and foreign policy gains that could be derived from the agreement at the same time mr zoellick alluded to sensitive issues that require attention trade in automobiles protection of intellectual property rights and labor and environmental standards1 zoellicks letter states that an fta would be particularly beneficial to us agricultural producers who have urged the administration to move forward as well as to us companies exporting industrial goods and services for agricultural producers by eliminating or reducing thailands high tariffs and other barriers the fta offers the opportunity to significantly increase export sales to thailand in 2005 thailand was the 16th largest market for us farm exports the administration also argued that an fta would help boost us exports of goods and services in sectors such as information technology telecommunications financial services audiovisual automotive and medical equipment in 2005 us companies exported to thailand 74 billion in goods and over 1 billion in services maintaining preferential access for us investors in thailand is also top priority for us business given that thailand is relatively small economy compared to 1 inside us trade ustr zoellick notifies congress of intent to negotiate free trade pact with thailand february 19 2004 crs2 the united states 1100th the size the agreement by itself will have limited effects on the overall us economy from the standpoint of us foreign policy interests the administration views the proposed fta as strengthening cooperation with thailand in bilateral regional and multilateral fora bilaterally the fta is seen as strengthening thailands position as key military ally particularly in the war on terrorism regionally the fta is viewed as advancing president bushs enterprise for asean initiative eai the goal of the eai is to negotiate network of bilateral trade agreements with the 10 members of asean2 multilaterally thailand plays key leadership role in the world trade organization wto an fta could encourage thailand to actively cooperate with the united states in supporting multilateral trade negotiations under the aegis of the doha development agenda particularly in the area of agricultural liberalization as for thailand similar broad economic and political calculations explain its interest in an fta in economic terms thailand is very concerned that its exports to the united states have been losing market share in recent years to countries such as mexico and china by eliminating us tariff and nontariff barriers to thai exports an fta could help increase the competitiveness and market share of thai products in the us market thailand also does not want to be excluded from fta benefits the us has negotiated with other countries particularly the potential of an fta to increase us investment in thailand modernization of the services economy and diffusion of higher levels of technology knowhow and labor management skills are essential for the thai economy to advance beyond the competition from lower wage emerging market economies such as china vietnam and laos in addition closer political and economic relationship with the united states could provide thailand with more leverage to play larger role in southeast asia general opposition to the fta in both countries is expected from workers and companies in importcompeting industries that bear the brunt of the adjustment costs of trade agreement despite the welfare gains to society as whole eg more efficient resource allocation lower priced imports and greater selection of goods those industries subject to increased competition face additional pressure to cut costs wages and prices some companies may not be able to withstand these pressure and may be forced out of business accompanied by loss of jobs under these circumstances certain stakeholders as matter of selfinterest may oppose trade agreements that accelerate competition and structural changes in an economy specific opposition in thailand has arisen from stakeholders in the agricultural and services sectors given that close to 50 percent of the thai labor force is employed in agriculture liberalization of this sector has been contentious similarly in number of services sectors thai companies feel they are at competitive disadvantage in opening up to us competitors thailands banking and financial services industry in particular is wary of further liberalization after the financial 2 asean is the association of southeast asian nations members include brunei indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore cambodia laos myanmar burma vietnam and thailand crs3 crisis of 1997 thai stakeholders are also particularly wary given the high incidence of aids infections in us efforts to secure data exclusivity for patented pharmaceuticals in addition number of thai business interests reportedly are concerned over potential us investment in newly privatized companies such as the electricity generating authority of thailand and the mass rapid transit authority opposition in the united states may arise from groups concerned about the impact of the trade agreement on labor and environmental standards often joined by antiglobalization activists these interest groups question whether trade agreements enhance the social welfare of participating countries other issues such as transparency in government decisionmaking human rights and freedom of the press could also be raised increased market access for thai agricultural products such as rice and sugar as well as reduction of the 25 us tariff on lightweight pickup trucks is already controversial in addition thailand is persistent opponent and critic of us trade remedy laws which many us interests groups dont want to see weakened in short competing viewpoints have surfaced regarding the desirability of an fta as in most ftas that the united states has negotiated the distribution of gains and losses would depend on the details of the provisions as background for congressional oversight this report examines thailands economy and trade orientation the scope and significance of the usthai commercial relationship and the likely top issues in the negotiations the report concludes with short summary of the congressional role and interest in the fta thailands economy and trade orientation thailand was severely affected by the asian financial crisis which hit the thai economy in july 1997 and subsequently affected several other east asian economies the economic crisis in thailand was characterized by significant depreciation of its currency the baht depletion of nearly all of thailands foreign exchange reserves decline in the stock market bankruptcies among number of major thai banks and corporations and sharp deterioration of property prices the combination of these shocks led to sharp economic downturn ten years prior to the 1997 crisis thailand had been one of the worlds fastest growing economies between 1990 and 1996 gross domestic product gdp averaged 86 fueled in large part by rapid export growth however in 1998 gdp fell by 105 while exports and imports dropped by 67 and 330 respectively over 1997 levels see table 1 in addition the unemployment rate rose from 32 in 1997 to 73 in 1998 and living standards measured according to per capita gdp measured on purchasing power parity basis plummeted by 113 3 purchasing power parity ppp measurements attempt to convert foreign currencies into us dollars based on the actual purchasing power of such currency derived from surveys on domestic prices in each respective country they thus give more accurate measurement of the size of countrys economy and living standards relative to those in the continued crs4 thailands economy was stabilized by 172 billion loan from the international monetary fund real gdp grew by 44 in 1999 and by 48 in 2000 but slowed to 22 in 2001 public dissatisfaction in thailand with the way the government was

economic initiatives designed to stabilize the economy boost domestic demand encourage the growth of small and medium sized businesses and improve rural incomes thailands economy experienced relatively strong growth from 20022004 real gdp growth averaged 62 real gdp growth was more modest in 2005 at 45 due to number of factors including the december 2004 tsunami higher energy prices rising inflation concerns over the avian influenza bird flu and domestic insurgencies global insight an international economic forecasting firm estimates thailands real gdp will rise by 46 in 2006 and

agricultural subsidy programs contending that they give us farmers an unfair competitive advantage in addition thailand has participated in two wto dispute resolution cases against the united states us antidumping subsidy offsets the byrd amendment and us restrictions on shrimp imports while the united states has not filed any cases against thailand in the wto it has pressed thailand to liberalize its trade and investment regimes and to improve protection of us intellectual property rights ipr issues in the fta negotiations countries that form ftas agree at minimum to phase out tariff and nontariff barriers ntbs on mutual trade in goods in order to enhance market access between trading partners most us ftas including nafta and agreements with chile and singapore are more comprehensive because the us thailand fta is being modeled on the singapore fta sector product or functional issue can expect to be excluded from the liberalization process this approach is favored by many members of congress as result the negotiation is covering trade in goods and services agriculture investment and intellectual property rights as well as other issues such as government procurement competition policy and customs procedures 6 estimated based on data for januarynovember 2005 crs7 trade in goods tariffs are the major barrier to liberalized trade in goods thailands reliance on import licensing opaque customs procedures and excise taxes are also issues the us is addressing thailands simple average applied tariff rate of about 13 for nonagricultural imports provides relatively high level of protection7 many thai tariff rates are much higher than the average and tend to be applied to imports competing with locally produced products these include tariffs on autos and auto parts alcoholic beverages fabrics footwear and headgear and some electrical appliances for example the tariff on passenger cars and sport utility vehicles is 80 the tariff on motorcycles 60 and the tariff on completely knocked down ckd auto kits 33 tariffs on fabrics range from 2540 beyond cuts in tariffs market access for us goods could be improved by reducing excessive paperwork and undue processing delays in thai customs procedures in addition import licensing requirements on various items remains opaque and can sometimes serve as quantitative restriction us tariffs imposed on thai nonagricultural exports are relatively low averaging around 23 but us tariffs on some items such as textiles and apparel and light trucks are much higher thai concerns may also focus on us trade remedy measures such as use of antidumping and countervailing duty procedures to protect us industry agricultural trade the united states and thailand are important trading partners in agricultural products but the us market is more important for thailand than the thai market is for us exporters the united states is the second largest market for thai agricultural exports and thailand is the fourth largest supplier of us agricultural imports at the same time even though the united states has been the largest supplier of thailands agricultural imports thailand ranks only as the 16th largest market for us agricultural exports8 the total value of bilateral farm trade was about 12 billion in 2002 with the us running 377 million deficit the major thai exports to the united

oil seeds cotton cereals especially wheat soybean oil and cake9 thaius agricultural trade is more restricted than trade in manufactured goods both countries impose higher tariffs on agricultural products than on manufactured goods the thai average mfn applied tariff on agricultural products is about 24 percent compared to about 7 for the united states10 more than 43 of the thai tariff lines for agricultural products have applied rates exceeding 20 compared to only 13 of the us tariff lines consumer ready products meats fresh fruits and vegetables face tariffs ranging from 4060 excise taxes and surcharges licensing fees and labeling and certification standards can further boost the tax burden considerably11 us fruit growers estimate lost sales of up to 25 million annually from the combined effect of thailands high tariffs and surcharge12 other us exports that could benefit from liberalization include meat and dairy products sugar alcoholic beverages and tobacco us tariff rates that thailand may want to see reduced include vegetables and fruits with tariff rates exceeding 10 pineapples with tariff rate of 29 and fish and fish products with tariff rate of 26 thailand which is the worlds third largest producer of sugar will also seek substantial liberalization of the us sugar quotas13 since agricultural barriers are higher than nonagricultural barriers liberalization could boost trade more in agricultural products than in manufactured goods us farm groups estimate that potential us agricultural exports to thailand could increase by around 300 million annually if thailands tariffs and other trade distorting measures were substantially reduced14 similar large increases in thai agricultural exports to the united states can be expected if substantial liberalization occurs intellectual property rights deficiencies in thai protection of us ipr such as patents copyrights and trademarks have been longstanding us concern the ustrs 2005 special 301 report acknowledged that thailand had taken number of measures in 2004 to improve ipr protection such as conducting raids on illegal production facilities but expressed concern over transshipments of illegal ipr products through thailand and the continued high piracy rates of copyrighted materials such as optical disks 9 tdri study p 43 10 tdri study p44 11 tdri study p 55 12 office of the us

president eric smith stated the thai government harbors dozens of cd plants capable of producing over 400 million discs per year more than seven times any justifiable legitimate domestic demand it is clear thailand has become major exporter of pirate discs15 in deference to these concerns thenus trade representative zoellick in announcing the intention to begin negotiations recognized their concerns about the deficiencies in thailands protection of intellectual property and in its customs regime addressing these issues as well as other areas such as strengthening measures against the production of illegal optical discs will be essential for the successful conclusion of these negotiations16 in august 2005 the thai government reportedly implemented new regulations that would enforce stringent restrictions on the sale and transfer of cd production equipment in order to combat piracy all cds will be required to display mark certifying manufacture issued by the government17 trade in services services such as commerce wholesale and retail trade transportation telecommunications and finance account for growing share of economic activity in thailand in 2002 services accounted for about 55 of gdp and about 40 of employment large share of foreign investment goes into services especially in finance and retail trade18 us negotiating objectives are likely to include improvements in access for us providers of financial telecommunications and professional services and other sectors liberalization of these sectors is likely to be accompanied by improvements in thailands regulatory environment as well as capacity to oversee and insure effective competition in pursuing these objectives us negotiators are insisting on according greater market access across each others entire services sector subject to few exceptions that must be in writing this socalled negative list approach was used in the singapore fta and is supported by many members of congress exceptions in the

security public hospitals government corporations or involve national policy atomic energy19 major financial institutions in thailand include the central bank commercial banks finance companies securities companies and insurance companies following the 1997 asian financial crisis thailand increasingly deregulated and liberalized access of foreign firms to its financial sector for example foreign equity limits were relaxed for ten years to allow foreign ownership of up to 100 previously 25 in commercial banks and finance companies however new capital invested in these companies after the tenyear period must be provided by domestic investors until foreignheld equity share falls to 49 other restrictions concerning the number branches foreign banks may operate as well as limits on the number of expatriate professionals that can be employed could also be raised in the negotiations similarly in the area of brokerage services foreign firms are allowed to own shares greater than 49 of thai securities firms only on casebycase basis20 thailands communications market is characterized by limited competition and relatively high prices while thailand has committed to open up telecommunications services to direct foreign competition by early 2006 the reform process has lagged although the thai government has allowed foreign participation in the telecommunications sector since 1989 the market is still dominated by two state owned companies the communications authority of thailand which controls international services and the tot corporation and public company limited which controls domestic services few private sector companies have been awarded concessions by the thai government to provide wireless and fixedline services pending establishment of national telecommunications commission to serve as an independent regulator deregulation and full liberalization of the telecommunications market is likely to be difficult21 liberalization of other services such as legal construction architecture engineering and accounting are also us negotiating objectives various thai laws currently make it very difficult for foreignowned companies and nationals to operate in these industries22 investment the united states has an investment agreement with thailand under the 1966 treaty of amity and economic relations aer the treaty accords the same rights to us and thai citizens and companies to own and operate in each others territory with the exception of professional services and several sectors such as communications transportation and depository banking

22 office of the united states trade representative 2002 trade barriers report pp 377 378 crs11 initially the aer provided few benefits to us investors because thailand at the time had few laws and regulations restricting foreign investment over time however thailand instituted new laws and regulations that limited foreign nationals operations in thailand as result the legal treatment accorded by the 1966 treaty became preferences extended only to us investors consequently the aer came to violate thailands wto obligations to accord equal treatment to all member states thailand received an exemption from the wto for ten years but the exemption expired in january 2005 the fta negotiations may consider ways to construct bilateral investment agreement that is wtoconsistent but still retains current privileges for us companies and nationals with over 1200 us companies currently taking advantage of the rights protected by the aer the issue is top priority for the us business community23 us negotiators may also make establishment of special investorstate dispute mechanism priority objective such mechanism could ensure neutral and binding thirdparty resolution of disputes involving foreign investors and the host country thailands plans for reforming and privatizing number of stateowned companies continues to be matter of great interest to foreign investors the thai governments plan to overhaul stateowned telecommunications energy and transport companies has encountered widespread opposition from labor unions causing indefinite delays in planned share offerings of the electricity generating authority of thailand thailands largest stateowned company24 status of fta negotiations the two sides completed their sixth round of fta negotiations in chiang mai thailand on january 1013 2006 while us negotiators stated that some progress was made they expressed disappointment over the lack of progress in the talks major stumbling blocks reportedly include us proposals on ipr25 and liberalization of the services sector including distribution financial services such as banking insurance and securities brokerage and telecommunications thai officials have sought to reduce high us tariffs on light trucks 25 and restrictions on sugar imports in addition the january 2006 fta talks were reportedly temporarily disrupted by an estimated 10000 thai protesters on january 19 2006 thailands lead negotiator in the usthailand fta talks nitya pibulsonggram resigned press reports stated that the resignation was induced in part by political opposition to the fta by various groups in march 2006 thailand suspended the negotiations pending the outcome of the snap april general election which was 23 tdri study p 103 24 crispin shawn w thailands drive to privatize hits few hurdles wall street journal march 11 2004 p 7 25 one concern expressed by thai opponents to the fta is that us efforts to obtain stronger ipr protection on patents will prevent thailand from gaining access to low cost drugs such as those used by hivaids patients us negotiators deny this would occur crs12 subsequently invalidated by constitutional court with new general election scheduled for this fall the fta negotiations remain suspended thus it appears that even if they were to restart unexpectedly before the election it is unlikely an agreement could be completed in time to be considered under the current trade promotion authority statute which expires on july 1 2007 congress and the usthailand fta the usthailand fta negotiations are of interest to congress because 1 an agreement would require passage of implementing legislation to become operational 2 an agreement could increase us exports of goods services and investment 3 an agreement could increase competition for us importcompeting industries such as textiles and apparel and pickup trucks and 4 if an agreement is implemented thailand would become the second asian fta partner the first was singapore for the united states many members of congress support an aggressive fta strategy because of the potential to open foreign markets further to us exports and investment while the administrations policy of negotiating multiple ftas has not been very controversial some members have expressed concerns that the administrations criteria for deciding on fta partners has relied too heavily on foreign policy considerations in the case of thailand however the same members welcomed the announcement of the thailand fta because thailand represents relatively large market that offers significant commercial gains particularly to us agricultural producers26 at the same time some congressional concern has surfaced in regard to automotive trade centered on the impact that reduction of the current 25 us tariff on pickup trucks could have on imports and us jobs auto companies based in thailand produce more than 500000 pickups year making the country the worlds second largest producer none of these vehicles however are exported to the united states but the united auto workers argue that if the 25 tariff were removed some 80000 auto jobs would be jeopardized more than million pick ups are currently produced in the united states senators george voinovich roh and carl levin dmi cochairs of the senate auto caucus in november 12 2003 letter urged the bush administration to retain the 25 tariff out of concern that its elimination would open the door for japan to export trucks from thailand to the united states similar letter was signed by the chairs of the house auto caucus representatives dale kildee dmi and fred upton rmi27 on the senate side group of 40 senators 36 democrats and 4 republicans sent similar letter to us trade officials on march 18 2005 26 inside us trade bush announces fta with thailand as it puts g21 at distance october 24 2003 27 inside us trade us seeks thailand fta despite opposition on ipr autos may pose problem february 20 2004 crs13 different approach to this concern is embodied in sconres 90 introduced by senators levin and voinovich on february 23 2004 and hconres 366 introduced february 24 2004 by representatives kildee quinn and levin because japan and other countries could benefit from bilateral concessions agreed to between the united states and thailand the resolutions maintain that negotiations affecting access to the us automotive market should only take place if all major automobile producing countries participate one house ways and means committee member phil english announced on june 8 2006 that he would not support the fta if it were brought to congress english said that thailand continues to demonstrate that it does not share common views with the united states with respect to the world trade organization and countrys right to police its markets effectively from predatory or illegally traded imports28 other members of congress may wish to consider how usthai fta could affect us commercial relations in asia in general particularly in light of the trend among asian countries for bilateral trade agreements chinas growing economic role in asia and its quest for new markets materials and trade deals is pushing almost every other major asian country including japan and south korea to consider ftas with each other29 given the increased competition the usasean business council has called for vigorous timetable for the completion of the usthai fta talks and designation of the next asean country with which the united states will seek an fta30 accordingly us trade strategy toward the
