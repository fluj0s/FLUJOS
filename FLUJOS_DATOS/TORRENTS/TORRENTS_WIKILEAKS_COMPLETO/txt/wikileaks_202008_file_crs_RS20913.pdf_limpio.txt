division updated may 31 2002 abstract congress is now examining options for reauthorizing major farm programs that expire in 2002 many agricultural interests are urging that new countercyclical assistance program be an integral component of future farm policy although various countercyclical proposals diﬀer in detail they all share common objective to provide more government support when farm prices andor incomes decline and less support when they improvehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20913congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rs20913 updated may 31 2002 farm countercyclical assistance geoffrey s becker and jasper womach specialists in agricultural policy resources science and industry division summary congress has approved legislation pl 107171 reauthorizing major farm income and commodity price support programs th rough crop year 2007 this legislation includes new countercyclical assistance programs for grains cotton oilseeds peanuts and milk the intent of counte rcyclical assistance is to provide more government support when farm prices and or incomes decline and less support when they improve in fact farmers have for many years been eligible for various forms of countercyclical assistance at issue has been the need for and potential impacts of another countercyclical program this report will not be updated background farming often is characterized as cyclical business with exaggerated price swings that are destabilizing farmers respond to high prices by boosting output however when prices drop farmers are not quick to cut back production they are more likely to operate at loss and draw down resources contributing to the unstable nature of the farm economy are the weather export demand currency exchange rate fluctuations and the farm support and export subsidy programs of foreign competitors typically farmers do not view the eventual selfcorrecting character of commodity prices and production with the same equanimity as economists in fact us producers of the major crops have asked for and recei ved federal intervention including various forms of countercyclical assi stance to support their commodity prices and incomes for nearly the past 70 years between 1973 and 1995 prominent form of countercyclical aid was deficiency payments linked to target prices congre ss specified for each major crop an annual per unit target price eg 4 per bushel for wheat if as often occurred the market price was below the target price eligible producers received deficiency payment to make up the difference this aid was ended by the federal agriculture im provement and reform fair act of 1996 pl 104127httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20913crs2 provisions of the 1996 law under title i of the 1996 act fixed produc tion flexibility contract pfc payments replaced target price deficiency payments these payments were intended to provide over 7 years total of about 36 billion to eligible producers or landowners the pfc payments were not linked to either current production or pr ices by design lawmakers intended that these fixed payments along with the ability to make unconstrained planting decisions would cause the mark etplace rather than subsidies to guide farmers production choices however the 1996 law did continue anot her form of countercyclical support marketing assistance loans producers coul d and under the new 2002 law continue to pledge their stored grain cotton or oilseed s as collateral for us department of agriculture usda nonrecourse commodity loan after harvest these loans are based on perunit bushel pound rate in earlier years these nonrecourse loans were set higher than market prices in order to support farm incomes and farmers forfe ited the commodities pledged as collateral at the end of the loan term about 9 months under the more recent design farmers can repay the nonrecourse marketing assistance loans at less than the original loan rate when market prices are lower than that an rate the difference between the usda loan rate and the lower repayment rate times the number of bushe ls under loan constitutes the federal subsidy in addition those produ cers who choose not take out usda commodity loans can instead receive the equivalent subsidy as direct payment called loan deficiency payment ldp the federal subs idy either loan gain or ldp increases as market prices drop below the loan rate and the subsidy diminishes as prices rise thus the countercyclical nature of the marketing loan program when the 1996 farm b ill was passed commodity prices were relatively high and policymakers widely anticipated that the pf c payments when combined with whatever was earned from the market would provide fficient income to producers marketing loans were set at relatively low rates so that they only would be needed as safety net if prices declined relatively steeply howeve r by the late 1990s major commodity prices declined even more than expected and genera lly did not recover to what farmers regarded as acceptable levels as result they relied heavily on marketing loan benefits which went from zero in fy1996 to high of ove r 8 billion in fy2000 the cost has declined somewhat since then congress determined that the safety ne t provided by the 1996 fair act ie marketing assistance loans and fixed pfc pa yments was inadequate and supplemented the benefits with additional emergency market loss payments these payments mainly to pfc enrollees added about 3 b illion in fy1999 11 billi on in fy 2000 nd 55 billion in fy2001 to program costs these supplemental payments also can be characterized as countercycli cal even though they are ad hoc and not programmed into standing law because they were made according to the sponsors in response to low prices and incomeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20913crs3 the new countercyclical programs nearly all of the numerous farm and comm odity organizations that testified before the house and senate agriculture committees in 2001 requested that additional counter cyclical support be developed as supplement to the current marketing assistance loans and fixed annual payments in response th separate farm bills passed in october 2001 by the house and february 2002 by the nate incorporated new countercyclical measures into standing law thus congre ss presumably would l onger have to debate and enact periodic emergency ad hoc assistance the final farm bill the farm security and rural investment act fsria of 2002 hr 2646 pl 107171 provides new longt erm countercyclical support for grains and cotton by restoring target prices and ficiency payments similar in some respects to the program terminated by the 1996 act what are now calle d annual pfc payments are replaced with fixed direct payments to farmers both types of payments will be available to producers with annual agreemen ts with usda in addition the measure maintains marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments as they now function with changes in most loan rates the new law which covers the 20022007 cr op years brings soybeans and the minor oilseeds eg sunflowers etc fully under th support program rules that apply to grains and cotton in major departure from th past fsria redesigns peanut support to operate like that for grains oilseeds and co tton instead of the traditional system of peanut marketing quotas and nonrecourse price support loans under the new law fixed payments and target price deficiency payments will be paid on 85 of each farms base production base acres times base yield of each commodity farmer may choose as ba production either the acreage used for pfc payments or average acres planted to eligible crops from 1998 through 2001 yields effectively are the 198185 averages except that for counte rcyclical payments yields also can be updated under statutorilyprescribed formula key difference between the new target price payments and those made until 1995 is that the old payments were tied to an nual planting rules ie an acreage reduction program the new system is not continge nt upon such rules payments are based upon historical not current produc tion and farmers can plant virtually any crops except most fruits and vegetables under the new countercyclical program the deficiency payment rate will be calculated as the difference between the target price and the lower average season market price but not to exceed the difference between the target price and the sum of the loan rate and fixed payment see table 1 for rates an individual may receive more than 130000 per year in countercyclical assistance milk support would continue under fsria through government purchases of nonfat dry milk butter and cheese however it has an added feature of countercyclical payments dairy farmers nationwide will be eligible for national dairy market loss payments whenever the minimum monthly market price for farm milk used for fluid consumption in boston falls below 1694 per hundr edweight cwt in order to receivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20913crs4 payment dairy farmer must enter into contract with the secretary of agriculture the value of the payment equals 45 of the difference between the 1694 per cwt target price in any month that the boston mark et price falls below 1694 producer can receive payment on all milk production dur ing that month but payments will be made on any annual producti on in excess of 24 million pounds per dairy operation all contracts expire on september 30 2005 see

some years nanot applicable whereas the final farm bill ties the ava ilability of counterc yclical assistance to target prices for specified commodities other designs also were discussed for example one plan would have triggered payments in state whenever state as opposed to national gross cash receipts for any of eight program or oilseed crops are forecast for the year to be less than 94 of that states annual average cash receipts for the crop during 19961999 cash r eceipts would be defined as the national average price times statelevel pr oduction those who produced the crop during 19982000 would be eligible for share of total payments american farm bureau federation another would have established national target income for each major crop that is the national average annual market value of the crop during 19962000 plus the annual average of any marketing loan bene fits and market loss assistance payments made during those years further adjus tment would be made to account for yield

production times the average price for the firs t 3 months of the marketing year are below the national target income for the crop national corn growers association cost the congressional budget office cbo has estimated the commodity support provisions title i of fsria at 989 billi on over 6 years budget authority march 2002 estimate fy20022007 this is 376 billion mo re than the baseline policy of simply extending current programs into the future the new countercyclical payments for grains cotton and oilseeds account for 236 b illion of the new costs ie above baseline the peanut and dairy counterc yclical payments are projected to cost respectively another 904 million and 963 million however such cost estimates are speculative due to the extreme difficulty of predicting future market conditions including prices if prices are lower than cbos assumptions then costs will be higher and vice versa some other analysts already have differing projections for example the food and agricultural po licy research institute fapri at the university of missouri estimates that the to tal cost of the dairy program alone could exceed 36 billion thats mainly because fapri projects significantly lower market prices for milk than cbo over the 46month life of the program cbo estimates that the average monthly payment rate over the 46m onth life of the program will be about 045 per cwt fapri estimates an average monthly payment rate of 089 per cwt see also what is the cost of the 2002 farm bill in the crs electronic briefing book on agriculture policy and the farm bill international trade obligations the 1994 uruguay round agreement on agri culture uraa obligates countries to discipline their agricultural subsidy programs and reduce import barriers in order to promote more open trade under the uraa the united states is committed to providing subsidies of more than 191 billion per year through domestic farm policies with the most potential to distor t production and trade the uraa contains detailed rules for how countries should determine which of their programs must be counted toward their assigned subsidy limits eg 191 billion for the united states generally however pr ograms that are tied to current prices or current production must be counted these are called amber box policies thus marketing loan gains which rise when crop prices decline and vice versa are amber and must be counted but only if their valu along with other subsidies exceeds 5 of the value of annual pr oduction of that crop on the other hand subsidies that are not linked to prices or production andor meet other specified criteria might be exempted as green box policies the united states has classified its pfc payments as green b ecause they are made without regard to prices or current production it is anticipated the fixed decoupled payments in the new law also will fall within the green boxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20913crs6 the new countercyclical assistan ce will be decoupled from current output because the producer would not have to produce any particular crop now to receive the payments however because like marketing loan gains the target price deficiency payments would be triggered by current market prices they are expected to be placed in the amber box so they conclude if counte rcyclical payments when adde d to other amber subsidies such as marketing loan benefits caused u s spending to exceed 191 billion the united states could be in violation of its world trade commitments whether that would happen is unclear in part because of the difficulty of predicting future market prices but also because of the technicalities involved in cla ssifying and valuing subsidies under the wto system circuit breaker language in fsria is intended to require usda to keep trade distorting farm subsidies at or below th 191 billion limit questions arise about the administrative economic and political implications of changing ie reducing benefits particularly after they are announced andor awarded see crs report rl30612 farm support programs and world trade commitments some groups had argued that their own c ountercyclical policie s could be designed in way that they would not have to be counted toward the 191 billion limit for example if payments to farmers were triggered by low income as measured by gross receipts for one or more commodities rather than by low prices they would be exempt it has been argued others dispute this asse rtion noting that it is usually low prices that cause low income equity issues the new countercyclical aid in the 2002 law focuses on the major commodities grains cotton oilseeds peanuts and mil k these generally are the most widely produced but that still leaves much of us agriculture ineligible for such payments raising questions of equity among commodities and of the potential for distorting production toward items that might receiv more support contributing to surplus production but extending such aid to more commodities such as fruits vegetables or livestock also would have incr eased federal costs or else reduced assistance levels for the major commodities also not all commod ity groups sought such aid for example the national cattleme ns beef association was among those that opposed most forms of direct assistance counte rcyclical or otherwise and the united fresh fruit and vegetable association argued against any subsidies that would insulate fruit or vegetable producers from market signals or w ould sustain or encourage production another issue was whether new counterc yclical program should perpetuate past patterns that tie aid to output rather than ec onomic need farm programs including direct payments marketing loans and the ad hoc market loss payments have been based on either past or current produc tion by individual farmers m eaning that larger payments have trended toward larger operations wh ich do not or should not need them critics argue they add that if congress intends to help producers in economic distress then such recipients should have to document thei r need others counter that farm programs are not welfare but rather part of larger policy to ensure that us agriculture remains competitive in the global economy an assertion that cr itics challenge
