koitz domestic social policy division updated march 21 2001 abstract social security beneﬁts are not paid for the month in which recipient dies legislation is routinely introduced that would either pay the full amount of the beneﬁts for the month of death or prorate the beneﬁts based on the proportion of the month that the recipient was alivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs93792 order code 93792 updated may 29 2008 social security benefits are not paid for the month of death dawn nuschler domestic social policy division summary social security benefits are not paid fo r the month in which recipient dies in most instances the check an individual receives in given month represents payment for the preceding month in other words by design the check or direct bank deposit arrives after the month for which it applies in situations where recipient dies late in the month the social security administrati on often is not notified of the death in time to stop the payment when family members are informed that the check must be returned they often complain that the policy is unfair and creates financial hardship because the deceased recipient incurred expens for part or even most of the month legislation is introduced routinely that would pay full benefit for the month of death or prorate the benef it based on the proportion of the month that the recipient was alive supporters of the legislation argue that withholding benefits for the month of death does not make sense given that persons bills do not stop at the beginning of the month in which they die they argue that the public views the policy as anomalous in system designed to provide monthly income to retirees the disabled and survivors of deceased workers critics of the legislation ar gue that paying full benefits for the month of death would cost an estimated 16 billion annually excluding administrative costs they point out that deceas ed recipients spouse and children can collect survivor benefits for the month of death regardless of when the death occurred that survivors may be entitled to 255 lumpsum death payment and that those seeking to have benefits paid for the month of death have little appreciation for the administrative difficulties involved in deter mining who should get the more than 2 million final benefit checks issued each year background section 202 of the social security act stat that benefits are paid up through the month before the month in which recipient dies thus benefits are paid for the month of death this rule has been in the law since 1939 the rule does not apply to medicare in which benefits are pr ovided up to the date of deathhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs93792crs2 1 for related legislation in the 110th congress see hr 1380 social security benefits fairness act of 2007 and hr 1668 proporti onate final benefit act of 2007social security benefits are paid on monthly basis the check or direct deposit for each months benefit is issued in the following month for example the check that an individual receives in february is for the benefit payable for january this is referred to as retrospective payment system if recipient dies late in the month family members or the executor of the estate may not notify the social security administration ssa in time to stop the payment subsequently they are informed that the check must be returned to the government member s of congress are asked often to support legislation that would provide full or partial benefit payment for the month of death1 arguments for and against paying benefits for the month of death arguments for changing the current policy critics of the current policy argue that withholding benefits for the mo nth of death does not make sense they maintain that persons bills do not stop at the beginning of the month in which they die moreover the deceased recipients family memb ers or estate have to pay funeral and burial expenses the unfairness of the policy is often illustrated with comparison of the individual who dies on the last day of the month and receives benefit for that month and the individual who dies at 1205 am the next day and receives full benefit for the preceding month critics complain that the current policy is cruel in that it adversely affects individuals who are already distressed by the death of family member they find the circumstances in which check must be returned to the government to be the most incomprehensible persons who are ffected often ask questions such as do you mean my father or mother had to live each day of their final month to get benefit for that month why are family members placed at dis advantage when recipient dies at the end of the month after having incurred liv ing expenses throughout most of the month how could the government have established such policy critics contend that the public views the policy as an anomaly as mistake in the design of the social security system if the policy was intended to reduce th cost of the system they see it as poor device to do so they argue that the policy discredits the system by creating the impression that it is arbitrary unbending nd thoughtlessly bureaucra tic they maintain that benefits should be paid at least for the part of the month that the recipient was alive arguments for retaining the current policy supporters of the current policy argue that paying benefits for the month of death would be costly ssa estimates that paying full benefits for the month of death would cost 16 billion annually alternatively paying 50 of the benefit if the recipient dies in the first half of the month and full benefit if the recipient dies in the second half of the month would cost an estimated 12 billion annually pr orating the benefit based on the number of days the recipient was alive during the final month would cost an estimated 800 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs93792crs3 2 ssa estimates are unpublished data for 2002 estim ates reflect an increase in benefit payments only they do not take into account an increase in administrative costs as result of the policy change estimates assume change in auxiliary benefits 3 ssa estimates prepared in 2003 assume the pr oposal would be effective for deaths after 2003 and are based on the intermediate assumptions of the 2003 social security trustees report under the proposal the increase in benefit paymen ts would be subject to the family maximum 4 data on the number of benefits terminated by reason for termination including death are published in ssas annual statistical supplement 2007 table 6f2 see httpwwwsocial securitygovpolicydocsstatco mpssupplement20076fpdf in cases where lumpsum death payment is made under current law the process of determining the proper payees would be less difficult other cases would requi re more thorough investigationannually2 ssa also estimated the increase in be nefit payments under proposal in which 1 full benefit for the month of death w ould be payable to surviving spouse the surviving spouse would not be required to have been living with the recipient when the death occurred or be entitled to benefits or 2 if there is surviving spouse prorated benefit based on the number of days the person was alive during the final month would be payable ssa estimates that the propos would increase benefit payments by 132 billion over the 10year period 200420133 supporters of the current policy also point out that the system pays benefits to an indi vidual beginning with his or her first month of entitlement regardless of when entitlement began during the month and that this provides rough balance in the system for not paying benefits for the month of death moreover survivor benefits are payabl to eligible family member s beginning with the deceased recipients month of death regardless of wh the death occurred during the month in addition the spouse who was living with the wo rker or spouse or child eligible for survivor benefits may receive lumpsum death payment of 255 they contend that there is little appreciation for the administra tive difficulties and potential costs involved in determining who should get the d eceased recipients benefit for the month of death ssa cannot simply mail check to the deceased recipient rather ssa would have to determine who should receive the payment because more than 2 million recipients die each year this would require laborintensive process simila r to the taking of regular benefit applications each case would have to be investigated and if there are multiple family members the payment may have to be split careful attention would have to be given to determining the proper payees in each case4
