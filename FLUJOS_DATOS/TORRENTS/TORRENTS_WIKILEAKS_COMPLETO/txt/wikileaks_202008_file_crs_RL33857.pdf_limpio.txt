franco specialist in social legislation domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33857methamphetamine background prevalence and federal drug control policies summary methamphetamine has risen to the top of the american drugpolicy agenda for most of its history it was regarded in law and public opinion as secondary or regional concern different fro m and less damaging than th drugs heroin cocaine and marijuana that have defined the focu s of national drug policy more recently however as the production trafficking nd use of methamphetamine have spread gathering consensus has come to regard it as one of the most dangerous substances available in illegal markets methamphetamines dangers including the devastating impact of the drug on child welfare and health care systems in blighted communities the risk of fires and explosions and the environmental contamination resulting from illicit manufacture of the drug and the rapid increase in foreign suppliers of the drug are likely to keep this drug problem at the forefront of the congressional agenda existing evidence of the pattern of methamphetamine abuse and the effectiveness of alternative responses to its abuse are in some cases highly imperfect and policymaking in this field remains an exercise in decision making under uncertainty there is however little doubt that methamphetamine use has risen significantly since the early 1990s indeed this trend arguably is the most important change in drug consumption patterns since the crack cocaine epidemic of the late 1980s and early 1990s the prospect of in creased methamphetamine use is major concern for the future during the 109th congress more than 25 bills were introduced to address the methamphetamine problem including its implications for public health

drugpolicy agenda for most of its history it was regarded in law and public opinion as secondary or regional concern different fro m and less damaging than th drugs heroin cocaine and marijuana that have defined the fo cus of national drug policy the issue before congress is how to effectively disrupt the illicit manufacture trafficking and use of methamphetamine that has spread eastward from the traditional center of the drugs use in the pacific west as historical drugpolicy priorities have been revised to reflect methamphetamines devastating impact on children of users user health risk to the users community and the nvironmental damage caused by the drugs manufacture comprehensive range of methamphetaminerelated issues has come before congress legislation was enacted in the 109th congress that addresses various aspects of the problem during the 109th congress the combat methamphetamine epidemic act cmea was enacted as part of the reauthorization of the patriot act pl 109 177 signed into law on march 9 2006 p l 109177 establishes measures designed to further criminalize and control the illicit use of methamphetamine by limiting the availability of certain precursor che

mine problem through such measures as providing grants for t echnology to detect the smuggling of methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals and grants for mentoring after school and educational enrichment prog rams for children whose parents are methamphetamine addicts the broad ra nge of legislation that was introduced indicates congresss perception of the farreaching implications of the methamphetamine problem in the united states the problem of methamphetamine abuse and its clandestine manufacture is not new reaching back over 50 years what makes methamphetamine uniquely worrisome illicit drug for congress is that it has easily adapted to changing federal pr ohibitions and continued to flourish2 moreover the chemicals from which methamphetamine is synthesized are produced and used for legitimate medical purposes and ca nnot be eliminated or eradicated this report begins with brief ove rview of the background and history of methamphetamine use and abuse followed by the sources of the drug in the country today the report then provides an analysis of trends in illicit methamphetamine use prevalence and geographic shift the fi nal section of the report provides few

by the japanese chemist nagayoshi nagai3 but its medical uses were identified only in the 1930s4 methamphetamine was marketed by burroughs wellcome and co as pharmaceutical drug under the trade name methedrine beginning in 1940 and by abbott laboratories under the trade name desoxyn beginning in 1943 originally used as nasal decongestant and bronchiodialator between 1932 and 1949 many other medical uses for methamphetamine and amphetamines became accepted including treatment of schizophrenia tobacco smoking heart block radiation sickness and morphine and codeine addiction chemistry of methamphetamine methamphetamine an easily manufactured drug of the amphetamine gr oup is powerful and addictive central nervous system cns stimulant with l onglasting effects the precursor drug ephedrine from which methamphetamine can be produced occurs naturally in plants of the genus ephedra and natural amphetamines are present in several plant species unlike heroin cocaine and marijuana wh ich are derived from botanical materials produced by large workforces dispersed over vast territories methamphetamine is synthesized from chemicals produced in di screte factories around the world

methamphetamine also known as methamphetamine sulfate that was largely manufactured and distributed by west coast motorcycle gangsamphetamines were widely available in the united states without prescription until 1951 and amphetaminecontaining inha lers were available over the counter until 1959 stimulants were widely used by longhaul truckers on transcontinental trips and students for staying awake to study8 the drugs were also widely used by construction workers and othe r bluecollar workers shift workers housewives and office workers to help them stay awake or give them an extra edge in their endeavors amphetamines were popular diet pills for anyone interested in losing weight particularly among women in the 1950s methamphetamine was considered to be promising therapy for depression methamphetamine use has lengthy histor in the united states medical use of methamphetamine began in the 1930s wh it was manufactured as bronchial dilator and soon after prescribed for va riety of conditions including narcolepsy attention deficit disorder obesity and fatigue by the 1950s methamphetamine was readily available legally and widely used in the 1960s liquid form of methamphetamine gained popularity as treatment for heroin addiction which quickly developed into new abuse pa ttern involving injecting methamphetamine during this period the black market for amphetamine and methamphetamine consisted of diverted supplies from pharmaceutical companies distributors and physicians in response to the growing abuse of amphetamine nd methamphetamine restrictions were placed on the availab ility of desoxyn and methedrine in the pharmaceutical market in late 1962 these re strictions led to the emergence of the first illicit methamphetamine laboratories generally operated by motorcycle gangs first in the san francisco area and later more widely in the western states these illicit biker laboratories synthesized meth amphetamine using phenyl2propanone p2p and methylamine as precursor chemicals yielding mixture of two isomers levo and dextromethamphetamine9 the resulting substance was commonly referred to as crank10 which was less potent form of methamphetamine than the pharmaceutical product this illicit form of methamphetamine was manufactured and distributed by motorcycle gangs als referred to as outlaw biker gangs beginning in the mid1960s and its use quickly spread along the pacific coast as the dangers associated with the use of amphetamine and methamphetamine became better understood further restricti ons were placed on how much could be legally produced and distributed as part of the controlled substances act of 1970 methamphetamine was classified as schedule ii drug the response to further federal regulation of these pharmaceutical s fueled the illicit production of crank and its use spread beyond white and bluec ollar workers to include college studentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33857crs5 11 many added crank to

1980s increased law enforcement efforts to target the motorcycle gang subculture and its dominance of the illicit methamphetamine supply led underground chemists to seek other methods of illicitly manufacturing methamphetamine the laws designed to crack down on biker gangs selling methamphetamine inadvertently resulted in the development of new easier method of manufacturing illicit methamphetamine that changed the production and distribution of the drug12 the new method of manufacturing illicit methamphetamine was the simpler phedrine reductionba sed method first popularized in southern calif ornia primarily centered in san diego use of the reduction method ma it not only simpler to ma nufacture methamphetamine but inadvertently led to the production of the significantly more potent form of methamphetamine in use today13 see appendix for more detailed description of the federal legislative hist ory of methamphe tamine regulation current uses of methamphetamine today

historically methamphetamine was problem largely in the pacific west particularly in hawaii nd california however during the 1990s the use of methamphetamine grew and bega n to spread first into the northwestern states and by 2000 its use had spread to the midwest and south and to much lesser degree to the northeast and midatlantic region38 for policymakers it is important to understand the depth and pervasiveness of the methamphetamine problem in order to craft legislative responses that can effec tively address the issues druguse surveys and other data sources can help to inform these discussions is there methamphetamine epidemic during recent congressional delibera tions on the latest round of anti methamphetamine legislati on questions were raised about whether the methamphetamine problem was truly national drug priority critics of us drug policy argued that nationa l drug data from the nsduh did not support the urgency of claims that methamphetamine epidemic was spreading across the nation39 the response of congressional policym akers to anecdotal stories that methamphetamine use was spiraling out of control in their home districts was considered by some critics to be another drug panic fueled in part by sensational media coverage to consider the ques tion is there methamphetamine epidemic in the country first one would need to specify the period in question second one would need to consider the definition of epidemic that would be applied finally it would be important to consider how accurately the available druguse data capture these developments nationally and whether these data could be used for estimating druguse patterns in cal or regional areas if the question of methamphetamine epidemic were posed today there are several lines of evidence indicating that the national prevalence of methamphetamine use increased dramatically between 19942004 since 2004 however national survey data indicate that the number of methamphetamine lifetime users and first time users is declining nationally after peaking in or around 2004 however the latest nsduh data for 2005 do not support national epidemic because the survey estimates that methamphetamin use has declined since 2004 limitations of the nsduh sample40 and other survey and administrative data sets make it difficult tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33857crs11 40

regional drug problem or the latest drug panic in the case of national methamphetamine prevalence estimates there are some limitations on how quickly and reliably the druguse data sources reflect changes in patterns of use until the resurgence of methamphetamine use in the mid 1990s the low reported incidence of meth amphetamine use compared to the use of drugs such as marijuana or cocaine hampered the development of state druguse estimates from national estimate s as result until recently these druguse surveys and treatment admission data sets reported methampheta mine as part of more general category of stimulants noncocaine68 this combined reporting has made it difficult to track national methamphe tamine trends over time in additi on the small sample size of survey responde nts reporting methamphe tamine use makes it difficult to estimate statelevel prevalence data on the drugs use for any single year69 moreover such data limitations in turn complicate capturing regional or

dramatic pace than that seen in certain midwestern states where methamphetamine use was less common and rose quickly understandably there are some who would argue that the characterization of

methamphetamine problem across number of states in the midwest and south although not numerically signif icant on national scale was enough to trigger national response federal branch law enforcement programs and policies federal approaches to illicit drug use take one of three basic forms 1 demand reduction prevention and tr eatment 2 domestic law enforcement and 3 interdiction72 many law enforcement efforts at all levels of government rely on arrest and incarceration drug seizures and production interruptions at the drugs major sources the sources of methamphetamine manufacture are unique because the drug can be synthesized from precursor chemicals that are produced for medical purposes and available in bulk for dtos from certain chemical manufacturers around the globe many of the other chemicals used in the synthesis of the drug are chemicals found in household products that are not easy to regulate illicit methamphetamine production is particularly nsitive to law enforcement efforts to limit access to its chemical pr ecursors because without ephedrine and pseudoephedrine methamphe tamine simply cannot be readily synthesized in addition the manufacture of methamphetamin precursors is capitalintensive difficult chemical process that requires exacting laboratory techniques and equipment that does not lend itself to illicit manufacture as result these methamphetamine precursors are only manufactured in bulk by handful of chemical companies around the world therefore new federal rest rictions on methamphetamines precursor chemicals can have significant impact on the availability and abuse of illicit methamphetamine federal and state laws have been developed to regulate the precursor chemicals used including phedrine and pseudoephe drine

measures to reduce the illicit use of methamphetamine finally to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of federal drug regulations congress may want to consider significant improvement and expansion of druguse surveys and drugrelated administrative data sets along with drug inte rdiction data collection conclusion the illicit use of methamphetamine is seen as serious problem in the united states the severity of the problem vari in communities across the country and in some states methamphetamine has been serious problem for decades there is evidence that methamphetamine use has been moving eastward into new regions of the country into both rural and urban comm unities often with devastating results methamphetamine is not new drug of abuse but its low price longlasting effects high purity ease of manufacture and r eady supply from mexican drug trafficking organizations raise concerns that metham phetamine use may continue to be difficult to control legislation considered and recently enacted by congress relies on interdiction and law enforcement efforts as the primary means of controlling the availability of methamphetamine past experience suggest s that such approaches can succeed and there is reason to believe that the mo st recently enacted law pl 109177 can significantly reduce the availability of illicit methamphetamine in the past when precursor chemicals became difficult to obtain methamphetamine prices rose the drugs purity declined and fewer addi cts were able to maintain their methamphetamine habit as result some methamphetamine addicts entered treatment substituted other drugs to ease withdrawal or just quit the antimethamphetamine provisions of pl 109177 pl aced restrictions on the availability of retail otc cold nd sinus medicines to eliminate access to methamphetamine precursor chemicals for amateur labs reducing the attendant dangers of clandestine labs states that passed such restrictions on otc precursors experienced significant declines in the number of clandestine laboratory seizures numerous reports from state and local law enforcement indicate that the mexican drug trafficking organizations that already s upply most of the drug that is used in the united states have been able to quick ly step in and supply methamphetamine markets that formerly relied on amateur produced methamphetamine providing purer more addictive product as result the restric tions on otc medications may not have as great an impact on the overa ll methamphetamine problem the new law however may help eliminate more informal clandestine laboratories by replacing the state patchwork of laws with federal floor restricting retail sales of methamphetamine precursors simultaneously communities will be spared the attendant dangers of fire s and explosions from amateur methamphetamine labs making it less likely that children would be exposed to toxic fumes and other dangers from methamphetamine manufacture

production to mexico read ily supplied with the necessary methamphetamine precursor chemicals by other international chemical companies willing and able to provide tonquantities r ecent press accounts indicate th at the mexican government has announced that it has begun taking steps to limit imports of methamphetamine precursor chemicals to correspond to leg itimate domestic demands such move by mexico could begin to reduce access to methamphetamine precursors by drug trafficking organizations82 the effectiveness and durability of these mexican policies are difficult to gauge and it is particularly important to remember that methamphetamine precursors are manufactur ed outside of mexico and could be made into methamphetamine and smuggled into the us via other routes singular focus on mexico as the source country of illegal metham phetamine could be shortsighted drug traffickers and drug markets are highly adaptable responding quickly to changing laws by stockpiling chemical s or adopting new production methods or switching chemical suppliers in order to continue their illicit highly profitable enterprises such flexible and dynamic market requires that federal drug policy be equally adaptive and as well informed as possible better data on all aspects of drug use and drug markets could help with the formulation of more responsive and successful federal policies current drug use surveys and datasets could be expanded and funded at higher levels to improve the quality and re liability of the information available to congress and policymakers supplyside interventions alone will not eliminate the illicit methamphetamine drug problem efforts to prevent the use of methamphetamine offer an opportunity to target prevention efforts in areas where methamphetamine use has not already taken hold especially in the midatlantic and northeast regions of the country illicit drug use generally is cyclical in nature just as patterns of illicit drug use vary over time there are

methamphetamine abuse on health and crime unpublished paper jan 18 2005appendix b what works case studi of the effectiveness of federal laws to control methamphetamine experts in the area of drug policy have long debated how eff ectively the federal war on drugs has controlled drug abuse in the us the orientation of us antidrug policies relies heavily on supplyside controls whose efficacy is frequently questioned as the primary antidrug strategy94 some federal antidr ug policies have had unintended consequences for example re searchers of drug policy often note that abuse of amphetamines led to federal law that banned the substance which unintentionally fostered demand for an alternative stimulant which in turn led to the development of increased use of methamphe tamine by the late 1960s the increased illicit use of methamphetamine led to the enactment of federal measures to restrict the availability of phenylpropanolamine ppa precursor chemical widely used at the time to manufacture one form of illicit methamphetamine crank federal controls restricting the availability of ppa significantly disrupted the illicit production and distribution of crank levodextro methamphetamine by biker gangs this drove underground chemists eager to meet the demand for an alternative stimulant in the illicit drug market to seek substitute for ppa thus ppas chemical cousins ephedrin and pseudoephedrine came to be the key ingredients of new and improved form of the stimulant the most potent and addictive form of methamphetamine dextro methamphetamine and form of the drug that could be easily synthesized inadvertently tighter regulation of ppa was the catalyst behind the development of the form of illicit methamphetamine abused and manufactured today the following section considers three case studies that attempt to discern whether or not the enactment of certain fe deral laws had an effect on the supply of methamphetamine an analysis by carlos dobkin and nancy nicosia95 looks at the impact of two large interventions that occurred in ma 1995 the first was the implementation of the domestic chemical dive rsion control act of 1993 dcdca pl 103200 and the second was large dea drug bust taken together the two interventions were of unprecedented scale the dea drug bust shut down two significant methamphetamine precursor suppliers whos production

the population but is only representative of the specific sample of arrestees for the federal governments stra tegy of disrupting the supply of methamphetamine and methamphetamine precursor chemicals these 2 cases were impressive successes although the federa l policy resulted in dramatic reduction in the availability of methamphetamine th effects were temporary dobkin and nicosias analysis indicates that the impact of the two dea interventions was made possible by the enactment and impleme ntation of methamphetamine precursor controls in the dcdca their analysis further shows that deas actions eliminated huge share of the available methampheta mine precursor supply in california an amount equal to 70 of the ondcp s estimated nationa l methamphetamine consumption of 341 metric tons in 1994 the passage of the dcdca in 1993 which went into effect in april 1994 was followed by final regulations implementing the new law in august 1995 the dcdca liminated the exemption of single entity pure ephedrine products so products containing ephedr ine were subject to record keeping and importexport notificati on requirements like those required of transactions of bulk ephe drine and pseudoephedrine96 the dcdca also permitted dea to deny or revoke companys regist ration without proof of criminal intent the implementation of these two new provisions of the law was essential to disrupting the market for methamphetamine precursor chemicals at that point in time according to dobkin and nicosia thes two companies were supplying more than 50 of the precursors used nationa lly to produce methamphetamine deas actions eliminated two very large ephedrine and pseudoephedrine s uppliers operating in california at that time97 as result deas efforts caused significant reduction in the national precursor supply which tr iggered an increase in price from 30 to 100 per gram and caused purity of thamphetamine to drop from 90 to less than 20 over the five month period th at followed dobkin and nicosias work showed that the provisions of the dcdc enabled dea to disrupt the supply of methamphetamine precursor chemicals and as result the supply purity and price of methamphetamine were profoundly affected howe ver while the immediate effect was profound it was also temporary and the analysis found that prices recovered within four m onths while purity of meth amphetamine took much longer to return to previous levels almost 20 months to climb back to 8598 dobkin and nicosia also analyzed data from the adamduf survey99 in relation to the dea drug busts in may 1995 as an alternative measure of the effectiveness of the dcdca regulations their analysis focused on exploring the relationship between methamphetamine use and crime by looking at the adamduf data for the period 19931996 they found that methamphetamine use among arrestees in three california cities san diego angeles and san jose declined by 55 felony drug arrests unlike so other crime trends including

dea intervention event but do not track as well with changes in the price of methamphetamine after the event their analysis also concluded that even largescale disrupti on only reduced adverse health effects and dr ug crime temporarily in similar analysis cunningham and liu looked at the effects on hospital admissions of three federal policies that regu lated ephedrine nd pseudoephedrine in 1989 1995 and 1997100 the federal interventions included 1 the 1989 implementation of the chemical diversion and trafficking act of 1988 which regulated bulk quantities of ephedrine and pse udoephedrine 2 the 1995 implementation of the domestic chemical dive rsion control act of 1993 which regulated the distribution of products that contained ephedrine as the only active medicinal ingredient and 3 the 1997 implementation of the comprehensive methamphetamine control act of 1996 which regulated pr oducts that included pseudoephedrine with or without other ac tive ingredients and the distribution of products that included ephedrine in co mbination with other active medicinal ingredients each of the federal interv entions built on the previous regulation often closing loopholes that were newly exploited by drug trafficking organizations dtos these federal interventions focused on responding to largescale methamphetamine producers until passage of the comprehensive methamphetamine control act of 1996 which focused on the distribution of sinus and cold medicines101 cunningham and lius analysis looked at methamphetamine related hospital admissions and how they were affected by all three precursor regulations in california they also looked at the impact of three of these regulations in the late 1990s in arizona and neva da both of which border california using an

pricing varia tions across cities the ondcp report showed that methamphetamine prices from 1981 to 2003 rose overall but that there were three very large price spikes in the years following three precursor control regulations in 1989 1995 and 1997 in addition the re port found that purity trends for methamphetamine did not move the way that might be expected for other drugs unlike other illicit drugs the analysis f ound that methamphetamine prices and purity were very volatile and did not exhibit the sa trends this analysis also found that the spikes in price and purity of methamphetamine were related to the regulation of precursor chemicals introduced in 1989 1995 and 1997106 the analyses described above indicat that legislative changes aimed at regulating the methamphetamine precursor chemicals had significant effect on the supply price and purity of illicit methamphe tamine in the short term the findings of dobkins and nicosia and cunningha m and liu also found that the changes brought on by new more restrictive federal law only worked temporarily as illicit suppliers found alternative ways to circumvent the regulati ons or develop alternative suppliers of precursor chemicals thus wh at these analyses show is that preventive legal strategies developed by congre ss over the past 17 years have steadily strengthened restrictions on the distribu tion of pseudoephedrine ephedrinecontaining products however these analyses also poi nt out that these changes in federal law only brought about temporary changes federal drug policy and regulation work effectively and may be nefit by being adaptive and responsive to the adaptive changes that suppliers of illicit thamphetamine and other illic it drugs willingly undergo to supply the demand for illicit drugs in the united states
