resumption in israelipalestinian violence smuggling activity underneath the gazaegypt border is said to have reached an alltime high10 the allure of smuggling has been further abetted by rising

following the hamas takeover israels accusations some israeli lawmakers and intelligence officials blame egypt for the increased tunnel traffi c in september 2006 the director of the shin bet israels

rockets and shoulderheld antiaircraft missiles13 in november 2007 steinitz wrote letters to members of congress asking them to s upport proposals to freeze us military aid to egypt in his letters steinitz stated that it is almost ridiculous for the egyptians to focus on finding the tunnels since it woul d be much easier for them to intercept the smugglers before they get anywhere near the border also in november 2007 israeli public security minister avi dichter asserted that egypt could deploy to stop the smuggling within an hour what we previously perceived as weakness or inability to act may be egyptian policy14 in december 2007 israeli accusations against egypt reached crescendo israeli foreign minister tzipi livni stated in her testimony before knesset committee that the egyptian failure to secure the border with gaza is terrible problematic and damages the ability to make progress in the peace process following her statement the new york times reported that israeli officials had sent videotapes to us officials showing egyptian border guards not only ignoring smuggling but in at least one case aiding it15 however an unnamed israeli secu rity official stated that

asked israel to renegotiate either the 2005 mou or the camp david peace treaty itself to allow for the deployment of additional 12 regiments in rafah israeli leaders have responded by insisting that

overall security some observers state that hamass arsenal is not as sophisticat ed as hezbollahs in lebanon nevertheless israeli military officials appear to have c oncluded that hamas is gradually

fundamentally over the size of egypts border guard force egypt has repeatedly requested that israel amend their agreement to allow for an additional regiment to deploy in rafa h raising the total number of soldiers to 1500 israel has responded that egypt lacks the political w ill to stop smuggling or stop palestinians from breaching the border however as previously mentioned israel may now be

reportedly lacked the capacity or the will to destroy the tunnel shafts that remain open even when an entrance is s ealed furthermore as long as tunnels remain open on the palestinian side the egyptians have not been able to fully destroy them with the recent us pledge to reallocate 23 million in fmf for new equipment and training egypts record on destroyi ng tunnels may improve moreover the border guard forces rules of engagement against palestinians crossing the border are deliberately ambi guous due to domestic popular sensitivities in egypt its leaders seek to avoid the appearance

challenges for egypt which wants to keep hamas isolated but not be held solely responsible for failing to do so by either israel or the united states nevertheless as violence between israel and hamas and other palestinian factions in the gaza strip continues these issues will continue to fester with hamas showing indicati on that it is ready to renounce its stated goal of israels destruction all parties would appear to be long way from seeing the gazaegyptisraeli region at peace
