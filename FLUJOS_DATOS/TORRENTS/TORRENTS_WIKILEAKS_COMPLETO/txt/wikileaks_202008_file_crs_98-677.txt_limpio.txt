larry niksch specialist in asian affairs foreign affairs and national defense division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this crs report describes the history and the issues involved in the longstanding differences between congress and the executive branch over us policy toward the indonesian military abri the report describes two past episodes when these differences broke out the period of indonesian radicalism under president sukarno in the early 1960s and the initial years of the indonesian military occupation of east timor in the late 1970s it outlines the different views of the indonesian military between its congressional critics and executive branch officials who have promoted close us relations with it the issues between congress and the bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s are discussed within this framework culminating in american policy toward the abri in 1998 as indonesias economicpolitical crisis led to the downfall of president suharto specific issues of the 1990s discussed in the report including us training of indonesian military personnel and us arms sales to indonesia likely will come to new legislative attention in the near future this report will not be updated for more from crs see the guide to crs products under east asia indonesia us relations with the indonesian military summary differences between the us executive branch and congress over us policies toward the indonesian military have persisted since the early 1960s in the early 1960s indonesian policies under president sukarno including aggression against neighboring countries and political alliance with the indonesian communist party led congress to cut military and economic aid to indonesia the kennedy administration opposed this action in the late 1970s the policies of the indonesian military in east timor drew criticism from us human rights groups and members of congress who accused the military of violating the human rights of the people of east timor the carter administration on the other hand sought to deal with the issues of east timor and political prisoners through dialogue with the indonesian government and military from these episodes until the present the executive branch has believed that good relations with the indonesian military are necessary to promote us strategic interests especially us naval access to the indonesian straits connecting the pacific and indian oceans executive branch officials also argue that the united states needs close contacts with the military in order to influence indonesias political evolution critics in congress conversely argue that the united states should deal with the indonesian military on the basis of the day to day actions of the military and should penalize the military when its actions violate human rights or jeopardize us interests in other ways in the 1990s new differences arose between congress and the bush and clinton administration over the indonesian militarys massacre of civilians in east timor in november 1991 congress pushed for terminating us military training of indonesian military personnel and greater limits on arms sales to indonesia the clinton administration took an initial cautious approach to the role of the military in indonesias economicpolitical crisis of 1998 but reports of new human rights violations led it take several actions to pressure the military including suspension of training exercises some members of congress had criticized the administration for continuing the training

indonesian military background of congressionalexecutive policy differences over the indonesian military the current policy differences between the clinton administration and the department of defense on the one hand and some members of congress and human rights groups over us relations with indonesias military are the latest in pattern of such disputes since the early 1960s two earlier periods stand out 1 the early 1960s indonesia under the sukarno regime adopted foreign policy of quasialliance with china and waged military aggression against dutch new guinea the western half of the island of new guinea and the newly formed federation of malaysia defended by us allies great britain and australia president sukarno also built political alliance with the indonesian communist party pki by 1965 the pki was the largest communist party outside of communist countries with three million members and 20 million in front organizations1 the indonesian military known by its indonesian acronym abri acted as sukarnos instrument in his aggressive actions but its relations with the pki appeared to be cool the kennedy administration and congress disagreed over whether to continue military aid to indonesia congress cut military aid and economic aid to indonesia in 1963 citing sukarnos growing radicalism and aggressive acts the kennedy administration opposed this action2 after the military took power from sukarno after september 1965 the united states gradually normalized relations with the new order government under general suharto who became president in 1967 2 the late 1970s president suharto ordered the military to invade east timor in 1975 after portugal east timors colonial master withdrew and civil war broke out indonesia formally annexed east timor in 1976 guerrilla resistance to indonesian rule led by the fretilin party soon broke out the indonesian government committed large numbers of troops to east timor and repressed civil liberties famine developed in east

political prisoners whom the military had incarcerated in the 19651967 period and were still in custody ten years later us human rights groups and critics in congress accused the abri of violating the rights of the east timorese people through suppression of civil rights and physical abuse of political prisoners they asserted that the us government gave tacit support to the abris policies through the extension of military assistance programs to indonesia the carter administration responded to the criticism by initiating discussions with the indonesian government and the abri seeking measures to open up east timor to outside aid and monitoring and program to release the 35000 indonesian political prisoners4 executive branch view of military relations in these episodes and in the 1990s the executive branch has argued that us policy toward the indonesian military should be based on two considerations 1 strategic the maritime passages between the pacific and indian oceans are solely or partly indonesian waters thus the us seventh fleet requires indonesian cooperation to move ships between the two oceans in times of crisis5 indonesia has asserted legal right to control passage through the straits connecting the two oceans the abri exercises operational control of the straits the pentagon and the abri reportedly negotiated arrangements in the early 1970s for the passage of us surface warships and submarines through the indonesian straits6 the contents of the arrangements have never been disclosed however in 1986 president reagan and suharto exchanged letters in which the united states acknowledged indonesian sovereignty over the straits and indonesia pledged to uphold the right of innocent 3 jenkins david new ordeal for east timor far eastern economic review

high level usindonesian military negotiations reportedly occurred in 1995 and 1996 over proposed indonesian rules regarding foreign naval passage8 the importance to the pentagon of us naval passage through the indonesian straits grew after the soviet invasion of afghanistan and the islamic revolution in iran at the end of the 1970s as result the pentagon formulated strategy to enable the united states to fight two wars simultaneously in the persian gulf and the western pacific predicated on the ability to shift us forces between the indian ocean and the western pacific9 these events also created new factor influencing indonesian attitudes toward us naval access the willingness of indonesia as predominantly muslim state to tolerate us security policy in the persian gulf region in the 1988 oil tanker flagging crisis in the persian gulf and during the 1990 1991 persian gulf conflict majority of the us warships deployed to the gulf traversed the indonesian straits into the indian ocean10 in march 1996 one of the two us aircraft carrier battle groups that the seventh fleet deployed near taiwan during the chineseinstigated military tensions passed through the straits from the indian ocean into the south china sea when tensions with iraq rose in early 1998 the navy deployed the aircraft carrier the uss independence from japan through indonesian waters to the persian gulf11 2 the political role of the abri executive branch officials and many academic experts on indonesia have argued that the indonesian military is the arbiter of indonesias political system only the abri it is argued can either affect political change or can thwart change thus this argument goes the united states needs close contacts with the military leadership in order to influence indonesias political evolution and ensure that any significant political change does not affect us interests adversely the kennedy and johnson administrations argued these points during the tumultuous 19621965 period in defending continued us military aid to indonesia they viewed the abri as the best defense against the pki and sukarnos radicalism12 officials of the carter administration and the state

to east timor and the release of political prisoners13 in more recent years us officials have viewed the indonesian military as counterweight to the emergence of islamic radicalism in indonesia14 views of the military relationship by executive branch critics the critics of cooperative us relationship with the abri include human rights organizations some academics and some members of congress they do not dispute the executive branchs view of the political power of the indonesian military their criticism stresses the power and authority of the abri in east timor aceh province and other situations where violations of human rights occur or reportedly occur the executive director of asia watch referred to the unchecked power of the military in east timor15 the critics argue that the united states should base its policy toward the abri on the day to day actions and conduct of the military rather than on future scenarios of the abris role in political crisis they also contend that the executive branch gives too much weight to strategic considerations and inadequate priority to the abris treatment of east timorese and indonesian civilians16 thus the critics of us military aid in the early 1960s viewed the abri as an instrument of sukarnos radicalism and aggression against indonesias neighbors congress cut military and economic aid to indonesia in 196317 after indonesias invasion of east timor in 1975 the critics accused the ford and carter administrations of allowing the abri to use us weapons in east timor which indonesia had received under us military aid programs in the 1990s critics extended these accusations to the abris actions toward indonesian political and labor dissidents and the killing of civilians18 such accusations have been documented in the state departments annual human rights reports 13 as an example see the testimony by us ambassador to indonesia edward masters in us congress house subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs famine relief for

crime oppressing workers chicago tribune november 3 1996 p 7 crs5 critics of the abri have argued that because of its unique political role the united states must exert direct pressure on it in order to bring about change in its behavior indirect influence through cooperative programs will not work they insist and may send the wrong message over the years critics of the executive branch have proposed penalties on the abri these proposals have included reductions andor suspensions in cooperative programs with the indonesian military they have targeted foreign military sales fms financing of us weapons sales to indonesia and us military training of indonesian military personnel they also have proposed restrictions on commercial sales of weapons to indonesia the tumultuous military relationship of the 1990s the differences between the executive branch and congress over policy toward indonesia reached new heights in the 1990s in the wake of the persian gulf war and the expulsion of the united states from military bases in the philippines in 1992 the pentagon sought closer relations with indonesia the navy negotiated with the indonesian government in 1992 to gain access to ship repair facilities at surabaya port city on java19 this initiative collided with the congressional reaction to the indonesian militarys massacre of civilian demonstrators in dili the capital of east timor in november 199120 representatives of the us human rights community called for the united states to terminate the abris participation in the us international military education training program imet under the imet program the us executive branch had allocated over 2 million annually for indonesian officers to attend us military training schools representatives of asia watch argued that termination of the program for indonesia would put pressure on the indonesian government and military to provide full accounting of the dili killings and punish military personnel responsible21 congress legislated termination of funding for indonesian participation in the imet program in 1992 pl 102391 foreign operations appropriations for fiscal year 1993 approved in october 1992 the bush administration opposed the ban on imet funding for indonesia the administration criticized the killings the administration called for the indonesian government to investigate and inflict appropriate punishments on individuals responsible for the massacre and to ensure that such incident recurs22 on the other hand us officials stressed that the killings were not part of deliberate policy of the suharto administration this assertion constituted significant difference in views between the administration and its critics the critics argued that the dili 19 richardson michael indonesia opens

was part of pattern of human rights abuses by the abri in number of regions of indonesia these officials argued that the imet program was means of influencing the indonesian military and exposing it to us views of human rights they warned that termination would undercut moves by president suharto and the indonesian government to investigate the killings23 the administration stressed the broad range of us interests in indonesia arguing that our engagement with indonesia needs to be sustained not hindered24 the bush administrations arguments were partially undercut by the actions of indonesian courts and military tribunals that investigated the massacre president suharto established an investigating commission which issued an interim report in late december 1991 the commission disputed the abris claim of 19 killed saying that the death toll was at least 50 it concluded that military units though provoked had used excessive force the commission called for the prosecution of people who violated the law president suharto subsequently replaced the two senior commanders with responsibility for east timor and ordered the creation of tribunals to try military personnel however the tribunals handed out more severe sentences to timorese demonstrators than to military personnel according to figures provided by the state department sentences given to 13 civilians involved in the dili demonstrations of november 12 1991 ranged from six years to life imprisonment sentences of eight military personnel ranged from eight months to 18 months the senate appropriations committee stated in its report on foreign aid for fiscal year 1993 that it was shocked by the gross disparity in the sentences25 the clinton administration initially did not oppose the imet ban it also imposed two east timorrelated sanctions against the indonesian military july 1993 veto of jordanian sale of usmade f5 fighters to indonesia and prohibition of us sales of lethal crowd control equipment to indonesia however the administration took more sympathetic position toward military training and arms sales the administration allowed the indonesian government to finance indonesian officers

administration also decided to oppose congressional attempts to restrict us arms sales to indonesia in 1993 the administration successfully worked against proposed amendment in the senate to the foreign operations appropriations bill that would have made all us arms sales to indonesia conditional on reduction of the indonesian military presence in east timor29 in 1994 the administration opposed attempts in the senate to bar us military equipment purchased by indonesia from being used in east timor30 nevertheless in august 1994 the 103rd congress passed hr 4426 the fiscal year 1995 foreign operations appropriations bill pl 103306 the legislation banned the export to indonesia of light arms and crowd control equipment until the secretary of state reports to congress significant progress on human rights in east timor and elsewhere in indonesia when the 104th congress convened in 1995 the administration acted to prevent reenactment of similar legislation it assured congressional committees that the administration would continue to ban such weapons sales imet restoration and f16 sale initiatives the start of the 104th congress triggered two clinton administration initiatives to strengthen relations with the indonesian the administration announced in march 1995 that it would seek restoration of us funding for indonesias participation in the imet program in fiscal year 1996 foreign operations appropriations legislation it requested 600000 for indonesian military participation the defense department especially the navy promoted the administrations request admiral richard macke commanderinchief of the us pacific command and admiral william owens vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff met with american and indonesian journalists in washington and jakarta and testified before congressional committees in order to advocate resumption of imet funding both of the admirals voiced the need for personal and professional contacts with indonesian officers to enhance future cooperation and us influence civilian administration officials said that the views of owens and macke reflect the overwhelming view in the us military and that the us

fighters in 1986 and 13 shipboard harpoon missile systems in 1990 however after 1991 the indonesian government shifted purchases away from the united states to great britain australia and western europe reportedly in reaction to congressional criticisms of us arms sales32 purchases from the united states since then have been spare parts or servicing contracts for the previously acquired f16 fighters technical assistance for f16s and structural modifications of the f16s indonesia reportedly is interested in future purchases of us parts for its c130 transport aircraft f5 fighters boeing maritime patrol aircraft bell helicopters and armored fighting vehicles33 the origin of the clinton administrations initiative to sell new f16s to indonesia lay in the aborted sale of 28 f16 aircraft to pakistan the collapse of the deal with pakistan led the administration to seek other countries to purchase the aircraft presidents clinton and suharto reportedly discussed an f16 sale at their october 1995 white house meeting the united states and indonesia reached an agreement by the summer of 1996 for indonesia to buy nine of the fighters however in late july 1996 an antigovernment riot took place in jakarta indonesias capital following governmentorchestrated ouster of the leader of the indonesian democratic party pdi one of indonesias two nongovernment political parties abri

purchase and that the indonesian military would cease participation in the imet program president suharto stated in letter to president clinton that his decision was based on the wholly unjustified criticisms in the united states congress against indonesia 36 usabri relations in the fall of the suharto government the indonesian financial crisis of 19971998 which led to president suhartos resignation on may 21 1998 brought us attention to the abri in two respects the first was the traditional human rights issue of how the military would deal with critics of the government and protestors the second was how the abri would respond to mounting pressure for political reforms that emerged from economic hardships the clinton administration took cautious approach at first it concentrated decision making in special white house task force37 it stressed economic reform issues in its dealings with the suharto government us missions to indonesia in early 1998 avoided raising the political reform issue secretary of defense william cohen visited indonesia in january 1998 he reportedly emphasized the need to strengthen security cooperation with the indonesian government and expand us military ties with the abri including resumption of indonesian participation in the imet program he apparently did not raise the political reform issue or the abris role in dealing with the emerging social discontent38 by april 1998 the abris treatment of civilian dissenters prompted the administration to broaden its strategy reports of disappearances of dissenters and the reports of

embassy officials in jakarta reportedly made similar representations to indonesian counterparts and to general wiranto the abri commanderinchief40 us officials said their overtures resulted in the release in late april of some of those who had disappeared41 however key members of congress criticized the administration for the continuing training of abri units in early may 1998 canceled scheduled joint training exercise with indonesian military units until may 12 1998 the abri had avoided the use of violence against mounting antisuharto protests led by college students general wiranto had endorsed proposals for political reforms on that day however security forces fired at students at trisakti university killing six the clinton administrations immediate response was to organize high level military delegation to jakarta to appeal to the abri not to use violence against civilians administration officials said the planned mission had political agenda related to the status of president suharto42 the mission was canceled on may 14 however after massive rioting erupted in jakarta creating dangerous conditions for foreigners department of defense officials continued

we can talk about new status for east timor based on history based on culture based on the actual needs of the east timorese people43 however prospects for future usindonesian military relations have been affected negatively by the demands in indonesia for investigations of human rights abuses allegedly committed by the abri in the weeks leading up to suhartos resignation the demands from the press and elements of the public focus on three incidents the kidnapings of over 20 political dissidents mainly in march and april 1998 the killings of four students at trisakti university on may 12 1998 and the rioting of may 1415 1998 in jakarta and other cities during which scores of women were raped and property were destroyed by organized gangs of men another complication arose in july 1998 when mass graves were uncovered in aceh province in northern sumatra raising another issue of possible abuses by the military general wiranto has said that the abri high command did not order military units to commit human rights abuses in the cases of the kidnapings the trisakti killings and the riots however public suspicions have focused on units commanded by lt general prabowo subianto suhartos soninlaw wiranto removed prabowo from his command of security units covering jakarta following suhartos resignation in july 1998 the abri high command announced finding that members of kopassus the special forces also commanded by prabowo were involved in the kidnapings seven kopassus members were arrested on august 3 1998 the abri command announced that an officers honorary council would investigage general prabowos role in the incidents president habibie has created task force to investigate the rapes many of which were committed against ethnic chinese women44 secretary of defense cohen alluded to these allegations when he visited jakarta in early august 1998 cohen stated that the defense department wanted to resume cooperative programs with the abri in the coming months and he
