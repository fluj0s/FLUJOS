of land management issues and approaches by ross w gortefederal lands managed by the bureau of land management blm and the forest service fs issues for the 110th congress the 110th congress is considering actions th at affect the various uses and management of federal lands administered by the bureau of land management and the forest service these actions include legislation administr ative or regulatory proposals and litigation and judicial decisi ons issue areas include access to energy resources on federal lands velopment of hardrock minerals designation of the national landscape conservation system w ilderness designati on management of wild horses and burros wild fire protection forest rvice implementation of the national environmental policy act nepa nd other issues many of these issues have been of interest to congress and the nation for decades background and analysis the bureau of land management blm in the department of the interior doi and the forest service fs in th us department of agriculture usda manage 449 llion acres of land more than two thirds of the land owned by the federal government and onefifth of the total us land area the blm manages 2558 million acres of land predominantly in the west the fs administers 1928 million acres of federal land also concentrated in the west the blm and fs have similar manageme nt responsibilities for their lands and many key issues affect both agencies lands thus merging the two agencies often is proposed1 by law blm and fs lands are to be administered for multiple uses although slightly different uses are specifi ed for each agency in practice the land uses considered by the agencies in clude recreation range timber minerals watershed wildlife and fish and conservation blm and fs lands also are required to be managed for sustained yield hi gh level of resource outputs in perpetuity without impairing the productivity of th lands however each agency also has unique emphases and functions for instance most rangelands are managed by the blm and the blm administers mineral development on all federal lands most federal forests are managed by the fs nd only the fs has cooperative program to assist nonfederal forest landow ners moreover developmen t of the two agencies has differed and historically they have focused on different i ssues nonetheless there are many parallels httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33792crs2 history of the bureau of land management for the blm many of the issues traditionally center on the agencys responsibilities for land disposal range ma nagement particularly grazing and minerals development the blm assumed these three key functions when it was created in 1946 by the merger of the gene ral land office created in 1812 and the us grazing service created in 1934 the general land office had helped convey land to settlers issued leases and adminis tered mining claims on the public lands among other functions the us grazing service had been established to manage the public lands best suited for livestock grazing under the taylor grazing act of 1934 43 usc 315 et seq congress frequently has deba ted how to manage fede ral lands and whether to retain or dispose of the remaining public lands or to expand fe deral land ownership congress enacted the federal land polic and management act of 1976 flpma 43 usc 1701 et seq sometimes ca lled blms organic act because it consolidated and articulated the agencys responsibilities among other provisions the law establishes general national policy that blmmanaged public lands be retained in federal owners hip establishes management of the public lands based on the principles of multiple use and sustained yield and generally requires that the federal government receive fair market value for the use of public lands and resources blm public land management encompasses di verse uses resources and values such as energy and mineral development timber harvesting livestock grazing recreation wild horses and burros fish and wildlife habitat and preservation of natural and cultural resources history of the forest service the fs was created in 1905 when forest lands reserved by the president beginning in 1891 were transferred fro m doi into the existing usda bureau of forestry initially an agency for private forestry assistance and forestry research management direction for th national forests first enacted in 1897 and expanded in 1960 identifies the purposes for which the lands are to be managed including timber grazing recreation wildlife and fi sh and water and directs harmonious and coordinated management to provide for multiple uses and sustained yields of the many resources found in the national forests many issues concerning national forest management and use have focused on the appropriate level and location of timber harvesting in part to address these issues congress enacted the national fo rest management ac t of 1976 nfma 16 usc 16001614 et to revise timber sale authorities nd to elaborate on considerations and requi rements in land and res ource management plans wilderness protection also is continuing issue for the fs the multipleuse sustainedyield act of 1960 16 usc 528531 authorizes wilderness as use of national forest lands nd possible national forest wilderness areas have been reviewed under the 1964 wilderness act 16 usc

for energy and mineral development phase iii of blmcoordinated study issued may 2008 found that 62 of the estimated oil and 41 of the estimated natural gas on the 279 million acres of federal nd inventoried are classi fied as inaccessible or unavailable for drilling and development3 the oil and gas industry contends that entry into currently unavailable areas is necessary to ensure future domestic oil and gas supplies opponents maintain that the restricted lands are unique or environmentally sensitive and that the united states could realize equivalent energy gains through conservation and increased ex ploration on current leases or elsewhere4 development of oil gas and coal on blm and fs lands and other federal lands is governed primarily by the mine ral leasing act of 1920 30 usc 181 leasing on blm lands goes through multistep approval process if the minerals are located on fs lands the fs must perform leasing analysis and approve leasing decisions for specific lands before the blm may lease minerals the energy policy act of 2005 epact pl 10958 made significant changes to the laws governing federal energy resources including the ma nagement of energy development on blm

in the house eg hr 6566 and hr 6709 also would have ended the spending prohibition on issuing final regulations fo r commercialscale oil shale development hardrock minerals by marc humphries background the general mining law of 1872 is one of the major statutes directing federal lands management policy the law grants free access to individuals and corporations to prospect for miner als in open public domain lands and allows them upon making discovery to stake or locate claim on the deposit claim gives the holder the right to deve lop the minerals and apply for patent to obtain full title of the land and minerals continuing issue is whether this 136yearold law should be reformed and if so how to ba lance mineral development with competing land uses13 the right to enter federal lands and fr eely prospect for and develop minerals is the feature of the claimpatent system th at draws the most vigorous support from the mining industry critics consider the cl aimpatent system giveaway of publicly owned resources because royalty payments are not required and because of the small amounts paid to maintain claim and to obtain patent congress has imposed moratorium on mining claim patents throug h the annual interior appropriations laws since fy1995 but has not restricted the right to stake claims or extract minerals blm study in 2000 estimated that about 165 million acres of nds with federallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33792crs6 14 there are approximately 700 million acres of federal mineral rights including fs and blm lands as well as lands administered by th nps fws and department of defense and federal mineral rights underlying private lands 15 the blm administers mineral resources under all federal lands regardless of which agency has responsibility for administering the surfaceowned mineral rights14 about 24 of all federal mineral acreage have been withdrawn from mineral entry leasing and sale subject to valid existing rights mineral development on nother 182 million acres 26 of all federal mineral acreage is subject to the approval of the surface management agency15 and must not be in conflict with land designations and plans the lack of direct stat utory authority for envir onmental protection under the mining law of 1872 is another major issue that has spurred reform proposals many mining law supporters contend that other current laws provide adequate environmental protection cr itics however assert that these general environmental requirements are not adequate to assure reclamation of mined areas and that the only effective approach to protecting lands from the adverse impacts of mining under the current system is to withdraw them from development under the mining law further critics charge that federal land managers lack regulatory authority over patented mining claims and that clear legal authority to assure adequate reclamation of mining sites is needed administrative actions since the late 1990s administrative efforts have focused on new surface management regulations with attention centering on mine reclamation efforts new mining claim location and annual cl aim maintenance fees were increased in 2005 to 30 and 125 pe r claim respectively from 25 and 100 legislative activity broadbased legi slation to reform the general mining law of 1872 hr 2262 was intr oduced on ma 10 2007 the 135year anniversary

existing hardrock mineral producers on fe deral land second senate bill s 2287 aimed at the hardrock mining industry would eliminate the percentage depletion allowance for certain hardrock minerals and establish an abandoned mine reclamation trust fund national landscape conservation system by carol hardy vincent background the blm created the national landscape conservation system nlcs in 2000 to focus management and public attention on its specially protected conservation areas according to the blm the mission of the system is to conserve protect and restore for present and future generations the nationally significant landscapes that have been recognized for their outstanding archaeological geological cultural ecological wilderne ss recreation and sc ientific values16 the system consists today of about 27 million acr of land with mo re than 850 federally recognized units these units include national monuments na tional conservation areas wilderness areas and wilderness study areas as well as thousands of miles of national historic and na tional scenic trails and wild and scenic rivers current issues for congress include whether to establish the system legislatively and the adequacy of funds for the system administrative actions over the past several years the blm has given priority to developing ne w or updated land mana gement plans for areas within the nlcs currently most of these plans are completed the administration has testified in favor of estab lishing the nlcs legislatively and is seeking reduced funds for the system for fy2009 see below legislative activity legislation has been introduced hr 2016 s 1139 s 2180 and s 3213 to establish the nlcs legislatively without intending to alter the way the areas are currently managed the measures seek to conserve protect and restore nationally significant landscapes that have outstanding values for the benefit of current and future generations s 2180 has been i ndefinitely postponed by the senate while the other three bills are on the senate calendar17 at hearings on the bills the administration and other witnesses testified in favor of establishing the sy stem legislatively for instance at hearing on s 1139 the acting director of the blm testifie d that doi supported the bill as way to provide legislative support nd direction to the blm and to formalize and strengthen its conservation system within the context of the agencys multipleuse mission18 other witnesses expressed oppos ition to the legislation for instance on the assertionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33792crs8 19 mr orie williams testimony legislative hearing on hr 2016 us house natural resources subcommittee on national parks forests and public lands june 7 2007that it could have the effect of establishing new st andardized requirements for disparate areas in the system19 on april 9 2008 the house passed hr 2016 with several amendments some of the amendments sought to clarify the effect of establishing the system on the management of its units for instance the house agreed to amendments specifying that the bill would not affect existing grazing rights or operations additionally hinder or restrict energy development or limit access for hunting fishing trapping or recreational shooting or infringe on the rights of states to manage these activities the house narrowly rejected motion to recommit the bill with instructions to report back promptly with an amendment stating that the bill shall not affect the right to bear arms within the nlcs the amendm ent was supported as essential to protect the right to bear arms under the sec ond amendment to the constitution but opposed on the grounds that the legislation already affirmed the rights of gun owners and hunters on april 10 2008 hr 2016 was placed on the senate calendar on june 28 2007 the senate committee on energy and natural resources reported s 1139 with an amendment seeking to clarify the description of the components of the system but without ma king substantive changes to the bill as introduced srept 110116 p 3 the bill was placed on the senate calendar on the same date similar provisions to establish the nlcs were included in broader natural resources legislation s 2180 wh ich was indefinitely postponed by the senate on june 11 2008 and s 3213 which was placed on the senate calendar on june 27 2008 pl 110229 s

to the nlcs questions about the adequacy of funds for the nlcs have been recurring some questions have cente red on whether recent funding for management and law enforcement have been sufficient to

bills that cont ain the text of other freestanding wilderness billspart of the national system designations often are controversial because commercial activities motorized access and roads structures and facilities generally are restricted in wilderness areas20 similarly agency wilderness studies often are controversial because many uses also are restricted in the study areas to preserve wilderness characteristics while congre ss considers possible designations some observers believe that the clinton rule protecting national forest roadless areas see below was prompted by belie f that congress had lagged in designating areas as wilderness21 others assert that the bush administration in promulgating new guidance to preclude additional fo rmal blm wilderness study areas and in eliminating the nationwide national forest roadless area protections of the clinton administration is attempting to open areas with wilderness attributes to roads energy and mineral explora tion and development thereb making them ineligible to be added to the wilderness system one significant issue is when and whether the agencies must review the wilderness potential of their lands the wilderness act directed the review of administratively designated national forest primitive areas and of national park system and national wildlife refuge system lands release language in statutes designating national forest wilderness areas and fs planning regulations 36 cfr 2197a5ii provide for periodic review of potential nationa l forest wilderness areas in the fs planning process for blm lands 603 of

background the wild freeroaming horses and burros act of 1971 16 usc 1331 et seq seeks to protect wild horses and burro s on federal land and places them under the jurisdiction of the blm and fs for years management of wild horses and burros has generated cont roversy and lawsuits controversies include the method of determining the appropriate management levels amls for herd sizes as the statute requires whethe r and how to remove animals from the range to achieve amls methods other than adoption for reducing animals on the range particularly fertility control and holding animals in longterm facilities whether appropriations for managing wild horses and burros are adequate and the slaughter or potential fo r slaughter of horses24 adoption has been the primary method of disposal of healthy animals with 221714 dopted from fy1972 to fy2007 the 108th congress enacted controversial changes to wild horse and burro mana gement on federal nds pl 108447 142 to provide for the sale of wild horses and burros specifically the first change directed the agencies to sell without limitation excess animals or their remains that essentially are deemed too old more than 10 years old or otherwise unable to be adopted offered unsuccessfully at least three times proceeds are to be used for the adoption program second change re moved the ban on the sa of wild horses and burros or their remains for processing into commercial products third change removed criminal penalties fo r processing into commerc ial products the remains of wild horse or burro if sold under the new authority these changes have been supported as providing costeffective way to help the agencies achieve amls to improve the health of the animals to protect range resources and to restore natural ecological balance on federal lands they have been opposed as potentially leading to the slaughter of healthy animals as of october 14 2008 the blm had sold nearly 2900 animals httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33792crs13 25 16 usc 1333b other provisions provide for the sale of excess animalsas of february 29 2008 there were an estimated 33000 wild horses and burros on blm lands national maximum amls are set at 27512 which some critics assert is set low in favor of livestoc k there were another 3180 wild horses and burros on fs lands as of september 30 2006 most recent year available further 29772 wild horses and burros were being held in facilities preparation maintenance and longter m facilities as of april 1 2007 and the blm continues to be responsible for these animals administrative actions the blm has been pursuing multiyear effort to achieve amls and in fy2007 had been clos er to amls than at any time since the early 1970s to achieve amls the blm s continued to rem ove wild horses and burros from the range and dispose of them through adoption and sale as well as through placement in longterm holding facilities however the blm estimates removal of 5200 animals in fy2008 and 3300 in fy2009 sizeable reductions from the number removed in each of the past several years these reductions will contribute to higher populations on the range for instance the blm projects total of 33444 wild horse and burros on the ra nge in fy2009 although adoptions have been declining over the past several years they have continued to outpace sales of animals the blm has determined that there is very little demand for the estimated 8000 older animals available th rough the sales program in addition the blm is reportedly cons idering whether to euthanize healthy wild horses and burros under current author ities to bolster efforts to reach aml the possibility of euthanizing wild horses and burros has been controversial authority to destroy excess animals is pr ovided for under the 1971 law specifically the secretary of the interior for blm lands and the secretary of agriculture for fs lands are to remove animals exceeding the ranges carrying capacity to restore natural ecological balance and protect the range from deterioration associated with an overpopulation of wild horse s and burros first they are to destroy old sick or lame animals by the most humane means available second they are to remove healthy animals for private adoption thir d if adoption demand is insufficient the secretary shall cause additional excess w ild freeroaming horses and burros to be destroyed in the most humane and cost efficient manner possible25 the agencies have not used this authority since january 1982 for fy2008 the blm requested 321 million for management of wild horses and burros 12 decrease from th fy2006 and fy2007 level of 364 million the agency expected that the funding reduction woul d be achieved by reducing efforts to gather and remove animals from the range at the time anticipating the removal of 830 animals in fy2008 congre ss did not support the requested decrease instead appropriating 362 million for fy2008 for fy2009 the administration requested 370 million funding for wild hor and burro management has not been determined for fy2009 blm is operatin g under continuing appropriations resolution through march 6 2009 division pl 110329 the level of funding that would be suffi

its appropriation for wild horse and burro management the blm currently needs additional space in longterm holding fac ilities and has been soliciting bids for new facilities most recently in june 2008 the agency solicited bids for contracts for one or more new pasture facilities each facility must be able to provide care for between 500 and 2500 animals legislative activity on april 26 2007 the house passed hr 249 to overturn the changes enacted in the 108th congress specifically the bill would repeal the authority to sell wild horses nd burros reimpose ban on the sale of wild horses and burros and their remains for pr ocessing into commercial products and reinstate criminal penalties for processing the remains into commercial products26 as with the 108th congress legislation the deba centered on whether the sale authority would result in the slaughter of healthy animals or whether it is needed as tool to manage the number of wild horse s and burros on the range there has been further action on hr 249 in october 2008 the g overnment accountability office gao released report on blm management of wild horses and burros27 gao examined number of issues including blms progress towards setting and meeting aml use of adoptions sales and holding facilities for managing wild horses and burros off the range controls to ensure humane treatment of animals and challenges in program management among other findings gao termined that if the costs of holding animals in facilities are not controlled they will overw helm the program gao also concluded that blms options for dealin g with unadoptable animals are limited and that because blm is not destroying an imals or selling them without limitation it is not in compliance with 1971 law among its recommendations for executive action gao recommended that the secretary of the interior direct blm to discuss with congress and other interests how best to comply with the 1971 law or to amend it so that blm would be able to comply wildfire protection by ross w gorte background recent fire seasons seem to have been getting more severe with more acres burned and presumably mo re damage to property and resources than in

should be protected from development while others contend that the areas should be available for developmenttype uses the principal clinton administration rule affecting roadless areas issued in 2001
