implement an automated entry and exit data system that would track the arrival and departure of every lien in 110 of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirir the objective was in part to develop mechanism that would be able to track nonimmigrants who overstayed their visas as part of broader emphasis on immigration control following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks there was shift in priority for implementing the system while the tracking of nonimmigrants who overstayed their visas remained an important goal border security has become the paramount concern legislation enacted from 1997 to 2 000 changed the sc ope and delayed implementation of 110 of iirira fo r example the ins data management improvement act rewrote 110 to require the development of system using data currently collected with new documen tary requirements the visa waiver permanent program act of 2000 required the development and implementation of fully automated entry and exit control system covering all aliens who enter the united states under the visa waiver prog ram vwp at airports and seaports following the terrorist attacks several provisions in the usa patriot act and the border security act however required the immediate implementation of an automated entry and exit data system and called for enhancements in its development more recently the intellig ence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 implements the 911 commission recommendations including those recommendations that pertain to the integrated entry and exit data system and biometric identifiers in travel documents tracking the entry and exit of foreign nati onals at us ports of entry is not small undertaking in fy2005 there we re over 428 million insp ections conducted at us ports of entry with the major ity of the inspections conducted on foreign nationals implementing the requirements of an automated entry and exit data system however is not without controversy some observers fear that the full implementation of usvisit will cause massive delays at us ports of entry primarily at land ports of entry some be lieve that the cost of implementing such system would outweigh the benefits othe rs express concern about the inadequacy of current infrastructure and the lack of consensus with respect to the type of biometric technology that s hould be used in travel documents many continue to question the purpose of such system some argue that resources should be directed at immigration interior enforcement rather than on an expensive system whose capability is not fully known the automated entry and exit data system was administratively renamed the united states visitor and immigrant status indicator technology usvisit it is being implemented

automated entry and exit data system volume of entries tracking the entry and exit of most foreign nationals at us ports of entry is not small undertaking in fy2005 there were over 428 million in spections conducted at us ports of entry with the major ity of the inspections conducted on foreign nationals most observers contend that implementing an automated entry and exit data system at the nations ports of entry poses variety of gistical problems as discussed below us ports there are 280 air land and sea ports of try in the united states the majority of travelers enter the united states at land port of entry land borders are unique because traffic at these crossings could consist in varying combinations of cars pedestrians bicycles trucks buses and rail moreover land ports of entry pose various challenges to the creation of an automated alien tracking system due to their location infrastructure geography and tra ffic volume which can vary extensively among ports of entry air and sea ports are faced with some of the same challenges present at land ports however the impact is not as intense as it is at land ports of entry while land ports of entry have heavy tr affic volume that could make fully implementing such program difficult some air port offici als and observers express concern that implementing the system could also disrupt th flow of traffic at air ports of entry airports have tried to delay the implement ation of an automated entry and exit data system and reportedly they were effective in pushing back the implementation date of the administrations first increment of the program to january 5 2004 primarily due to concerns of the potential slow down in the flow of traffic at the nations air ports of entry in addition to possible c ongestion at the nations air ports of entry some fear that the exit process may not be fully deve loped due to inadequate space sea ports also pose challenges to the implementation of an automated entry and exit data system similar to other ts sea ports do not have the necessary infrastructure moreover some sea ports of entry are not staffed fulltime with immigration or customs inspectors the arrivaldeparture record form i94 for many years the former ins had recorded nonimmigrant arrivals at airports on form i94 the arrivaldeparture recor d which is paperbased system thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32234crs3

departure portion is completed by the departure carrier and submitted to the department of homeland security dhs at the port of departure under current regulations the outbound carrier has 48 hours to submit the departure form i94 to dhs due to the cumbersome nature of this process and its unreliability congress required that commercial carriers transporting passengers to or from the us deliver arrival and departure mani fest information electronically to dhs later than january 1 2003 these reports are to be inte grated with data systems maintained by the department of justice doj and the depa rtment of state dos at ports of entry or at consular offices6 exit control the i94 arrivaldeparture record is rou tinely collected from applicable foreign nationals at air and sea ports reportedly it is rarely collected from applicable foreign nationals exiting at land ports according to many implementing the exit process of an automated entry and exit data system at most ports of entry will entail expanding the infrastructure which may be challenging at some ports see discussion in selected issues section the administration is currently in the third phase of implementation of the system and reportedly the exit pro cess is operable at selected ports of entry7 the full implementation of the exit process will be one of the challenges to the successful development of an automated entry and exit data system see discussion in implem entation of usvisit statutory history and other related laws there are five principal laws that ex tend and refine 110 of iirira to

encouraged more expeditious velopment of the automated entry and exit data system required that biometric identifiers be used in all visas and other travel documents and required that the system be inter operable with other law enforcement and national secu rity databases accordingly implementation of the relevant provisions in these six laws together are intended to result in an integrated

to develop an automated data system that would record the entry and exit of every alien arriving in and departing from the united states by september 30 19988 under this initial authorization the attorney general was re quired to develop an automated entry and exit control system not later than two ears after the enactment of iirira in 1996 the automated entry and exit data system would have created record for every alien arriving in the us and paired it with the record for the alien departing the united states the automated entry and exit data system was also supposed to enable the attorney general to identify through on line searching procedures lawfully admitted nonimmigrants who remained in the united states beyond the period authorized by the attorney general the act also mandated that the attorn ey general report to congress annually after the development of an automated entry and exit data system on the following the number of recorded departur by country of

indicate the alien is inadmissible for nonimmigrants subject to usvisit requirements entering the c ountry through land port of entry this process is conducted in secondary inspection41 for departures at designated air and s ea ports the foreign national traveler will go to work station or kiosk to scan his travel documents have his photograph compared and provide his fingerprints on the same type of device used at entry the departure information that traveler provides will be verified and matched against any available information that he or she provided upon inspection and that was previously

dmias prohibition on new documentary or data collection requirements58 dhs supports its conclusion with the reduction in authority clause of the dmia claiming the biometri c requirements found in the

passed after the dmia that encourage and require dhs to develop and utilize biometric technology for the implementation of the automated entry and exit data system wh ile these provisions do not appear to give the secretary of dhs or dos the explicit authority to promulgate new data collection or documentary requirements under 110 per the broad grant of authority in these provisions to implement an integrated entryexit system that utilizes biometric technology combined with the generous di scretion that is often afforded agencies implementing congressionally mandated pr ograms by

to promulgate regulations for alien departure and arrival the pr esident pursuant to executive order 13323 delegated his authority to promulgate these regulations to the secretary of dhs this delegation and its result the secretarys new authority to pr omulgate regulations for the entry and exit of aliens would likely correct any apparent deficiency in the authority cited by dhs still the fact that dhs claims that it may collect additional biometric data as the deployment of more comprehensive technologies becomes feasible may raise questions as to whether these new requirements are

issues in its most basic form usvisit is an automated entry and exit data system that tracks the arrival and depart ure of most foreign nationals to and from the united states the 2001 terrorist attacks howev er have led many to view usvisit as more than tracking system although not formally described as the following some have pegged usvisit as travel log mechanism to collect data risk assessment tool mechanism to reduce document fraud and terrorist and criminal watch list many observers have expr essed concern with the implementation of usvisit observers fear that the full implementation of usvisit will cause massive delays at us ports of entry primar ily at land ports of entry some believe that the cost of implementing such system would outweigh the benefits others expressed concern about the inadequacy of curre nt infrastructure and the l ack of consensus with respect to the type of biometric technology that should be used in travel documents75 many continue to question the purpose of such system some argue that resources should be directed at immigration interior enforcement rather than on an expensive system whose capability is not fully known some may also argue that the implementation of usvisit is not in compliance with its statutory deadlines for example while the entry system appears to be in place at all ports of entry the exit process is not fully veloped some might argue that the lack of an exit system at all ports of entry is contrary to the programs authorizing language which requires the secretary of dhs to fully implement the integrated entry and exit data system by december 31 2005 emphasis added others however might contend that the language is ambiguous and that full implementation of exit features at some ts of entry is sufficient to meet the statutes mandate number of issues may complicate this issue and the actual time line for implementation including the us of pilot programs new or varying technologies between ports and funding levels infrastructure and facilit needs at the border many maintain that the successful development of an automated try and exit data system may require the united states and quite possibly its ne ighbors canada and mexico to expand infrastructure at land border crossings th current infrastructure at most us ports of entry reportedly is not sufficient to accommodate the demands of an automated entry and exit data system for example according to some observers at many land ports of entry additional lanes may be necessary to accommodate the number of individuals seeking entry into the united states who will need to be processed through the system moreover in order to record the departure of every alien leavinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32234crs24 76 this fear may be unwarranted because under current law and dhs regulations canadian nationals and legal permanent residents of ca would be exempt from the requirements of the usvisit program 77 testimony of ins

this could lead to significant delays as travelers try to make their way through ports of entry others assert th at the cost of expanding the infrastructure would be great with respect to air and sea ports of try concerns similar to those about land ports of entry have been expressed for example securing adequate space and facilities may prove challenging at many air and sea ports of entry particularly for the exit process moreover in many instances passengers are inspected on board vessels because of inadequate or nonexistent inspection areas at sea ports of entry with respect to the northern border ma ny businesses as well as the canadian government fear that the implementation of such system would clog the border76 there have been reports that the canadi an government may introduce plan that would have canadian customs officials collect exit information on noncitizens and pass it on to united states officials such plan could further aid the united states in identifying noncitizens who may enter the country moreover as the united states begins to implement the usvisit program the demand for improved infrastructure may be critical for its development it is unclear if canada will facilitate such system by extending its infrastructure at the relevant border crossings interior enforcement one of the purposes of the usvisit program is to track nonimmigrants who overstay the terms of their visas it is not clear if the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice will have adequate resources to track down those who overstay their visas once the usvisit program is implemented many have argued that enforcement of immigration law within the interior of the country has lacked suffici ent resources prior to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the immigration nd nationalization service ins had less than 2000 immigration agents to enforce immigration laws within the united states and during 2002 hearing the former ins commissioner james zi glar testified that the terrorist attacks prompted the ins to reassign many investigators to work on terrorism investigations77 although that number has not changed since the terrorist attacks the merging

since the consolidation of the former ins and cust oms many continue to express concerns that the number is insufficient to adequately enforce immigration laws moreover although the consolidation increased the number of interior enforcement agents customs needs to continue to carry out its interior enforcement missions of stemming the flow of illicit drugs and deterring money laundering am ong other things these critics argue that if the intent of the entry and exit system is to document nonimmigrants who overstay their visas then more resources should be directed at interior enforcement and integrating existing immigration databases rather than on developing and impleme nting new system privacy issues the usvisit programs increment i privacy impact assessment was made available to the public on december 18 2003 many observers stress the importance of having individuals privacy rights protected due to the potential for unauthorized use of pe rsonal information while some observers maintain that current law79 requires privacy impact assessment before developing and purchasing new technology that will collect or store personal information electronically the administration maintains that it is using existing databases during the first phase of the prog rams implementation some observers however view the introduction of biometrics as evidence that the administration is using new technology the administration published privacy impact assessment prior to the actual implementation of the program and according to the national institutes of standards and technology nist in its report to congress the biometric data that the us government would collect from foreign nationals disclose limited amount of personal information and do not raise significant privacy concerns specifica lly the personal information disclosed by the biometric data relates to the iden tity facial photographs do not disclose information that the person does not routin ely disclose to the general public and their use to verify identity obviously raises serious privacy concerns moreover fingerprints disclose very little other information about person other than the persons identity accordingly their use as biometric does not raise the sorts of privacy concerns that migh t arise from the use of other biometrics that in addition to verifying identity c ould also conceivably disclose secondary eg medical healthrelated information80 information technology interoperability the usa patriot act called for the automated entry and exit data system to

required the former ins to integrate all of its databases several gao studies criticized the former ins for having antiquated databases and failing to integrate its system81 reportedly the administration is currently using the ident system to capture two flat fingerprints instead of 10 fingerprints while the two fingerprint system is sufficient for iden tifying person some contend that two fingerprints may not be sufficient to return match from the federal bureau of investigations ten fingerprint system critical to the success of border security is the ability to process information in real time quickly enough to accommodate the pace and volume of work without information obtained in real time there is potential for backlog to occur the issue of making real time information available to the immigration inspectors processing foreign nationals seeking entry at us ports of entry is highlighted at many of the nations sea ports of entry as previously mentioned many inspections of travelers seeking entry into the united st ates at sea port of entry occurs on board the vessel immigration inspectors use the portable automated lookout system pals which is laptop computer that contains cdrom that is updated monthly and contains lookout inform ation on individuals who are deemed inadmissible to the united states lthough some may view this method as problematic primarily due to the potential for the information to be outdated sea vessels like their air carrier counterparts are required under law to submit passenger manifests in advance to their arrival at us port of entry submitting the passenger information in advance of arrival allows the immigration inspector to query real time databases databases while some observers question the ability of usvisit to carry out its mission many agree that the progra ms usefulness will pend in large part on the quality and accuracy of the various watchlists that are integrated with the immigration databases that comprise usvisit it is unclear however how many watchlists are included in usvisit and whether they are integrated in addition to the first hand knowledg immigration inspectors must have they also must be familiar with the numerous databases moreover dos and dhs use ident to store the biometrics for those foreign national travelers who are subject to the usvisit program requirements some contend that the ident database which contains recidivism and l ookout data on foreign nationals who have previously been apprehended should not be used to store the biometrics of admissible foreign nationals they argue that in addition to the number of databases that are accessed through the usvisit program the inclus ion of biometrics on inadmissible foreign nationals with those who are admissibl in ident may confuse the inspectorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32234crs27 82 congressional research service analysis of the former immigration and naturalization service workload datatraining needs and resources prior to the transfer of immigration and customs functions to dhs the agencies ins and the us customs service cross trained their inspectors to perform primary inspections upon referral to secondary inspections however more experienced inspector with the designated agency would perform the inspection ie an immigration matter would be referred to an immigration inspector and customs matter would be referred to customs inspector some have expressed concern that the discretion given to immigration inspectors and the complexity of immigration law requires substantial training moreover inspectors must have knowledge of the various docum ents and databases that are used to determine admissibility in spectors at us ports of entry must make an immediate determination that an undocumented alien or someone who has questionable documents should be excluded or detained for further processing by an immigration court now that dhs has implemented its one face at the border initiative some have questioned the adequacy of traini ng that is provided to the nonimmigration inspectors observers view the usvisit program as one more layer of technology that must be mastered by the immigration inspector while some contend that the first increment of the program has not in troduced new technology others contend that inspectors who may not already be familiar with current immigration databases are now expected to be competent with the usvisit database facilitation of travel and commerce many contend that programs such as nexus the secure electronic network for travelers rapid inspection sentri and the free and secure trade fast program that facilitate the speedy passage of low risk frequent travelers and commerce are essential the number of travelers who took advantage of automated inspections has risen over the recent years peaking to 26 million in fy200282 it is not clear how these programs will be incorporated into usvisit and how participants of these programs will be vetted through the system feasibility of implementation and policy questions many have questioned the feasibility of implementing the usvisit program while many observers question the ability of the administration to meet the congressionally mandated time line others question the financial burden of implementing such system some contend that until the limits and capabilities of usvisit are determined it will be difficu lt to assess its progress to wards its mission proponents however point to the success stories that have been reported since the implementation of usvisit as providing proof that the program is achieving its missionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32234crs28 83 see 69 federal register 468 469 84 eo 13323 69 federal register 241 jan 2
