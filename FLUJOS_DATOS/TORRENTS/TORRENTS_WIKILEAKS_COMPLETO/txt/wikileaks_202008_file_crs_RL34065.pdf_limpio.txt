for fy2007 pl 11028 enacted on may 25 2007 included provisions permitting the cancellation of the 13 billion in special community disaster loans cdls approved by the federa l emergency management agency fema under two laws enacted during the 109th congress in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita areas struck by disaster often experience destruction of property and decline in economic activity local revenue collections may fall substantially as consequence the federal community disaster loan program administer ed by fema is intended to assist local governments that experience revenue losses as the result of presidentially declared major disaster the traditional cdl program provides for loan forgiveness cancellation when it is determined for three fiscal years following disaster that the affected government will not be able to repay the loan from the initiation of the program in august 1976 through september 30 2005 of the total of 2335 million in principal advanced 2257 million or 97 was for loan amounts that were cancelled five loans in excess of 5 million accounted for 90 of the cancelled principal to restrain program costs in 2000 5 million limit was placed on loan that any one jurisdiction can receive through the traditional cdl program for single disaster on october 7 2005 both houses of congress approved and president bush signed the community disaster loan act of 2005 cdla pl 10988 the cdla provided for special community disaster loans up to an aggregate of 1 billion in principal amount to local governments so they could continue to provide essential services in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita for these special loans the new law removed the 5 million per loan limit but prohibited their cancellation within two weeks of enactment companion bills were introduced to remove the prohibition on cancellation but they were not voted upon the emergency supplemental appropriations act of 2006 pl 109234 enacted on june 15 2006 included an appropriation to support an additional 371733 million in cdls these loans were available only to communities that had lost 25 or more of their tax revenues as the result of hurricane katrina or rita again the 5 million limit was removed but cancellation of the loans was prohibited efforts to permit the cancellation of both groups of special cdls authorized by the 109 th congress resumed early in the 110th congress such provisions were included in hr 1591 the emergency supplemental appropriations bill for fy2007 vetoed by president bush on may 2 2007 and again in hr 2206 the emergency supplemental that was finally enacted as pl 110 28 the original appropriations for the loans had assumed 75 default rate the congressional budget office cbo estimated the cost of permitting cancellation of the 127 billion in loans to be an additional 321 million this report is the followup to crs report rl33174 fema s community disaster loan program action in the 109 th congress by nonna

lives and the dislocation of hundreds of thousands of families hurricane katrina on august 29 2005 and hurricane rita on september 24 2005 caused devastating damage to property and seriously disrupted the economic activity that normally provided the tax and revenue base of the affected areas especially in louisiana and mississippi there was concern in congress and elsewhere but particularly in the taxexempt bond community that the destruction of the underlying tax base would impair the ability of gulf coast communities to make the payments on their outstanding debt let alone their ability to issue new debt 1 these communities also faced the loss of revenues needed to finance normal operating expenses beyond debt servicing and possibly additional operating expenses engendered by the hurricane disasters this point was brought home when new orleans mayor c ray nagin announced on october 4 2005 that he would have to lay off 3000 municipal employees50 of the citys work forcedue to lack of revenue2 the community disaster loan cdl program administered by the federal emergency management agency fema is program of federal aid available to local governments specifically to replace revenues lost as the result of natural or manmade disaster these are the revenues needed to pay for normal operating expenses such as fire and police services public schools and debt servicing this aid is available in addition to the federal disaster aid provided to replace damaged public infrastructure and to address special stormrelated expenses such as debris removal the community disaster loan program is unique in permitting local governments struck by disasters to borrow directly from the federal government it has also been unique in giving the federal administrators of the loan program the authority to cancel the borrowers obligation to repay the loan under specified local budget conditions state and local governments are generally prohibited by state constitutions or laws from issuing municipal debt to finance deficits in their operating budgets indeed the regulations governing traditional cdls prohibit loan cancellation to finance budget deficit that was anticipated before the disaster 3 the cdl program is intended specifically to permit community to borrow to pay for operating expenses after its revenue base has been damaged by disaster in the 109th congress on single dayoctober 7 2005both the senate and the house of representatives approved and president bush signed into law the community disaster loan act of 2005 cdla pl 10988 the act provided for up to 750 millionof the 50 billion previously appropriated for disaster assistance following hurricane katrinato be available to support up to 1 billion in special cdls to local governments affected by the hurricanes in addition it made two important changes in the conditions governing these loans compared with traditional cdls it removed the 5 million per loan limit and prohibited the cancellation forgiveness of these loans nonetheless the ra tio of appropriations to loan limit was based on 1 leslie wayne tax bases shattered gulf region faces debt crisis new york times september 13 2005 pp c1

default rate on the loans subsequently fema approved loans totaling the full 1 billion permitted by the cdla efforts soon began to remove the prohibition on the cancellation of the special cdls companion bills to that effect were introduced in late october 2005 but were never voted upon by the 109th congress the emergency supplemental appropriations act of 2006 pl 109234 enacted on june 15 2006 included an appropriation of 2798 million to support an additional 371733 million in direct loans to communities affected by hurricanes during the 2005 season once again the ratio of appropriations to loan limit was based on the assumption of 75 default rate on the loans these supplemental loans were available to communities that lost 25 or more of their tax revenues as the result of hurricanes katrina or rita this law again removed the 5 million per loan limit and prohibited cancellation of these loans it also raised the size limit for loan from 25 to 50 of communitys operating budget fema approved loans totaling 271 million to all eligible applicants 101 million of the loan authorization was not used the safe port act pl 109347 enacted on october 13 2006 raised the size limit for traditional cdl from 25 to 50 of local governments annual operating budget if that government lost 75 or more of its tax and other revenue as the result of major disaster the 5 million per loan limit and the cancellation option still apply to traditional cdls efforts began early in the 110 th congress to permit the cancellation of the two groups of community disaster loans specifically authorized by the 109th congress several bills were introduced in the first three months of 2007 provisions enabling cancellation of those loans were included in hr 1591 the initial emergency supplemental appropriations bill for fy2007 that was approved by congress but vetoed by president george w bush on may 1 2007 for reasons related to the war in iraq the same cdl provisions were included in hr 2206 the emergency supplemental for fy2007 that was enacted as pl 11028 on may 25 2007 the original appropriations for the loans in 2005 and 2006 had already covered 75 of the principal amount the congression budget office cbo estimated the cost of permitting cancellation of the principal and interest due on the 127 billion in loans to be an additional 321 million measured

disaster relief and emergency assistance act5 is popularly known as the stafford act the stafford act authorizes the president to issue major disaster declarations that authorize federal agencies to provide assistance to states overwhelmed by disasters through executive orders the president has delegated to the federal emergency management agency fema within the department of homeland security dhs responsibility for administering the major provisions of the stafford act assistance authorized by the statute is available to individuals families state and local governments and certain nonprofit organizations 6 of particular relevance to local governments is section 417 of the stafford act7 section 417 authorizes the president to make loans to any local government which may suffer substantial loss of tax and other revenues as result of major disaster and has demonstrated need for financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions loan may be approved in either the fiscal year in which the disaster occurs or the fiscal year immediately following only one cdl may be approved for any one local government as the result of single disaster8 the amount of loan is based on need and is not to exceed 25 of the annual operating budget of the local government for the local governments fiscal year in which the major disaster occurs the safe port act pl 109347 enacted on october 13 2006 raised the size limit for traditional cdl from 25 to 50 of local governments annual operating budget if that government lost 75 or more of its tax and other revenue as the result of major disaster in addition as result of an amendment made in 2000 the dollar amount of any loan is limited to 5 million 9 the obligation to repay the loan is to be cancelled if the localitys revenues in the three fiscal years following the disaster are deemed insufficient by fema or its outside auditors the normal term of cdl is five years the loan typically takes the form of fiveyear balloon that is the full principal and accumulated interest are due all together at the end of the fiveyear term the associate director of fema may consider requests for an extension based on the local governments financial condition however the total term of loan normally may not exceed 10 years except under extenuating circumstances 10 the interest rate on cdls is based on the average rate on the date of the loan approval for us treasury obligations with maturities of five years the interest rate on cdls is higher than the average rate on municipal state and local bonds of similar maturity this is because the federal tax exemption of interest on state and local government bonds enables those governments to sell bonds at lower interest rates than comparable federal bonds the relatively higher cdl rate implies that localities with strong credit ratings would be better off borrowing from the private 5 pl 93288 as amended 42 usc 5121 et seq 6 crs report rl33053 federal

available to locality under other parts of the stafford act local government may use the borrowed funds to carry on existing local government functions of municipal operation character or to expand such functions to meet disasterrelated needs11 the funds are not to be used to finance capital improvements or the repair or restoration of damaged public facilities neither the loans nor any cancelled portion of the loans may be used as the nonfederal share of any federal program including those under the stafford act12 for loan cancellation purposes unreimbursed expenses of municipal

an outside auditing firm to perform the required analysis of the communitys operating budget this outside analysis is combined with data and information that the jurisdiction provides to fema in support of its loan application or cancellation application the code of federal regulations cfr assigns the primary responsibility for both making and canceling cdls to the associate director of fema

an additional 1 million of the disaster relief funds provided by pl 10962 to be transferred to the disaster assistance direct loan program for administrative expenses to carry out the direct loan program21 the new law made three changes to the cdl prog ram law with respect to the special community disaster loans scdls to be made under this section first an scdl may exceed the 5 million limit placed on traditional loans made under section 417 the limit of 25 of the localitys operating budget still applied second the cancellation forgiveness of such loans was prohibited third the law directed that the loans be used to assist local governments in providing essential services the provision eliminating the possibility of loan cancellation was reportedly insisted upon by the bush administration office of management and budget and the republican leadership in the house as condition for providing the loan assistance 22 several members made statements on the house and senate floors objecting to the requirement that the loans be repaid23 representative david obey requested that requirement be included to report to congress about the size and use of the loans made24 there were assurances from representative richard baker that mr obeys concern would be addressed after the columbus day recess25 but it was not the interim rules implementing the special community disaster loans program were published on october 18 200526 the standard interest rate on scdls is again the average rate on treasury issues with fiveyear maturities however the rules provide that fema would have the discretion to allow localities facing unique economic hardships to receive discounted interest rates at levels consistent with the lowest rate offered by the small business administrations disaster loan program27 formula was provided for determining the discounted interest rate the subsidized rate would be the us treasurys five year maturity rate plus one percentum adjusted to the nearest 18 and reduced by onehalf for example assume that the yield on fiveyear treasury bonds were 432 as it was on october 21 2005 adding one percentum would give 532 rounding that to the nearest 18 would give 538 reducing that by onehalf would give 21116 269 as the subsidized interest rate on scdls the federal budget for fy2007 assumed that the borrower interest rate for the cdl program would be 270 during fy200628 21 for comparison femas budget request for fy2006 was for 567000 to administer the entire disaster assistance direct loan program which includes state share loans in addition to

the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and hurricane recovery 2006 hr 4939 as amended pl 109234 was enacted on june 15 200629 among its many provisions it appropriated an additional 2798 million for the disaster assistance direct loan program account of which 1 million was for administrative expenses the remaining 2788 million was to subsidize gross obligations for the principal amount of direct loans up to 371733 million as with the special community disaster loan scdl program authorized under the cdla of 2005 th is numerical relationship was

essential services as with the scdls the loans made under this law may not be cancelled loans were available only to local governments that suffered loss of 25 or more in tax revenues due to hurricane katrina or hurricane rita this is in contrast to the reference in section 417 of the stafford act to substantial loss of tax and other revenues as was provided for the special cdls loan could exceed the 5 million limit placed on traditional cdls in addition the loan could equal not more than 50 of the annual operating budget of the local government this is in contrast to the 25ofbudget limit that applies to both traditional and special cdls because specific language was included to indicate that the funds would be available until expended it was interpreted by fema that the loans must be made by september 30 2006 the end of fy2006 to take advantage of the supplemental appropriation the same time limit applied to the original scdls this placed time pressure on the loan application approval and dispersal process because the percentofbudget limit was raised to 50 communities that applied in the first round for scdls of up to 25 of their operating budget could apply for an additional 25

1974 until 2000 there was dollar limit on the size of loan that could be made to an individual local government through the traditional cdl program the 2000 amendment limited the loan to any individual local government to 5 million and provided that additional loan would be made to community that is in arrears on payments under previous loan 38 congress made these changes to help control cdl program costs both the cdla of 2005 and the emergency supplemental of 2006 took two other approaches to controlling the cost of the particular cdl programs that they created while they lifted the 5 million cap on an individual loan39 both laws prohibited the cancellation of any loan made under their auspices both laws also specified an upper limit on the aggregate principal amount of loans that could be made based upon the dollars of subsidy appropriated the community disaster loan act of 2005 pl 10988 provided that up to 750 million of amounts previously appropriated by pl 10962 for disaster relief could be transferred to the disaster assistance direct loan program for the cost of direct loans as authorized under section 417 of the stafford act the transfer was permitted to subsidize gross obligations for the principal amount of direct loans not to exceed 1 billion an additional 1 million was allocated for administering the loans the emergency supplemental appropriations act of 2006 pl 109234 appropriated an additional 2798 million for the disaster assistance direct loan program account of which 1 million was for administrative expenses the remaining 2788 million was

up to 371733 million as set forth in the 2006 emergency supplemental42 the 75 subsidy rate assumed for the special cdls was lower than the subsidy rate ascribed to traditional cdls fema has estimated the credit subsidy rate of the traditional cdl program at just over 93 for each fiscal year from 2005 through 2008 this subsidy is made up of two components an interest rate subsidy and all other the interest rate subsidy accounts for the borrowers interest rate being below the federal governments cost of borrowing funds the all other category includes cancellation of principal and interest payments part of the subsidy for traditional cdls is attributed to the other two explanatory categories of defaults net of recoveries or fees for fy2005 for example the traditional cdl progra m had an estimated credit subsidy rate of 9343 of this 372 was attributed to the interest rate and 8972 to all other from fy2005 to fy2008 the interest component was projected to rise slightly to 501 as interest rates rose 43 essentially offsetting this the all other component fell slightly to 8829 net in each of the four years the total estimated subsidy rate remained in the very narrow band from 9330 to 9343 roughly speaking this means that for every 100 million of traditional community disaster loans made the federal government is assumed to provide subsidy of 93 million of that 5 million subsidizes an interest rate for borrowers that is lower than the federal borrowing rate and 88 million covers principal and interest payments that are cancelled forgiven by fema 44 this was by far the highest estimated subsidy rate among all of the federal governments direct loan and loan guarantee programs listed in the fy2006 budget45 even at 75 the special and emergency supplemental cdl programs had the second highest subsidy rate estimated for fy2006 among all of the federal direct loan and loan guarantee programs listed in the fy2007 budget 46 all of the 75 subsidy rate for special cdls for fy2006 was attributed to defaults net of recoveries and none to interest47 this was despite an explicit interest subsidy for the program all 42 278799750 75 371733000 equivalently 371733000 x 75

traditional cdl program the laws that authorized the special and emergency supplemental cdls prohibited their cancellation by fema this was in direct contrast to the rules governing traditional cdls at the same time 75 default rate was assumed for both groups of special cdls the subsidy appropriated was intended to cover potential defaults on both the principal amounts loaned and the interest due in response to the modification of the rules governing the special cdls to permit their cancellation the estimated subsidy rate may be raised from 75 to 92 comparable to traditional cdls or even to

local governments affected by hurricanes katrina and rita should be treated as loans that must be repaid or as loans that could be cancelled forgiven the effect of cancelling the loan repayment obligation is to conver t the loan into grant for the community indeed the community disaster program for local governments began in 1970 as program of community disaster grants in 1974 congress replaced the grant program with program of community disaster loans53 however the loan program was accompanied by provision requiring mandatory cancellation of the obligation to repay all or part of the loan under specified local budget conditions in contrast the funds advanced under the 2005 cdla or the 2006 emergency supplemental were to be treated strictly as repayable loans 1995 report by femas office of inspector general recommended considering the conversion of the community disaster loan program into grant program because so few of the loans were expected to be repaid and because it requires much less time effort and expense to administer grant program than loan program 54 in 1996 femas director of the office of policy and regional operations noted that the subsidy rate for the cdl program was close to 90 for fy1996 and close to 100 for fy1997 he said that femas goal was to terminate the loan program or if not terminate to administer it as grant program55 in 1997 congressional testimony then fema director james lee witt asked rhetorically then let it be grant program if they cant pay the money back why spend all the money we are having to spend administratively to support these loans and to have accounting firms go in and do audits of the cities or governments that are getting the loans if they are not being repaid 56 with grant program immediate revenue relief could be provided to local jurisdictions in disaster area without saddling them with additiona l debt on the other hand with possibility of interest or principal repayments grant program would cost the federal government more per dollar of aid delivered than loan program in addition grant program would likely be used by more jurisdictions than loan program and could thus be considerably more expensive for federal taxpayers larger program would redistribute more resources from nonaffected areas to areas affected by disaster 53 the evolution of the cdl program is

the traditional cdl program has been used infrequently relative to the number of declared disasters from the first loans made in august 1976 through september 30 2005 period of 29 years fema received 64 loan applications related to 21 separate disasters of those 64 applications four were withdrawn by the community and five were suspended because another federal aid program was then available to school districts through the department of education fema approved the remaining 55 loan requests and disbursed funds in contrast over the same period there were 1104 declared major disasters many of which affected more than one local jurisdiction community disaster loans were made from fy1999 through fy2005 even though this period included the multiple florida hurricanes of 2004 the fema data summarized in table 3 in millions of dollars and table 4 as percentage of total for loans disbursed suggest that the traditional cdl program is more accurately described as grant program with small loan component this is because the cdl program has experienced high rate of loan cancellation measured in dollar terms of the 2335 million in total loan principal disbursed 1687 million or 722 went to 16 loans that were fully cancelled another 570 million or 244 was the amount of principal cancelled for the six loans that were partially cancelled adding thes two categories together indicates that 2257 million or 966 of the total loan principal disbursed was cancelled the repayment experience looks better when measured simply by the number of loans thirtysix or twothirds of the 55 individual loans were paid back in part or in full however many of these loans were for amounts as small as 500 or 1000 altogether these loans repaid only 55 million or 23 of the total principal amount loaned by the cdl program when the loan principal was cancelled generally so was the interest due in addition to the 2257 million in loan principal that was cancelled so was 953 million in interest owed in contrast loans that were paid back in part or in full paid only 101 million in interest t able 3 comm unity disaster loan pr gram fr om the first loans in august 1976 thr ough september 30 2005 amou

in the gulf region including new orleans could not benefit significantly from the traditional cdl program because of the loan limit of 5 million per jurisdiction per disaster removing the 5 million limit is likely to deliver more federal aid to large jurisdictions than would be allowed under traditional program rules the primary argument against eliminating the 5 million cap is the greater potential cost to the federal government total of five of the 55 cdls approved through september 2005 under the traditional cdl program exceeded the 5 million cap together they accounted for 90 of the cancelled principal and 93 of the cancelled principal and interest see table 5 this suggests that removal of the 5 million cap is likely to increase the federal cost of the program if there are defaults on large loans

borrowing governments operating budget in the fiscal year of the disaster eventachieved the objective of capping the federal exposure albeit at higher level that cap was raised to 50 for the loans made under the 2006 emergency supplemental appropriations act pl 109234 which also removed the 5 million per loan cap section 608 of the safe port act pl 109347 ra ised the size limit for traditional community disaster loan from 25 to 50 of the annual operating budget of the local government for the fiscal year in which the major disaster occursunder particular condition the local governments loss of tax and other revenues as result of the major disaster must equal at least 75 of the annual operating budget of that local government for the fiscal year in which the major disaster occurs the 5 million per loan cap and the cancellation option still apply to traditional cdls this combination of rules would appear to offer substantial aid to small local governments in geographic area

provision for the special and emergency supplemental cdls was that the administrators of the loan program would have considerable latitude in setting the terms of repayment for the loans which include both the interest rate and the time period of the loan57 however according to the interim regulations accompanying cdla of 2005 the time period for repayment is the same for the special program as it is for the traditional program this is typically five years and not to exceed 10 years except in cases of exceptional financial hardship58 57 statement of rep baker congressional record daily edition

provides fema administrators the option of offering lower interest rate to communities judged to be in more serious financial distress according to fema all gulf jurisdictions were eligible for the subsidized interest rate on the special and emergency supplemental cdls lowering the interest rate is intended to reduce the burden of repaying the loan this is counter to the usual practice in credit markets where borrowers judged more financially risky typically face higher interest rate than those judged more likely to repay however it does parallel the treatment of physical disaster business loans offered by the small business administration sba to businesses that have not been able to obtain credit elsewhere 59 lower interest rate would by design increase the attractiveness of the cdl program to more governments the likely increased demand for the loans would increase the federal cost of the program the larger interest subsidy alone would add to the cost of the program even if the loans were repaid attracting less creditworthy borrowers is likely to raise the risk of default on the loans further increasing the cost of the program in contrast policy of linking the cdl interest rate to the underlying credit rating of the borrowing government could reduce the adverse selection that may exist under both the traditional and special cdl programs 60 for example setting the interest rate at fixed amount number of basis points or percentage below the local governments current fiveyear bond rate is method that could be easily implemented by fema yet would still reduce the burden on the borrowing government g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g10g146g156g157g152g155g162g561 over its history the community disaster program has taken the form of both grant

act of 1970 pl 91606 provided for community disaster gran ts the grant provisions originated in house amendment to s 3619 the president was authorized to make grants to any local government which as the result of major disaster had suffered substantial loss of property tax revenue both real and personal grant could be made fo r the year of the disaster and the following two tax years the grants were intended to replace lost property tax revenue the locality was expected to maintain its tax rate and assessed value factors at their predisaster levels specifically the grant 59 the sba sets maximum interest rate of 4 per year and maximum maturity of 30 years on loans to borrowers judged unable to obtain credit elsewhere for businesses that sba determines can obtain credit elsewhere the interest rate charged by sba cannot exceed what is being charged in the private market at the time of the disaster or 8 whichever is less and the maturity period cannot ex ceed three years httpwwwsbagov 60 the term adverse selection refers to the concept in insurance markets whereby only those who will likely need insurance are most likely to purchase policies in the context of cdls it

the conference committee on s 3619 did not adopt the provisions of the bill passed by the senate which proposed loan program instead of the grant program the senatepassed bill would have authorized 100 million to establish community disaster loan fund in the treasury the fund would have provided loans to local governments for three purposes 1 meeting interest and principal payments on outstanding bonded indebtedness 2 paying the local share of federal grantinaid programs necessary to restore the disaster area and 3 providing and maintaining essential public services such as fire and police protection to qualify for loan local government would have to have suffered loss of more than 25 of its tax base or such substantial amount that it could not otherwise meet payments on its debt obligations its matching shares or its essential public services the size of the loan was linked to the loss of property tax revenues in the same way as the grant program that was adopted the loans would be interestfree for the first two ye ars the term of the loan could not exceed 20 years the interest rate on the loans would be determined by the secretary of the treasury based on the current average market yield on 10 to 12year us treasury obligations less an adjustment not to exceed 2 per year the president would be authorized to defer the initial payments on the loans for five years or half the term of the loan whichever was less such sums as the president might determine necessary could be transferred to the fund from disaster relief appropriations in turn the president could transfer excess monies in the fund to the general fund of the treasury or to disaster relief appropriations 61

act authorized the president to make loans to any local government which suffers substantial loss of tax and other revenues which the conferees intended to include utility revenues as result of major disaster and has demonstrated need for financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions the legislative history of the act gives as examples of municipal services the protection of public health and safety and the operation of the public school system the amount of the loan is to be based on need but may not exceed 25 of the annual operating budget of the local government for the fiscal year in which the major disaster occurs repayment of all or any part of the loan is to be cancelled to the extent that revenues of the local government during the three full fiscal years following the major disaster are insufficient to meet the operating budget of the local government this budget may include additional disasterrelated expenses of municipal operation character the 1974 act also provided that any loans made under this section would not reduce or otherwise affect any grants or other assistance under the stafford act the enacted provisions regarding cdls originated in s 3062 the disaster relief act amendments of 1974 as approved by the senate there was counterpart in the house amendment to s 3062 the conference substitute amendment made the cancellation of community disaster loans mandatory under the specified conditions the senatepassed bill had authorized the president to cancel all or part of the cdls under the specified conditions 63 the senate

made to local government under section 417 of the stafford act section 2075 of the disaster mitigation act of 2000 pl 106390 placed limit of 5 million on the size of the loan that could be made to local government this dollar limit was in addition to the limit of 25 of the operating budget the 2000 amendments also provided that local government cannot receive additional assistance under section 417 if it is in arrears on payments for previous loan 65 in placing these limits congress was reportedly reacting to two very large loans that had been made to the virgin islands in the aftermath of hurricane hugo in 1989 and hurricane marilyn in 1995 for which repayment was cancelled see table 3 earlier in this report section 204a of hr 707 as passed by the h ouse would have repealed section 417 of the stafford act and thereby eliminated the disaster loan program it was section 207 of hr 707 as passed by the senate which contained the amendments to section 417 that were adopted in the enacted bill 63 legislative history of pl 93288 disaster relief act of 1974 united states code congressional and administrative news 93rd cong 2nd sess 1974 vol 2 st paul minn west publishing co 1975 pp 3077
