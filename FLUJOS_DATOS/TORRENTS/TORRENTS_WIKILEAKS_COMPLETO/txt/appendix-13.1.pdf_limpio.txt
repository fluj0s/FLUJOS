of syndication companies even when requested to do so during disco very proceedings md willie botha explained the rationale the plain tiff sharemax is not at liberty to simply make availab to the defendant yours truly those companies financial statements the defendant should strictly speaking be knocking at the door of those companies by way of subpoena duces tecum johan cronjé candidate attorney of thys cronjé inc duly handed coenie willemse sharemaxs attorney subp oena on the first day of what was supposed to be the tri sharemax refused to comply and launched an applicat ion to set aside the subpoena among others botha proclaim ed i am convinced that the reason why the respondent is now seeking the production of the financial statements of the compa nies referred to is exactly the same it is not because he truly believes such financial statements to be relevant to the issues in the applicantplaintiffs action his sole motive for requiring the production of these financial stateme nts i verily believe is to 2 obtain additional material as basis for the publi cation of further information about the applicantplaintiff i therefore submit t he respondent by serving the subpoena acted with an ulterior motive and not with the purpose of furthering his cause in the pending litigation with the applicantplaintiff1 i replied i will demonstrate during trial that the witness s answer to the subpoena duces tucem and the plaintiffs general conduct in this trial i s one of non disclosure which was exactly my complaints in rela tion to the business activities of the plaintiff in the articles complai ned of 2 as we now know the trial didnt go ahead in his re ply to botha stated that my assertion that sharemaxs busi ness activities are one of nondisclosure was cheap shot3 what botha conveniently forgot is that financial st atements of public companies are public documents4 both in and outside court processes he had refused open access open access means that the motives for asking for these financial statements are irrelevant the fact is that regulators underestimate the value of disclosure they in particular cipro should actua lly encourage and make it easy for the public to vigoro usly seek access to public disclosures and to consult their p rofessional advisors about them they may very well be surprise d at how positive an impact it would have on their task as regulators as matter of course cipro should on receipt mak financial statements of controversial public compan ies available to the fsb the consumer affairs committe and to the registrar of banks sharemax as promoter is private company and has to file financial statements with the fsb in terms of secti on 19 of the fais act given the substantive interplay betwe sharemax and dozens of

as propagated by andré prakke5 is not such farfetched idea with reference to waterglen shopping centre prakke points out that it is stated condition in the prospectus that sharemax will at all times have three directors on the board of all these entities for minimum period of five years he argues that the companies act specifies that whe re company controls the decisionmaking of another com pany

should company wish not to consolidate the result s of its subsidiaries over which it has control permission c an be sought from the registrar of companies sharemax d id not seek such permission6 by

publi c companies this early application of funds has been severely c riticized by andré prakke partial withdrawals of funds will take place within 7 days of receipt of the funds from an applicant subscribing to the issue of shares this means that allotment has taken place ahead of the completion f the prospectus and the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary to acqu ire the property of

balance sheet reflects debtors of r1 7m and cash of r64m the balance sheet further reflects unidentified current liabilities of r5m leaving n et asset value of r31m it further shows that debentures of r744m had been repaid and the income statement shows that dividends of r186m had been paid to shareholders21 adding the debentures redeemed to the dividend give s net sale value of r93m which is again different from th numbers earlier presented by sharemax i must add t hat it is possible that the current liabilities may in fac t be debentures which were reclassified and which will p ush up the net sale value to r98m the summarized income statement does not help at l to clarify the mystery of the cost factors which reduc ed the gross sale value of r113m to net sale value of r9 71m and how in fact could the company possibly still ve balance sheet with assets and liabilities on 29 feb ruary 2008 if it was put into voluntary liquidation on 3 novem ber 2006 without any assets or liabilities ominously dark cloud hangs over the sale transac tions nevertheless lets give the bluff as star perf ormer in the sharemax portfolio the benefit of the doubt and as sume shareholders have been paid in

listed companies with much lower risk profiles the lower risk stems from greater liquidity for investors in liste d companies and from the diverse spread of properties being hel d in their portfolios the comparison looks even bleaker for sharemax if t he net sale value of r971m is taken into account then th capital uplift reduces to 305 for investments in listed property the cost effect is likely to be much smaller becaus brokerage is minuscule in comparison to sharemaxs cost that means the gap in performance will be even bigg er than that reflected in table 133 together with the other properties that were sold b sharemax at later stage various items such as co st of sales trade creditors and provisions provisions f or administrative costs redemption of sharemaxs loan accounts provisions for capital gains tax and seco ndary tax on companies were cited as reasons for the differen ce between the gross and net sale values23 22 basson deon sharemax fails the relative test iti news the blog was first published by moneyweb in june 2006 httpwwwitinewscozacontentmediacompanydocs b1a334ad9ac844ee8488 cdba83bd02b9pdf and retrieved on 18 july 2008 based on jse records th bluffs financial statements for 2005 and sale documentation related to the bluf f 23 various newsletters to shareholders and debenture holders in companies who sold properties to sa retail 2 october 2006 12 from the information in table 132 it can be calcul ated that disproportionate 41 of the gross sale value would have been absorbed by the cost items listed in the parag raph above for all 11 properties sold and listed in tab 132 the equivalent percentage is 48 theres another way to look at the transaction ori ginally according to sharemax the bluff was acquired for r 574m in november 2003 if that is taken as the base valu the gross profit on the sale value of r113m was r556m of that only r226m 40 purportedly went to investors th is goes long way to explain why this type of syndication scheme with their outrageous upfront cost structure can h ardly be competitive the only possible competitive feature is the fact t hat interest is paid monthly to investors instead of twice yea r as is the case with listed property the problem is that with many of these syndications portion of the interest paymen t was and continues to be subsidized by sharemax if they are so uncompetitive in an unprecedented bu ll market then the business rationale of these compan ies rests on extremely shaky foundations in bear mark et other public companies which were also voluntarily liquidated on 2 november 2006 were centurion highve ld park glen gables centurion homefront and groenklo of plaza their private whollyowned subsidiaries we re liquidated day earlier its rather odd that six weeks later on 14 december 2006 groenkloof plaza centurion homefront and glen gabl handed in applications to postpone the holding of t heir annual general meetings and the submission of their financial statements24 in all cases the reason cited for the required extension was the introduction of new ac counting package cipros records show that these three public compan ies and centurion highveld park had filed financial stateme nts in 2006 but cipro didnt or couldnt make them availab to 24 form 17 aplications for extension of time for cent urion homefront groenkloof plaza holdings and glen gables

for liquidated company to ask for an extension to hol d an agm particularly if the directors minute this inte ntion after the voluntary liquidation when they have lost cont rol of the companies another sticky issue related to the bluff is that c ompany documentation indicates that the property was origi nally acquired in 2003 for r574m however the records of the deeds office show it was r505m25 there is explanation in financial statements for the difference of r69m 26 sale to sa retail the sale of ten properties to sa retailsa corporat gives rise to further questions four of the

analysis was simply not disclosed by sharemax atterbury décor is considered sharemaxs blueeyed boy in this group of companies because the sale purportedl achieved gross capital growth of 602 in 33 months 28 whether 33 months was indeed the investment period is doubtful the property was first registered in the name of c max investments 302 on 19 december 2003 29 and according to the financial statements of the holdin g company cmax holdings resumed doing business duri ng that month adding 33 months to december 2003 takes us to augustseptember 2006 at that stage the sale agree ments with sa retail had been signed but due diligence h ad not been completed in fact the property was only regi stered in the name of sa retail on 24 may 200730 the investment term was thus 41 months and not 33 months then there is also uncertainty as to how much cmax holdings did in fact pay to investors as dividend on ordinary shares and as redemption of debentures th uncertainty has been given further impetus by the f ollowing excerpt from sharemax newsletter written by andré brand the financial statements for the properties that h ave february 2008 year end are currently being prepared internally

sclosed in prospectuses after the termination of the trust sch eme doesnt change the reality of this redistribution unlike the situation under the trust regime expen ses were disclosed in prospectuses and investors could see t hat they would pay sizeable premium to net asset value in both bull and bear markets it is however doubtful whether th ey were really able to take an informed decision because it has now been proven that profit forecasts were generally to optimistic and that this optimism was not possible to detect at an early stage due to the nondisclosure of the information that is required in paragraph 6 h of the third schedule of the companies act willie botha told rsg moneyweb in july 2006 that sh aremax properties unlike listed property were sold at ne t asset value this is not true they are always sold at premium stemming from the heavy upfront cost structure its difficult to determine the expense levels of s haremax itself the reason for this is because some of the general expenses disclosed in prospectuses are clearly unre alistic and overstated and are likely to rather add to sha remaxs bottom line small example is the allocation of r 94 000 to travel and accommodation for waterglen shopping centre38 marketing costs in prospectuses are generally state d as 10 of the syndication value it is common cause that 38 basson deon incredible property valuations finweek 14 december 2005 wwwfinweekcoza 18 commission levels had in later years settled to aro und 6 could it be that the other 4 was spent on marketin g for instance how much could the marketing flirtation unprofessionally dressed up as socalled credible ditorial material in geldrapport contribute to the cost of syndications for the sake of argument lets assume the total co st including commission to brokers is 10 of syndic ation value that will be about r300m which still leaves sharemax with pretax profits of roughly r200m for the perio d from termination of the trust scheme in 2003 until mid2 008 now the real question is how much of these profit s have been distributed by way of directors fees andor d ividends to botha and his codirectors i guess that taxeff iciency largely determines in which way directors have take n their share of the lucrative spoils but there is another more important consideration how much of the profits have been left behind in the co mpany its important to know the extent of reserves that are available to support the various schemes to subsid ise and guarantee interest payments to investors in syndica tion companies that is of course if one accepts that these guarantee payments are lawful nevertheless one sh ould consider what kind of reserves sharemax investments will require in future to meet its interest subsidy and guarantee commitments interest earned vs interest paid the message in the early marketing brochures and prospectuses issued during the period 19992005 was clear interest payments to investors will be funded fro m profits generated by the underlying property assets there was indication that profits would be used to fund inter est payments lets be frank about it profits generally didnt u sually match the optimistic forecasts why its actually very s imple if 19 you raise r100m from the public and buy property of r75m and tell the public youll pay yield of 10 then you need to generate profit of r10m from property w hich is at the outset only worth r75m your yield on r75m t hen has to be 133 and youre unlikely to make it to ke ep the scheme credible you then have to find way to subs idise interest payments annexure 9 shows how many of the properties that were sold didnt make profit forecasts consequently in order to support the marketing promises interest payments h ad to be subsidised this trend has continued with the ne xt generation of properties which have not yet been so ld the subsidy game so sharemax flexed its balance sheet to make good t he interest shortfall with unsecured interest free ans and to guarantee payments the practice was first revealed in december 200539 and regulators can hardly say that they didnt know about it 39 basson deon pyramid accounting finweek 21

that would be earned by the investors from 1987 to 1990 masterprop ensured that the investors received earnings per unit which were close to the estimated returns by subventing rentals and subsidi sing expenses if on the other hand an investment earned more than the prom ised return masterprop charged additional fees to recover the excess retur n so that shareholders received more than they

11 cash flow shortfall funds another trick up sharemaxs sleeve to prop up inte rest payments is the creation of socalled cash flow sho rtfall funds these funds are kept within the syndication companies and are funded upfront by investors as pa rt of the syndication amount its case of pauls capit being used to pay pauls interest it was introduced in 2005 with the syndication of magalieskruin holdings and is one of the reasons wh guarantee payments declined in 2007 see table 137 the other reason is that various syndications that requ ired propping up had been sold in 2006 and 2007 prakke pointed out the following flaws related to c ash flow shortfall funds this raising of an additional amount and investing it in the company by investors is in direct contravention of the conditi ons of the long term insurance act and relates to the principles and fun damentals in the act governing sinking fund policies further serio us matter to be taken into account of is the fact that the promoters sharemax after earning upfront r14 million will use this fund to pay back to inves tors the socalled equalizer on their loans for showing greater than actual re turn on capital this is insurance business further contravention is th acceptance of these funds not invested separately with any approved bank and this portion of the transaction is in contravention of the banks act the prospectus also does not deal with the fact what interest investors will earn on this fund it amounts to more than 50 depositors depositing money in company to be repaid back later and exceeding the amount of r500 000 to be paid back to the same depositors in various different installmen ts although each depositor might not receive the same portion back as what was paid in and deposited by the investor 43 there are examples where syndication companies depl eted cash flow shortfall funds much quicker than was env isaged in prospectuses waterglen shopping centre is cas in point as is clear

on the profits which exclude guarantee payments and the valuations generally s peaking it is evident that yields came down significantly i n 2007 as result of the sale transactions valuations of prop erties not being sold were clearly influenced by the sale tran sactions44 many of the high valuations are in response to infl ated property prices as was highlighted in the report b prof tanya woker in 200645 some of the low yields are actually similar to those achieved by high quality and high liquidity listed companies and would not be sustainable in bear market how sustainable are high valuations although property is by definition growth asset i t is not risk free and capital losses are possible if the in vestor overpaid in the first instance property investment s are very much linked to economic and interest rate cycles u nless property is being sold the value of an unlisted pro perty is only an issue once year when the financial statem ents are drawn up it is interesting

benchmark for sharemaxs properties during july 2008 sa corpora traded at yields between 114 and 134 and at discount to net asset value of between 30 and 42 its sobering thought that should certainly

statements up to 2007 or at least 2006 are availa ble for more conservative yields of 11 and 13 it is c lear that the margin by which liabilities exceed assets is armingly high the facto insolvency of this part of the portfolio continues and appears to have worsened in certain instances this is of course partly brought about b the high upfront cost structure waterglen shopping centre is striking example whe re the purported value of the property at yields of 11 an d 13 is even lower than what the property was bought for i ts completely fair for investors to ask that the reali ty be presented

statements had not been filed at the time of writing this book these syndi cations took place between the first half of 2006 and july 2008 and cash flow shortfall funds featured strongly in pros pectuses if one accepts the slogan often used by sharemax th at the propertyowning companies controlled by sharemax bo ught the properties as willing knowledgeable buyers in an arms length transaction then lets assume those transa ctions took place at the time at fair market value but since then property prices have gone into decli ne which is likely to mean that the original deficit between liabilities and assets may very well now be bigger than when th properties were syndicated one must remember that many investors who participa ted in some of the later syndications actually reinvest ed the capital and profits from earlier syndications in t hat sense they took fresh step backwards as their capital w as diluted second time by the massive promotion fees earned upfront by sharemax the difference is that this time it is unlikely that an extreme bull market and an overly keen sa r etail will come to their rescue 27 the story of louise kennedy on glorious free state spring day in october 2007 the day when free state retained the currie cup in th rilling encounter against the golden lions i met an oxfor d gate investor named louise kennedy in bloemfontein she d reached the end of the road in her attempts to cash in her investment and the attempts by the company to sell the property had also failed she handed copies of documentation in her posses sion and we agreed that i would help her to draft lett er to the fais ombudsman later we changed our stance and dec ided to write one final letter to sharemax at the time i was not actively practicing as journalist so i was free to help her with this from research viewpoint it was an inte resting opportunity to gauge the inner workings of the shar emax model on microlevel kennedy asked for r1 48935 per unit and got it it is important to remember that until very shortly befor the letter was sent she had been getting the cold sho ulder from the company then the letter arrived although willie botha stated that he disagreed with her letter he has not at any stage thereafter attempted to refute the conten ts of the letter its important to record that the transacti on effectively valued oxford gate at staggering r41 7m and that shortly before this the company had failed to sell the underlying property for r31m who the willing buye r was who bought the shares in private transaction re mains mystery but director gert goosen was quite keen to swiftly settle the matter with kennedy the ordeal for mrs kennedy was for an excellen t case study underlining many of the flaws in sharemaxs business and compliance model annexure 14 contains kennedys letter which i drafted 28 the reality in substance sharemax is in all probability more ak in to money purchase scheme than to property operation botha indirectly admitted it46 investors are lured with interest rates higher than ruling rates in the money market if the property operation cant produce the required retur ns interest rates are propped up regulators and legis lators have ignored and continue to ignore the concerns of the nel commission in relation to property syndication schemes lack of sufficient share capital47 by july 2008 the following forces were at work forces which inevitably will i nfluence property syndication companies high interest rates which are slowing down economic activity and curbing property rentals this puts pressure on profitability being money purchase schemes high interest rate cycle creates situation where investors wish to b enefit from such high rates for some of the later phases of the zambezi retail park project sharemax offers staggering 12 interest rate consequently the gap between interest paid to investors and interest earned by properties will gr ow for each percentage point gap the cost of subsidisa tion to sharemax is roughly r25m if the gap grows to say 4 percentage points the cost will be r100m the public doesnt know how much reserve sharemax really has retained earnings is likely to be substantially less than the figure of r200m mention ed earlier because directors probably took out porti on of their money as dividends andor directors fees the joker in the pack is the mammoth r11bn zambesi retail park development disclosure is problem an d it is virtually impossible to appraise the risk of the 46 see chapter 6 47 see chapter 3 29 scheme accurately various parties have expressed their concern about the project48 lack of transparency about the property development is reminiscent of th failure of tea in australia in the 1980s49 holistically the total scheme remains factually insolvent the first meaningful financial disclosure about the zambezi project is only likely to appear in 2009 c ouple that with the rather opaque disclosure of existing development projects totalling r500m and the expected strain on shopping centres as the interest rates bite the south african consumer and it is cl ear that regulators are sitting on an armed timebomb 48 for an
