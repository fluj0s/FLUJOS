during december 9 meeting in abu dhabi other meetings reported septel deputy secretary of energy daniel poneman told abu dhabi crown prince mohammed bin zayed mbz that the usg shared many energy policy priorities with the uae including renewable energy development and the importance of critical energy infrastructure protection poneman briefed mbz on the teheran research reactor trr proposal and vienna talks mbz said he would be surprised if iran accepted the p51iaea proposal and warned that iran was already acting like nuclear power further and more dangerously iran is establishing emirates across the muslim world including south lebanon and gaza sleeper emirates in kuwait bahrain and the eastern province of saudi arabia the mother of all emirates in southern iraq and now saada in yemen mbz suggested that the us is misreading the situation in yemen and failing to recognize strong evidence of iranian support end summary potential cooperation renewables infrastructure protection 2 sbu the crown prince asked depsec poneman several questions about us energy development plans including the outlook for the next 25 years poneman explained president obama and secretary chu have strategic vision of new energy economy with low carbon profile in the short term poneman said doe is investing recovery act funds to improve efficiency and support new technologies but that the usg seeks to facilitate energy development through portfolio approach not dictate what the market should pursue on nuclear mbz specifically asked what progress could be expected within the next three years poneman said there are number of active deals under development and strong public support for nuclear power but that capital costs continue to be challenge comment mbz pressed hard on us plans for nuclear renaissance suggesting to us that he is worried we may compete with his program in the hunt for nuclear engineering and technical talent end comment turning to renewable energy and efficiency the depsec noted that usg goals are very much in line with abu dhabis own masdar abu dhabi future energy company and that he looked forward to greater doemasdar cooperation septel 3 sbu poneman also told mbz that the usg is interested in supporting abu dhabis critical energy infrastructure protection ceip plans and said doe team was discussing cooperation potential with the critical national infrastructure authority cnia reported septel learning from hurricane katrina doe was focused on survivability of assets resiliency and recovery mbz said he was personally very interested in greater cooperation with the us on ceip through doe other usg entities andor the private sector he stressed that citizens confidence in their government was very important noting were doing our best to make them feel secure mbz added that while uae is small country it has the resources to protect itself and is willing to invest in topquality infrastructure protection iran 4 snf depsec poneman briefed mbz on the international proposal for iran to ship 1200 kg of low enriched uranium produced at natanz to location outside iran and where it would be enriched to 20 percent for use to produce medical radioisotopes at the tehran research reactor poneman stressed that the iaea the russians and the us had all taken every possible step to address stated iranian concerns including firstever official usg statement of support for the proposal he stressed that the offer would not remain open indefinitely as dg baradei had said this is fleeting opportunity he also explained that the extra effort had strengthened international cooperation with russia and china supportive of the recent iaea board of governors resolution poneman stressed that the deal was not offered out of naivete but rather out of the view that if iran agreed it would remove significant amount of leu from natanz and if iran refused it would help build international support beginning with russia and china for tougher sanctions 5 snf the crown prince said he would be very surprised if deal was possible as irans nuclear program is not an issue of internal conflict but rather one of national pride for the vast majority of iranians he stressed that iran is not north korea because 1 it is looking to reestablish persian empire in the 21st century 2 iran has resources and lacks neighbors including the uae who can pressure it 3 the leadership has not changed it is the same people who seized embassy tehran in 1979 and 4 iran believes itself to be superpower poneman said the usg does not disagree with mbzs analysis but believes pride makes the iranian leadership more susceptible to the pressure of the world community uniting against them whereas north korea revels in its own isolation mbz agreed and emphasized the strategic importance of creating palestinian state ie resolving the israelipalestinian conflict as the way to create genuine middle eastern unity on the question of irans nuclear program and regional ambitions yemen 6 snf mbz said iran already acts like superpower and explained that while the uae is federation of emirates irans emirates have larger army and budget that the uae in addition to irans established emirates in south lebanon and gaza sleeper emirates in kuwait bahrain the eastern province of saudi arabia and the mother of all emirates in southern iraq now iran has an emirate in saada mbz told poneman we believe you dont want us to believe the mounting evidence of iranian involvement in yemen he stressed that he doesnt believe ali abdullah saleh either but this is not like cracking the enigma code in world war ii there are iranian ships unloading weapons for the houthis and you have the capability to track this he warned we know your priority is alqaeda but dont forget iran alqaeda is not going to get nuclear bomb iran is matter of time 7 sbu depsec poneman has cleared this cable olson
