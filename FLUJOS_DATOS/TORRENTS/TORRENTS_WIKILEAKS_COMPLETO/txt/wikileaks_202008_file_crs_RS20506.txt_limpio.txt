the defense language institute english language center dlielc located at lackland air force base tx dlielc provides resident english language training in stateofthe art facilities additionally dlielc conducts english language training surveys to evaluate foreign government programs and will assign instructors as detachment to the host country to personally assist in the establishment and maintenance of their english language training program expanded international military education and training program imet in 1990 the house and senate appropriations committees initiated statutory change based on their view that changing world politicalmilitary circumstances warranted new direction for the traditional imet program one that would bring an increased emphasis on enhancing the skills and professionalism of both civilian and military leaders and managers of foreign military establishments the foreign operations appropriations act for fy1991 hr 5114 pl 101513 signed november 5 1990 directed the defense department to establish program within imet focused in particular on training foreign civilian and military officials in managing and administering military establishments and budgets creating and maintaining effective military judicial systems and military codes of conduct including observance of internationally recognized human rights and fostering greater respect for the principle of civilian control of the military congress earmarked 1 million of the fy1991 imet appropriation to be used to establish this program this initiative is called expanded imet or eimet and each year the defense department has broadened the program although congress did not earmark imet funds to support this program after fy1991 it has in report language noted an expectation that the financial investment in eimet be increased congress further broadened the program to include participation by members of national legislatures who are responsible for oversight and management of the military and individuals who are not members of government because eimet is subelement of the overall imet program it is funded as part of the annual imet appropriation the eimet initiative is accomplished through educational programs in the united states offered by us defense department and us military service schools by mobile education teams visiting host countries and by funding military participation in overseas conferences such as the african american institutes seminar on the role of the military in democracy joint usaid world bank and imet funded initiative although imet funding can be used for such an initiative overseas seminars under the auspices of the eimet program when such activities are deemed appropriate the emphasis and preference is for longer training experience in the united states that maximizes the students exposure to the american way of life programs for implementing eimet beginning in fy1991 the defense department launched eimet by refining some existing programs and initiating new courses through the military departments further new educational programs were established to address the topics of military justice human rights and civilmilitary relations the bulk of this effort is accomplished through three schools defense resource management institute naval postgraduate school nps monterey ca crs4 center for civilmilitary relations naval postgraduate school monterey ca and the naval justice school newport ri defense resource management institute drmi the defense resource management institute at the naval postgraduate school at monterey ca was tasked with meeting the eimet criteria to assist recipients establish processes for more effective defense resources management drmi reactivated two week mobile education team which takes the curriculum to the host country and developed two resident programs within the us the 11week midlevel international defense management course and the fourweek senior international defense management course established for flagrank military and civilian equivalents the naval justice school under defense department assistance and guidance the naval justice school established program to address the topics of military justice and human rights they developed multiphased program comprised of seminars and resident programs designed to culminate in the passage of rewritten military code by their national legislature albania was the first nation to legislate into effect its rewritten military code in october 1995 the center for civilmilitary relations ccmr the center for civil military relations located at the naval postgraduate school in monterey ca was established by dods defense security assistance agency to provide broad range of innovative graduate level educational programs and research to address the issue of civil military relations in democratic society this program is first conducted as one week seminar held in the host country which is attended by ministers key parliamentarians ranking military representatives and the us ambassador it is followed with resident programs within the united states to include one year accelerated graduate degree program the first class of which began in january 1996 other eimet programs all eimet approved programs are published in an annual eimet handbook the handbook reflects the various programs described above and others covering such topics as equal opportunity financial management and maritime law in addition the eimet effort was recently broadened to include environmental military law and resource management issues the value of imet perspectives of supporters and critics as worldwide us military assistance funding levels have declined in the postcold war era the imet program is viewed by its supporters as valuable tool in support of american foreign policy imet and within it eimet are seen as lowcost means of maintaining access to and influencing the military and civilian leaderships of nations with political traditions less democratic in nature than most western democracies by making professional military training available to us friends and allies imet also enhances the ability of participating countries to make the most of us weaponry they have obtained from the united states thereby increasing the selfdefense capabilities of these nations and lessening the need for us military forces to be utilized to protect such nations advocates of strong imet program believe it should be afforded increased funding to build on the programs successes in the past and to enable imet to be extended to more of the emerging nations of the former soviet union while continuing to provide assistance to traditional clients crs5 critics of imet argue that it is relic of the high cold war era and has been at best only marginally successful in advancing united states foreign policy interests indeed imet opponents believe that much of the training related to human rights issues and exposure to american democratic institutions is conducted in pro forma fashion and is in any event not taken seriously by many foreign participants imet critics argue that number of the programs notably effective military elements should be drastically curtailed if not totally eliminated because they enhance the capabilities of anti democratic military establishments and associate the united states with their practices should imet focus almost exclusively on training foreign military and civilian participants in us democratic values institutions and principles of human rights they might be prepared to support carefully targeted funding of the program but in the absence of substantial redirection of the program toward these ends these opponents would support termination of the program current issues for congress funding level and focus the level of funding for imet has increased significantly since fy1995 from 2635 million to an estimated 917 million for fy2004 while overall foreign assistance program funding has continued to decline the recent funding levels represent restoration of imet funding to levels more consistent with those that existed in the late 1980s and early 1990s it also reflects support for efforts to meet training requirements generated by 29 newly emerging democracies globally the defense department expects the costs associated with the imet program to increase due to inflation to growing requirements of central europe and the newly independent states nis to the increasing popularity of expanded imet and efforts to maintain existing programs in africa and latin america in addition since fy1994 the united states has placed strict limitation on the amount of technical and highcost training in response to an earlier large reduction in imet funding instead emphasis has been placed on the us military services senior service school programs professional military educational efforts expanded imet and english language training as result there has been notable reduction in the proportion of technical training in fy1995 for example technical training represented about 17 of the overall imet appropriation while professional military education programs constituted over 50 of the appropriation these facts raise the current issue of whether or not more resources and possibly more funds should be made available for technical training this issue may become more acute as the united states attempts to advance its policy goals in nato enlargement which might well require training on nato interoperable systems and in seeking to help imet participants enhance their ability to assume greater roles in international peacekeeping operations however any decision to provide additional funding for imet would mean that those funds could come at the expense of other programs given current budgetary constraints human rights and imet in recent years american concerns with human rights practices of certain nations that were recipients of united states foreign aid has led to restrictions or conditions being placed on their participation in the imet program in the case of indonesia for example congress has required that the president make number of certifications about the actions of the indonesian government before funds can be provided under the expanded imet program in some cases the imet program crs6 represents the major current vehicle for contact between the united states military and its counterparts in countries with record of human rights violations or tradition of authoritarian or undemocratic governments as reductions in the united states foreign military financing program fmf continue imet is increasingly the remaining military assistance program that congress can use to sanction nations it finds to be abusing the human rights of its people at the same time imet may also be the only instrument available that might assist in changing the attitudes of militarydominated governments and lead to reduction in human rights abuses and greater levels of democratic government current issue then is whether using imet restrictions to sanction nations with poor human rights records can be an effective means for modifying the behavior of their governments3 3 although the western hemisphere institute for security cooperation shares number of the goals of the imet program it is an independent entity for background see crs report rs20892 western hemisphere institute for security cooperation for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20506
