study5 regional controversy the fpc has been at the center of some controversy in the pacific northwest many agencies and tribes concerned primarily w ith salmon recovery have confidence in the centers technical analyses and consider fpc staff to be valuable resource when reviewing fcrps operations and impacts on fis h others are concerned that the fpc does not provide unbiased analysis but rath er advocates policy positions favoring fish protection representatives of the fish and wildlife serv ice the oregon department of fish and wildlife and the columbia river intert ribal fish commission among others have provided statements in support of the fpc th ey indicate that their jobs require them to provide the best scien tific information on effects of the fcrps on fisheries resources to their respective agencies and to the region as whole and that they have relied heavily on the scientists at the fpc for information nd analysis they stress that in their opinion and consistent with i ndependent review the work conducte d by the fpc scientists is at high level of scientific ri gor and merit and that othe r group in the region has had to endure such levels of scrutiny as the fpc staff6 the national marine fisheries service nmfs science center and the university of washingtons columbia basin research ce nter have both expre ssed concern that the fpcs approach mingles an advocacy role with scientific one and that this commingling of advocacy and analysis shades the fpcs an alytical products staff of those two research institutions also feel that the fpc data are difficult to work with and that the data sources and underlying analyses are not always clear7 the council established fish passage center oversight board in 20008 to assess why the fpc did not enjoy the same reputation for independent analytical quality as other scientific bodies in the region9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22414crs4 10 srept 10984 at 179 2005 11 hrept 109275

debate over the fpcs role in the co lumbia basin came to head in 2005 during congressional debate over the energy and water deve lopment appropriations act of 2006 first in its report of the appropriations bill the us senate appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development instructed that bpa may make new obligations from the bonneville power administration fund in support of the fish passage center because there we re universities in the region th at collect the relevant data and could fulfill the functions of the fpc while saving money for taxpayers10 similarly the conference committee report for the act directed that the bonneville power administration may make new obligations in support of the fish passage center11 the committee report also stated that th conferees call upon the bonneville power administration and the northwest power nd conservation council to ensure that an orderly transfer of the fish passage cent er functions occurs within 120 days of enactment of this legislation12 bpa selected two entities to take over the functions of the fpc on january 26 2006 bpa announced that the pacific states marine fisheries commission psmfc and the battelle pacific northwest national laboratory pnnl would assume the duties of the fpc on march 21 200613 specifically bpa indicated that psmfc would 1 manage the smolt monitoring program 2 perform functions associated with related data collection and manageme nt and 3 conduct routine analys is and reporting of that data pnnl was selected to 1 oversee coordinate and facilitate broader nonroutine scientific analysis of that data including independent peer review and 2 manage the analysis itself which would be perform ed by biometricians and scie ntists selected by and under contract to pnnl via request for qualifi cations in addition bpa proposed that the columbia basin fish and wildlife authority assume coordination of the policy interests of regional fishery agencies and tribes on fl ow and spill issues this would be done under modification to its current bpa cont ract pending approva l of its members14 in response to bpas decision to transfer the fpcs functions to other entities number of organizations including the nort hwest environmental fense center public employees for environmental responsibility and the northwest sportfishing industry association filed petition for revi ew challenging the bpas decision15 on march 17 2006 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit granted the pa rties request for stay of the transfer of the fpcs func tions pending resolution

the functions of the fpc to two other entities violated the 706 of the administrative procedure act apa 5 usc 70617 under the apa federal agencys actions are to be set aside if they are arbitrary capri cious an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law18 the court first held that bp could not base its decision to transfer the fpcs functions on the langua ge found in senate subcommittee report and conference committee report because legisla tive history untethered to text in an enacted statute has compulsive legal effect19 the court further noted that treating legislative reports as binding law undermines the legislativ process because it gives the force of law to language that has not been subject to the constitutional requirements of bicameralism and presentment20 the court also found that th is treatment of legislative history as binding law frustrated the purpos of the northwest power act which establishes participatory process in which various interests colla borate to advise bpa on how best to exercise its discretionary authority21 finally the court rejected bpas argument that its decision to transfer the functions of the fpc was based on thorough analysis conducted independe nt of the directives in the legislative reports22 therefore the court held that bpas decision to transf er the functions of the fpc to other entities based on the language in legi slative reports was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law23
