supreme court held in massachusetts v epa that at least as to mobile sources of emissions cars truc ks epa has authority under the caa to regulate greenhouse gas ghg emissions this decision puts pressure on epa to move forward as we ll with regulation of ghgs from stationary sources powerplants factories second litigation under the marine mamma l protection act and current and likely litigation under the endangered species act raise the possibility that the impacts of climate change on wildlife may constrain government and private activities associated with ghg emissions third what about federal energy statutes muchpublicized decision held that under the energy policy and conservation ac t the united states must monetize the benefits of reduced carbon emissions as part of tting lighttruck fuel ec onomy standards the outer continental sh elf lands act also has been invoked fourth various statutes re quiring federal government analysis and information dissemination the national environmen tal policy act nepa global change research act and freedom of information act have generated climatechange litigation nepa suits make up the most numerous category of climatechange litigation courts appear to agree that if plaintiff can establish standing nepa can be used to compel agency consideration of the climate change effects of its actions fifth can common law tort theories such as nuisance be used to force cutbacks in ghg emissions or payment of damages all four decisions thus far have denied relief to plaintiffs on lack of st anding or political question grounds sixth are the suits challenging state regulation of ghg emissions from motor vehicles as preempted by the federal corporate average fuel economy standards or federal authority over foreign policy the two rulings thus far have rejected these challenges moreover these issues will be moot unless epas denial of californias request for waiver of federal preemp tion under the caa is

introduction the scientific economic and political questions surrounding climate change have long been with us this report focu ses instead on relative newcomer the legal debate though the first court decision rela ted to climate change appeared 18 years ago the quantity of such litigation has mush roomed in recent years more than two dozen cases pursuing multiple legal theories are now pending the principal court cases decided and pending arise in seven contexts number that continues to rise the first nd most important context is the clean air act caa in april 2007 the supreme court held in massachusetts v epa that at least as to mobile sources of emissions cars trucks epa has authority under the caa to regulate greenhous gas ghg emissions1 second must global warming effects be considered under the federal wildlife protection statutes such as the mari ne mammal protection act and endangered species act third must they be consid ered under federal energy statutes such as the energy policy and conservation act and outer continental shelf lands act fourth may any of severa l information statutes particularly the national environmental policy act be used to compel government analysis of and dissemination of informati on about climate change fifth can common law tort theories such as nuisance be used by stat and private plaintiffs to force cutbacks in ghg emissions or payment of damages sixth granted that state regulation of ghg emissions from motor vehicles is pr eempted by the caa absent an epa waiver is such regulation also preempted by other federal statutory or constitutional law and seventh chiefly with respect to coalfired power plants what role will be played by state utilities laws sections i through vii of this report address these seven areas of

kyoto protocol 30 envtl l 491 2000the rest of this section deals with th second issue epas possible authority to regulate ghg emissions independently of the prot ocol under the caa this authority has now been confirmed by the supreme court at least as to mobile sources nonetheless this re port retains from earlier versi ons some of the historical evolution of the issue for the sake of fuller appreciation of its complexity during hearings on epas fy1999 appr opriations representative tom delay asked thenepa administrator carol br owner whether the epa believed it had authority under the caa to regulate ghg missions this led weeks later to an epa general counsel memorandum7 which concluded that co2 satisfies the caa definition of air pollutant but that this is only the first step before epa can regulate co2 emissions it must further conclude that co2 meets criteria in other caa provisions requiring the agency to termine that the substance poses harm to public health welfare or th environment this next step epa declined to take at house hearing in 19998 panel of legal experts argued the question of epas authority to regulate co2 under the caa new epa general counsel endorsed his predecessors analysis in the 1998 memorandum but just as his predecessor stressed that the epas legal analysis was largely theoretical since epa currently has plans to regulate carbon dioxide9 this handsoff position was prompted in part by strong c ongressional opposition based on uncertainties as to the economic impact of regulating pollutant as widespread as co2 in addition some in congress argued that caa implementation of co2 standard was barred by the aforementioned enactments appropriation riders prohibiting implementation of the kyoto protocol10 the epa general counsel opinion that air pollutant includes ghgs held sway until 2003 when that office reversed it self in the context of petition asking the agency to regulate ghg emissions fro m mobile sources this story

15 coke oven environmental task force v epa 061131 dc cir filed april 7 2006suits enforcing the caa against epa two suits have been filed seeking to compel epa to regulate ghg emissions from stationary sources in massachusetts v whitman filed in 2003 three northeast states ma ct sought to force epa to list co2 as criteria pollutant under the caa11 they argued that on various occasions epa had indicated its belief that co2 emissions contribute to c limate change these epa statem ents constituted in the words of caa section 10812 judgment that ghg emissions cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare and also per section 108 that such emi ssions result from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources these prer equisites being satisfied the suit argued section 108 required epa to add co2 to its list of criteria pollutants then proceed under section 10913 to develop national ambien t air quality standards for co2 on september 3 2003 few days after epas nial of petition asking the agency to regulate ghg emissions from motor vehi cles the plaintiff states voluntarily dismissed this suit without prejudice reportedl so as to transfer their energies to suit challenging the petition denial leading to the supreme courts massachusetts v epa decision the second suit is new york v epa which seeks to compel epa to issue new source performance standard nsps for co2 unlike the first case however this one will be litigated in the shadow of massachusetts v epa holding that epa has authority under the caa to regulate ghgs from mobile sources the burning question is how this litigation seeking to compel epa regulation of stationarysource ghg emissions will be affected new york began with an epa proposal to revise its nspss for electric utility and other steamgenerating units some commenters on the proposed rule argued that epa must in addition to the revi sions proposed set n spss for ghgs emitted from steam generating units the comm enters pointed to caa section 111s command that epa promulgate nspss to address emissions from new stationary sources that cause or contribute significantly to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or we lfare in promulgating its final rule in february 200614 however epa rejected this demand saying it lacked authority to set nspss for ghgs review of the final rule was sought in the dc circuit15 in september 2006 the court severed the portion of the case dealing with regulation of ghgs titling

after the supreme court decision in massachusetts v epa this severed case was re manded to epa for further proceedings in light of that decision this section infra suits enforcing the caa against stationary sources in northwest environmental defense center v owens corning corp environmental groups invoke the caa citiz suit provision to enforce the acts new source review require ment as to ghg emissions17 they contend that owens corning is constructing manufacturing pl ant in oregon with the potential to emit more than 250 tons per year of harmful ga ses without having obtained the required permit18 the principal such gas is hcfc142b which plaintiffs contend is potent ghg in preliminary ruling the court held that plaintiffs have standing notwithstanding that the climate change impacts of the plants ghg emissions would be indirect anticipating the supreme courts rationale for granting standing in massachusetts v epa the court found that standing was not precluded by the fact that the injury to plaintiffs would be shared with many others nor because the relief sought would not lead to complete elimination of climate change impacts in another proceeding this time befo re epas environmental appeals board sierra club objected to the issuance of caa prevention of significant deterioration psd permit by state agency for construction of coalfired electric power plant in re christian county llc psd appeal 0701 decided january 28 2008 sierra clubs argume nt was that the permit must contain best available control technology bact limit on the plants co2 emissions the

case before the board in re deseret power electric cooperative psd appeal 0703 filed octobe r 1 2007 in which it raised the co2 bact issue during the public comment period and therefore preserved the issue for appeal in re deseret involves an epaissued psd pe rmit to construct new waste coalfired utility generating unit at an existing power plant the psd bact issue stems from the fact that the caa requires new major emitting facility in psd area to install bact for each pollutant subject to regulation under this act19 sierra club argues that in light of the massachusetts v epa holding that ghgs are air pollutants under the act co2 is subject to regulation by the caa to the contrary argues epa the phrase subject to regula tion refers only to pollutants that the agency has specifically regulated and since it has yet to issue regulation limiting co2 emissions bact for co2 is not required herehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32764crs6 20 42 usc 7521a1 21 epa control of emissions from new

twelve states ca ct il ma nj nm ny or ri vt wa and others opposing the challenge besides epa were ten state intervenors ak id ks nd ne oh sd tx ut plus several au tomobile and truck related trade groups in 2005 split panel in massachusetts v epa rejected the suit23 the two judges supporting rejection however did so for different reasons judge randolph assuming that epa had caa authority to regu late ghg emissions spoke to whether epa properly exercised its discretion in choosing not to wield that authority recall that caa section 202a1 di rects the epa administrator to prescribe standards for any motor vehicle emissions that in his judgment24 cause harmful air pollution judge randolph read in his judgment broa dly to allow epa consideration of not only scientific uncertainty about th effects of ghgs but also policy considerations that justified not regulating thus epa in his view was entitled tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32764crs7 25 the test for whether plaintiff in federal c ourt has standing is described in greater detail in the following discussion of the supreme c ourts decision on appeal of the dc circuit ruling 26 127 s ct 1438 2007 27 id at 1446 28 caa 307b1 42 usc 7607b1 29 127 s ct at 1453 30 id at 1454 31 idrely as it did on such factors as the fact that new motor vehicles are but one of many sources of ghg emissions resulting in an inefficient piecemeal approach to climate change and efforts to promote fuel cell and hybrid vehicles he concluded that epa had properly exercised its 202a1 discretion in denying the petition for rulemaking by contrast judge sentelle held that petitioners lacked standing25 in dissent judge tatel asserted that at least one petitioner had standing massachusetts he said had shown the possibility of injury from globalwarming induced rising sea levels on the merits he found first that epa has the authority under section 202a1 to regulate ghg emissions second he concluded that epas 202a1 discretion does not extend to policy considerations as judge randolph held but relates exclusively to whether the emissions cause harm supreme court decision in massachusetts v epa the court ruled 54 for petitioners on all three issues in the case standing authority and discretion26 first massachusetts has standing to bring the claim second epa has author ity to regulate motor vehicle ghgs under section 202 since air pollutant includes ghg emissions and third the phrase in his judgment in section 202 does not allo w epa to exercise discretion against regulating based on policy considerations the ruling in favor of petitioners was forecast early in the majority opinion by its opening sentences welldocumented rise in global temperatures has coincided with significant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmos phere respected scie ntists believe the two trends are related27 nor did the dissenters dispute this most of the decision is devoted to standing the court found that pe titioners had two factors in their favor first th caa specifically authorizes challenges to agency action unlawfully withheld such as here28 litigant to whom congress has accorded such procedural right said the court can assert that right without meeting the normal standards for redressability and immediacy29 two prerequisites of the sta nding test second the court found it of considerable relevance30 that the petitioner injury on which it focused massachusettss loss of shore land from globalwarminginduced sea level rise was th at of sovereign state states are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction31 said the court noting their quasi sovereign duty to preserve their territory httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32764crs8 32 id at 1457 33 id at 1458 34 49 usc 32902having described petitioners favored position in establishing standing it was surprising that the court then undertook tr aditional standing analysis as to the first prong of the standing test whet her plaintiff has monstrated actual or imminent injury in fact of concrete and particularized nature the court homed in on massachusettss status as owner of much of the shore land being lost to sea level rise that this injury may be widely shared with other coastal states does not disqualify this injury said the court it is noneth eless concrete the second prong of the standing test is causation requiring that the injury of which the plaintiff complains is fairly traceable to the defendant epa did not dispute the existence of causal rela tionship between ghg emissions and climate change it did argue however that any reduction in ghg emissions achieved through the current litigation would be too small portion of worldwide ghg emissions to make cognizable difference in climate change in ruling that may be of benefit to envi ronmental plaintiffs in many contexts the court held that even an agencys refusal to take small incremental step32 that would result in only modest reduction in worldwide ghg emissi ons is enough for standing purposes the third and final prong of the standing test is redressability demanding that the remedy sought by the plaintiff is one that is likely to redress hisher injury here the remedy sought was epa regulation of ghg emissions from new motor vehicles the court found that this remedy satisfied redressability becau while it would not by itself reverse climate change it would none theless slow or reduce it nor given the enormity33 of the potential effects of climate change was it relevant to the court that the full effectiveness of the remedy would be delayed until existing cars and trucks on the road were largely replaced by new ones in contrast with the majority opini ons lengthy discourse on standing its disposition of the caa issues in the case is quite brief on the authority question the caas broad definition of air polluta nt simply could not the court said be squared with epas view that ghgs are not included the court rejected epas argument that federal laws enacted following enactment of this definition laws emphasizing interagency colla boration and research suggest that congress meant to curtail epas power to use mandatory re gulations in addressing air pollutants nor was the court impressed with epas argument that air pollutant in the caa could not include vehicle ghg emissions b ecause epa standards for such emissions could be satisfied only by improving fu economy goal assigned to the department of transporta tion under different statute the energy policy and conservation act34 finally on the discretion issue the majo rity concluded that in his judgment refers only to whether an air pollutant may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare thus said the court epa can avoid taking further action in response to the section 202 petition onl if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32764crs9 35 127 s ct at 1463 36 three weeks after the decision in massachusetts v epa the senate held hearing devoted exclusively to it the implications of the supr eme courts decision regarding epas authorities with respect to greenhouse gases under the clean air act hearing before the senate comm on envt and pub works april 24 2007 hereinafter senate hearing 37 justice scalias dissent characterizes epa s three options similarly 127 s ct at 1472to why it cannot or will not exercise its disc retion it rejected epas stated policy reasons for refusing to regulate ghg emi ssions such as its claim that voluntary executive branch programs already provide an effective response to climate change and that unilateral epa re gulation of vehicle ghg emi ssions could weaken us efforts to persuade devel oping countries to reduce the ghg intensity of their economies such reasons have nothi ng to do with whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change35 in short said the court the only question is whether sufficient information exists to make an endangerment finding under section 202 accordingly the supreme court reve rsed the dc circuit opinion and remanded the case to that court for further proceedings36 on september 14 2007 the dc circuit vacated epas denial of the section 202 pe tition and remanded the matter to the agency fourjustice dissent by chief justice roberts in massachusetts v epa disputed the majoritys holding of standing dissent by justice scalia for the same four justices argued that agency policy preferences may appropriately be considered as part of epas decision whether to issue judgment conceding that the judgment if made must be limited to whether vehicle ghg emissions cause endangerment justice scalia also disputed the majoritys holding that air pollutant in section 202 includes ghgs implications of supreme court decision the courts decision leaves epa with three options make finding that motor vehicle ghg emissions may ndanger public health or welfare and issue emissions standards make finding that such emi ssions do not satisfy that prerequisite or decide that climate change science is so uncertain as to preclude making finding either way or cite some other reasonable explanation why it will not exercise its discretion either way37 as to the state of climate change science the courts focus on the policy reasons epa gave as part of exercising its judgment obscures the fact that the agencys rejection of the petition stemmed in part from expressions of scientific uncertainty in 2001 national research c ouncil report on the science of climate change whether sc ientific reports since the petition rejection in 2003 have foreclosed the scientificun certainty rationale is beyond the scope of this report the epa administrator did say after the decision that although it bars epa use of policy considerations as basis for denying the petition it left open

inhofe march 27 2008 identical letter from administrator johnson to representatives john dingell and joe barton march 27 2008 43 petition for writ of mandamus to compel compliance with mandate filed april 2 2008 the petition argues that the anpr broa d request for comment s on the role of ghgs continuedmake an endangerment finding38 in this regard it should be noted that caa section 202 does not explicitly impose any string ency or other criteria on ghg emission standards promulgated under the section gi ven the wide latitude epa has in setting section 202 standards for ghgs the possibility presents itself that epa following an endangerment finding coul d set voluntary standards or standards pegged to the cafe standards for fuel economy or standa rds that must be complied with only after the president certifies that developing nations have put ad equate ghg emission limits into effect we offer opinion here as to the legal viability of these options on may 14 2007 the president asked ep to have caa regulations limiting vehicle ghg emissions in place by the nd of 2008 and to use the presidents 2007 state of the union proposal for rais ing the cafe standards as guide39 as late as early december 2007 epa was consistently stating that it intended to issue proposed regulations by the end of 2007 however the enactment of the energy independence and security act in december 200740 with its increase in cafe standards led epa to back off from any firm deadline for issuance of mobilesource ghg emission standards in january 2008 letters from the massachusetts v epa petitioners asked the epa administrator when he intended to act41 prompting epa to respond that it did not have specifi c time line most recently epa announced by letter that it will issue during spring 2008 an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr addre ssing the full range of massachusetts v epa s ramifications throughout the caa including the section 202 standards42 on the ground that regulation under section 202 coul d automatically result in other caa regulations applying to stationary sources and other mobile sources in response the massachusetts v epa petitioners requested the dc circuit to order epa to comply with the supreme courts remand and the circuits mandate within 60 days choosing one of the three options noted earlier arguing that the proposed anpr extended well beyond the narrow section 202 endangerment issue in the case43httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32764crs11 43 continued throughout the caa is similar to one of the policy arguments made by epa in denying the original 1999 petition namely that establis hing motor vehicle ghg standards now would result in an inefficient piecemeal approach to addressing the climate change issue sensible regulatory sc heme would require that all significant sources and sinks of ghg emissions be considered in deciding how best to achieve any needed emission reductions 68 fed reg at 52391 as noted the suprem court decision held that such policy considerations are irrelevant to the agen cys determination on the section 202 petition 44 see eg caa 108a12 42 usc 7408a12 requiring the epa administrator to maintain list of each air pollutant emissions of which in his judgment cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare and then issue air quality criteria and national ambient air quality standards for that air pollutant 45 caa 165 42 usc 7475 46 caa 165a4 42 usc 7475a4 47 42 usc 7547a4 the petition recognizes that while caa section 202a1 at issue in massachusetts v epa states that epa shall issue standards upon making an endangerment finding section 213a4 states that epa may do so 48 42 usc 7571 as the epa letter confirms the courts ruling in

on climate change is precisely the kind of cumulative impacts analysis that nepa requires agencies to conduct80 nor did the energy policy and conservation act the statute authorizing cafe standards limit nhtsas duty to assess environmental impacts such as climate change more specifically while nhtsas assessment indicated the exp ected amount of co2 emitted by lightduty trucks under the new cafe standard it failed to evaluate the incremental impact that th emissions will have on c limate change in light of other past present and reasonably foreseeab actions such as other light truck and

by the prof merrill article supra note 100 is whether these general standing requirements develope d in the context of private lawsuits should apply in suit such as state of connecticut that is in parens patriae suit brought by state attorneys general under public nuisance law 102 connecticut v american elec po wer 406 f supp 2d 265 sdny 2005 103 baker v carr 369 us 186 210 1962litigation100 to reiterate many of these gr ounds typify the difficulties encountered when one seeks to address through private litigation ubiquitous longterm environmental problem to whic h countless parties contribute in dismissal motion some defendants argued there is federal common law cause of action for climate change creating such federal common law they argued runs afoul of supreme court directives th at federal courts do so only in limited areas especially where as with climate change the problem at issue has sweeping implications even assuming viable federal commonlaw nuisance theory they continued congresss enactment of co mprehensive scheme of air pollution regulation in the caa displaces federal cour t authority in this area defendants also challenge plaintiffs standing to sue pl aintiffs they argued have not demonstrated the injury in fact requisite of standing because they allege only injuries from climate change in the indefinite future nor said these defendants have plaintiffs shown causation because they do not alle ge that defendants conduct will directly cause the consequences of climate change especially since defendants collective emissions are admitted to be less than 212 of the global total from human activities101 as mentioned the viability of these federal common law of nuisance and nostanding arguments by defendants may be sign ificantly affected the displacement argument helped the others hurt by massachusetts v epa second motion sought dismissal for l ack of personal jurisdiction these movants alleged that although their powerpl ants are located in 20 states none is in new york where the case was filed or any other plaintiff state except wisconsin final motion to dismiss asserted that to the limited extent federal common law claim to abate an interstate nuisance has been recognized it has been limited to actions brought by state entities nor sa id defendants can plaintiffs assert public nuisance because they have not alleged special injury to their properties or private nuisance because they have not alleged substantial harm as indicated the dismissal motions in connecticut and open space institute have now been ruled on by the district court102 which dismissed the cases on political question grounds this judicial doctrin requires court to look into the appropriateness under our system of government of ttributing finality to the action of the political departments ie the legislative and executive branches and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for judicial determination103 one situation judicially recognized as pointing to political questi on hence dismissal of the action is the impossibility of deciding the case without an initial policy dete rmination of kindhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32764crs26 104 id at 217 105 presumably two of the plaintiffs new york state and new york city have been able to support their standing to sue by argume nts not contrary to those they made against plaintiff standing in another publicnuisance climate change case in which they were the defendants avoiding contradictory arguments was presumably facilitated by the idiosyncratic nature of the globalwarming harms alleged by the pro plaintiff eg those based on plaintiffs enhanced vulnerability to diseasecausing po llution as compared to the general population

on so many areas of national and international policy as political question the court be lieved the climate change issue in these suits to be for the legislature not the courts to resolve very possibly the amorphousness of nuisance law giving the court little guidance in resolving these cases may have hurt the plaintiffs cause these cases are now on appeal to the second circuit105 second nuisance action was filed in 2006 by california against several automobile manufacturers base d on the alleged contributions of their vehicles to climate change impacts in the state the suit alleges that these impacts constitute public nuisance under federal or state co mmon law and seeks monetary damages plaintiffs in connecticut seek injunctive relief the district court dismissed the suit on the same politicalquestion rationale as in connecticut namely the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion california v general motors corp 2007 westlaw 2726871 nd cal september 17 2007 the need for an initial polic determination by the political branches was supported in the courts view by the complexity of the climate change issue the need for political guidance in divining what is an unreasonable interference with the public s rights the definition of public nuisance and the existing debate over global warming in the political branches ironically the environmental win in massachusetts v epa was cited by the court against the state both because that d ecision found authority over ghg emissions to lie with the federal government and because it recognized states standing to press its grievances at the federal level n appeal to the ninth circuit is pending most recently native village on the aska coast sued

preempts state regulation of ghg emissions arises chiefly in connection with mobile sources with limited exceptions the caa disclaims any intention to preempt state air pollution controls on stationary sources106 and the energy policy and conser vation act does not set fuel economy standards for other than mobile sources so it too would be unlikely to preempt state regulation of stationary sour ces however some have asserted that state regulation of stationarysource ghgs is preempted as contrary to the federal governments authority over foreign policy an argument being pressed so far unsuccessfully in litigation attacking state regulation of mobilesource ghg emissions see below the most prominent state enactment limiting ghg emissions from stationary sources is that of california which so far has not been challenged107httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32764crs28 107 continued to reduce statewide ghg emissions to the 1990 level by 2020 note however that although ab 32 applies chiefly to stationary sources it provides that if the mobile source ghg emission limits imposed by an earlier state enactment are struck down alternative regulations to restrict mobilesource ghg emissions shall be imposed under ab 32 as the following paragraphs of the text discuss this earlier enactment is now the subject of preemption challenge 108 caa 209a 42 usc 7543a 109 caa 302k 42

relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles 108 and the act defines emission standard as certain limits on emissions of air pollutants 109 the supreme court has now held that at least for purposes of mobile sources air pollutants includes ghgs thus caa preemption of state re gulation of car nd truck ghg emissions is clear whether or not epa proceeds to regulate particular mobilesource ghg it would seem then that states are preempted from setting emission standards for co2 methane and hydrofluorocarbons thr ee substances said to enhance climate change even though epa has not set m obilesource emission standards for them an exception to the general caa rule preempting state mobilesource emission regulation is that epa may waive caa preemption for one particular

involves good deal of guesswork as they lie on the frontiers of international law this report concerned primarily with actually filed claims notes only few highlights taken mostly from what appears to be the most pertinent article in the area119 the article suggests that the international court of justice icj might be one forum for resolution of climate change claims with jurisdiction established through treaties that specifically provide for disput resolution before the court problem with the icj approach is that the treatie s most likely to be invoked are friendship commerce and navigation or similar tr eaties which focus on how each party within its own country treats the other countrys nationals and property climate change suit by contrast likely would have an extraterritorial focus another icj possibility would be for the court to render an dvisory opinion at the request of body authorized under the charter to request one other possibilities include voluntary submission of climate change dispute to any of several international arbitral forums or resort to the specialized dispute resolution systems created under various treaties an example of the latter reportedly being actively cons idered is fisheries cons ervation agreement under the law of the sea convention presumably on the argument that increased ocean temperatures from climate change imperil certain fish stocks120 some principles that might be applie d to claim alleging ghgcaused injury might be taken from the inte rnational law of transboundary pollution for example the restatement third of foreign relati ons law describes an international law principle under which nation must take ch measures as may be necessary to the extent practicable under the circ umstances to ensure that activ ities within its jurisdiction or control are conducted so as not to cause significant injury to the environment of another state121 similarly the trail smelter arbitration

change has violated the inuits human rights including their rights to their culture to property to the preservation of health life and physical integrity and so on124 inuit culture is described in the petition as inseparable from the condition of its physical surroundi ngs generally the interamerican commission on human rights is empowered to recommend measures that contribute to human rights protection request stat in urgent cases to adopt specific precautionary measures to avoi d serious harm to human rights or submit cases to the interamerican court of human rights the united states however has not accepted the jurisdiction of this court so the inuit pet ition sought only to have the commission prepare report declaring the responsibilities of the united states and recommending corrective measures in 2006 the inuit petition was rejected w ith reasons given as is customary for the commission however at the request of petitioners the commission held hearing on march 1 2007 on the generic issu of climate change and human rights one may speculate that the commission felt more comfortable with the hearing format than the petition because the former did not single out the

however that success in the conventional sense obtaini ng judgment for the environmental plaintiff is not the only objective of many of these suits some of the climate change litigation almost certainly has longrange strategic purpose to keep climate change on the political front burner and make it difficult for government and ghg emitters to ignore the problem in the conventional sense of

government consideration of climate change as this report shows standing has been persistent issue for environmental plaintiffs though of late the tide appears to be shifting in their favor and at least for states the supreme court decision in massachusetts v epa is likely to work sea change in improving plaintiffs prosp ects as noted earlier the big question is the extent to which the supreme court decision finding standing will be seen by the lower courts to generalize to nonstate plaintiffs othe r statutory and common law contexts and injuries as from weather events not as clearly attributable to climate change as massachusettss loss of shore land causation is not only component of the threshold standing test but component of the plaintiffs case on the merits several writers have identified proof of causation as key obstacle to tort action seeking relief from climate change injury133 and at the remedy stage allocati on of damages among specific defendants will likely present both factual and legal challenges in either the standing or caseinchief contexts the climate change issues in privateremedy actions reprise an intractable problem in environmental law imposing liability for harms that are remote in time and place from the pollution sought to be abated particularly where the pollution comes from multiple sources134 lawmakers of yesteryear encountered this same redistributive conundrum in tackling the problem of acid rain where pollution cau and effect are separated by hundreds of miles and weeks or months imposing liability for harm from exposure to toxic chemicals is of the same ilk exposure to contamination from multiple sources may result in ill effects manifested only decade or two later perhaps because of these hurdles under ex isting law
