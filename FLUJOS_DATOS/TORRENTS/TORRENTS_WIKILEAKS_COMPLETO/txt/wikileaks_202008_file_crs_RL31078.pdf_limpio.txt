trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31078the shiba farms dispute and its implications summary israels withdrawal from southern lebanon in may 2000 left several small but sensitive territorial issues unresolved notably roughly 10 square mile enclave at the southern edge of the lebanesesyrian border known as the shiba farms israel did not evacuate this enclave arguing that it is not lebanese territory but rather is part of the syrian golan heights which israel occupied in 1967 lebanon supported by syria asserts that this territory is part of lebanon and should have been evacuated by israel when the latter abandoned its selfdeclared security zone in may 2000 on june 16 2000 the secretary general informed the security council that the requirement for israel to withdraw from lebanon had been met the secretary general pointed out however that the determination does not prejudice the rights of syria and lebanon to agree on an international boundary in the future this obscure enclave has become focal point for tensions in the lebanese israelisy rian border area in the aftermath of israels withdrawal from southern lebanon neither the lebanese armed forces nor the interim force in lebanon unifil has established an effective presence in the border territory vacated by israel in 2000 the lebanese shiite muslim militia hizballah which had spearheaded guerrilla war against israeli forces in lebanon has continued to mount raids against israeli forces in the shiba farms area israel blames syria which maintains over 20000 troops in lebanon for tolerating or inciting the hizballah attacks and has retaliated against syrian military installations in lebanon as these clashes continue observers fear that they could escalate into higher level of conflict there are various alternatives that might break the cycle of violence centered on the shiba farms area wider deployment of the lebanese armed forces or unifil formal lebanesesyrian border agreement confirming lebanese sovereignty over the shiba farms or israeli withdrawal from the shiba farms area all of these would require syrian and israeli concurrence which does not seem likely at this time syria may see continued tension over the shiba farms as means of keeping pressure on israel to end its occupation of the golan heights territory israel on its part is probably wary of taking any steps that might strengthen the position of syria or hizballah in southeastern lebanon the shiba farms area remains source of tension and potential risk beyond its small size and limited strategic value the shiba farms area has become yet another symbol of the intractability of broader arabisraeli issues if unresolved it could lead to an increase in tensions and localized conflict that would further complicate

dispute and its implications israels withdrawal from southern lebanon on may 24 2000 left several small but sensitive territorial issues unresolved the principal example is roughly 25 square kilometer approximately 10 square mile enclave called the shiba farms1 which lies at the southern edge of the lebanesesyrian border in the past this enclave has been widely regarded as part of syria specifically as part of the syrian golan heights territory which was occupied by israel during the arabisrael war of 1967 lebanon supported by syria asserts that this territory is part of lebanon and should have been evacuated by israel when the latter abandoned its selfdeclared security zone in southern lebanon in may 2000 the shiba farms territory remains source of further unrest along lebanons borders with israel and the syrian golan heights as the lebanese shiite muslim militia hizballah continues to challenge israeli military units in the disputed enclave this report discusses the origins of the shiba farms dispute current issues in the debate concerning sovereignty over this area and implications of the dispute for regional stability besides the shiba farms area several other territorial issues remain unresolved but so far they have not constituted significant flash points in the region provisional line drawn by team to confirm israels withdrawal in may 2000 divided the town of ghajar located near the shiba farms between lebanon and the israelioccupied golan heights israeli officials have expressed concern over this arrangement also lebanon claims seven northern israeli villages that were included in israel under earlier international agreements however lebanese leaders acknowledge that these villages are not part of the lebanese territory occupied by israel in 1978 these lingering disputes over the seven villages ghajar and other small pieces of territory are not discussed in this report origins of the dispute the shiba farms area the term shiba farms sometimes referred to as shiba farmlands refers to group of approximately 14 farmsteads lying between the asal valley in the northern golan heights and the syrianlebanese boundary as depicted on most maps of the region the roughly 25 square kilometer 10 square mile area of the shiba farms is narrow and elongated stretching northeast to southwest for distance of roughly 15 kilometers 10 miles

the town of shiba which is located north of the farmlands and across the lebanes esyrian golan border in lebanon the absence of the shiba farms on most maps may reflect the fact that they do not constitut clearly defined area and have only recently become the focus of international attention in the aftermath of israels withdrawal from lebanon in may 2000 official united nations maps of peacekeeping operations in this region for example do not mention the shiba farms although the secretary general refers to them at some length in his may 2000 report dealing with israeli withdrawal several periodicals dealing with middle east affairs however do contain maps showing the general location of the shiba farms3 and their general location is indicated on the accompanying map border evolution the shiba farms controversy is legacy of overlapping border disputes among israel lebanon and syria borders among the three countries evolved from post world war i arrangements which awarded mandates to britain and france to administer several former ottoman turkish territories in 1923 britain which had mandate for the territory of palestine and france which had mandates for syria and lebanon4 negotiated boundary separating palestine from lebanon and syria after the establishment of israel in most of the palestine mandate territory in 1948 and the arabisraeli war that followed the 1923 line was succeeded by two separate lines under armistice arrangements in 1949 an israelilebanese armistice line which replicated the lebanonpalestine segment of the former 1923 boundary negotiated by britain and france some minor border adjustments took place in subsequent years by mutual agreement an israelisyrian armistice line which deviated somewhat from the 1923 boundary

these changes continue as issues in stalled israelisyrian peace talks5 different situation existed with regard to lebanon and syria france which had mandates for both countries did not define formal boundary between the two although it did separate them by administrative divisions nor did lebanon and syria establish formal boundary after gaining independence from france in the aftermath of world war ii the secretary general noted in may 2000 that there seems to be official record of formal international boundary agreement between lebanon and the syrian arab republic6 the absence of such an agreement complicates the task of determining ownership of the shiba farms war and occupation subsequent arabisraeli conflicts and civil strife in lebanon created further border complications during the june 1967 arabisraeli war israel occupied 450 square mile portion of southwestern syria known as the golan heights following another arabisraeli war in october 1973 then us secretary of state henry kissinger negotiated disengagement agreement between israel and syria under this agreement disengagement observer force undof was assigned to the golan area to maintain ceasefire supervise initial disengagement of forces and supervise an area of separation and areas of limited armament between the two forces the shiba farms enclave is located at the northwestern end of the undof area of operations as discussed in more detail below see map and appendix lebanons 15year civil war which began in 1975 made the situation even more intricate in 1976 syrian forces entered lebanon at the invitation of then lebanese president suleiman frangieh and remained in large parts of the country nominally as part of an arab peacekeeping force in 1978 brief incursion by israeli forces into southern lebanon operation litani in retaliation for palestinian guerrilla attacks led to the adoption of security council resolution 425 which called on israel to withdraw from southern lebanon resolution 425 also created interim force in lebanon unifil with threefold mission to confirm withdrawal of israeli forces to restore international peace and security in the area and to assist the government of lebanon in reestablishing effective authority over southern lebanon companion resolution number 426 deals with implementation of resolution 425 most maps and other information available

s2000260 p 4 paragraph 21 as noted below the security council endorsed the secretary generals report in which he outlined these requirementsalthough israel withdrew from southern lebanon later in 1978 it launched largescale invasion of lebanon in 1982 operation peace for galilee designed to eliminate armed palestinian groups and expel syrian troops from lebanon in the end the israeli operation succeeded in evicting palestinian guerrillas however syrian forces though badly mauled stayed in lebanon for the next 3 years israeli forces remained in the southern third of lebanon withdrawi ng to the extreme south in 1985 as security in lebanon continued to deteriorate from 1985 until 2000 israeli forces in conjunction with proisraeli lebanese militia the south lebanon army or sla maintained what israel described as security zone approximately nine miles wide just north of the israelilebanese border during this period israeli and sla forces were increasingly targeted by the lebanese shiite muslim militia hizballah which enjoyed wide support among southern lebanons largely shiite population and other sectarian groups as well unifil found its activities significantly circumscribed by the presence of warring parties in its area of operations israeli withdrawal from lebanon in march 2000 as israeli and sla casualties continued to mount the israeli cabinet approved proposal by then prime minister ehud barak to withdraw from lebanon by july preferably through an agreement with lebanon but otherwise unilaterally lebanon refused to negotiate an agreement unless israel undertook to withdraw from the syrian golan heights and help find solution to the problem of over 300000 palestinian refugees in lebanon on may 4 2000 lebanon also raised the issue of the shiba farms informing the secretary generals envoy that lebanon planned to claim this territory in the context of israels obligation to withdraw from lebanon under the provisions of security council resolution 425 of 1978 unable to reach agreement with lebanon and faced with the collapse of its sla allies israel completed its withdrawal from its former security zone in southern lebanon on may 24 it did not however withdraw from the shiba farms enclave which it does not regard as part of lebanon see section entitled other positions below meanwhile the secretary general had identified three principal requirements that must be fulfilled for the united nations to certify that israel had fully complied with resolution 425 withdrawal of israeli military and civilian personnel from lebanese territory including lebanese territorial waters and air space b dissolution of israels auxiliary force the south lebanon army sla and c release of all prisoners detained in prison operated by the sla in the southern lebanese town of khiam7 the second and third requirements were met quickly as the sla collapsed and its leaders fled to israel and other countries the first requirement was more complicated because of uncertainties surrounding the exact location on the ground of lebanons borders with israel and with the israelioccupied golan heights territory of syriahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31078crs5 8a

line to accomplish this task the secretary general identified line of withdrawal commonly called the blue line based on available cartographic material and technical survey conducted on the ground by team in consultation with the governments of israel and lebanon the secretary general emphasized that the was not establishing border but rather was drawing line for the purpose of confirming israeli withdrawal in compliance with resolution 425 it was the intent of the secretary general however that the line should conform as closely as possible to recognized international borders the blue line as drawn by the team consisted of two segments longer segment approximately 80 kilometers between lebanon and israel and shorter segment approximately 20 kilometers between lebanon and the israeli occupied golan heights territory see map the first segment of the blue line conformed largely to the 1949 israeli lebanese armistice line although minor adjustments were made to accommodate existing towns and terrain features8 regarding the second segment of the blue line as noted earlier there was formal syrianlebanese border agreement that could serve as guide for the team in drawing line between lebanon and the syrian golan territory which israel had occupied in 1967 consequently the secretary general recommended that the line separating the area of operations of unifil the force in southern lebanon and undof the force in golan be used to confirm israels withdrawal from lebanon in the eastern sector using the unifil undof line for this purpose had the effect of placing the shiba farms in the golan territory rather than in lebanon undof and unifil sectors are shown on the accompanying map and described further in the appendix both the israeli and lebanese governments expressed reservations over several small segments of the blue line however according to the secretary general the two countries took the position that identifying this line was solely the responsibility of the united nations and that they will respect the line as identified9 on june 16 2000 the secretary general informed the security council that israel had withdrawn from lebanon in compliance with resolution 425 and on july 27 in resolution 1310 the security council called on lebanon and israel to respect the line of withdrawal blue line the government of lebanon however has asserted that the

withdrawal that the shiba farms area acquired its new found prominence in the past the small enclave wedged between the slopes of mt hermon and the golan heights had attracted little attention residents of the nearby town of shiba which lies clearly in lebanon say that they and their ancestors had cultivated the farms for over 200 years prior to 1967 when israel captured the golan heights including the shiba farms area11 initially israel reportedly allowed residents of shiba town to harvest olives and other produce from the shiba farms every 2 years but withdrew its permission in the 1970s since israel occupied the shiba farms portions of the enclave have become winter resort and center for wine production under israeli proprietorship and in recent years jews from ethiopia have moved onto some of the farms12 the following discussion summarizes the lebanese and positions on the shiba farms as well as the positions of other interested parties lebanons position lebanese government officials generally take the position that the shiba farms area has always been part of lebanon or was transferred to lebanon by syria some years ago some lebanese officials have mentioned an alleged transfer of the shiba farms area from syria to lebanon in 1951 according to another lebanese version the two countries entered into an oral agreement in 1951 dividing jurisdiction over the farms between them neither agreement appears to have been documented or registered with the united nations13 in may 2000 on the eve of israels withdrawal from lebanon the lebanese government provided the united nations with title deeds showing lebanese ownership of the farmlands in the disputed area together with other documents indicating that lebanese governmental and religious institutions had held jurisdiction over the farmlands at various times in addition the government of lebanon informed the united nations that joint lebanesesyrian border commission concluded in 1964 that the shiba

little brown and co 1982 p 1254international border should be redefined to reflect that conclusion also the government of lebanon provided the united nations with 1966 map which reflected the lebanese position that the shiba farms are located in lebanon14 lebanese officials have continued to maintain their claim to the shiba farms in april 2001 lebanese prime minister rafiq alhariri was asked during visit to the united states if he agreed with the hizballah position that the shiba farms are part of lebanon he answered this is not the theory of hezbollah variant spelling this is the theory of the lebanese government we believe it is lebanese territory for sure15 in press conference with secretary of state colin powell hariri told reporters that we can argue all the time about whether the shiba farms is lebanese or syrian but that it is not on israeli land anyway the position in response to lebanons claims and such supporting documentation as lebanese officials were able to provide the secretary general noted the following pertinent points16 first with regard to the 1966 map provided by the lebanese government locating the shiba farms in lebanon the united nations has 10 other maps issued after 1966 by various lebanese governmental institutions including the ministry of defense all 10 of these lebanese maps place the shiba farms inside syria moreover according to the secretary general the united nations has six maps issued by the government of syria including three maps published after 1966 and all six locate the disputed area in syria second the division of responsibilities between the two relevant peacekeeping forces tends to support the position that the shiba farms are located on syrian rather than lebanese territory undof created in 1974 is located on the golan heights where it supervises the cease fire agreement of that year between syria and israel17 unifil was established in 1978 with its area of operations in southern lebanon although as noted above it has not fully deployed throughout the area because of the presence of other warring parties the secretary general noted that the 1974 israelisyrian disengagement agreement that

pointed out that the security council could not have included the shiba farms in the unifil area of operations ie southern lebanon because the farms were already included in the area of another peacekeeping force namely undof placing the shiba farms in lebanon would require shifting this enclave from undofs to unifils area of operations this would necessitate modifying longstanding security council decisions defining the areas supervised by undof and unifil in view of the foregoing in report to the security council of may 22 2000 the secretary general recommended that the line separating the unifil and undof area of operations be used to identify the portion of the blue line between lebanon and the israelioccupied golan heights in effect this meant placing the shiba farms in syrian territory in his report the secretary general explained that this definition was solely for the purpose of confirming israeli withdrawal from lebanon and would not prejudice any international border agreement that lebanon and syria might wish to conclude in the future in statement on may 23 2000 the security council welcomed and said it strongly endorses the report of the secretarygeneral of 22 may 2000 s20004 60 security council resolution 1310 adopted on july 27 2000 among other things called on the parties to respect the withdrawal line exercise utmost restraint and cooperate fully with the united nations and with unifil other positions syria supports lebanons claim to the shiba farms as does the lebanese shiite muslim militia hizballah which has continued to challenge militarily israels presence in the disputed area in telephone conversation with the secretary general on may 16 2000 the syrian foreign minister endorsed lebanons assertion that lebanesesyrian team had concluded that the shiba farms were located on lebanese territory subsequently lebanese newspaper reproduced what it claimed was copy of letter dated october 24 2000 from the syrian permanent representative to the united nations to the president of the security council stating that the shiba farms are on lebanese territory19 some analysts believe that syria and hizballah raised the issue of this obscure enclave as justification for continuing to put military pressure on israel to withdraw from the golan heights in the aftermath of its withdrawal from lebanon20 syrian and hizballah representatives

the blue line as established by the united nations observing that we should talk to the united nations so that this line includes the shebaa farms21 israel has not spoken extensively on the legal aspects of the issue but has made clear that it has intention of withdrawing from the shiba farms under present circumstances on may 28 2000 then prime minister ehud barak said the territory would not be evacuated and then foreign minister david levy added that the united nations had made determination which would be binding on israel22 in may 2001 an israeli diplomat confirmed that his government does not regard the shiba farms as part of lebanon23 the united states has endorsed the position on the requirements for israeli withdrawal without taking position on sovereignty over the shiba farms in press briefing on may 31 2000 then spokesman philip reeker told reporters the following we supported the secretary generals report which was submitted to the security council and unanimously endorsed that shebaa farms is part of territory that israel occupied in 1967 so the has stated very clearly that shebaa farms does not fall within the scope of security council resolutions 425 and 426 which sic regard to the withdrawal from lebanon he did not respond directly however when asked whether the shiba farms were part of syria or part of lebanon in may 2000 both houses of congress passed resolutions sconres 116 and hconres 331 commending israel for its decision to withdraw and for taking risks for peace while calling on unifil in conjunction with the lebanese armed forces to gain full control over southern lebanon neither resolution specifically mentioned the shiba farms anomalies periodic statements by various officials concerned with the area have injected further ambiguities in the claims and counterclaims over the shiba farms area for example although he helped frame the decisions that effectively put the shiba farms in syrian territory secretarygeneral kofi annan suggested that the territory could be allocated to lebanon in the future on june 15 2001 he told reporters in beirut that the shiba farms issue in time will be resolved and the land will be back in lebanon but

the town of alghajar which was split by the blue line between lebanon and the israelioccupied syrian golan heights there is close territorial linkage between alghajar and the shiba farms both situated just to the northwest of the asal valley see map but the syrian foreign minister while maintaining that the shiba farms are lebanese has asserted that ghajar lies in occupied syrian territory us expert believes this assertion undermines the lebanesesyrian claim that the shiba farms are located on lebanese territory he comments that the putative boundary that would place the shaba farms in lebanon would do the same for alghajar24 on the other hand the mayor of alghajar appears to reject the theory of territorial linkage between his town and the shiba farms speaking to reporters the mayor asserted that we are syrians and added that the lebanese claim to the shiba farms which he did not dispute has nothing to do with ghajar because it ghajar is originally syrian25 finally some observerseven those who regard the shiba farms as syriansuggest that small parts of this illdefined area may spill over into lebanon for example in statement carried by his office at the time of israels withdrawal from lebanon in may 2000 then israeli prime minister ehud barak said that 90 percent of the territory of the farms did not belong to lebanon baraks comment implies that small portion or an extension of the farms could be in lebanese territory ambiguities over the location of the shiba farms are likely to continue as long as broader issues involving israel lebanon and syria remain unresolved implications the status of the shiba farms could be an important factor in any future agreements involving israel lebanon and syria if the shiba farms area forms part of lebanese territory occupied by israel in 1982 it would come under the provisions of resolutions 425 and 426 which address israeli withdrawal from lebanon if the shiba farms area forms part of the syrian golan heights territory occupied by israel in 1967 it would come under the provisions of other resolutions 242 and 338 which address the golan territory and other broader aspects of the arabisraeli conflict in practice it may prove difficult to determine the appropriate provisions that would apply to this territory during any future negotiations among other things the question of the shiba farms illustrates the difficulty in disaggregating the israeli lebanese and the israelisyrian tracks of the stalled arabisraeli peace process this difficulty is probably welcomed by syria which has consistently favored linkage between the two negotiating tracks for the time being the controversy over the shiba farms helps feed continuing unrest in southern lebanon in his periodic reports to the security council the secretary general has mentioned several serious breaches of the blue line in the shiba farms area since the summer of 2000 in one of these incidents on octoberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31078crs11 26weymouth opcit in this connection as noted earlier the secretary general stated that the requirement for israeli withdrawal from lebanon included

lebanon since 1996 in addition there have been numerous lower level incidents involving ground violations of the blue line attacks by fire and frequent israeli overflights of lebanese air space continued friction in the shiba farms area coupled with palestinian uprising broadly supported throughout the arab world carries risk of further escalation several alternatives have been proposed in an effort to reverse these potentially dangerous trends in the vicinity of the shiba farms any of these alternative approaches however is likely to encounter serious obstacles to its implementation one alternative would be the return of effective lebanese authority throughout southern lebanon up to the blue line including those areas of southeastern lebanon adjacent to the shiba farms security council resolution 1310 of july 27 2000 called on lebanon to take this step following israels withdrawal so far however lebanon has deployed only small mixed force of approximately 1000 military and police units in isolated parts of southern lebanon leaving the hizballah militia in effective control of most of the areas vacated by israel when asked during an april 2001 press interview why lebanon had failed to deploy its armed forces in the south prime minister hariri responded that achieving peace agreement is more important than sending an army at this time he added that although israel had withdrawn from lebanon the previous year israel continues to violate lebanons territorial waters and air space on daily basis26 in all likelihood however neither syria nor hizballah would approve of lebanese army deployment that could complicate hizballahs ability to maintain pressure on israel in southern lebanon second alternative also enjoined by security council resolution 1310 would be wider deployment of unifil in southern lebanon such step might help reduce continuing tensions in the shiba farms area and other potential flash points in the vicinity of the blue line again syria and its allies probably would not welcome wider unifil deployment that might constrain hizballah pressure on israel moreover unifil in the past has had little success in restraining israeli responses to challenges mounted from southern lebanon in actuality the secretary general has recommended cutting back on the number of personnel in unifil since according to officials the force has already met its main goals on july 31 2001 the security council voted to downgrade unifil cutting back its size and scaling back its missions the secretary general envisions reduced force of approximately 2000 by mid2002 down from 5800 in january 200127 this reconfiguration of unfils size and role does not augur wider deploymenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31078crs12 28for further discussion of this option see nicholas blanford shebaa farms and beyond middle east insight septemberoctober 2001 p 8 29also israeli leaders may be unwilling to carry out any further withdrawals in view of widespread perceptions that their unilateral withdrawal in may 2000 was perceived as sign of weakness and may have enhanced hizballahs position as role model for other arabs see alan philps israeli troops prepare for long

heartland financial times london october 28 2000 p 7a third alternative would be for lebanon and syria to conclude bilateral agreement stipulating that the shiba farms are situated on lebanese territory in his report of may 2000 the secretary general pointed out that the placement of the blue line which effectively put the shiba farms in occupied syrian territory was done without prejudice to any internationally recognized border agreement that lebanon and the syrian arab republic may wish to conclude in the future although the two parties are free in theory to reach such an agreement as practical matter it would be hard for lebanese and syrian cartographers to demarcate new boundary as long as the disputed area remains under israeli occupation28 there is guarantee that israel on its part would respond to an ex post facto border agreement between syria and lebanon by unilaterally withdrawing from the shiba farms then too syria despite its current endorsement of lebanons claim to the shiba farms may be unwilling to sign away this enclave on permanent basis fourth alternative would be for israel to recognize lebanons claim of sovereignty over the shiba farms and withdraw from the territory unilaterally or in agreement with one or more of the other interested parties by doing so israel could test the sincerity of syrian lebanese and hizballah leaders who have previously stated or implied that attacks on israeli forces would cease upon israels full withdrawal from lebanese territory at best israeli withdrawal from the shiba farms could eliminate the principal catalyst for continued fighting on the southern lebanese border at worst it could leave vacuum that might result in further instability in this area on balance it seems unlikely that israel would consider such step unless assured that its forces would not be replaced by those of hizballah or syria29 the latter on their part have little incentive to guarantee tranquility as the price of israels withdrawal from small enclave that is not of major concern to either syria or hizballah syria in particular may see continued tension over the shiba farms as means of keeping pressure on israel to end its 34year occupation of the syrian golan heights in the meantime the shiba farms area remains source of tension and potential risk beyond its small size and limited strategic value the shiba farms area has become yet another symbol of the intractability of broader arabisraeli issues if unresolved it could lead to an increase in tensions and localized conflict that would further
