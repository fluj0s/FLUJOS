that newspapers and magazines that publish articles written by freelance authors do not automatically have the right to include those articles in electronic databases background jonathan tasini and five freelance writers brought suit against the new york times newsday and time inc print publishers for copyright infringement as consequence of the inclusion of their articles in electronic

usc 404a 3 17 usc 201d2the writers brought suit in us district court alleging copyright infringement by both the print publishers and the electronic publishers plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief and damages as defense the publishers asserted the privilege to include copyrighted work in revision of collective work the privilege is accorded publishers under 17 usc 201c of the copyright act which provides copyright in each separate contribution to collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as whole and vests initially in the author of the contribution in the absence of an express transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it the owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work any revision of that collective work and any later collective work in the same series the district court issued summary judgment in favor of the publishers holding that the databases were part of revision of that collective work the second circuit court of appeals reversed holding that the databases were not among the collective works covered by 201c and specifically were not revisions of the periodicals in which the articles were originally published the courts decision in 72 decision prepared by justice ginsburg the court examined the legislative history of the authorial rights of freelance writers and explained why the electronic databases are not in the courts view revisions of the original collective works prior to enactment of the current copyright law in 1976 freelance authors contribution to collective work was preserved only if the article was published with copyright notice in the authors name since this was rarely done or because the notice appeared only in the publishers name freelance authors contribution to collective work could easily fall into the public domain thus even though freelance writer could theoretically retain copyright interest in contribution to collective work the right was easily relinquished or unenforceable in the 1976 copyright act congress acted to remedy this perceived inequity the law specifies that single notice applicable to collective work as whole is sufficient to protect the rights of freelance authors2 further it expressly provides that an exclusive right including subdivision of any right may be transferred and owned separately3 and the provision of 201c quoted above expressly provides that the copyright in contribution to collective work is distinct from the rights in the work as whole it describes and limits the privilege publisher acquires regarding an authors contribution to collective work this adjustment in rights between the freelance author and the publisher the court explained is designed to accommodate freelancers copyright in her contribution after authorizing the initial publication the freelance author may resell the article to others because the 1976 copyright act clearly demonstrates congressional intent to protect the divisible but retained copyright interest of the freelancer in an articlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20964crs3 4 slip opinion at 14 5 the right to display work publicly is one of the authors discrete rights in 17 usc 1065 the register of copyright suggested that the authors display right was implicated in the litigation and therefore the publishers privilege of reproduction and distribution under 201c need not be the legal fulcrum for resolving the issue 147 c ong rec e1823 daily ed feb 14 2001 the court did not reach this contention which was not argued by the parties to the case 6 slip opinion at 15 citation omitted that is initially published as part of collective work the court was not willing to interpret 201c in manner that it believed would diminish the authors exclusive rights the court acknowledged that there were factual disputes regarding ownership of the freelancers copyright interests the sole question before it was whether the transmission by the print publishers to the electronic publishers and their commercial use of the material was encompassed by the 201c privilege of revision to determine whether the articles were reproduced and distributed as part of revision of the collective works the court focused on the articles as presented to and perceptible by the user of the databases4 it lent great weight to the fact that when the user conducts search the electronic databases produce each article as separate item despite the fact that the article notes its placement page number etc in the publication it is displayed with minimal connection to the original publication5 indeed the court refused to view the vast scope of collected articles within each electronic database as in any way constituting revision of the original newspaper or magazine from which the article was extracted one might view the articles as parts of new compendium namely the entirety of works in the database in that compendium each edition of each periodical represents only minuscule fraction of the everexpanding database the database more constitutes revision of each constituent edition than 400page novel quoting sonnet in passing would represent revision of that poem revision denotes new version and version is in this setting distinct form of something regarded by its creators or others as one work the massive whole of the database is not recognizable as new version of its every small part6 the publishers argued that the databases were comparable to the permitted collections of periodicals maintained on microfiche or microfilm but the court rejected the analogy distinguishing microforms because each article appears in context although user can extract an individual article she must manipulate the microform much as she may have used the original that is if an article appears on page a2 and is continued on page a12 the reader must view reproductions of those pages on the film the databases in contrast offer users individual articles not intact periodicals the fact that user can manipulate the database to generate search results consisting only of articles from particular periodical edition did not sway the court because database can be used in noninfringing manner does not immunize it from other infringing activityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20964crs4 7 slip opinion at 8the dissent the dissenting opinion written by justice stevens and concurred in by justice breyers expressed far broader view of possible revision of collective work one that would encompass the material on the electronic databases in their view the standalone aspect of the databases document retrieval coupled with information identifying its context in the original publication is sufficient to support the publishers revision privilege they based their conclusion on several principles they felt that the argument of the publishers invoking the concept of media neutrality the principle that the transfer of work between media does not alter its character for copyright purposes was persuasive one doubts that the new york times has the right to reprint its issues in braille in foreign language or in microform even though such revisions might look and feel quite different from the original such differences however would largely result from the different medium being employed7 the minority viewed the standalone feature of articles in electronic databases as an integral feature of the medium employed computer generated ascii text files they were not satisfied with the majoritys distinction between permissible microfilm collections and electronic databases nor do they believe that the majority adequately balances authorial copyright interests against the publics interest in broad availability of literature music and other arts the paramount copyright goal created by the explicit reservation of the freelancers copyright in contribution to collection is to ensure his or her ability to exploit its value in additional media venues for example by republication in new collection such as the authors collected essays or from resale to different publications they concluded that finding copyright infringement in the case before them is not likely to enhance the copyright value of the freelance authors relationship to the original publisher in meaningful or permanent way first according to the publishers since 1995 the new york times has required freelance authors to grant complete electronic rights in addition to print rights but this has not had discernible impact on the freelancers compensation second the dissenters presume that the vast majority of database users seek comprehensive and easily searchable collections of periodicals not the individual writings of freelance authors therefore they conclude that the courts holding does not increase the value of the authorial right in pragmatic way other than their right to retrospective statutory damages for copyright infringement impact of the courts decision great concern was expressed in many quarters including many publishers historians and scholars over the consequences of holding for the freelance authors the publishers contend that either judicial injunctive remedy ordering the excision of the infringing articles from the databases or their voluntarily removal by the publishers themselves in order to mitigate damages for infringement would leave great information void in the historic record encompassed by the databases the court however viewed excision of the infringing material from electronic databases ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20964crs5 unnecessary and undesirable it suggested alternative scenarios such as negotiated agreements between the authors and the publishers to authorize continued electronic reproduction of the infringing articles or blanket licensing arrangements patterned after those utilized by the music industry regardless of the consequences however the court would not subordinate its view of the scope and implementation of authorial rights under the copyright act to speculation about future harm or as expressed by the register of copyright the tasini case should be about authorial rights and the compensation of authors not the preservation of electronic databases the dissent expresses greater concern than the majority over the impact on the public which it believes stands to lose many of the principal benefits from access to comprehensive electronic archives with little if any benefit to either authors or readers
