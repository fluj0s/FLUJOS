6309c25 shspec310 summary ii scientology 0 note summary i was probably 6306c19 shspec276 summary of modern auditing pp 421423 above in the material covered since 24ju163 plus cchs and touch assists we have basically all the material in scientology every level of scientology contains in vignette all the levels of scientology scientology 0 deals with the problems confusions and wrongnesses of existence with the identification of those zones of chaos falsity and upset people go around thinking that healing including mental healing is all solved scientology 0 points out that they are unsolved areas this level is easy to work with because all you have to do is to find falsities and wrongnesses it is matter of degree how much you reveal and point out you dont want to open up too much scientology 0 too fast this requires judgment it is level that has ta in it unless you talk about false solutions it is better to talk about solutions than problems dont imply that there are only problems this gives the audience ta the last stable datum anyone can get in is tolerance of terrible condition it is best to talk about false solutions but this is scientology i scientology i gets the false solutions off scientology 0 just recognizes existing chaos typical question on scientology 0 would be do you find your home noisy do you like your job the idea is to give the person the idea that his life might be better that is the sole therapeutic action of scientology 0 hope instilled by identifying problems and giving faint hope for change this is quite workable this level says 1 there is problem 2 maybe something can be done about it hope factor view of scientology 0 is view of the world as it exists we need this as legitimate level of inspection scientology 0 is in processing to the extent that in order to find service fac you have to find what problems the pc has that is the scientology 0 factor at that level little of this goes long way in all auditing you have to keep the hfactor in scientology 0 is very acceptable on public level if you keep it very mild as far as the degree of hope you offer is concerned if someone comes in with all sorts of problems take only one and tell him that maybe you can do something about it pick out some small possible gain and put some hope in on it person can have this he can give up just little of his service fac so this gets around the service fac little dont promise the sun and the moon that is too much it is unacceptable it threatens his service fac so what youve got to do is to take one thing and put in very little hope that is acceptable that is confrontable you have to judge what is confrontable and give him neither too much nor too little if you ever gave somebody drill on scientology 0 you would give him long list of confusions and have him pick out the one or ones that people could confront there always something that you can get pc to confront on any dynamic the trick is that there is something to be done about any condition that the person can do the elements of hope are 1 there is something that can be done about it 2 there is something that you can confront and do about it in processing if the pc gets in trouble just getting him to tell you about it can raise his tone level because that is doing something about it in scientology iv never force the pc forward if the hill is too steep dont push be willing for the pc not to do it but at scientology 0 find something that person can do and get him to do it remember gradients when giving advice to people if you advise people this way your advice will be followed and you will win dont ever suggest that they do something that they know cant be done nobody ever gives anybody anything they can do in social work consequently you get socialism and total indigence and you get social workers who go terribly downtone because they have given the client an overwhelm and arc broken him by telling him something that he knows cant be done because of some stable datum that he has adopted at scientology 0 it doesnt matter if you put the itsa line in or he does even in r3sc you can offer things to the pc that you noticed had gotten ta and run them they may be quite confrontable things and therefore not really the service fac but you could get ta running them person who can only confront getting mad at the auditor can confront getting mad at him because he is the persons best friend this is the secret of the arc breaky pc he is arc broken in the world at large and it is safe to get mad at the auditor people may get mad at their friends because that is all that is safe perhaps marital squabbles exist by virtue of this mechanism the scientology 0 aspect of existence is that you dont tell people about problems that you know are unreal to them that they cant do anything about and expect them to be enthusiastic about doing something about them people arent even capable of observing an existing condition they destroy ones stable datum that seeing is believing or that if people just saw something with their own eyes they would believe they dont even see thats the trouble dont ever bother to try to prove anything to person with fixed idea in an area even if he sees it he wont believe it there is ability to observe there is only generality or service fac instead of observation and judgment this person is incapable of asking what is the situation the easiest thing to relay then is an idea that doesnt violate the reality and confront level of the person who is receiving it if he cant look he can get something trustworthily looked at someone who can confront only in small area will be able to be effective only within that area when his confront comes up he will get larger problems to handle he will solve these problems if they are the real problems and not some lowerscale mockery to have real justice you have to have the real situation actually looked at as unbiasedly as possible if all during your career in this universe you had only operated on the real facts you would be in fine shape if you are going to have group operate on any cleared level youve got to take the service fac out of the group as far as you can the characteristics of service fac are 1 nonobservation 2 generality substituting for judgment you cant utterly remove those on an absolute basis from all situations everywhere but you can go long way in this direction the formula for successful handling of case or of third dynamic is 1 what is the situation 2 what part of it is potentially confrontable 3 what part of that can someone actually do something about neglect of this can give you case failures that is the usual reason for case failure someone made an inadequate observation of the confusions of the case and didnt handle the case on the basis of what the auditor and pc could confront the auditor should look over two aspects of case 1 problems and difficulties that he can see in the case 2 the ones the pc can see these are often quite different there is certain level of pc difficulties that the auditor thinks is confrontable and then there is what pc thinks is confrontable if the auditor pays attention to the pcs view of problems and difficulties he will have some loses there is also the question of what the auditor can confront about the case vs the pcs view of what part of his problems as he sees them he can confront then there is also the level of doingness the auditor can confront and the pcs idea of what he can do about those difficulties he can confront thus there are six factors in the auditorpc relationship at scientology 0 1 difficulties the pc is in that the auditor can perceive 2 what the auditor can confront 3 what the auditor is capable of doing about it 4 the pcs estimation of his difficulties 5 which difficulty is confrontable for him 6 what is he willing to do about it you can get case failures by misestimation of any one of these this becomes quite important when you cant get ta action then little discussion with the pc can be very enlightening the greatest use of this survey is in odd advices to pcs advice is something we ordinarily ignore because of fear of evaluating but scientology 0 is the level of giving advice using the above survey would make you very successful advisor whose advice would always be followed 1 get an estimation of the problem situation 2 find what part matter how small he could confront 3 get what of that he can do something about 4 get what he could do about that 5 tell him to do it when you find out what the pc can do be militant about his doing it he will think you are genius but you are just getting him to actually estimate the situation and do what he thinks he can do about it when someone acts on that he gets larger reality more confront etc the cycle can be repeated after being successful once the only difficulty is that pcs confidence can rise faster than their real doingness sometimes pcs overestimate their confront ability so undercut what they think they can do just get them to do that point that they can do and you will have agreement because you havent told them anything that they think is false scientology 0 is the level at which one gets an estimation of the case or situation if you can get the other guy to estimate the situation you seldom have to scientology 0 deals with confront life is successfully lived with scientology 0 well in you probably came downscale just because it was out
