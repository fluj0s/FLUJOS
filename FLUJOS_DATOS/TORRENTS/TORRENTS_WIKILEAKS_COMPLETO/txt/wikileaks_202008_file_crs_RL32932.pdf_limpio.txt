contain entr ies for the introduction of the many bse related bills introduced into this or prev ious congresses except for those in recent years where committee or floor action has occurred this report which will be updated if significant developments ensue is intended to be used alongside other crs reports that provide more background and context for the bse policy debate and that cover many speci fic legislative proposals the chronology begins in 1986 when bse was first identified by british laboratory as the united kingdom and ot hers attempted to understand and contain bse the us and canadian governments were establishing panels to study the disease and began instituting series of safeguards aimed at keeping it out of north america or stopping any spread if it s hould occur here the chronology proceeds into may 2003 when canada reported th first native case in north america december 2003 when the united states reporte d finding case in us herd and most of 2004 when both countries worked to reassure consumers of the safety of north american cattle and beef and to reopen foreign markets blocking these exports us and canadian officials since 2003 also have been strengthening various regulatory safeguards aime d at protecting the cattle herd and the food supply from bse the chronology continues with major ev ents of 2004 2005 and the first half of 2006 which have revolved around efforts to reestablish more open cattle and beef trade within north america even while handful of new cases of bse have emerged here and the steps being take n to regain the japanese and korean markets which were until december 2003 two of the four lead ing foreign buyers of us beef both were closed as of mid2006 although japa n appeared on the verge of reopening as of this writing congress can be expected to continue to play role holding oversight hearings providing funding for bserelated activ ities and possibly considering legislative options to address one or

in north america as of this writing 10 native cases have been confirmed on this continent seven in canada nd three in the united states1 bse is degenerative disease that is fatal to ca ttle affecting their nervous sy stem and it has been linked to rare but fatal human form of the disease which has occurred primarily in the united kingdom where most bse cases also have been reported the following

does not contain entries for the introduction of the many bserelated bills introduced into this or previous congresses except for those in recent ears where committee or floor action has occurred or where markedly widespread attention has been focused nor does it cover number of policy developments that are not directly bserelated but that nonetheless have arisen within the context of bse debate

known about its character its cause or how to contain it the united kingdom uk has so far been the hardesthit region where reported cases affecting cattle continued to climb through the late 1980s and early 1990s to peak of more than 37000 in 1992 cases have been declining each year since then several other countries primarily in other parts of eu rope also reported hundreds of additional cases according to the world animal health organization oie its french acronym as the uk and other countries were copi ng with bse the us and canadian governments were establishing panels to study the disease and instituting series of safeguards aimed at keeping it out of rth america or stopping any spread if it should occur here prior to 2003 the only known case of bse in north america was in

immediately halted the importation of virtually all ruminants and ruminant products including live cattle and beef from canada an interim fi nal rule was published in the may 29 federal register retroactive to may 20 in august the us secretary of agriculture announced that the us border would re open to boneless beef from cattle under 30 months old and other items cons idered to be of low risk for bse rather than issuing proposed or interim rule usda claime d authority to proceed under standing veterinary import permitting process in november usda proposed for comment more extensive rule change that essentially would formaliz and expand imports from canada to include among other things live cattle under 30 months old shortly thereafter testing of cow in mabton washington indicated the presence of the bse agent confirmatory testing affirmed bse and the us secretary of agriculture reported the findings on december 23 this became the first repor ted us case although investigators quickly determined that the animal was not native but rather was born in and imported from canada usda cattlemen and meat i ndustry officials scrambled to reassure us and foreign consumers that us beef was safe and as the year closed the secretary of agriculture announced that she would take number of major steps to strengthen existing us bse safeguards althoug h domestic demand remained firm most foreign countries closed their borders to us beef and live ruminants including cattle january 2003 federal interagency work ing group led by usda in response to legislative manda in pl 1079 provides information on the economic impacts and public health risks if bse or related diseases nd an unrelated disease foot and mouth disease were introduced into the united states and information on federal prev ention efforts and sufficiency of current legislative authority the working group recommends number of policy changes such as strengthening fda authority to enforce its animal feed regulation and to control entry of imports that may risk bringing tses into the united states an extended commitment of budgetary resour ces and better interagency coordination among other things january 21 2003 in an advance notice of propos ed rulemaking aphis solicits public comment to develop appr oaches to control the risk that dead stock and nonambul atory animals could serve as potential pathways for the spread of bse if that disease should ever be introduced into the united states comments were taken until march 24 2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32932crs8 january 31 2003 the

canadian black angus cow becoming the first native case reported in north america may 29 2003 aphis publishes an interim rule retroactive to may 20 2003 adding canada to list of regions where bse exists prohibiting or restricting the importation of meat meat products and other productsbyp roducts of ruminants from canada officials subsequen tly ask harvard to reassess its bse risk model june 26 2003 canada releases the report of an international review team irt of bse experts which concludes that the most likely source of bse would have been consumption of feed containing mbm of ruminant origin contaminated with the bse prion before the us nd canada implemented feed ban in august 1997 the original source of the bse prion in mbm is likely to have been from limited number of cattle imported directly into either canada or the us from the uk in the 1980s and it is likely that some of these animals were slaughtered or died and entered the animal feed system prior to canadian ban on further importations from the uk in 1990 the irt reported the team recommends number of actions including an immediate ban on srms eg brain and spinal cord believed to constitute greater risk of disease review of animal feed regulations strengthened tracking and tracing system s and improved testing july 18 2003 canada announces requirement that effective august 23 2003 srms must be removed from cattle destined for human food srms are defined as including the skulls brains eyes tonsils and spinal cords of all cattle over 30httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32932crs9 months and the distal ileum part of the small intestines of all cattle august 8 2003 the secretary of agricultu re announces that after thorough scientific analysis the department will begin accepting applications for import permits for certain low risk ruminant derived produc ts from canada usda said it will longer prohibit importation of wild ruminant products intended for persona l use immediate and will begin to accept applications for import permits for certain commercial products including boneless sheepgoat meat from animals under 12 months boneless bovine meat from animals under 30 months boneless veal from calves under 36 weeks fresh or frozen bovine liver vaccines for veterinary medicine if for non ruminants certain pet products and feed ingredients august 15 2003 usda posts an amended list of allowable canadian products on its website as clarification of the august 8 announcement the list now includes trim from beef from cattle under 30 months of age nd veal including carcasses from calves 36 weeks of age or under permit applications are subsequently submitted to aphis for processed product made from allowable product aphis determines that processed product from trim and boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age would be allowed since processing would not increase the risk ssociated with the products august 23 2003 the canada srm rule see july 18 2003 takes effect august 25 2003 fsis issues revised directive intended to strengthen enforcement of measures to ensure that amr systems do not introduce spinal cord into meat products the directive notes that based on the first

october 31 2003 usda releases the findings of second harvard assessment of bse risk since the canada case the report notes that group of cattle imported into canada from the uk in 1993 included one that was found to ve bse and that if other animals in this group harbored the disease and were slaughtered and rendered in fectivity may have been introduced into the canadian and us cattle feed supplies before the 1997 feed ban was imp lemented in both countries harvard observed that although the possible introduction of bse into the us from cana da cannot be dismissed the likelihood is very low and us protective measures by now would have contained any possible spread usda also announces it will publish proposed rule see november 4 2003 to ame nd its bse regulations november 4 2003 usda publishes proposed rule in the federal register that would amend its bse regulations to establish new category of regions that recognizes those that present minimal risk of introducing bse into the united states via the importation of certain lowrisk live ruminants and ruminant products the rule which is initially open for comments until january 5 2004 will form the basis for the final rule that eventually will be published on january 4 2005 the proposed rule would add canada to that risk category and would allow entry of certain commodities including bovine animals for immediate or subsequent slaughter under 30 months sheepgoats for immediate or subsequent slaughter under 12 months cervids deer elk for immediate slaughter fresh chilled or frozen meat and wholehalf carcasses from bovines less than 30 months fresh chilled or frozen bovine liver fresh meat of sheep november 25 2003 aphis decides to allow canadi an facilities that receive and process bonein beef from the united

of the sting program and how results were being reported pr ior to final confirmation at fda where officials had promised early in 2004 to revise their an imal feed rules to tighten controls over possible bse contamination liberations over the rules continued through the end of the year some countries notably canada and mexico were again accepting some us beef in 2004 as were severa l smaller

holds the first congressional oversight hearing on the us bse crisis january 26 2004 the secretary of health and human services announces coming changes in fda feed rules expected to be published within two months but which had not appeared as of late may 2005 which he says will eliminate the exemption that allows mammalian blood and blood products to be fed to other ruminants as protein source ban the use in ruminant feed of poultry litterwhich consists of bedding spilled feed feathers and fecal matter ban the use in ruminant feed of plate waste which consists of uneaten meat and other meat scraps that collected from restaurant operations and rendered into meat and bone meal further minimize the possibility of cross contamination of ruminant and nonruminant animal feed by

47 million to fund multiagency efforts to enhance usdas bse prevention program february 4 2004 usda releases findings of the international panel of bsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32932crs14 experts the irt the irt observes that although the infected us animal may be the only one from the 81cow herd that survived to adult hood and its birth cohorts do not represent significant risk it is probable that other infected animals have been imported from canada and possibly also from europe these animals have not been detected and therefore infective material has likely been rendered fed to cattle and amplified with the cattle population so that cattle in the usa have also been i ndigenously infected the irt also states that testing of all cattle for human consumption is unjustified but an intensive onetime surveillance effort to determine the extent if any of us bse and that testing random sample of healthy cattle over 30 mont hs should be strongly considered the us epidemiological investigation and the tracing and recall of m eat and byproducts had conformed to international standards insofar as possible but that implementation of an appropriate national id system is needed because downers are now being banned from the food supply it is imperative for usda to ensure that dead and nonambulatory cattle are properly sampled and disposed of the united states should consider excluding all srms from both human and animal foods including pet food and unless aggressive surveillance proves the us bse risk to be minimal according to international standards the srm definition should be expanded to include the brain spinal cord skull and vertebral column of all cattle over 12 months and the entire intestine from all cattle the partial ruminanttoruminant feed ban now in place is insufficient complete ban on the feeding of all mammalia n and poultry byproducts to cows and other ruminants is justified due to the practical difficulties of enforcement and to the issues of crosscontamination as well as the current problems in differentiating mammalian and avian mbm february 9 2004 an fsis update of recall activities states that the total amount of meat distributed th at was subject to recall had been expanded to approx imately 38000 pounds affecting 578 establishments february 9 2004 aphis also announces that the fi eld investigation of the case of bse in cow in

of washington on december 9 2003 was born on dairy farm in calmar alberta canada on april 9 1997 the epidemiological investigation to find additional animals from the source herd led to total of 189 investigati ons leading to complete herd inventories of 75000 animals on 51 premises in washington oregon and idaho the inventories involved th examination of the identification on more than 75000 animals total of 255 animals of interest those that could have been from the source herd in alberta were identified on 10 premises in washington oregon and idaho all 255 were depopulated and bse testing was negative for all the carcasses from all of the euthanized animals were properly disposed of in landfills these 255 are in addition to the 449 animals slaughtered from the bull calf

weekly and trans ition to the ongoing testing of approx imately 40000 animals per year the secretary states that this ongoing testing will continue to focus on cattle populations where the disease is most likely to be found and will c ontinue to far exceed the levels in oie guidelines the transition will occur as soon as late august 2006 july 27 2006 japan announces that it will resume imports of us beef from cattle 20 months and younger following japanese inspectors july review of us facilities the japanese reportedly clear 34 out of 35 u scertified plants for their market us products are expected to begin entering the country in august postscript at the time of this report the administration and many members of congress were continuing to focus on efforts to reopen more major foreign markets to us beef most notably korea they also were awaiting the restart of beef exports to japan which officials in that country d promised would begin shortly after successful round of us plant inspections in july 2006 at hearings and other venues us policymakers and industry offi cials had been expressing frustration with the pace of these marketopening efforts bills such as s 3364 s 3538 and hr 5675 demanding trade sanctions against ja pan have been introduced but likely will not be acted upon if the market does reope n as anticipated as noted the pending senate version of the fy2007 usda appropriation hr 5384 includes committeeapproved nonbinding amendmen t recommending such sanctions after more than two years of intens ive surveillance with more than 764000 tests of higherrisk cattle only two us born bse cases have been confirmed according to usda yet some remain cerned about the disease and its potential threat to public health as well as trade particularly in the wake of several additional findings of bse in cattle the age of several of the canadian cattle that is theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32932crs32 were born after the imp lementation in 1997 of stronger cattle feed rules to protect against bse has been cited as worrisome development by some critics of north american bse safeguards however canadian usda and industry officials continue to argue that the overall north american risk profile is unc hanged they have long warned that several additional bsepositive cattle might be found but should be cause for alarm these officials have repeatedly ttempted to reassure consumers and foreign buyers that us cattle and beef are safe and pose risk to animal health or to human food safety although research in to the numerous unknown aspects of the disease and of the tse family of diseases and consideration of additional regulatory safeguards continues few observers had expected the trade and economic issues to be resolved quickly nonetheless frustrations continue to mount over the length of time it has taken to regain entry into the japanese and korean markets even after us beef becomes eligible for japane importation the industry f aces the difficult task of both meeting restrictive japanese requirements and then regaining the market share there that other countries notably australia have since captured efforts to restore beef and cattle trade between the united states and canada have been more fruitful although some u s cattlemen continue to express concerns about the potential impacts on us cattle health meanwhile congress can be expected to play continued role holding oversight hearings providing funding for bserelated activities and possibly considering legislative options to address one or more of the problems at hand
