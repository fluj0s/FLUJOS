retirees face in retirement longevity risk investment risk inﬂation risk and the risk of large unexpected expenses for medical care or longterm care it then describes the basic features of life annuities and examines some of the reasons that the market for these annuities remains small in spite of the protection that they provide against outliving ones retirement assets the second section of the report describes various strategies for selfannuitizing and presents the results of an analysis that crs conducted to estimate the probability that an individual who elects to selfannuitize would

perhaps more important question than how long will my money last congress has strong interest in the income security of older americans because much of their income is either provided directly from public programs like social security or in the case of pensions and retirement accounts is subsidized through tax deductions and deferrals many retirees must decide how to convert retirement account balances into income and how to preserve the accounts in the face of several kinds of risk longevity risk is the risk that the individual will exhaust his or her account before death and experience substantial decline in income investment risk is the risk that the assets in which the individual has invested his or her retirement account will decline in value inflation risk is the risk that price increases will cause the individuals retirement income to decline in purchasing power unexpected events such as divorce the death of spouse the cost of medical care or need for longterm care services are also risks there are strategies for dealing with each of these risks but single strategy can deal effectively with all of them for example purchasing life annuity insures against longevity risk and it shifts the investment risk to the insurer however purchasing an annuity depletes the purchasers available assets by the amount of the premium these assets are longer available to the retiree in the event of catastrophic illness or other unexpected major expense to date the demand for annuities has been low there are many reasons for the low demand for annuities but one of the most important has been that many potential annuity purchasers do not value the longevity insurance provided by annuities at its market price retirees who choose not to purchase life annuities must decide how much to withdraw from their retirement accounts each year because they face uncertainty with respect to both life expectancy and the rate of return on investment this decisi on carries its own risks if withdrawals are too large retirees risk spending down their savings too quickly possibly leaving them impoverished if withdrawals are too small they might spend too little and leave substantial assets unspent when they die an analysis conducted by crs indicates that under specific conditions there is 95 or greater probability that man who retires at age 65 will not exhaust his retirement account before the earlier of death or age 95 if his initial withdrawal does not exceed 5 of the account balance and later withdrawals are the same in inflationadjust ed dollars under the same conditions there is 95 or greater probability that woman who retires at age 65 will not exhaust her retirement account before the earlier of death or age 95 if her initial withdrawal does not exceed 45 of the account balance and later withdrawals are the same in inflationadjusted dollars

members of the baby boom generation are beginning to retire1 after many years of accumulating assets to spend in retirement they now must decide how to convert these assets into steady stream of income because of the trend away from defined benefit db pensions to defined contribution dc planssuch as 401k plansfuture retirees will be less likely to have guaranteed stream of income from defined benefit pensions furthermore while social security will provide guaranteed income to most retirees it will replace only relatively small proportion of their preretirement income 2 as result of these trends many future retirees will rely greatly on their savings to finance their consumption during retirement retiree who is deciding how to convert wealth into retirement income will have to balance many risks increases in average life expectancy will mean that future retirees will have to ensure that their wealth will last through retirement that could span 30 or 40 years increased volatility in equity markets the effects of inflation on purchasing power and the possibility of substantial expenses for medical treatment and longterm care will further complicate this decision there are number of ways to convert retirement wealth into income one option is to purchase life annuity from an insurance company in exch ange for payment of an initial premium life annuity pays guaranteed income throughout re tirement regardless of how long the purchaser lives 3 life annuities represent only about 5 of individual annuities sold in the united states most annuities sold in the us are deferred annuities which are taxdeferred retirement savings accounts at retirement deferred annuity can be converted to life annuity yet relatively few deferred annuities are converted to life annuities likewise most individuals who have accumulated retirement savings in 401k plans or individual retirement accounts iras choose to access these funds through lumpsum distributi ons or periodic withdrawals rather than by purchasing life annuity there are many reasons why relatively few retirees choose to purchase life annuity as source of retirement income4 among these reasons are that most retirees receive annuity income from social security about onethird of retirees receive annuity income from defined benefit pensions the fees charged by annuity providers can be high and the fee structure is not transparent purchasing an annuity reduces the assets available to the retiree to meet unexpected expenses and breaking the contract is costly and 1 the bureau of the census defines the baby boom as people born between 1946 and 1964 2 the social security administration estimates that social security replaces bout 55 of earnings for careerlong lowwage worker 41 of earnings for careerlong medianwage worker and 27 of earnings for careerlong high wage worker 3 life annuities are also sometimes called immediate annuities this report uses these terms interchangeably 4 some individuals choose not to spend assets because they wish to leave the assets as bequest to their heirs however given that an individual chooses to spend some or all of his or her retirement savings the relevant question for this analysis is why relatively few choose to do so by purchasing life annuity

agents many of whom receive large commissions for each sale another option for converting retirement savings into income is to take periodic withdrawals from retirement account some retirees attempt to selfannuitize by basing the amount of each periodic withdrawal from the account on their remaining life expectancies retirees who self annuitize take on the responsibility of managing their investments and also the risk that they will live longer than average this report has two sections the first section describes four kinds of risk that retirees face in retirement longevity risk investment risk inflation risk and the risk of large unexpected expenses for medical care or longterm care it then describes the basic features of life annuities and examines some of the reasons that the market for these annuities remains small in spite of the protection that they provide against outliving ones retirement assets the second section of the report describes various strategies for selfannuitizing and presents the results of an analysis that crs conducted to estimate the probability that an individual who elects to selfannuitize would exhaust his or her retirement assets before death g22g145g142g561g16g138g157g158g155g142g561g152g143g561g20g146g156g148g561g146g151g561g20g142g157g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g561 decisions about how to draw down as sets in retirement must take into account many risks these include longevity risk ie the risk that one will live beyond the average life expectancy inflation risk investment risk and the risk associated with unexpected financial shocks from widowhood divorce medical care or the need for longterm care services g14g152g151g144g142g159g146g157g162g561g20g146g156g148g561 the us population is living longer than previous generations man who reached age 65 in 1960 could expect to live another 130 years while woman who turned 65 in 1960 had remaining life expectancy of 158 years man who reached age 65 in 2004 could expect to live another 171 years while woman who turned 65 in 2004 had remaining life expectancy of 200 years 5 looking beyond the averages more than onefourth of women who reach age 65 are likely to live to age 90 and 124 are likely to live to age 95 one out of six men who attain age 65 will live to age 90 and an estimated 6 will live to age 95 see table 1 individuals who underestimate the likelihood of living into very old age might spend their assets too quickly depleting their savings while they still have many years to live this could lead to decline in their standard of living and possibly to increased reliance on public assistance programs 5 us national center for health statistics national vital statistics report united states life tables 2004 vol 569 dec 2007

purchasing power of income declines unless income increases at the same rate that prices increase few pensions in the private sector provide regular costofliving increases data collected by the department of labor indicate that fewer than 5 of pensions in the private sector provide regular costofliving adjustments to retirees retirees must account for the potential impact of inflation on their investment portfolios as they decide how to draw down their retirement wealth social security is one of the few sources of retirement income that is fully inflationindexed each year yet even social securitys annual costofliving adjustments may not fully protect retirement income from the effects of inflation the annual costofliving adjustment for social security is based on the increase in the overall level of prices prices for some categories of expenditures that the elderly use at higher rates than younger consumers such as health care have been growing faster than overall prices over the period from 1980 to 2007 the average annual rate of inflation for goods and services averaged 35 but prices for medical care rose at an average annual rate of 59 6 for those who have aboveaverage outofpocket health care expenditures these price increases can significantly reduce the amount of income available for other expenditures in addition medicare part b premium increases are tied to program cost increases which have historically exceeded growth in general inflation7 by 2025 these premiums are expected to equal over 50 of the average social security benefit as compared to 27 in 20068 6 from 1980 to 2007 the consumer price index cpi for all goods and services rose from 824 to 2073 while the cpi for medical care rose from 749 to 3511 see council of economic advisers

investment risk is the possibility that an individuals retirement assets might decline in value because specific stocks bonds or other assets depreciate diversification can reduce investment risk because declines in the value of some assets are likely to be fully or partially offset by gains in the value of other assets stock and bond mutual funds for example help protect individuals from investment risk by purchasing securities from many companies in variety of industries in mutual fund investment losses from companies that are performing poorly may be offset by investment gains from companies that are performing well investment risk includes market risk which is the possibility that an individuals retirement assets will decline in value because of an overall decline in asset prices as when the stock market falls even welldiversified portfolio of stocks will not protect the value of an individuals retirement from depreciating if stock values fall across the board as they

widowhood was more likely to reduce womens wealth than mens wealth10 unexpected health care costs can also reduce retirement wealth although the majority of retirees are covered by medicare deductibles and copayments can be significant for those who are seriously ill medicare provides only limited coverage for longterm hospital stays and nursing home care recent analysis of the health and retirement survey found that 6 of households aged 7584 paid more than 50 of their income for outofpocket medical expenses11 these costs can be especially high at the end of life when surviving spouse may face large medical bills and an accompanying reduction in retirement income study in 2002 found that outof pocket costs for endoflife medical expenses could average about 23000 adjusted to 2007 dollars12 while the introduction of medicare part d may offset some of these costs even under this program an individual who is not eligible fo r lowincome subsidy could be responsible for more than 6000 in copayments for prescription medicines in 2009 another potential economic shock is the cost of longterm care services13 it has been estimated that over twothirds of individuals aged 65 and older will require longterm care services at some point in their lives in 2008 the annual average cost of nursing home stay is 68255 for semi private room and 76285 for private room14 these costs greatly exceed the 2007 median income of 29730 among households in which either the householder or householders spouse was 65 or older 15 medicare does not cover extended stays in nursing homes and medicaid coverage generally is available only to individuals who are poor or become poor by spending down their assets on longterm care services16 for those who are not medicaideligible and who have

reducing longevity risk and investment risk life annuities continue to represent small proportion of all annuities sold in the us in recent years deferred annuities used as taxdeferred savings vehicles have outsold life annuities by ratio of almost 20 to 117 as noted earlier the irrevocable nature of annuity contracts appears to be an important factor in dissuading many retirees from purchasing life annuities although insurers have devised options to assure that the payments will continue after the purchasers death jointandsurvivor annuities and termcertain annuities for example

from investment risk and longevity risk the benefit formula under most defined benefit pensions is based on the workers years of service and final average salary the individuals benefit does not vary with investment returns nor does it decrease as result of increases in average lifeexpectancy 18 the employer that sponsors the plan bears both the investment risk and the longevity risk if investment returns fall below expectations or if the plans actuaries project increases in life expectancy the plan sponsor must provide additional funding to the plan to meet these costs since the mid1980s the proportion of workers who retire with defined benefit pension has declined substantially the number of workers participating in defined benefit pension plans fell from 269 million in 1985 to 206 million in 2006 decline of 2319 another reason for the decline in the number of workers retiring with an employersponsored annuity has been an increase in the number of defined benefit plans that offer the option of taking lumpsum rather than an annuity of all those who are covered under defined benefit plan more than half are offered the choice between lump sum and an annuity20 when offered this choice many individuals choose the lumpsum option according to study by the vanguard group only 40 of defined benefit plan participants who are offered lumpsum choose to 17 national association

deferred annuity is similar to savings account in which individuals can accumulate money over time investment earnings accrue on taxdeferred basis deferred annuities represent nearly 95 percent of

annuity provides guaranteed monthly income for specified period of time in exchange for onetime premium payment income from an annuity can be either fixed or variable income from an annuity may be

currently sold are immediate annuities 23 table 3 shows some examples of monthly income from an immediate annuity most annuities purchased in the private sector provide different incomes for men and

growth tax relief reconciliation act is 15 annuity withdrawals are taxed at the marginal tax rate for ordinary income which could be higher than the capital gains tax rates 29 annuities purchased in

premium for an immediate annuity at age 65 in november 2008 65 yearold male would receive monthly income of about 675 for premium of 100000 irs life tables indicate that on average the purchaser will receive annuity payments for 20 years31 the total expected lifetime income from the annuity therefore would be 16200032 the proportion of each payment that would be excluded from taxable income would

consumer protections are intended to ensure that information used to sell an annuity is truthful and that individuals who purchase an annuity fully understand the future consequences with respect to retirement income the key challenge in the development and enforcement of consumer protections is that some annuity products are regulated exclusively at the state level while others are also regulated by federal agencies because state governments have primary jurisdiction over regulation of fixed annuities there is wide variation in regulation across states further while variable annuities are regulated by the federal securities and exchange commission sec equityindex annuities which are designed to track the performance of common stock index such as the sp 500 or the russell 2000 are regulated primarily by the states g21g157g138g157g142g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g3g151g151g158g146g157g146g142g156g561 like other insurance products most annuities are regulated by the states state laws govern the organization and licensing of insurance companies and their agents and state insurance departments oversee insurance company operations these state laws and regulations also govern marketing and sales practices as well as insurer requirements to help guide states in their oversight efforts the national association of insurance commissioners naic has developed language for model laws and regulations to provide guidelines for legislators to modify and adopt in their respective states the naic model act has not been uniformly adopted across states thus leav ing potential gaps in consumer protections as of february 2008 17 states have not adopted the naic model regulations on suitability34 the naic model suitability language requires insurance companies to give objective financial information to potential purchasers and it requires agents to use standardized form to determine whether an annuity would be suitable for the potential purchaser some state laws ban the use of professional designations or titles such as senior financial advisor that might mislead senior consumers into thinking the advisor has special financial expertise related to the needs of older consumers similar problem exists with respect to disclosu re requirements in annuity contracts the naic annuity disclosure model regulation requires certain information to be disclosed including information about premiums and how they are charged summary of the options and restrictions for accessing money and an outline of fees according to the naic 35 states have adopted the naic disclosure regulation the states also play role in protecting annuity owners against the insolvency of annuity insurers to do this each state has state guaranty association to provide financial safety net for each line of insurance and to ensure that coverage continues if an insurer becomes insolvent state laws require insurers to become members of the guaranty associations in every state in which they are licensed to do business the actual coverage for annuity contracts varies from state to state but cash values and annuity benefits are usually protected up to at least 100000 however coverage is not provided for variable annuity contracts variable annuity contracts are held in separate 34 american council of life insurers life insurers

potential advantages of individual life annuities immediate annuities remain small part of retirement assets held in the us of those who purchased immediate annuities in 2003 the median age of purchase was 70 37 the internal revenue code requires owners of individual retirement accounts to begin taking withdrawals from their accounts and including the withdrawals in their taxable inco later than april of the year in which they reach age 70½ some owners of iras use immediate annuities to meet the requirement to take these required minimum distributions from their retirement accounts without this requirement demand for annuities might even be lower there are several reasons why the demand for annuities is low despite the aging of the population some potential purchasers may alread feel they have sufficient amount of annuitized income from social security and about third of people 65 and older also have annuity income from defined benefit pensions another reason may be the amount and non transparency of fees and expenses charged by insurance companies further annuity contracts are not easily canceled and many individuals fear that after purchasing an annuity they may later need large sum of money to pay for unexpected expenses such as longterm care or health 35 section 17a of the securities act of 1934 section 10b of the exchange act and rule 10b5 and section 206

annuity providers impose number of fees and expenses that are complex and are not transparent to the annuity purchaser even rather simple prospectus identifying the various fees can be more than 50 pages long38 fees and expenses fall into three main categories surrender charges investment fees and insurance charges fees and expenses vary depending on the type of annuity fixed or variable both fixed and variable annuities have surrender charges which are fees for cancelling the contract before specified number of years have passed typical surrender charge starts at 7 of the premium in the first year of the contract and declines by 1 year until it reaches zero however few companies have surrender charges of up to 15 to 25 of the annuity premium 39 variable annuities have two additional fees associated with managing assets these are investment management fees and insurance charge s investment management fees cover the cost of managing the different funds across investme nt accounts investment fees vary depending on the type of investment portfolio chosen insurance charges include administration sales commissions and mortality and expense charges mortality and expense charges average 115 of the average value of investment and cover three components of the insurance guarantee mortality premium or guarantee of income over ones lifetime death benefit to protect beneficiaries also called survivor benefit and the cost of the minimum income guarantee these fees vary by product design typically fixed annuity with joint and survivor option is subject to all three components however variable annuity without joint and survivor option and minimum guarantee would only be subject to the mortality premium it is difficult for consumers to identify and understand each fee charged for an annuity each insurer has different format for disclosing information the insurance industry has recognized this problem and has begun to standardize fee disclosure group of insurance

who buy annuities tend to be those who expect to live longer than average person who chooses to purchase an annuity may have information about his or her health habits or family history that the insurance company does not have regarding their risk of living longer than average this phenomenon called adverse selection leads to higher annuity premiums than insurers would otherwise have to charge if longevity risk were spread over the entire population estimates of the cost of adverse selection vary some studies have found that adverse selection reduces income to annuity purchasers by 4 cents to 10 cents per dollar of premiums paid 41 more recent study defined potential annuitants more narrowly to only include those with sufficient wealth to purchase an annuity when redefined in this manner potential annuitants tend to live considerably longer than average and thus would receive better deal from an annuity than the average person according to this analysis the impact of adverse selection on annuity prices is only about half as great as previously estimated or about 2 cents to 5 cents per premium dollar 42 if participation in individual annuities were broader the effect of adverse selection would be reduced and annuitants income would be higher

once an individual purchases an immediate annuity the decision is not easily reversible most states require 10day look back period during which buyer can change his or her mind but after this canceling an annuity contract will result in substantial surrender charges part of the lack of flexibility in annuity contracts was recently addressed in the pension protection act of 2006 which allows funds used to purchase an annuity to be withdrawn taxfree to buy longterm care insurance it is important to note that longterm care insurance must be purchased well in advance of actually needing longterm care serv ices annuity owners would have to make the decision to purchase longterm care insurance in the early years of the payout phase dying before getting full value annuity buyers pay for the insurance component of the annuity which guarantees monthly income matter how long the annuitant lives some people are reluctant to purchase an annuity out of fear that they will die before they get back the premiums that they paid into it joint and survivor annuities and termcertain annuities can assure that annuity payments will continue even if the purchaser dies earlier than he or she expected but these options reduce the monthly payments that the annuitant receives while he or she is living adverse publicity and lack of knowledge about annuities another factor affecting current demand for annuities may be adverse publicity surrounding false advertising and deceptive sales practices employed by insurance agents selling equityindex annuities these practices may have led some consumers to avoid all annuity products equityindex annuities however currently account for only 11 of annuity sales further recent proposals by the sec to strengthen regulations for sales of equityindex annuities may help to alleviate consumers concerns in the future 41 mitchell olivia james poterba mark warshawsky and jeffrey brown new evidence on the moneys worth of individual annuities

protection from longevity risk and investment risk relatively few people use their retirement savings to purchase an annuity most people choose instead to take periodic withdrawals from their retirement accounts indi viduals who purchase life annuities transfer the responsibility for managing assets and the risk of outliving their assets to an insurance company in contrast retirees who selfannuitize take on the responsibility of managing their investments and also the risk of living longer than average annuity purchasers however give up control over the assets that they use to purchase their annuities while those who take periodic withdrawals have the money in their retirement accounts available to meet large unexpected expenses that may arise during retirement for those who choose to take periodic withdraw als there are two basic approaches to taking money out of their retirement accounts the first approach attempts to smooth consumption over the period of retirement through equal inflationadjusted withdrawals each year this method provides steady income from year to year but as the examples presented in this report will illustrate it can be difficult to choose rate of withdrawal that can be sustained in the face of uncertain life expectancy and variable rates of return on investment another strategy for drawing down retirement assets is to take withdrawals that are based on the individuals remaining life expectancy in the year that each withdrawal is taken this method of withdrawing money from retirement account is prescribed by law for the required minimum distributions that all owners of traditional iras and retired owners of 401k accounts must begin taking after they reach age 70½ 43 under this approach it is unlikely that the individual will exhaust his or her savings but withdrawals can vary substantially from year to year this can make planning and budgeting difficult an individual who chooses to take periodic withdrawals might want to have some idea how likely his or her chosen strategy is to succeed the first step in such an assessment is to define success financial planners often advise clients that they should adopt method of withdrawing retirement funds that will result in high probability that their savings will last 30 to 40 years assuming that 40 years is reasonable upper bound for the number of years that retirement account might need to last the next task for the retiree is to determine the minimum probability of success that he or she is willing to accept there is fixed standard for the minimum probability of success that retiree should be willing to accept for the annual rate of withdrawal that he or she chooses for purposes of illustration we have highlighted in the tables that follow the combinations of initial withdrawal rates and investment allocations that resulted in an account balance lasting for given number of years or to given age in 950 or more of our simulations

this probability crs developed model that estimates how long sum of money will last assuming particular initial rate of withdrawal and the probable distribution of annu rates of return on investment the model estimates the annual rate of return on investment through monte carlo simulation process in which the rate of return in each year is based on the distribution of annual total returns on stocks and bonds over the 82 years from 1926 through 200744 see appendix for description of monte carlo simulation processes it is important to note that an annual rate of withdrawal that minimizes the risk of exhausting retirement account whether by delaying the initial withdrawal or by taking small annual withdrawals will increase the likelihood that the account will have substantial assets remaining at the time of the owners death delaying the initial withdrawal and taking relatively small withdrawals both help to preserve assets in the event that the individual outlives his or her normal life expectancy or experiences belowaverage rates of investment return however for the individual who lives to his or her normal life expectancy and experiences average rates of return on investment the end result of successfully reducing the risk of exhausting his or her account may be substantial unexpended account balance at the time of death

years to 40 years at five initial withdrawal ra tes ranging from 40 to 60 of the value of the account when the first withdrawal is taken we chose this range of withdrawal rates because large body of research on safe withdrawal rates for individuals has determined that real withdrawal rate in the neighborhood of 4 percent of the initial retirement portfolio has low chance of running out of money 45 and because recent research has demonstrated that initial rates of withdrawal equal to 70 or more are very likely to exhaust the assets too rapidly46 in the estimates presented in the following tables the withdrawal rate is stated as the percentage of the initial withdrawal from the account subsequent wit hdrawals are equal to the first withdrawal in constant inflationadjusted dollars but they may represent different percentage of the remaining account balance47 44 we used the real annual rates of total return on the standard and poors 500 index of common stocks and its predecessor s p index and aaarated corporate bonds from 1926 through 2007 to represent the rates of return on investment the monte carlo simulations were performed with palisade corporations risk simulation software 45 jj spitzer jc strieter and s singh guidelines for withdrawal rates and portfolio safety during retirement journal of financial planning vol 2010 october 2007 46 spitzer strieter and singh note that simulations of withdrawal rates of 70 or more of the account balance invariably resulted in unnacceptable runout rates 47 this is mathematically equivalent to increasing an initial nominal withdrawal by the estimated annual rate of change in the consumer price index as spitzer et 2007 note some authors used nominal rates of return and then adjusted the withdrawals each year for inflation such that the withdrawal am ount was the same amount in real terms we chose to use real dollars throughout and avoid the annual inflation adjustment the outcomes of either process should be the same irrespective of where the adjustment for inflation is made whether in the withdrawal rate or in the rate of return earned by the investment

invested in diversified portfolio of stocks because stocks have historically achieved higher longrun average rate of return than bonds the higher longrun average rate of return on common stocks compared to bonds acts as form of longevity insurance for the retiree generally advisors recommend that the remainder of assets should be invested in bonds and money market securities that are less susceptible than stocks to large capital losses in our analysis we simulated withdrawals from two portfolios in one set of simulations retirees allocated 65 of assets to the standard poor s 500 index of stocks and invested the remainder in aaarated corporate bonds in the second set of simulations retirees allocated 35 of assets to the standard poor s 500 index of stocks and invested the remainder in aaarated corporate bonds in all of the simulations withdrawals were taken at the beginning of each year accounts were rebalanced annually so that the portfolio would start each year at the chosen allocation between stocks and bonds the model also took into account the correlation between annual returns on stocks and bonds 48 the effects of account fees and income taxes were ignored for

retirement account in which 35 of assets are invested in stocks and 65 of assets are invested in bonds would last for at least 20 30 or 40 years the results of the simulations indicate that for periods of time of 20 years or more the likelihood of exhausting retirement account is higher for an account with 65 allocation to bonds compared to an account with 65 allocation to stocks the likelihood that an account would last for at least 20 years is slightly higher for an account with 65 allocation to bonds compared to an account with 65 allocation to stocks this result occurs because portfolio that is more heavily invested in stocks has greater chance than portfolio mainly invested in bonds of experiencing large capital loss if this happens in the early years of retirement the account may be pleted rapidly over longer periods of time however the probability of running out of money is substantially higher with portfolio in which 65 of assets are invested in bonds compared to

5 illustrate the probability that retirement account will last for at least given number of years assuming particular initial rate of withdrawal specific allocation of investments between stocks and bonds and the estimated annual rates of return on investment these results are likely to underestimate the likelihood that particular strategy will succeed because they do not account for individual mortality because not all account owners will live until the end of fixed interval of time the probability of an account having money in it at the earlier of either the account owners death or the end of the interval is greater than the probability of the account having money in it at the end of the interval to ignore the possibility of the account owner dying in any year will result in underestimating the probability that particular rate of withdrawal will sustain the account throughout the owners lifetime as other researchers have noted the relevant consideration in planning retirement withdrawals is the probability of running out of money in the retirement life span whether that span is shorter or longer than predetermined number of years 51 estimates of the likelihood that retirement account will last for particular number of years should include the probability that the account owner will survive for that number of years this can be done by including in the model of retirement withdrawals the probability of the individual surviving from one year to the next to incorporate the effect of mortality on the probability that retiree will exhaust his or her retirement account before the earlier of either the retirees death or the attainment of particular age crs added two variables to its model one variable accounts for the individuals age at retirement and in each succeeding year and the other makes each annual withdrawal conditional on the individual having survived from one year to the next 52 the probability of survival from year to year was based on male and female life expectancies taken from cohort life tables 53 an individuals withdrawal strategy was considered to have been successful if there was 950 or higher probability that he or she had positive account balance in the year of death or if still living at the ages of 80 85 90 95 and 100 table 6 table 7 and table 8 show the estimated probabilities that the retirement accounts of men and women who retire at ages 60 65 or 70 will last until the ages of 80 85 90 95 and 100 taking into account the probability of the individual dying in each year 54 the initial withdrawal rates range from 40 to 60 and subsequent withdrawals are assumed to be equal in real value 51 rg stout and jb mitchell dynamic retirement withdrawal planning financial services review vol 152 summer 2006

looked at one portfolio consisting of 65 stocks and 35 bonds and their estimates were based on unisex life expectancy table crs tested two portfolios one of 65 stocks and one of 35 stocks and we used separate life expectancy tables for men and women 52 in each simulation the individuals probability of having died between age x and age x1 was compared to random number generated by the model if the random number was greater than the probability of having died the simulation continued for another year if the random number was lower than the probability of death the simulation stopped 53 male and

at age 60 there is 989 chance that her account will last until at least age 80 in this case the probabilities are almost equally high in both table 5 and table 6 and there is little difference in the probabilities of success between and women both of these results change for the probability of success at later ages table 5 showed that at 40 withdrawal rate the probability of retirement account

inflationindexed annuity by providing steady annual income56 however an individual who selfannuitizes must in effect insure against his or her own longevity by holding substantial reserves in the account to protect against the possibility of outliving his or her savings because insurers diversify the risk of longevity over all annuity purchasers they are able to pay higher annual income than an individual who self annuitizes could safely withdraw from his or her account taking withdrawals from retirement account that are equal to the amount that would be paid by an annuity purchased from an insurance company exposes the retiree to the risk of outliving his assets 57 if retiree is willing to allow the amount withdrawn from the account to vary from year to year based on investment returns and remaining life expectancy he or she can reduce the likelihood of fully depleting the account before dying the tradeoff for reducing this risk is that the individuals annual income will be less predictable this can make planning and budgeting more difficult one such strategy bases each annual withdrawal on the current account balance and the individuals remaining life expectancy 58 this withdrawal rule is mandated under the internal revenue code for owners of traditional iras and re tired owners of 401k plans after they attain age 70½ to ensure that retirees consume their taxqualified retirement pension accounts instead of leaving them as bequests for their heirs59 table 9 table 10 and table 11 show how annual withdrawals that are based on the individuals remaining life expectancy in the year that the withdrawal is taken can vary over the course of the persons retirement table 9 illustrates the variability of withdrawals for man and woman each of whom retires at age 60 with an account balance of 100000 table 10 and table 11 show withdrawals for men and women who retire at ag 65 and 70 respectively also with initial account balances of 10000060 in 2004 60 yearold man had remaining life expectancy of 208 years and woman had remaining life expectancy of 240 years61 under the 1 et withdrawal rule the 60 yearold man would withdraw 1208 48 of his account balance and the 60 yearold woman would withdraw 1240 42 of her account one year later the 61 year old man would have remaining life expectancy of 200 years and woul d withdraw 1200 50 of his account balance the 61 yearold woman would have remaining life expectancy of 232 years and would withdraw 1232 43 of her account balance as the retiree ages his or her remaining life expectancy falls and the percentage of the account that he or she withdraws rises at age 75 for example man has remaining life expectancy of 107 years and so he would withdraw 1107 93 of his remaining account balance 75 yearold woman has remaining life expectancy of 128 years and would withdraw 1128 78 of her remaining account balance 56 most annuities are not adjusted for inflation and the income therefore declines in value over time 57 ivica dus raimond maurer and olivia mitchell betting on death and capital markets in retirement shortfall risk analysis of life annuities versus phased withdrawal plans financial services review vol 143 fall 2005 58 in this method of withdrawing funds the fraction withdrawn from the account each year is equal to 1et where et is the persons remaining years of life expectancy at

be smaller but the relative variability of the withdrawals from year to year would be similar data from the census bureau indicate that 129 million households headed by pers ons aged 60 or older had

fraction of the remaining account balance but the real dollar of value of the withdrawals may rise or fall from year to year depending on the investment performance of the retirement account in worstcase scenario the aging retirees withdrawals would be rising fraction of shrinking account balance although the retiree would not fully deplete the accountbecause the withdrawal is never equal to 100 of the remaining account balanceif the account shrinks in value due to decline in asset values the withdrawals could grow smaller from year to year 62 withdrawals based on remaining life expectancy will vary in size measured here in constant dollars from year to year for example the top panel of table 9 shows the range of withdrawals taken between the ages of 60 and 100 by man who retires at age 60 with an account balance of 100000 across 10000 simulations the typical male retiree could expect his annual withdrawals to range from 4465 to 9160 with an average withdrawal of 6394 in 5 of the simulations however the smallest annual withdrawal was 1409 or less and in 5 of the simulations the largest withdrawal was 22803 or more woman with the same portfolio retiring at age 60 could expect her annual withdrawals to range from 3940 to 9729 with an average withdrawal of 6342 see panel 3 of table 9 in 5 of the simulations the smallest annual withdrawal was 1530 or less and in 5 of the simulations the largest withdrawal was 25968 or more panels 2 and 4 of table 9 show that when the simulations were based on portfolio in which 65 of assets were invested in bonds and 35 invested in stocks the average withdrawal was smaller than in the case of the more stockheavy portfolio the typical male retiring at 60 with 100000 portfolio invested 65 in bonds and 35 in stocks could expect his annual withdrawals to range from 4491 to 7370 with an average w ithdrawal of 5734 again all amounts are in constant dollars in 5 of all the simulations however the smallest annual withdrawal was 1100 or less and in 5 of the simulations the largest withdrawal was 13184 or more woman with the same portfolio who retires at age 60 could expect her annual withdrawals to range from 3985 to 7465 with an average withdrawal of 5516 see panel 4 of table 9 in 5 of all the simulations the smallest annual withdrawal was 1349 or less and in 5 of the simulations the largest withdrawal was 14460 or more for individuals who retire at age 65 or at age 70 average annual withdrawals will be higher than for those who retire at 60 because they will be based on shorter remaining life expectancies table 10 shows the estimated range of withdrawals taken between the ages of 65 and 100 by men and women who retire at age 65 with initial account balances of 100000 table 11 shows the estimated range of withdrawals taken between the ages of 70 and 100 by men and women who retire at age 70 with initial account balances of 100000 63 for man retiring at age 65 with an initial account balance of 100000 of which 65 is invested in stocks and 35 is invested in bonds annual withdrawals could be expected to range from 5284 to 9103 with an average withdrawal of 6861 see panel 1 of table 10 in 5 of the 62 as an example consider man age 85 with 25000 in an account that loses 10 in value each year for three consecutive years at age 85 he withdraws 172 139 of 25000 or 3468 one year later he withdraws 168 148 of 19379 or 2864 the next year he withdraws 163 158 of 14864 or 2343 the following year he withdraws 159 169 of 11269 or 1896 if the account earns positive rate of return the withdrawals could increase or decrease in size depending on the rate of investment return 63 for easier comparison the initial balance is assumed to be 100000 in all cases although an individual who delays retirement until age 65 or 70 might accumulate larger balance

uncertainties that retirees face with respect to both life expectancy and annual rates of return on investment make choosing withdrawal strategy for their retirement accounts one of the most complicated financial decisions of their lives the decision is even more complicated if retirement assets must be managed over the joint life expectancies of couple in light of these complex considerations some analysts have suggested that the withdrawal phase of retirement planning may well require more professional guidance and expertise than the accumulation phase64 retiree who wishes to achieve predictable annual income can take annual withdrawals that are equal in inflationadjusted dollars an individual who chooses rate of withdrawal that is too high risks spending down the account too quickly possibly leaving the person impoverished an individual who chooses rate of withdrawal th at is too low risks spending down the account too 64 stout and mitchell financial services review 2006 another prominent economist has observed that retiring employees are illequipped to set sensible drawdown program on their own especially in the current volatile environment see the

leaving substantial assets unspent at death on the other hand the retiree can choose to take withdrawals that va ry from year to year based on the current balance in the account and the retirees remaining life expectancy this strategy can result in highly variable annual income the results of the analysis that crs conducted indicate that under certain conditions there is 950 or greater probability man who retires at age 65 will not fully deplete his retirement account before the earlier of his death or age 90 if his initial withdrawal does not exceed 50 of the account balance and if later withdrawals are equal to the first in inflationadjusted dollars under the same conditions there is 950 or greater probability that woman who retires at age 65 will not fully deplete her retirement account before the earlier of her death or age 90 if her initial withdrawal does not exceed 45 of the ac count balance and if later withdrawals are equal to the first in inflationadjusted dollars the results hold for both portfolio invested 65 in stocks and 35 in bonds and for one invested 35 in stocks and 65 in bonds the weight that individuals assign to each of the risks they face in retirement will vary from person to person one withdrawal strategy will be optimal for everyone other researchers have noted that overall there is clearly dominant strategy because all involve tradeoffs between risk benefit and bequest measures and individual preferences may vary65 one way to balance these risks would be to segregate ones retirement funds into two or more accounts and adopt different withdrawal strategies for each li kewise one might use some retirement assets to purchase an annuity while taking withdrawals from one or more accounts using one or more withdrawal strategies many retirees however will not have accumulated enough retirement savings to make these options practical 65 dus maurer and mitchell financial services review 2005

in which one or more of the variables affecting the outcome are random the term was coined by mathematicians in the 1940s who likened probability analysis to studying the games of chance played in the casinos of monte carlo one common use of monte carlo simulations is to illustrate how the variability of investment rates of return can affect the balances in retirement account the essence of monte carlo estimation process is to simulate an event many times allowing the random variable to vary according to its mathematical mean and variance each outcome is then ranked according to the likelihood of its occurrence using monte carlo methods analysts can estimate not just the result that will occur on average but also the likelihood of results that are significantly above or below the average in other words monte carlo methods of estimation allow us to incorporate into our estimates the element of risk monte carlo estimation methods utilize not just the average value of random variable but also the distribution of values around the average for example rates of return in the stock market vary from year to year the nominal rate of return on the standard poor s 500 index of stocks averaged 103 between 1926 and 2007 but annual rates of return varied widely around this average producing standard deviation of 200 likewise while the nominal annual return on aaarated corporate bonds averaged 63 between 1926 and 2007 the standard deviation around this average was 70 to estimate the likely rate of return that an investment would achieve over 40year period for example monte carlo simulation software generates rate of return for each year based on the distribution of probable rates of return as rived from historical data the program then simulates the 40year period second time again generating rate of return for each year from the probability distribution of rates of return the process is repeated until the simulation is completed and thousands of 40year investment periods have been simulated the results of the simulationin this case investment rates of returnare then ranked by percentiles the model crs used also accounted for the correlation between the rates of return on stocks and bonds and the effects of inflation on real annual returns in our simulation of 40year period in which 100 percent of assets were invested in common stocks the mean real rate of return in 10000 iterations simulating 40year period 10000 times was 70 which is the same as the actual mean real rate of return on common stocks in the period from 1926 through 2007 110310305 170 however in 5 of those 10000 iterations the mean real rate of return over the 40year period was 16 or less while at the other extreme in 5 of the 10000 iterations the mean real rate of return over the 40year period was 124 or more in terms of evaluating risk these results imply an expected annual average real rate of return on common stocks over any given 40year period of 70 and 90 probability that the average annual real rate of return over that period will be between 16 and 124
