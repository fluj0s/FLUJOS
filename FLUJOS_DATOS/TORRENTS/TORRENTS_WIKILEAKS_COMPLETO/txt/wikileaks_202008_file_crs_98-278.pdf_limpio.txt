comparable worth the next step summary womens participati on in the labor market has undergone considerable change in the last few decades with more than half of all women now in the workforce in addition legislation and regu lations have since the 1960s prohibited discrimination against women in employment and pay although womens pay re lative to mens has increased over time so that today women typically earn 7679 cents for every dollar earned by men the persistence of the gender wage gap in the face of these changes has prompted concern in some quarters about the equity or fairness of the markets wagesetting process hence the terms pay equity and fair pay studies have estimated that perhaps onehalf of the observed gender wage gap can be justified by produc tivity differences measured by work experience and educational attainment for example if women had the same human capital attributes as men they might earn about 80 as much as men jobrelated factors eg occupation and industry of empl oyment affect relative earni ngs as well studies that include both sets of characteristics estimate th at they might explain twothirds of the observed wage gap if women were like n in terms of their individual and job attributes they might earn about 90 as much as men some believe that the unexplained portion of the wage gap represents discrimination others an inability to accurately measure and include all factors that affect gender differences in pay comparable worth supporters contend that corrective action is needed because employment discrimination relegates women to different jobs than men and wage discrimination causes womens work to be devalued that is paid lower wages than jobs predominantly employing men co mparable worth policy would extend the current mandate of equal pa for equal work to equal pay for equivalent work within firm it thus would not directly address sex segregation in employment by job occupation industry and firm size u nder comparable worth an employer would through such means as an unbiased job ev aluation determine those jobs that had equal total scores for such job attributes as skill effort responsibility and working conditions the employer would then ra ise the wages of jobs deemed underpaid eg jobs having wages below other jobs with the same total scores in this manner workers would longer incur wage pena lty for employment in traditionally female jobs the size of workers paycheck would be unrelated to supplydemand conditions in the labor market under compar able worth policy some highly rated jobs within firm may not warrant pay increase if there is an abundant supply of workers in the labor market to perform them however in other words legitimate nondiscriminatory pay differe ntials can exist between jobs equally rated by an evaluation critics regard the substitution of job evaluations for market conditions to determine relative wages as critical flaw of comparable worth by eliminating wage differentials between equivalent male and femaledominat ed jobs it could increase unemployment of women in the short run as well as remove the strongest motivation for women to overcome discrimina

other protected classes of work ers eo 11246 also forbids labor market discrimination and requires affirmative action for protected classes of workers at federal contractors and subcontractors one constant over time however has been the lower wages of women compared to men the persistence of the gender wage gap in the face of workplace antidiscrimination edicts and of significant changes in womens labor force participation has prompted c oncern in some quarters about the equity or fairness of the markets wagesetting process it is contended that corrective action which goes beyond current law is needed because ongoing discrimination against wo men is distorting the allocation of human resources and creating inefficiencies in the labor market others believe that the pay gap reflects differences in freely chosen labor market qualifications between the sexes that legitimately affect relative wages they assert that as the work expectations schooling and labor market experience of

the issue termed pay equity or more recently fair pay originates from the chronic fact that women as group are pa id less than men in 1960 half of all women employed yearround fulltime ie 5052 weeks at least 35 hours per week earned more than 3257 and half earned less than that amount in the same year the median annual earnings of men employ ed yearround fulltime were 5368 more than 4 decades later according to us bureau of the census data for 2003 the median earnings of women with str ong commitment to the workforce were 30724 while those of men were substantially greater 40668 it is often noted that even when co mparisons are made between similar groups women still earn less than men women with bachelors degree employed year round full time earned 47910 in 2003 while similarly educated men earned an average of 69913 male high school gra duates were paid 38331 on average well above the 27956 paid to female high school graduates women typically earn less than men of the same

much as males in the same age group and female 4564 year olds were paid 59 as much as male 4564 year olds although these dispar ities between seemingly similar groups of men and women sometimes are taken as proof of sexbased wage discrimination they have not been adjusted to reflect gender differences in all characteristics such as differences in school course work among those with the same educational attainment1 that can legitimately affect relative wages the size of the malefemale wage ga p has shrunk at slow and uneven pace over the years see table 1 in the 1960s and 1970s women employed yearround fulltime typically earned less than 60 cents for every dollar earned by men the gap narrowed steadily during the 1980s so that by the end of the decade women were being paid about

of the gender wage gap has led to search for explanations basically two schools of t hought have developed th human capital explanation has supplyside focus that is it looks at the personal characteristics of working women and men the sexsegregati onintheworkplace or discrimination explanation has demandside focus that is it looks at the characteristics of the jobs in which women and men ty pically work the human capital model focuses on the voluntary choices made by women the discrimination model on the restrictions faced by women the human capital explanation one school of thought asserts that wo men earn less than men because of the division of labor within the family which results in productivity differences between the sexes2 anticipated family responsibilities are believed to influence womens decisions about the amount and kind of i nvestment in educa tiontraining eg number of years of schooling subject matter of course work and general versus firm specific training as well as the length and pattern of time devoted to market work ie total years and timing of work ex perience intermittentc ontinuous participation and parttimepartyear or fulltimefullyear schedules because women expect to spend fewer years than men in the labor force it is less profitable for women to invest in marketoriented skills accord ing to the human capital explanation then womens smaller human capital investment lowers their productivity and hence their earnings relative to mens the discontinuous employment history of women is thought to further depress their relative wages3 because skills deteriorate w ith prolonged nonuse womens wages upon reentering the labor force initia lly are lower than their wages had been when they exited the labor force to bear and care for their children it is argued that women who anticipate moving in and out of the labor force choose to enter occupations having the least earnings penalty for intermittent employment that is occupations having the lowest rate of skill depreciation therefore women more so than men would prefer employment in jobs in which wage growth is not closelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98278crs5 4 the human capital explanation assumes th at individuals preferenceschoices are voluntary it does not consider the possibility of prelabor market societal discrimination for example social normscustoms may cons train

particularly as result of this voluntary choice 4 women who do not expect to work continuously would want jobs that offer smaller rewa rd for additional work experience ie jobs with flatter experienceearnings profile than would continuous workers human capital theory thus not only attempts to explain the relatively lower wages of women but also the difference in the occupa tional distributions of men and women the division of labor within the family could have more direct impact on womens wages than through its eff ect on human capital accumulation married women continue to be larg ely responsible for child car and other energyintensive household responsibilities because they cons equently expend more effort than men on these family duties it arguably reduces the effort that women can put into market work if wages and market work intensity are positively related then married womens wages will be lower than those of married men even for workers having the same human capital endowments5 some analysts also believe that household duties affect married women s occupational preferences by encouraging them to seek lessdemanding jobs which allow them to economize on the energy they expend on market work6 researchers have tried to explain the existence of the wage gap by estimating the proportion that is due to differences in the average amounts of human capital accumulated by female and male workers the residual or unexplained portion of the pay differential is due to differences in th rates of return reward to working women and men with the same pr oductivityrelated characteris tics because productivity rarely can be directly observed commonl used proxies include amount and quality of formal education onthejob training hours of work job tenure

tion to others it indicates the limits of knowledge for the residual to solely refl ect discrimination that is all earnings differences between the sexes not accounted for by differences in their human capital attributes then all relevant variables mu st be included in the empirical studies and the included variables must be meas ured accurately however productivity characteristics may be omitted from studies because they are difficult or impossible to measure eg motivation or are not incl uded in particular da ta set eg field of specialization in school and they may be imprecisely measured eg use of potential rather than actual work experience based on its review of seven empiri cal studies the national academy of sciences found that less than onehalf of the wage gap between the sexes could be explained by human cap ital variables alone7 while this finding lends credence to some researchers questioning of the ability of the skill depreciation hypothesis to account for the wage gap over the longrun nd to explain the different occupational distributions of women and men8 it also reflects the inherent difficulty of accurately measuring all productivityrelated character istics in addition the finding gives support to claims that factors other than productivity affect wages including the presence and strength of unions the industr of employment and the size of firms the discrimination explanation in contrast to human capital theorists other researchers look to jobrelated variables as justification for the existence of the wage gap some focus particularly on the relationship between sex segregation in the workplace and womens comparatively low wages segregation encompasses the clustering of women and men in different occupationa l groups in different occupations within these larger groups in different jobs within occupati ons and in different industries or firms performing the same jobs sex segregation by occupation gender integration of

forces vol 81 3 mar 2003 continuedrelationship9 and indeed the gradual narrowing of the gender pay gap has occurred over period when the occupational distri butions of women and men slowly have become more similar in the 1960s occupational segregation of the sexes declined somewhat due partly to the movement of men into femaleintensive jobs eg elementary school teachers librarians and social workers10 in the 1970s gender segregation decreased to greater extent due primarily to both men and wome n entering neutral occupations11 women also increased their presence in few maledominated occupations during the 1970s with the great est inroads being made in the rapidly expanding occupational groups of executive administrative and managerial workers as well as professional workers the pa ttern of and changes in sex segregation by occupation are sensitive to the percentages that researchers utilize to define female dominated maledominated and neutral occupations12 the occupational distributions of wome n and men have ke pt converging over the ensuing decades but at progressively slower pace13 the index of segregation is the share of women men who would have to change jobs for their occupational employment distributions to be identical the index stood at about twothirds in each census year through 1970 it then dropped substantially from 677 in 1970 to 593 in 1980 the index at 520 showed further convergence by 1990 in the occupational employment patterns of women and men based upon current population survey data as opposed to dece nnial census data the index in 1990 was 564 its level of 539 in 1997 reflected continuing albeit slowed reduction in occupational sex segregation it should be noted that national data underlie the aboved escribed trend in occupational segregation most workers and organizations function in local labor markets and the degree of occupational segregation by gender may vary from one area to another research suggests that th size of the wage penalty for working in femaledominated jobs is related to the degree of occupational segregation that exists in given local labor market14httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98278crs8 14 continued and philip

ferrer and anne winkler the economics of women continuedwhy does segregation depress womens relative wages the crowding hypothesis offers one explana tion of why occupational segregation is associated with lower earnings for women relative to men15 according to this theory women are excluded from many jobs due to the discriminatory tastes of employers male employees or customers because women have access to only limited number of occupations the supply of labor to those occupations increases which in turn reduces the capitaltolabor ratio as result the productivity and wages of both women and men in the crow ded femaleintensive occupations are depressed similarly produc tivity and wages in male dominated occupations are higher than they would otherwise be the case because the supply of labor to them is restricted discrimination it is asserted prevents labor mobility between the two sets of occupations which would equalize wages between male and female workers with the same human capital endowments the dual labor market theory offers nother explanation for the relationship between occupational segreg ation and the wage gap16 according to this model the labor market has both primary and secondary sectors the former is comprised of jobs having opportunities for advancem ent offering good wages and working conditions and providing job security the latter is comprised of deadend jobs with low wages poor working conditions and substantial employee turnover because primary sector jobs require firms to inve st in employee training wage differentials can arise from this market segmentation pr imary sector employers will want to hire stable workers so that they have some assurance of recouping their training costs since women historically ve tended to move in and out of the labor force more often than men riskadverse employers who rely on their impressions of the relative job turnover of all men and women when deciding about hiring individual men and women ie statistical discrimination would prefer men over women for primary sector jobs the outcome some analysts claim is that women are relegated to the secondary lowpaying sect or of the labor market it is suggested that limiting women to poor job opportunities could make their alleged high turnover selffulfilling pr ophecy because the jobs provide women little reason to stay with any one employer17 labor market discrimination could have other feedback effects if it discourages women from making human capital investments weakens their attachment to the labor force and provides economic incentives

differences between men and women can be quite large even within occupa tional groups for example us bureau of labor statistics data for 2003 show that within the major occupational group of professionals women were 82 of elementary and middle school teachers while men were 93 of electrical and electronics engineer s among fulltime wage and salary workers female elementary and middle school teachers had median weekly earnings of 757 and male electrical and electronics engineers had median weekly earnings of 1348 these intraoccupational differences are obscured in studies that use

had the same occ upational industrial and union characteristics as men the adjusted ratio would have been 882 another study that included both human capital and jobrelated variable s was able to account for somewhat more of the gender wage ga p but it still left about 20 of the pay disparity unexplained23 generally even those studies that incorporate both types of variables leave substantial porti on of the wage gap unexplained one of the job characteristics frequently included in empirical analyses such as those described above is occ upation however to the extent that the difference in occupational distributi ons of women and men partly reflects employment discrimina tion or unequal occupational access then clearly this gender difference cannot legitimately be used to help explain the gender wage gap24 in other words the result of including occupation as an explanatory variable is underestimation of labor market discrimination to the degree that gender differences in occupational distributions reflect discrimination rather than personal preferences the feedback effect of discrimination on other variables commonly included in empirical analyses eg job tenure and unionization also would lead to understatement of disc riminations impact on wo mens relative wages25 because neither discrimina tion nor productivity can be measured directly it is likely that debate will conti nue on precisely how much of the wage gap is due to each of them by extension disagreement so will continue about whether remedial action is needed and if so what kind of

wage gap has narrowed gradually and sporadically over the years some assert that th intransigence of discrimination despite enforcement of equal pay and employment legislation accounts for th slow and fitful erosion of the wage gap others c onclude that it is related to among other things the timing of market skill converg ence between the sexes and to nongender specific changes in the labor market during much of the postworld war ii period the human capital endowments of women entering the labor force worked against contraction in the wage gap26 working mens educational attainment increased more than working womens as greater number of less educated than more educated women joined the labor force through the 1970s in addition the average work experience of employed women was held down by the entrance into the labor force of many women who had little or prior experience it is thus argued that the lack of skill convergence between working women and men during the 1970s kept the wage gap fairly constant despite decreases in occupational and indus trial segregation over the period27 the 1980s rapid improvement in womens relative wages the situation changed in the 1980s wh the work experience and schooling of women increased relative to men about 25 of the 1 per year reduction in the wage gap between 1976 and 1989 can be ascribed to the increase in the amount of womens work experience compared to men s and another 3540 to the rise in the monetary return reward to an additional year of experience for women compared to men28 the relative gain in the level and reward to womens educational attainment accounted for significant but smaller share of the wage gaps contraction29 in terms of schooling level the incidence of college graduates among female labor force

occupational group compared to whitecollar workers32 thus some nongenderspecific factors changed the labor market in different ways for men and women during the 1980s for example decreases in unionization and employment shifts by industry eg away from manufacturing depressed mens wages more than womens thereby narrowing the earnings differential between the two33 increasingly unfavorable changes in the wage structure for lowpaid workers ove r the period also seemingly harmed men more than women with greater widening of male wage inequality and growing returns to intellectual visavis physical skill strength one economist has argued that intellectual skills are less equally distributed by gender than physical skills and as result growth in the relative value of intellectual skills will increase wage inequality among men while simultaneously increasing the relative earnings of women who are assumed to be more intellectually than physically endowed compared to men34 others similarly have advanced the notion that an inverse relationship exists between trends in wage inequality among men and in the pay gap between the sexes35 the unexplained portion of the wage gap decreased during the 1980s as well interpretations of this finding are ambig uous however the improvement in womens unmeasured labor market attributes or decline in discrimination or some combination of the two coul d have reduced the residual36 as womens relative level of measured productivity characteristic s increased over the decade eg work experience and occupational upgrading it is possible that unaccounted for personal characteristics eg work expectations and job motivation also improved among women compared to men as result of womens increased commitment to the labor force and

further during the 1990s it did so to lesser extent that during the prior decade according to one study when human capital variables alone are taken into acc ount the ratio of womens compared to mens wages rose from 708 in 1979 to 819 in 1989 and then remained basically unchanged in 1998 at 812 when the sp ecification was expanded to include job related factors the ratios were higher but the trend was the same 816 in 1979 and 910 in both 1989 and 199837 differences in work experience by ge nder decreased less in the 1990s than in the 1980s but it appears that relative incr eases in womens ducational attainment played much larger role in shrinking the pay gap during the 1990s than during the preceding decade consequently work experience and schoolin g were estimated to have had similar impact over the 20year period when considered jointly more favorable changes for women in both occupational upgrading and deunionization occurred in the 1980s compared to the 1990s women moved into managerial and profe ssional occupations and out of cl erical and service occupations at about the same rate in both decades womens representation in bluecollar occupations did not expand to the same degree in the 1990s however as men more often lostleft those jobs during the 1980s similarly gender differences in the pace of deunionization were larger in th 1980s than in the following decade but unexplained gender differences in wages appear to have been the main contributor to the slowed convergence in womens and men s earnings during the 1990s as against th 1980s one unmeasured char acteristic that might have contributed to the slowdown is hours spen t performing housework as previously discussed it has been argued that housewor k decreases the amount of effort put into ones job and the gender difference in th is measure decreased much more quickly in the 1980s than the 1990s if employers perceived that women had made greater commitment to the labor force more in th former than the latter decade it could have prompted reduction in statistical discrimination against women again more substantially in the 1980s as compared to the 1990s in addition the occupational upgrading women experienced in the 1980s put more of them in positions that might have been subject to the glass ceiling which could have impeded their wage advancement in the following decade it has

measured and unmeasured human capital differences between the sexes they would argue that additional government intervention in the labor market is unnecessary because ongoing relative improvements in womens pr oductivity characteristics w ill cause the wage gap to shrink further with women continuing to opt for market work as major lifetime activity human capital theory suggests that women will

less in wage determination than are traditionally male skills eg physical or supervisory skills42 supporters of this viewpoint thus have concluded that mark etset wages are tainted by genderbased

not sufficient to reduce the male female pay differential because of the intransigence of sex segregation in the workplace they point out that even if one thought workplace integration were an adequate remedy to the wage gap it would take an extremely long time to achieve pay equity given the very slowly growing similarity in womens and mens occupational distributions see earlier discussion in this report on this point comparable worth adherents further obser ve that occupationa l desegregation as remediation approach has its own drawbacks since the influx of women continues to be largest in those occupations where it began some initially male jobs have now tipped and become disproportionately female thus furthe r increases in the proportion of women in these jobs increase rather than decrease segregation46 because occupational desegreg ation and job desegregati on are not necessarily the same proponents also contend that the increased occupationa l similarities between

to hold relatively highpaying jobs driving buses for city transit systems it thus is asserted that the growing presence of women in nontraditional occupations may ve unexpected outcomes namely resegregation as well as ghettoization with women and men having the same occupational titles but working in different specialties which limit its ability to reduce the wage gap47 comparable worth

working women have come to more closely resemble those of men some observers claim that employment discrimination rather than wage discr imination accounts for womens depressed earnings if mo re nontraditional jobs were open to women the wage gap would shrink 1 because female entrants to these occupations would receive higher pay and 2 because the supply of labor to traditionally female jobs would decrease thereby raising the wages of workers in those positions according to both these perspectives comparable worth is not dir ected at the real issues namely gender differences in human capital qualifications and discrimination in hiring and promotions while comparable worth opponents consequently might support more active enforcement of current antidiscrimination laws and regulations they see need for further government intervention in the markets wagesetting process job evaluation as wagesetting mechanism supporters of comparable worth believe that discrimination results in misallocation of labor by steering equally productive wo men and men into different jobs and paying women relatively lower wages firms operating in such labor market produce more of the goodsservices that use underpaid fema workers and less of the goodsservices that use overpaid male workers than they would if the market were free of gender bias comparable worth advocates therefore reason that action is needed to correct the market wage to remove the distortions caused by discrimination that is to bring wages closer to what they would be in nondiscriminating market thus increasing efficiency and productivity49 according to this viewpoint it is discrimination rather than comparable worth policy that interferes with the optimal functioning of the labor market job

evaluati on for market conditions in the wage determination process wages differ not only because different jobs require different levels of skill effort or responsibility but also because of the inherent scarcity of certain skills and talents relative to societys demand for such skills and talents51 some jobs may have high valueinuse as m easured by the inputs of skill effort and responsibility but they may not warrant high wage ie valueinexchange for labor services if there is plentiful supply of workers to perform them52 because of varying occupational s upplydemand conditions legitimate non discriminatory pay differentials can exist between jobs that evaluations conclude are of equal value to employers moreover opponents assert th at requirement to equa lize wages of jobs having the same total scores on evaluations would not allow the market to efficiently allocate labor across occupations if sewing mach ine operators wages were raised based on job evaluation findings for example the higher wages would prompt more workers than otherwise to enter the occupation because the demand for sewing machine operators did not change however firms would be unwilling to hire these new entrants and unemployment would increase the wage determined by job evaluation would have sent an incorrect signal to wo rkers with misallocation of labor resources the result further if demand for sewing machine operators were to subsequently increase comparable worth would prevent firms from using higher wages to effectively signal this to workers if they wanted to offer higher wages to attract more sewing machine operators firms woul d also have to offer higher wages for other jobs found to be of qual and higher value even though there was an ample supply of labor at the lower wage for the other jobs these inefficiencies and the likelihood of different firms job evaluations producing varying ratings for the same occ upations have led some critics to predict additional government intervention once comparable worth becomes the law of the land53 it is suggested that one form of fe deral intervention might be the development and administration of national job evaluation system because the government would be the only entity capable of reconciling possibly discriminatory differences between firms in their evaluations results some sort of regulatory or adjudicatory process could well be needed to at the l east resolve disputes over the specifics of individual firms evaluations and to deci when evaluations should be revised to reflect

government in the role of labor allocator because wages could longer be used to attract workers to specific jobs under comparable worth system the government might have to encourage or direct peopl

some economists and business groups to make dire predictions about the effects of legislati on which would increase government regulation of the labor market in addition supporters claim that comparable worth policy is not intended to measure the inherent value of jobs but rather to eliminate the wage disparities between femaledominated and male dominated jobs that cannot be justified by differences in pr oductivity requirements as to the use of job evaluations in setting wages comparable worth adherents contend that many firms have long us ed them and that wages set by market conditions actually are incor porated in job evaluations depending on the type of system used market wages have varying degrees of influence on the weights ie relative importance accorded the job attributes in evaluations in fact this is one of th problems with relying on job evaluations to achieve comparable worth according to its supporters they find this drawback to be especially egregious at firms which c onduct separate evaluati ons of female and maledominated job families eg clerical workers and bluecollar workers respectively it is claimed that the use of multiple pay plans within firm is the single most important reason that the common practice of job evaluation has done little to close the sex gap in pay54 for this reason comparable worth advocates not only call for unbiased job eval uations but also for the sa evaluation system to be applied across all job families within an establishment the job evaluation tool also has been criticized for its complexity and subjectivity55 even before an evaluation is be gun definitions of firm eg an establishment within multiestablishment enterprise without regard to proximity of other locations and of female as we ll as maledominated jobs eg composed 60 or 70 by one sex must be made after developing job descriptions for all positions within firm the evaluators must select the job attributes or compensable factors to be analyzed then for each job included in the analysis they must assign numerical value to each of the chosen attributes in order to develop total score for each job the evaluators also must termine weights for the individual factors for example they must d ecide whether jobs skill component is more important ie given more weight than jobs s upervisory component after having gone through these several steps final decision must be made about how to relate scores to wages and whose wages should be ad justed eg should the wages of all underpaid jobs be raised or just underpai d femaledominated jobs should the wages of overpaid jobs be reduced frozen or given smaller increases and what level should wages be raised to the average of all jobs or maledominated jobs with the same total points or

weighting factors typical of mens jobs eg unsafe workin g environment more heavily than those typical of womens jobs eg finger dexter ity and using separate evaluations of job families predominated by men and by women because of these practices comparable worth proponents want bias free evaluations to be conducted the policys detractors suggest however that what actually could occur is the substitution of one set of biases for another the economic effects of impl ementing comparable worth critics of comparable worth expect that its efforts to raise wages in femaledominated occupations could harm women through dise mployment if employers must raise wages of femaledominated jobs deemed to be underpaid by job evaluations employment in those occupations will decrease unless demand is totally inelastic ie demand does not change in response to change in the wage the higher labor costs resulting from comparable worth pay ra ises could lead firm s to replace workers in previously underpaid positions with now cheaper laborsaving technology in addition the resultant increase in producti on costs could prompt decrease in output and total employment or an increase in prices to consumers the outcome of implementing comparable worth under th is scenario would be both reduced employment in traditionally female jobs and higher wages for the women still employed in those fields opponents of comparable worth also exp ect its implementation would cause the wages of some women to fall this is because some sectors or groups eg small firms or parttime workers often are not covered when law is enacted56 specifically with regard to comparable worth policy it is more likely that mediumand large firms rather than small firms eg those with fewer than 100 employees would be covered because numerous differe nt job titles are needed to conduct job evaluation and because the cost of using job evaluations decreases as firm size increases 57 women who either were displaced from or were unable to get jobs in the part of the economy covered by comparab worth legislation would increase the supply of labor in the uncovered sector thereby putting downward pressure on their

ll help higherpaid women more often employed by large firms and harm werpaid women more often employed in small firms moreover it appears that occupational segregation is highest in the sector least likely to be the target of comparable worth policies and lowest in the sector most likely to be covered58 comparable worth advocates concede that there could be tradeoffs for elevating wages in traditionally female occupations but as this is true of many policy initiatives they do not consider it an ade quate reason for maintaining the status quo how much comparable worth actually woul d cost depends in part on how many workers are displaced how quickly and wh at happens to them at present we simply do not know how severe these problems would be59 some believe that indirect benefits might flow from comparable worths direct costs women longer able to get traditionally female jobs after the upward adjustment of the jobs wages might leave the safe harbor of the female occupations and consider competing for jobs heretofore filled with males60 while men might be more attracted to the now higher paying traditionally female jobs the implementation of comparable worth might thus encourage occupational desegregation comparable worth also might raise womens aggregate compensation as they expand their presence in traditionally higher paid male dominated jobs and in now

worth on the wage gap after the policy had been implemented65 while iowas comparable worth policy also called for raising the wages of all not just femaledominated underpaid jobs it originally called for pay cuts as well in light of union objections however compromise was reached which gave smalle r wage increases to underpaid jobs in return for pay cuts study of the actual experience with comparable worth in iowa found not surprisingly that wome ns relative pay rose by just 1466 i n minnesota by contrast most of the co mparable worth pay adjustments went to women on the states payroll and particularly to workers in femaledominated jobs mainly women by definition one study estimated that the state governments comparable worth policy was responsible for almost 12 increase in womens relative pay67 thus the manner in which comparable worth is implemented canhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98278crs24 67 continued of comparable worth difference of some 420 jobs male employment would have

actual effectiveness in narrowing the gender wage gap misgivings have arisen about how comp arable worth has been implemented in some instances because of the influence this can have on the achievement of pay equity the pay for points approach woul d in theory adjust the wages of all jobs based on their job evaluation score with overpaid jobs having their pay cut and underpaid jobs having their pay raised because of objections from representatives of workers whose pay is to be cut however this approach typically is compromised such that underpaid jobs receive smaller wa ge increases than they otherwise would have and ones pay is reduced this compromise pay for points appro ach has three serious weaknesses 1 it does not achieve the basic purpose of comparable worth to eliminate the underpayment of womens work 2 it does not target pay adjustments to femaledominated jobs and 3 it is overly dependent on the job evaluation system this approach cannot achieve equal pay for comparable worth because it relies on pay cuts to achieve this aim but these cuts are never enacted by targeting all underpaid jobs for pay adjust ments this approach increases the cost of comparable worth and undercuts the gains to female workers finally it relies primarily on the job evaluation system to determine salaries system that is known to be subjective and arbitrary comparable worth policy only needs to eliminate the variation in wages that is negatively correlated with the femaleness of job once job requirements are taken into account this approach tries to eliminate all wage variation once job requirements are accounted for68 it appears that political considerations can erode comparable worths ability to raise womens relative wages because the intere sts of broader constituency come into play69 as with other policies employers may be able to avoid comparable worths mandate and thereby both limit its cost to them as well as its effectiveness as remedy for the gender wage gap70 if comparable worth policy were not universally applied covered employers c ould contract out the func tions of femaledominated jobs to uncovered firms similarly they might increase their use of parttime or temporary workers if coverage did not exte nd to these groups possibly jobs could be redefined in order to downgrade femaledominated jobs by shifting their more complex tasks to already higher paid em ployees eg have ma nagers assume thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98278crs25 71 even if women are traditionally excluded from higher paying jobs the incentive still exists for them to try to obtain better positions to the extent that women encounter discrimination in this effort it is of the type that current law exists to remedyword processing functions of their secretarie s jobs might also be redefined in order to raise the wages of particular incumb ents whom employers wanted to retain concluding remarks whether the proponents of the human capital explanation or the discrimination expl anation are correct about the underlying reasons for the gender wage gap the same end result is expected according to standard economic analysis namely depressed wages whether women limit their fields of work in order to fulfill family responsibilities or di scrimination confines women to certain jobs the markets wage response is the same the abundant supply of women to certain jobs relative to employer demand will prompt firms to use more women than otherwise and in hiring each new worker spread complementary inputs eg capital more thinly this in tur n decreases the productivity of workers in femaledominated jobs and consequently their earnings in neither the human capital nor the crowding model are the wages of predominantly female jobs necessarily depressed because employers unconsciously decide that particular jobs should be valued that is worth relatively low wages rather it is the presence of numerous qualified persons ready to fill those jobs that removes the firms incentive to offer higher wages in order to attract more workers or to keep from losing workers already on the payroll regardless of the reason for pay differen tials they are economically desirable from the perspective of an efficiently func tioning labor market wage differentials encourage workers especially new entr ants to seek higher paying jobs71 and they encourage firms to use more of the plentiful source of labor if comparable worth were mandated however both these incen tives would disappear with wage differentials between equivalent female and maledominated jobs gone the strongest motivation for women to overcom discrimination in the long run would be lost in addition fema unemployment would increase in the short run without wage differentials to encourage work ers to exit from or not enter crowded traditionally female jobs comparable worth also would adversely affect the allocation of labor among ccupations in which wage di fferentials might not be due to discrimination while the advocates of comparable worth have plausible and empirically supportable case that discrimination is res ponsible for substantial portion of the malefemale wage gap the policy itself offers limited solution ie raising the wages of workers in traditionally female jobs which cuts two ways with respect to gender equity 1 increasing unemployment in femaledominated fields and 2 reducing womens incentive to further integrate maledominated jobs these economic costs may be worth incurring but that is judgment for policymakers to makehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98278crs26 appendix hr 5680 passed the house in the 98th congress but became stalled in the senate title i of the bill the federal pay equity and management improvement act of 1984 specified that study of the fede ral classification sy stems be conducted to see if they discriminated against women s 958 the civil service amendments act of 1984 omitted such study confer ence committee was appointed after passage of s 958 the senate s ubsequently voted down an amendment to continuing resolution that would have adopted h r 5680 during consideration of the amendment compromise was reached on pay equity study in return for passage of bill to reform the merit pay system and to reorganize the senior executive service it was agreed that the ge neral accounting office gao now the government accountability office woul d report on methodolog ies for conducting pay equity study of the federal classifica tion systems hearings would be held on the gao report and legislation would be intr oduced to authorize pay equity study based on gaos findings gao subsequently issued options for conducting pay equity study of federal pay and classification systems gaoggd8537 it discussed two approaches for determining why some female federal employees earn less than male federal employees an economic analysis to measure and explain gender wage differentials due to employee characteris tics eg educational attainment and seniority and job content analysis to examine job characteristics eg skill level and working conditions in gaos view an effective pay equity study would use both analyses then during the 99th congress house and senate committees held hearings on the gao report the house committee on post office and civil service reported out hr 3008 the fe deral equitable pay practi ces act of 1985 it would have established commission on equitabl pay practices which was required to contract with private consultant chos from list of experts drawn up by gao to conduct pay equity study employing both an economic analysis and job evaluation the consultants study nd commission recommendations were then to be forwarded to the president and the congress the house passed the bill as amended and referred it to the senate committee on governmental affairs in the senate the subcommittee on civil service he ld hearings on similar bill s 519 the federal employee antisexdiscriminati on in compensation act of 1985 and s 5 the pay equity act of 1985 was proposed as well hr 387 the federal equitable pay practices act of 1988 was introduced during the 100th congress and was passed by the hous it was identical to the 99th congress hr 3008 s 5 the pay equ ity act of 1987 also was reintroduced but in substantially revised form it wa s broad bill requiring that the equal employment opportunity commission velop guidelines for eliminating discriminatory wagesetting practices in the federal government and among federal contractors as well as furnish report tailing its activities unde r the equal pay act and commission on compensation equity to select consultant who would conduct pay equity study of the governme nts pay system the study included in s 552 the federal employee compensati on equity act of 1987 was similar to s 5s study with both calling for conducting an economic analysis and job evaluation the senate took acti on on this legislation
