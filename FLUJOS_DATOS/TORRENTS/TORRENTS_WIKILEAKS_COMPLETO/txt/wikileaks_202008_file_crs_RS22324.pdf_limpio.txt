rival forces into an integrated army controlled by the central government5 additional landmark agreements on intelligence and information services state prosecution offices and justi ce ministry and border and customs services among others further expanded central state competencies and institutions bosnias economy has also achieved significant growth in recent years although unemployment still

to embark on process of constitutional reform to create stronger and more efficient democratic institutions some envisioned reforms included creating single presidency instead of the current tripartite presidency strengthening the prime ministers office and strengthening the bosnian parliament ne gotiations on reform package continued through early 2006 with the intention to complete them in time for scheduled general elections in october in march 2006 seve n bosnian parties agreed to package of constitutional reforms and the tripartite bosnian presidency likewise adopted it despite this br oad consensus the measure failed in bosnias lower house of parliament on april 24 missing the required twothirds ma jority by two votes some bosnian croat nd opposition mu slim deputies opposed the bill its failure was widely viewed as major setback to the state consolidation process after the vote several parties reiterated thei r commitment to continue negotiati ons toward reaching
