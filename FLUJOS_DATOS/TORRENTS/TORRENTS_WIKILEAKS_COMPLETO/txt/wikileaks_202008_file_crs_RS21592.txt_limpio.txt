order code rs21592 updated march 8 2007 irans nuclear program recent developments sharon squassoni specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary international atomic energy agency iaea inspections since 2003 have revealed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21592 two decades worth of undeclared nuclear activities in iran including uranium enrichment and plutonium separation efforts iran agreed in 2003 to suspend sensitive activities in negotiations with germany france and the uk eu3 which broke down in august 2005 on september 24 2005 the iaea board of governors found iran to be in noncompliance with its nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt safeguards agreement and reported irans case to the security council in february 2006 the security council called upon iran to resuspend enrichment and reprocessing reconsider construction of its heavy water reactor ratify and implement the additional protocol and implement transparency measures iran has continued its enrichment activities failing to meet deadline after deadline on december 23 2006 the security council adopted limited sanctions under unscr 1737 and gave iran another 60 days however the february 21 2007 deadline has passed with little progress and further sanctions may be under consideration this report will be updated as needed background iran has had nuclear program for close to 50 years beginning with research reactor purchased from the united states in 1959 the shahs plan to build 23 nuclear power reactors by the 1990s was regarded as grandiose but not necessarily viewed as back door to nuclear weapons program possibly because iran did not then seek the technologies to enrich or reprocess its own fuel1 there were few suspicions of nuclear weapons program but these abated in the decade between the iranian 1979 revolution and the end of the iraniraq war both of which brought halt to nuclear 1 reports in the 1970s indicated that iran sought laser enrichment technology in the united states and conducted reprocessingrelated experiments intelligence reports suggested that the shah had secret group to work on nuclear weapons see leonard s spector nuclear ambitions colorado westview press 1990 p 204 crs2 activities irans current plans to construct seven nuclear power plants 1000 mw each by 2025 are still ambitious particularly for state with considerable oil and gas reserves2 iran argues as it did in the 1970s that rising domestic energy consumption should be met by nuclear power leaving oil and gas sales to generate foreign currency few observers believe that such an ambitious program is necessary or economic for iran and many question irans motives in developing uranium enrichment before even single power reactor is in operation iran has asserted repeatedly that its nuclear program is strictly peaceful stating in may 2003 that we consider the acquiring development and use of nuclear weapons inhuman immoral illegal and against our basic principles they have place in irans defense doctrine3 iranian government spokesman gholam hussein elham said in july 2006 that the islamic republic will never produce weapons of mass destruction at the same time supreme leader ali khamanei said in november 2004 that iran would not give up its enrichment at any price and former president khatami stated in march 2005 that ending irans uranium enrichment program is completely unacceptable uranium enrichment can be used for both peaceful nuclear fuel and military nuclear weapons uses however two decades of clandestine activities have raised questions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21592 about irans intentions and many have called for iran to rebuild world confidence by refraining from enrichment and reprocessing perhaps indefinitely nonetheless the further iran proceeds down the path of enrichment the more difficult it will become to foreswear it if only for financial reasons what inspections revealed in 2002 the national council of resistance of iran ncr helped expose irans undeclared nuclear activities by providing information about nuclear sites at natanz uranium enrichment and arak heavy water production three years of intensive inspections by the iaea revealed significant undeclared iranian efforts in uranium enrichment including centrifuge atomic vapor laser and molecular laser isotope separation techniques and separation of plutonium as well as undeclared imported material iranian officials have delayed inspections changed explanations for discrepancies cleaned up facilities and in one case lavizanshian razed site4 according to iaea director general mohamed elbaradei iran tried to cover up many of their activities and they learned the hard way5 among other activities iran admitted in 2003 it conducted bench scale uranium conversion experiments in the 1990s required to be reported to the iaea and later admitted that it used for those experiments some safeguarded material that had been declared lost in other processes safeguards violation iranian officials told the iaea 2 see statement by irans former foreign minister kamal kharrazi at httpwwwpbsorg

conference apr 29 2003 4 david albright and corey hinderstein iran countdown to showdown bulletin of atomic scientists novdec 2004 vol 60 6 5 iran was offered nuclear parts washington post feb 27 2005 crs3 only in january 2005 of pakistani scientist aq khans 1987 offer of centrifuge enrichment starter kit6 in november 2005 iran finally admitted that the khan network supplied it with information on casting and machining parts of nuclear weapons7 enrichment activities inspections revealed two enrichment plants at natanz pilotscale facility planned to have 1000 centrifuges and commercialscale plant under construction planned to have 50000 centrifuges the pilotscale plant pfep started up in june 2003 only to shut down after iran suspended enrichment activities in december 2003 since february 2006 when iran resumed enrichmentrelated activities iran has tested small cascades 10 20 then 164 machines with uranium hexafluoride gas uf6 all under iaea safeguards8 the iaea has reported that iran has achieved maximum enrichment of 42 at pfep9 construction on the commercialscale plant fep was also suspended in 2003 although iran announced plans in april 2006 to install 3000 centrifuges in the commercial plant by the end of the year it did not even meet third of that goal as of february 2007 iran was operating two cascades under vacuum without feedstock and was in the process of installing another two cascades which would bring the number of centrifuges up to 656 at the point when iran introduces uf6 into the fep nuclear material accountancy must begin the iaea has httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21592 also told iran it must have remote monitoring equipment installed before 500 centrifuges are operating in fep which iran has resisted10 few enrichment issues remain unresolved the first is the source of highly enriched uranium heu particles at sites in iran iranian officials asserted that heu particles found at the natanz pilot plant in 2003 were contaminants from foreign centrifuge assemblies first clue revealing the pakistani aq khan network iran admitted to enriching uranium to just 12 while the particles sampled ranged from 36 to 70 u235 in october 2003 iranian officials admitted they tested centrifuges at the kalaye electric company using uf6 between 1998 and 2002 iaea report gov200615 reveals that components also came from another country besides pakistan another unresolved issue is how far iran has pursued more sophisticated centrifuge and laser enrichment technology iran admitted in october 2003 that it also pursued laser enrichment program beginning in the 1970s and admitted that it possessed more advanced centrifuge designs p2 in january 2004 such advanced designs could double irans enrichment capabilities shortening the time potentially to bomb iran insists that it received centrifuge components after 1995 but admitted it received limited number of magnets for p2 centrifuges in 2003 and in april 2006 admitted to purchasing magnets suitable for the p2 design the iaea continues to investigate this issue plutoniumrelated activities in october 2003 iran revealed that it had conducted plutonium reprocessing experiments in hot cell at the tehran nuclear 6 iran report by the director general gov200567 sept 2 2005 7 iran hands over nuclear cookbook nov 18 2005 aljazeeranet 8 iran report by the director general gov200615 feb 27 2006 9 iran report by the director general gov200664 nov 14 2006 10 iran report by the director general gov20078 feb 22 2007 crs4 research center and estimated the amount separated as 200 micrograms the iaea calculated that more plutonium would have been produced about 100g and iran admitted in may 2004 that it understated the amount inspections also revealed that iran experimented between 1989 and 1993 on irradiating bismuth which can be used to produce polonium210 for civilian purposes for nuclear batteries or in conjunction with beryllium to create neutron initiator for nuclear weapon finally the heavy water program also has raised questions about irans intentions iran first told the iaea that it planned to export heavy water then suggested that the heavy water would be used as coolant and moderator for planned ir40 reactor for research and development radioisotope production and training however irans design information for the facility which omitted necessary hot cell equipment for producing radioisotopes conflicted with reported iranian efforts to import hot cell equipment construction of the ir40 reactor has continued despite the boards continued calls for halt although iranian officials predict that the reactor will not be operational until 201111 the heavy water production plant reportedly has been operational since 2004 and in august 2006 iranian officials announced they would double its production httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21592 significance for nuclear weapons program iran is likely years away from producing weaponsgrade plutonium or highly enriched uranium thendirector of national intelligence john negroponte told the senate select committee on intelligence on february 2 2006 that we judge that tehran probably does not yet have nuclear weapon and probably has not yet produced or acquired the fissile material according to one report the 2005 national intelligence estimate on iran assesses that it will be 10 years before iran has bomb12 that said iran has pursued three different methods of enriching uranium and has experimented with separating plutonium suggesting steady accrual of expertise in weaponsrelevant areas according to some observers if iran received the same nuclear weapon design that aq khan gave libya the remaining technical hurdle albeit the most difficult would be fissile material production on january 18 2007 thendni negroponte told members of congress that our assessment is that tehran is determined to develop nuclear weapons it is continuing to pursue uranium enrichment and has shown more interest in protracting negotiations than reaching an acceptable diplomatic solution calculations of nuclear weapons production are generally based on estimates of fissile material production one calculation is that cascade of 1000 p1 centrifuges could produce one bombs worth of heu 25 kg in 22 to 27 years and that cascade of 3000 p1 centrifuges could produce the same amount in 271330 days13 such an estimate assumes that iran has the necessary amount and quality of uranium hexafluoride to feed the enrichment plant the components for building 1000 or 3000 centrifuges and the engineering skills to keep such cascades operating with few mishaps in short irans 11 gov200615 12 iran is judged 10 years from nuclear bomb washington post aug 2 2005 13 international institute for strategic studies irans strategic weapons programmes net assessment uk routledge 2005 p 54 crs5 limited experience in enrichment so far should not be equated yet with an ability to operate an industrialscale enrichment plant for peaceful or weapons purposes negotiating with iran since 2003 negotiations with iran on its nuclear program have proceeded on two levels with iaea inspectors and at the iaea board of governors in vienna and with the european union foreign ministers known as the eu3 of germany the uk and france in 2006 the eu3 were joined by russia china and the united states after irans noncompliance was reported to the security council some observers may view the second negotiating track as necessary because the iaea and board of governors failed to take decisive action against clear pattern of deception early on others may view it as necessary because of the potential danger of iran pulling out of the npt irans voluntary measures negotiated with the eu3 may have allowed iaea inspectors greater access than would otherwise be granted under irans comprehensive safeguards agreement but also may have left iran free to set the terms of engagement since irans concessions were voluntary and political while it is true that httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21592 the eu3 have been unable to obtain irans agreement to permanent halt to uranium enrichment activities their key objective such an objective could not have been pursued by the iaea because that is not in its mandate within few months of irans voluntary moratorium there were signs of continued activities that called into question irans commitment although the november 2004 paris agreement clarified the terms of the moratorium by march 2005 iran proposed running its pilotscale enrichment facility which eu3 negotiators rejected in april 2005 iran said that unless negotiations progressed it would start up its uranium conversion plant which it did in august 200514 following iranian president ahmadinejads inflammatory remarks at the september 2005 summit the iaea board voted on resolution gov200577 which found iran in noncompliance with its safeguards agreement specifically the board found that irans many failures and breaches of its obligations to comply with its npt safeguards agreement as detailed in gov200375 constitute noncompliance in the context of article xiic of the agencys statute for several months thereafter iran provided limited details on outstanding issues and discussed with russia an offer to conduct uranium enrichment on russian soil as an alternative to indigenous production in january 2006 iran abandoned its voluntary suspension of enrichmentrelated activities negotiations as well as the interim application of the additional protocol prompting an emergency board meeting an iaea report prepared for the meeting linked for the first time khan network document in irans possession on uranium casting and machining to the fabrication of nuclear weapons components15 iran asserts that the khan network provided the document on its own initiative nonetheless article ii of the npt obligates iran not to receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear explosives so the question of whose initiative prompted 14 infcirc648 communication dated 1 august 2005 received from the permanent mission of the islamic republic of iran to the agency available at httpwwwiaeaorg 15 see httpwwwiaeaorgnewscenterstatementsddgs2006heinonen31012006pdf crs6 transfer of the document is moot the february board passed resolution gov200614 without consensus to report iran to the security council the security council issued presidential statement on march 29 2006 calling upon iran to reinstate its suspension of enrichment and reprocessing reconsider construction of its heavy water reactor ratify and implement the additional protocol and implement transparency measures16 iran continued its enrichment activities while claiming it was cooperating with the iaea17 the iaea reported to the security council gov200627 on april 28 that it was unable to make progress in its efforts to provide assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in iran its june 8 report gov200638 reported even less progress given lack of new information on june 6 2006 the eu3 russia china and the united states p5 1 offered iran new negotiating proposal which included incentives such as affirming irans inalienable right to peaceful nuclear energy assistance in building stateoftheart light water reactors for iran fuel supply guarantees dismissing security council consideration of irans npt noncompliance wto membership and an end to certain us httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21592 sanctions to allow iran to purchase agriculture appliances and boeing aircraft parts18 in return iran would suspend enrichment and reprocessingrelated activities resume implementation of the additional protocol and fully cooperate with the iaea irans moratorium could be reviewed once several conditions had been met including resolving all issues and restoring international confidence in the peaceful nature of irans nuclear program the proposal also outlined several measures targeted at irans nuclear program should iran not agree to cooperate ban on nuclearrelated exports freeze of assets travelvisa bans suspension of technical cooperation with the iaea ban on investment in related entities and on iranians studying abroad in nuclear and missilerelated areas broader measures could include an arms embargo support for wto membership and general freeze on assets of iranian financial institutions since june 2006 the security council has demanded iranian compliance and transparency and iran has failed to respond the p5 discussed sanctions through the fall and the security council ultimately adopted unscr 1737 on december 23 2006 which requires states to prevent the supply sale or transfer of equipment and technology that could contribute to enrichment reprocessing heavywaterrelated activities or missile delivery systems in iran and to freeze the funds of persons and entities involved in the nuclear and ballistic missile programs19 unscr 1737 gave iran another 60 days to comply which expired on february 21 2007 on february 22 2007 the iaea reported its inability to make further progress and hence its inability to verify the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in iran gov20078 the security council continues to discuss further sanctions on iran see crs report rl32048 iran us concerns and policy responses by kenneth
