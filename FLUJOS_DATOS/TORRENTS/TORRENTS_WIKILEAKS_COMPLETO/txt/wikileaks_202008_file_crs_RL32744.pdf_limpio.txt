determination dana shea larry parker james mccarthy and thomas chapman resources science and industry division january 21 2005 abstract number of controversies have arisen concerning the proposed mact standards in general critics argue that the proposed standards are not suﬃciently stringent to meet the statutory requirements for mact the epa responds that technology to meet more stringent standards is not currently available and that the standards reﬂect the best performance achieved by currently installed control equipment this report examines this controversy ie whether the proposed mact standards do reﬂect the best emission control achieved at existing coalﬁred electric generating units as required by statute this report begins by describing the statutory requirements and the standards proposed by epa it then proceeds to describe the sampling methods used by epa to generate data on existing mercury control levels the methodology used by epa to determine the proposed mact standard based on the sampling data is described finally some of the comments received by epa on the proposed standards are reviewedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32744congressional research service the

dana shea larry parker james mccarthy and thomas chapman resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32744mercury emissions from elec tric generating units review of epa analysis and mact determination summary the environmental protection agency epa has identified mercury as the hazardous air pollutant emitted from electric generating units that is of greatest public health concern as result epa propos ed regulations limiting electric generating unit egu mercury emissions in d ecember 2000 epa committed to promulgating maximum achievable control technolog mact emissions limits under section 112 of the clean air act section 112 sets specific re quirements for mact standa rds for new facilities the mact standard must be at least as st ringent as the degree of emissions control achieved at the best controlled similar source for existing facilities the mact standard must generally achieve limits equal to the average performance of the best 12 of comparable sources determination of this performance is complicated by the lack of installed comme rcial technology specifically for capture of egu mercury emissions thereby necessitating data coll ection on other existing technologies and extensive analysis of potential control levels to determine the level of allowable mercury emissions epa collected data regarding coal composition and mercury emissions from an 80 egu sample analysis of these data led epa to subcategorize egus and propose mact standards for each subcategory in january 2004 the proposed mact standards have b een criticized by wide range of stakeholders on several criteria incl uding epa methodology to determine the allowable emissions threshold the epa methodology incorporates two statistical treatments the use of first 975 upper confidence limit to account for the variability in input coal and second nother 975 upper confidence interval to account for variance in plant operation th result is proposed standards that are substantially less stringent than the average emissions rate of the top 12 of the 80 unit sample while epa justifies these statistical treatments others assert they unnecessarily weaken the proposed regulation indeed the proposed mact standard allows greater amount of mercury emi ssion than most stakeholders from all viewpoints had recommended prior to the epa proposal the proposed mact standards

mercury is heavy metal and potent neurotoxin that bioaccumulates and concentrates as it passes through the f ood chain the environmental protection agency epa considers it both public health concern and concern in the environment1 these concerns have grown in recent years as research has indicated mercurys presence at significant levels in numerous species of fish analyses of human dietary intake and resulting levels of mercury in blood have pointed to potential health risks from mercury ingesti on particularly for women of childbearing age2 to limit mercury exposure 45 states have issued fish consumption advisories3 at the same time epa and the states have promulgated series of regulations toreduce the amount of mercury used in products 4 and limit emissions for most sources of mercury emitted to the atmosphere5 us emissions of mercury to the air come from eight principal sources of these the largest source and the only major source for which emission standards have not yet been promulgated is coalfi red electric generating units coalfiredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32744crs2 6 us epa proposed national emissi on standards for hazardous air pollutants and in the alternative

onethird and onehalf of total us mercury emissions in january 2004 ep proposed regulations to limit emissions from these units positing two possible control mechanisms one is to establish maximum achievable control technolog mact standards for emissions of mercury from coalfired electric power plants the other is to develop capandtrade mechanism for those same emissions this report focuses on the proposed epa mact standards including critiques ther eof and does not treat the proposed cap andtrade alternative model number of controversies have ar isen concerning the proposed mact standards in general critics argue that the proposed standards are not sufficiently stringent to meet the st atutory requirements for ma ct the epa responds that technology to meet more stringent standards is not currently available and that the standards reflect the best performance ach ieved by currently installed control equipment6 this report examines this controve rsy ie whether the proposed mact

secti on 112d of the clean air act the epa proposed the establishment of maximum achievable control technology mact standards for emissions of mercury from coalfired electric power plants7 t h standards rely on the statutory requirement s in section 112d3 of the clean air act which states that for new sources t he degree of reduction shall be not less stringent than the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source for existing sources the degree of reduction shall be with some qualifications not less stringent and ma be more stringent than the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources for which the administrator has missions information or if there are fewer than 30 sources in category or subcategory it shall be not less stringent than the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32744crs3 8 42 usc 7412 9 at the time these regulations were promulgated these technologies were considered beyond the floor although now they are sta ndard controls on incinerators the most common of the technologies is activated carbon injection aci which when used with fabric filter or baghouse captures more than 90 of mercury emissions from incinerators similar technology has been the subject of successful fullscale field tests at at least four coalfired pow er plants but has not yet been commercially installed 10 considerable controversy has arisen over wh ether epa is correct in deciding not to go beyond the floor this determination is generally supported by industry groups who agree that mercuryspecific controls are not commercially available others including environmental groups and some state and local agencies contend that because technologies such as aci exist epas mact standard s for mercury from electric utilities should have been more stringent by imposing standards th at would be achieved by the use of

oar20020056 june 29 2004 p 3which the epa administrator has or could reasonably obtain emissions information8 the statute establishes minimum re quirement mact floor but it explicitly permits the administrator to impose more stringent requirements it is unclear how often epa has used this author ity to go beyond the floor although two examples of the agencys doing so invol ve mercury controls imposed on municipal and medical waste incinerators in the mid1990s9 this report focuses on epas calculation of the current mact floor for mercury emissions from coalfired powerplants not whether the agency should have gone beyond it10 thus this report will not discuss at any length beyondth efloor technologies or standards us power plant has as yet installed emission control technologies specifically designed to capture mercury emissions therefore the currently proposed mact floor for these sources re lies on calculations of mercury removal rates cobenefits achieved by other tec hnology that was installed to control sulfur dioxide particulates or other regulated pollutants the epas objective was to identify the technologies designed for other pollution control objectives that have the maximum level of these cobenefits for mercury emissions the proposed mact standards for mercury emissions from coalfired powerplants are shown in table 1 using the authorities provided in section 112c and d epa divided coalfire d plants into five subcategories four based on coal type bituminous subbituminous lignite nd coal refuse and the fifth based on combustion technology integrated gasifi cation combined cycle also known as igcc each type of coal has diffe ring properties and mercury contents additionally the number of f acilities burning each type of coal varies with the majority of facilities burni ng bituminous or subbituminous coal the epa set standards that vary by as much as fact or of 30 depending on the coal type the most stringent standards apply to coal refusefired and bitu minousfired facilities while the other categories have less st ringent standards as shown in table 2 the size of the five subcategories also varies widely 95 of the existing units fall intohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32744crs4 11 facility is defined as contiguous plant site where one or more electric utility steam generating units are locatedthe bituminous or subbituminous groups while the other three subcategories have relatively few units the proposed standards would apply on unitbyunit basis for each unit with capacity greater than 25 megawatts electri c mw but the proposal allows facilities three forms of flexibility in achieving compliance first emissions can be averaged among all of the units at facility11 large power plant commonly has several units so this provision might allow facilities to comply by installing stringent controls on one or more of their units while leaving other units uncontrolled second compliance will be termined not by whether facility is within the standard continuously but by whether th rolling 12month average of emissions is within the standard this would allow facility to exceed the standard for days or weeks provided that it lowers emissions sufficiently at other times during the 12 months to offset peak emi ssions the epa states that use of an averaging period is appropriate because mercury emissions from power plants

13 november 16 1998 17 69 federal register 4661 january 30 2004the proposed standards do not include percentage emission reduction requirement the epa estimates that the standards would result in emissions of 34 tons of mercury from the affected sources 29 reduction as compared to the 1999 emission level of 48 tons12 sampling the mact standard is ba sed on data obtained during an information collection request icr initiated by the epa in april 1998 to gather data on mercury emissions from electric generating units13 the industry was canvassed and those data were used to determine the amount of mercury emitted with respect to the coal burned the collection of comprehensive da ta is key to understanding the range of possible plant configurations coal compos itions and subsequent mercury emissions epa recognized that competing considerations the cost of the data collection effort versus the comprehensiveness of th data obtained were important factors in determining the final number of sites sampled14 the epa decided that due to the factors of cost and effectiveness 3 units would be selected for each combination of mechanical sulfur dioxide control co type and partic ulate matter control15 this led to maximum of 135 units considered assuming that at least three units populated each combination16 in practice site existed for several of the combinations data was subsequently obtained from 80 sites and considered to establish the mact floors17 table 2 provides comparison of the number of existing coalfired power plants to the num ber of plants used to determine the proposed mact standard epa methodology for generating mact levels epa chose to subcategorize the mercuryemissions data by unit type because of the different mercury coll ection characteristics followi ng combustion different mact floor was determined for each of these categories by examining the mercury emission rates in the case of coalrefu sefired lignitefired and igcc

epa found it necessary to statistica lly treat the data received from the information collection request because the mercuryemission measurements were limited in time often scribed as snapshot epa termined that it was necessary to project the probable mercury emissions from coal burned at the facility over the course of year coal mercurycontent and heatingvalue data were combined with estimates of control efficiencies based on the observed data of various airpollution control equipment in some cases taking into account the effect of coal chlorine level to estimate the distribution of mercury emitted18 rather than use the directly measured mercury emissions epa chose instead to use the range of coal compositions repor ted by each plant to estimate an emissions value which would be exceeded more than 25 of the operating time the 975 upper confidence limit the epa considers th is value to represent the operation of the unit under conditions reasonably expected to occur at each unit19

source crs analysis from epa data the average measured mercury emission is for those facilities directly included in the mact determination not for all facilities within the subcategory for bituminous and subbituminousfired units there are more than 30 established units thus the mact floor is established by the best performing 12 of units the epa determined that the sample obtained from the information collection request was representative of existing facilities and therefore the best performing 12 of the sample would suffice to establish the mact floor in both the bituminous and subbituminousfired cases ep took the four units which had the lowest measured mercury emissions and combined the observed collection efficiencies with coalcomposition values reported by those units over the course of year to calculate the expected mercur emission from these estimated emission rates epa determined for each unit the projected mercuryemission level that would not be exceeded more than 25 of the time these four values were averaged and their average was then statistically adjusted to level which would not be exceeded more than 25 of the operating time this second statistical adjustment is intended to reflect the possible variability in operation of different units burning the same fuel type20 this final value was assigned as the mact standard for graphical representation

average mercury emissions measured for all facilities of that subcategory the incorporation of each statistical treatment serves to make the proposed mact standard less stringent similarly for lignitefired units the observed mercury emissions from the five best performing units were adjusted to reflect the coal variability being adjusted to value which would be exceeded more than 25 of the operating time and then averaged this average value was then adjusted so that it would not be exceeded more than 25 of the operating time this final value was assigned as the mact floor for igcc and

sampled and the specific sites included in the dataset provides sample data representative of those units already employed in industry settings for example the national mining association nma states the icr emissions data represent at best limited snap shot of emissions from few units taken over very short period of time with limited number of fuels and cannot account for the wide variability of coals and process conditions encompassed by the full fleet of us utility boilers in addition the units chosen by epa for mercury emissions sampling in the icr program is sic unrepresentative of us coalfueled power plants30 based on an analysis conducted for nma by aems llc consulting firm that found inadequacies and biases in the epa 80 unit sample nma states as result of these inadequacies the icr part iii data ca nnot be used to identify and evaluate the emissions performance of specific units that would rank in the top 12 percent of their subcategory r among the 5 best on an annual basis31 indeed nma argues that the data and relate d analysis are so fl awed that epa should abandon mactbased form of mercury re gulation stating that if epa proceeds nma and its members reserve all potential objections to such standards arising under the data quality act and other applicable provi sions of federal law32 the state of missouri department of natural resources contending that the mact standard at least with respect to subbituminous coal is too lenient states the missouri source calculations indi cate that the proposed mact emission limitation for existing subbituminous coalf ired units is too lenient this leniency was likely caused by sampling error resulting from basing the determinations on sample population too small to be representative of the norm in this case the sample size of 32 uni ts used to determine the floor greatly increased the likelihood of sampling errors33 the epa determined that an appropriate experimental design for the icr was to vary three

expe rimental strategy including more proportionate distribution of facilities or including technologies that are in development but not yet implemented w ould have provided for more stringent mercury standard for example nescaum asserts that epas attempts to treat variability in the icr data is flawed in part due to the lack of any data from mercury specific controls such as activated carbon injection35 the epa has stated that mercuryspecific control technologies are not yet commercially available for electric generating units and will likely not be commercially available prior to 2010 and therefore consideration of these technolog ies in determining th mact floor would be incorrect subcategories and mact floor levels primary source of disagreement bout epas proposal is the use of subcategories while section 112d provides the epa administrator with the authority to subcategorize mact standards the criteria for determining these subcategories are not defined the ep used combination of coal types bituminous subbituminous lignite and firi ng configurations igcc boilers to develop subcategories within the utility mercury mact this decision has proven highly controversial both with respect to the subcategories chosen and the mact floor determination for each subcategory environmental groups have attacked the proposed subcategories as without rational

coal type burned in addition these groups state that many boilers have some flexibility to adapt to different coal feedstocks also criticizing the use of subcategories the state of new jersey suggests in its comments that because th proposed standard for subbituminous coal is nearly three times that for bituminous coal utilities may be able to comply with the proposed mact standard s by simply switching coal supplies emitting more mercury than before37 that the weaker subbituminous proposal could encourage western subbituminous coal production at the expe nse of eastern bituminous

than epas proposal in similar vein nescaum found that if the average observed mercury emissions from the topperforming 12 of epas 80 unit data sample regardless of coal type was used as the emissions standard an emissions reduction of 911 would be achieved in comp arison with the predicted 29 reduction in mercury emissions expected under ep as proposed mact standard40 most industry groups agreed with epas determination that subcategories were appropriate but disagreed on their specifi cation in particular several commenters argued that north dakota and gulf coast lignite should be regu lated separately not combined stating that merc ury content of gulf coast lignite was at least double that of north dakota lignite the edison electric institute eei argued that the proposed lignite standard would be unachievable for units using gulf coast lignite41 other concerns were expressed about the absence of any units burning powder river basin subbituminous coal in epa sample data42 variability and mact floor levels major source of disagreement surr ounding the proposed mercury rule is epas variability analysis to determin the proposed standard epa used methodology to identify and quantify exp ected variability in mercury emissions because of the variability of mercury in co the result is proposed standards that are substantially less stringent than the simple average emissions rate of the top 12 of its 80 unit sample this variability analysis has come unde r particular scrutin by all parties environmental groups label the analysis as statistical gimmicks that result in mact floors that represent virtually the worst shortterm emissions from the worst performing of the best units and assumes that these pollution levels will persist through the year43 one of the more detailed an

based on 12month rolling average44 stating if it were essential to identify and quan tify variability in emissions the relevant measure of variability would be what wa s experienced over 12 months not what was experienced in any single stack testin g event transient peak in emissions during the 12month period will not cause noncompliance with the standard because lower emissions during the rest of the period will average out the effect of the peak for that reason using the shortterm worstcase scenario to set an annual standard immediately makes the standard unnecessarily lax if compliance is to be based on longterm average epa should be estimating longterm averages not worst case emissions to determine the mact floor45 new jersey proceeds to argue that epas pr oposed standards are indeed less stringent as result of their variability analysis eliminating epas variability analysis including subcategorization would re duce the mact floor to 018 lbstbtu alternately if the data were only stratified by coal type the average of the observed mercury emissions would be 012 lbstbtu fo r bituminous units in contrast with the proposed mact standard of 20 lbstbtu in contrast while industr generally supported epas efforts some industry analysis found that epa insufficiently dea lt with the mercury variability issue in arguing for mact floors substantially hi gher than epas proposal nma asserted that combination of data quality and variability concerns require an increase in mact floor estimates for new sources to 51 lbstbtu for bituminous units and 74 lbstbtu for subbituminous units46 according to analysis by aems llc the epa mact standards for new sources when c onverted from an output basis to an input basis are equivalent to 063 lbstbtu for bituminous units and 21

35approach to variability analyses as well as the use of available data on mercury content of us coal48 conclusion the proposed regulations to limit mercur emissions from electric generating units have been criticized by wide range of stakeholders based on several criteria including the method used by epa to termine the allowed emissions threshold the proposed emissions threshold incorporates two statistical treatments this serves to make the proposed mact standard less stringent than the average of the actual emission measurements and less stri ngent than the recommendations of stakeholders including industry and nvironmental groups pr ior to the mact proposal while epa justifies these statisti cal treatments as necessary to account for the variability in i nput coal and plant operation others assert that they represent significant unnecessary weakness of th proposed regulation whether mercury emissions from electric generating units should be contro lled via the proposed regulation in its current form an alternate form or through an alternate mechanism is topic of likely congressional interesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32744crs17 49 the data at the extremes of the distribution ie the highest and lowest measurements play predominant role in determining the confiden ce interval therefore the quality of these measurements is crucial since any inaccurac ies in this data will be magnified in the calculation of the confidence interval 50 the number of facilities averaged influences the width of this confidence interval the greater the number of facilities averaged togeth er the lower the uncertainty regarding the distribution of these values this lower unc ertainty translates to narrower confidence interval appendix effects of statistical treatment the effect of each statistical treatment performed by epa serves to make the proposed mact standard less stringent than the average of the measured mercury emissions data the epa found it necessary to statistically treat the data received from the information collection request for several reasons first the mercuryemission measurements were limited in time often described as snapshot and may not represent the actual emissions performance of the facility as consequence epa projected the probable mercury emissions from coal burned at the facility over the course of year the epa developed these pr ojections through one of two methods in the case of some equipment configurations it was determined that correlation between the mercury emissions and the coal chlorinecontent existed in these situations the coal chlorine content was used to predict the rcury emissions in other cases suitable correlation did not exist in these situations the mercury emissions for that facility were determined by using an empirical estimate of the control efficiency for mercury of existing emissionscontrol equipment by obtaining these projected mercury emissions epa was able to determine the expected mercury emissions level over twelvemonth period the epa took the projected mercury emissions developed from the coal compositions reported by each plant and determined the emissions value which would be exceeded more than 25 of the operating time the upper 975 confidence limit49 the epa considers this value to represent the operation of the unit under conditions reasonably exp ected to occur at each unit the proposed mact standard was then determined from the average of these upper 975 confidence limits once the average of the upper 975 confidence limits was determined second statistical treatment was pe rformed to determine the variation between the units from this va riation calculation wa s made to determine what the upper 975 confidence limit woul d be for these averaged units50 this value was then set as the mact standard the number of facilities averaged depended on the subcategory considered in the case of bituminous and subbituminousfi red facilities 4
