released to accrediting organizations to carry out their accr editing functions and to the parents of dependent student finally ducation records may be released in connection with an emergency if the records are necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other persons11 in the wake of the shootings at virginia tech there have been several attempts to clarify ferpas health or safety exception for example under recen t amendments to the higher education act the secretary of education is required to provide guidance clarifying rules regarding disclosure when student poses significant risk of harm to himself or herself or to others including significant risk of suicide homicide or assault such guidance must clarify that institutions that disclose such information in good faith are not liable for the disclosure12 in addition the depa rtment of education recently issued proposed regulations that contained similar clarif ications regarding disclosure requirements in the event of threat to health or safety13 in 2001 the definition of education record s and the requireme nts related to the release of such records was the subject of review in supreme court case owasso independent school district v falvo that considered whether peer grading and the practice of calling out grades in class resulted in an impermissible release of education records14 the plaintiff argued that the grades on studentgraded assignments were education records maintained by students acting for an educational institution and that students should not be allowed to call out th grades they recorded in class because education records may not be released without consent the school district on the other hand maintained that ferpas definiti on of education records covered only institutional records or materials maintained in permanent file such as final coursehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22341crs4 15 id at 43132 16 id at 432433 17 id at 433 18 20 usc 1232ga5 19 idgrades standardized test scores attendance records and similar information but not student homework or classroom work15 ultimately the court concluded that the grades on peergraded student assignments were not education records identifying two statutory explanations for its decision first the court determined that student assignments are not maintained within the meaning of ferpas definition of education records because neither the teacher nor the students maintain the grades of recently corrected assignment in manner that reflected common understanding of when something is maintained as the court observed the word maintain suggests records that will be kept in filing cabinet in records room at the school or on perm anent secure database16 second the court concluded that student graders are not persons acting fo r an educational institution for purposes of ferpas definition of education records the court found that the phrase acting for does not suggest students but rather connotes agents of the school such as teachers administrators and other school employees moreover the court maintained that correcting classmates work could be viewed as being part of an assignment it is way to teach material again in new context and it helps show students how to assist and respect fellow pupils17 the court did not interpret ferp to prohibit such educational techniques and noted that the logical cons equences of finding p eergraded assignments to be education records would seem unbounded directory information absent prior notice from parent an educational agency or institution may release directory information without consent ferp defines directory information to include the following the students name address telephone listin g date and place of birth major field of study participation in officially recognized activities and sports weight and height of members of athletic teams dates of attendance degrees and awards received and the most recent previous educational agen cy or institution attended by the student18 an agency or institution compiling director information must give public notice of the categories of information it has designated as directory information and must allow reasonable period of time after the issuance of such notice to permit parent to inform the agency or institution that parental consent must be given before the release of any or all of the directory information19 disclosure of misconduct and drug and alcohol violations ferpa does not restrict postsecondary institutions from disclosing certain information about student misconduct and from identifying student drug and alcoholhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22341crs5 20 id at 1232gb6 21 id at 1232gi 22 id at 1232gj1 23 id at 1232gj2 24 id at 1232gb4violations for example pos

in addition postsecondary institution may disc lose to parent or legal guardian of student information regarding any violation of any federal state or local law or any rule or policy of the institution governing the us or possession of alcohol or controlled substance however disclosu re is permitted only when the student is under the age of twentyone and the institution determines that the student committed disciplinary violation with respect to the use or posse ssion of alcohol or controlled substance21 disclosures related to the investigation and prosecution of terrorism in 2001 ferpa was amended to allow th attorney general ag or certain employees designated by the ag to seek access to education records that are relevant to an authorized investigation or prosecution of terrorismrelated offense or an act of domestic or international terrorism thes records may be disseminated and used as evidence in an administrative or judicial proceeding22 to obtain access to the

specific facts that give reason to believe that the education records are likely to contain relevant info rmation and the court shall issue the order if it finds that the application includes this certification23 education records disclosed pursuant to court order are not subject to ferpas requirement that educational agencies and institutions maintain records identifying entities that have requested or obtained access to students education records24 enforcement of ferpa violations under ferpa educational agencies nd institutions found to have policy of denying parental access to students educati on records or releasing students education records without written consent may be denied federal funds the secretary of education is authorized to deal with violations of the act and to establish or designate review boardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22341crs6 25 id at 1232gf g 26 34 cfr 9963 27 id at 9966 28 id at 9967a 29 536 us 273 2002 30 id at 277 31 id at 282 32 id at 283 33 id

written complaints26 if violation is found after investigation the fpco will notify the co mplainant and the educational agency or institution of its findings and identify the specific steps that the agency or institution must take to comply with ferpa27 if the agency or institution fails to comply within reasonable period of time the secretary may either withhold further payments under any applicable program issue complaint to compel compliance through ceaseanddesist order or terminate elig ibility to receive funding28 in gonzaga university v doe 29 the court considered whether student could enforce the provisions of ferpa by suing an institution for damages under 42 usc 1983 which provides remedy for violations of federally conf erred rights the respondent former student at gonzaga pl anned to teach in the washington state public school system after graduation washington re quired new teachers to obtain an affidavit of good moral character from dean of thei r graduating college or university but the respondent was denied such an affidavit af ter gonzagas teacher certification specialist informed the state agency re sponsible for teacher certifica tion of allegations involving sexual misconduct by the respondent the responde nt sued gonzaga alleging violation of section 1983 for the impermi ssible release of personal in formation to an unauthorized person under ferpa30 the court found that ferpa creates pers onal rights that may be enforced under section 1983 the court noted that unless c ongress expresses an unambiguous intent to confer individual rights fe deral funding provisions like those included in ferpa provide basis for private enforcement under section 1983 the respondent had argued that as long as congress intended for statute to benefit putative plaintiffs the statute could be found to confer righ ts enforceable under section 198331 the court disagreed it is the rights not the broader or vaguer b enefits or interests that may be enforced under the authority of that section32 the court also observed that ferpas nondisclosure provisions had an aggregate focu s and were not concerned with the needs of any particular person33 by having such focus the provisions could not be understood to give rise to individual rights
