since 2002 introduction the first amendment to the us constitution provides that congress shall make law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof1 the language is commonly referred to as the establishment clause and the free exercise clause the two clauses serve to balance the collective freedom so that the government may neither coer ce nor prohibit citizens participation in religion the us supreme court historically s rendered its decisions on both clauses without applying bright line rules the tablishment clause cas in particular have used three tests to determine wh ether violation has occurred 1 the lemon test 2 the coercion test and 3 the endorsement test the lemon test assesses whether government action constitutes an establishment of religion via three prong approach the court considers wh ether the action has secular purpose whether the primary effect of the act is to advance or inhibit religion and whether the act creates excessive entangleme nt of religion and government2 the court has also used coercion test under which it deter mines whether an individual would feel coerced to participate in religious activity as result of government action3 the final test the court invokes is the endorsement test whic h assesses the effect of persons standing in the community as result of government action government action cannot be constitutional under this test if it sugge sts that nonadherents are outsiders and believe rs are insiders4 as is the case in other freedoms guaranteed by the first amendment the freedom of religion is not absolute th court has interpreted the free exercise clause historically to mean that government action alleged to interfere with religious practices could be constitutional only if it

california law did not have the sta nding required to sue on her behalf11 the concept of standing derives mainly from the cons titutions case and cont roversy requirement under article iii federal courts are per mitted to hear only cases that present actual controversies between pa rties in order to bring cas in federal court person must meet general requirements of standing harm must be 1 suffered 2 caused by the act being challenged and 3 capable of being remedied in the judicial system12 in addition to these constitutional standing requirements courts have also imposed other limitations known as prudentia l standing requirements on person seeking to litigate certain issues one of these is general prohibition on thirdparty standing which arises when one person attempts to sue on behalf of another person13 one exception to the prudential standing requireme nts concerns the rights of minors the parent of child generally may sue on the childs behalf howe ver under california law only the parent with sole legal control over the child may bring suit on her behalf14 three members of the courtrehnquist oconnor and thomasconcurred with the majoritys decision in favor of the sc hool district but wrot opinions that reached the merits of the case citing exampl dating back to president washington rehnquist found that the phrase under g od was variation on references to religion that had been part of public statements by the nations leaders for centuries rehnquist emphasized that the phrase was part of patriotic practice not religious exercise15 oconnors opinion interpreted the ph rase as an expression of ceremonial deism something that refers to the divine without offending the constitution16 she further stated that such re ferences history

ceremony violated the establishment clause because students although not officially required to attend the ceremony were effectively coerced to participate in school event that promoted religious exercise because of the significance of the ceremony as lifetime achievement and peer pressure involved in attending high school events 19 id at 49 for additional information on newdow see crs report

wrongly decided thomas voted to uphold the pledge policy as well19 locke v davey the courts next case illustrated the tension that may arise between the two clauses in some cases in order to comply with statute that has valid secular purpose such as law prohibiting polygamy person may be forced to violate his religious beliefs in order to avoid such situations some statutes grant exemptions for violations based on religi ous beliefs but these laws granting an exemption to some individuals in order to satisfy the right to free exercise arguably may be read as making an improper acco mmodation of religion in violation of the establishment clause on the other hand if congress does not allow an exemption the person cannot obey the statute without vi olating his religion by not granting the exemption and satisfying the establishment clauses requirements of neutrality the law creates burden that arguably violates the free exercise clause thus if statute has an exemption person who does not hold religious beliefs that entitle him to the exemption might bring an establishm ent clause challenge and if the statute has exemption person who does hold pa rticular religious belief might bring free exercise challenge this situation illustrates the complexities of the religion clauses of the constitution that played out in locke v davey in locke v davey washington offered students state funding for college under its promise scholarship program the program offered academic scholarships to college students but required that recipients not use the funds to pursue devotional theological degrees after receiving promise scholarship from the state davey enrolled in northwest college to pursue dual major in pastoral ministries and business management and administration b ecause daveys pastoral ministries major was considered devotional nd ineligible for funding under the program washington did not provide davey with the scholarship funds dave challenged the programs limitation for devotional degrees claiming that the states refusal to fund his chosen path of education interfered w ith his free exercise rights20 in clarifying the issues raised by this challenge the court noted that under federal c onstitutional law when recipient of public funds makes an i ndependent choice to spend those funds on religious training there is violation of the federal establishment clause21 however state constitutions such as washingtons in this case may contain religionclauses that more strictly limit the states role in religious matters

prohibit the state from funding religious instruction intended to prepare students for ministry22 the issue of the case thus was whethe r washington acting pursuant to the anti establishment provision in its own constituti on could deny students state funding for devotional degrees without violating the fe deral constitutions free exercise clause the majority rehnquist stevens connor kennedy souter ginsburg and breyer held that the withholding of the funds did not improperly infringe on daveys federal right to free exercise23 justices scalia and thomas dissented finding that the scholarship policy violated daveys ri ght to freely exercise his religion when law discriminates against religi on on its face eg the text of the law itself limits religious exercise the law is subject to strict scrutiny standard of review because laws that specifically target religion are considered suspect the court will strike them down unless it finds that the law serves compelling government interest and uses the least restrictive means necessary to achieve that interest24 in this case the court found that the programs disfavor of religion if it can be called that was of far milder kind than cases previously decided against facially discriminatory laws25 the program imposes neither criminal nor civil sanctions on religious practice does not deny to ministers the right to participate in the political affairs of the community and does not require students to choose between their religious beliefs and receiving government benefit26 factors such as these were present in previous cases where the limitation on free exercise was found to be unconstitutional thus the co urt distinguished the issue presented in locke from first amendment precedent explaining that the states interest in not funding the pursuit of devotional degrees is substantial and the exclusion of such funding places relatively minor burden on promise scholars27 scholars still were free to choose to attend accredited religi ous schools and to enroll in devotional theology elective courses but were rest ricted only from using the states funds to support ministry as major the policy according to the cour t struck correct balance between the clauses the federal free exercise clause was satisfied because students had the freedom to choose religi ous schools and religi on courses and the program also avoided violations of the state constitutions prohibition on state sponsoring and funding of religious ministry the dissenters found the majority opinion to be inconsistent with the courts previous

therefore must llow the recipient of that benefit to use the funds to pursue his chosen path of study28 scalia argues that the majoritys weighing of the states interest and the r ecipients burden is inappropriate if the law is not facially neutral laws involving discrimination on the face of the statue according to scalia ca nnot be solved with mere balancing instead any burden based on ones religious practice suffices to strike the facially discriminatory law as violation of the free exercise clause29 2004 2005 term cutter v wilkinson occasionally as occurred in locke some governmental act aimed at protecting religious liberty may be seen as threat to that same liberty in 2000 congress passed the religious land use and institutionalized persons act rluipa30 the act provided that the govern ment could not substantially burden religious exercise of any person residing in or confined to an institution unless compelling state interest was present and the state used the least restrictive means in placing the burden in effect the legislati on ensured that strict scrutiny would apply to government actions that interfere with individuals religious exercise the issue presented to the court in cutter was whether that provision attempting to protect free exercise advanced religion in vi olation of the establishment clause31 the court held that section 3 of rl uipa the provision applying the strict scrutiny standard to burdens on institutionalized persons did not violate the establishment clause and in fact was permissible accommodation of religion current and former inmates of ohio correctional facilities brought the suit claiming that officials did not acco mmodate their religious n eeds as believers in non traditional religions the inmates claimed that they were denied the chance to dress as their religion required denied various ceremonial items recognized by their religions and denied chaplain trained in their religion stat officials responded that the rluipa was unconstitutional becau it improperly fa vored religion under the establishment clause and that therefore they were not obligated to accommodate the inmates requests the unanimous court ruled that some accommodation of religious practices is not by itself sufficient to constitute violation of the establishment clause citing several historic first amendment cases including its recent decision in locke the court held that the cha llenged portion of the act does not on its face exceed the limits of permissible government accommodation of religious practices32 the court noted

freely to attend to their religious needs33 the court noted that its decision in cutter did not elevate accommodations of religious observances over an institutions need to maintain order and safety and that the justices had cause to believe that rluipa woul d not be applied in an appr opriately balanced way with particular sensitivity to security concerns34 the court declined to strike down the law on its face but noted the possibility that application of the law in certain circumstances might violate the establishm ent clause in closing its opinion the court suggested that state institutions may decline to make religious accommodations if those accommodations become excessive impose unjustified burdens on other institutionalized persons or jeopardize the effective functioning of the institution35 without such imposition of bur dens the court said accommodation of religious practice in state institutions cannot be in violation of the first amendment mccreary county v american civil liberties union twice in its 2004 2005 term the court considered the constitu tionality of the governments displaying the ten commandments on public property in the first case two counties in kentucky put up large displays of the ten commandments in their courthouses prompting the american civil liberties ion of kentucky to sue for injunctive relief in reaction to the suit the counties expanded the exhibit to show that the commandments were kentuckys precedent legal code to include eight other documents the common theme of which was reference to religion as the dispute between the parties continued the counties changed the display third time the final display included the nine documents of similar size to each other with title the foundations of american law and government display36 declining the counties request to abandon the lemon tests purpose prong the court held 54 that the context of the display and purpose behind the actions could not be ignored when considering whether the display violated the establishment clause the majority souter stevens oconnor ginsburg and breyer held that the manifest objective of the displays may be dispositive of the constitutional enquiry and that the development of th presentation should be considered when determining its purpose37 the court noted that the evolution of the displays throughout the dispute rested on religious th emes rather than on any historical link or secular purpose the court explained that the establishment clause requires neutrality among religious and between re ligion and nonreligion and that if the government acts with the ostensible and predominant purpose of advancing religionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34223crs8 38 id at 860 39 id at 862 40 id at 893 41 van orden v perry 545 us 677 68183 2005 42 id at 686 43 see id at 68688it violates that central establishment clause value of official religious neutrality38 the court clarified that the purpose prong of the lemon test was aimed not at secret or subtle motivations that would escape notice from the common observer but rather that the test turned on whether relig ious purpose was observable from readily discoverable fact39 justice scalia writing for the dissent cited historic instances of religious references in public speaking and religious displays in public life as evidence that the establishment clause was not meant to forb id all public displays of religion the dissent disputed the majoritys claim that the establishment clauses requirement of neutrality should be interpre ted as forbidding preferen ce among religions or between religion and nonreligion instead justice s calia argued the prin ciple of neutrality applies where public aid or restriction on free exercise is contemplated but not where public ac knowledg ment is made to require such acknowledgment be kept within those neutrality limits would require that religion be entirely nondenominational which would mean the re could be religion in the public forum at all40 this distinction between ac knowledgment and establishment is dispositive in justice scalias interpretation of the establishment clause van orden v perry the second ten commandments case the court considered yielded different result the court considered whether monument of the ten commandments on display on xas state capitol grounds constituted an establishment of religion under the first amendment the state placed the monument on the grounds as part of its larger display of dozens of other historical markers and monuments that were intended to reflect components of texan identity unlike in mccreary the court upheld this display as c onstitutional but the justices did not reach consensus in its reasoning41 the plurality opinion written by chief ju stice rehnquist and joined by justices scalia kennedy and thomas explained that the lemon test was inappropriate for evaluating the constitutionality of monuments and stated that analysis in this case should be driven both by the nature of the monument and by our nations history42 the opinion listed references to religion in public life and religious displays in public buildings that had been part of amer ican heritage throughout us history43 rehnquist emphasized that context matters in decisions involving public displays of religious symbols noting that the court did not uphold statut requiring displays of the ten commandments in schools b ecause schools are par ticularly sensitive areas in terms of creating sense of religious establishment the court recognizes

setting44 the plurality found the texas monument far more passive use of those texts than was the case in stone where the text confronted elem entary school students every day indeed van orden apparently walked by the monument for number of years before bringing this lawsuit45 because the monument was part of broader display focused not merely on religi on the plurality held the tablishment clause was not violated justice breyer who provided the d eciding vote in both ten commandments cases concurred with the judgment but wrote separately to explain why he reached different outcomes in each case breyer notes that there is single mechanical formula that can accurately draw the cons titutional line in every case in any of the courts historic establishment clause precedent46 according to breyer the establishment clause requires the government to avoid excessive interference with or promotion of religion but does not compel the government to purge from the public sphere all that in any way partakes of the religious47 recognizing van orden as borderline case breyer suggests that objective legal judgment is the most effective evaluation in such factspecific cases this objective legal judgment considers the underlying purpose of the cl auses and the context and consequences measured in light of those purposes48 according to breyer in van orden the monument had stood unchallenged for 40 year s as part of larger display that communicates secular message and suggests stateinitiated plan for sacred display of religious messages breyer found that the display satisfied the lemon test because it had an apparently secular purpose did not advance or inhibit religion and did not create an excessive entangle ment of religion and government the dissent justices stevens oconnor ginsburg and souter believed the monument to be an unconstitutional endorse ment of religion claiming that the monuments presence violates the require ment of government neutrality the dissenters emphasized that government not only cannot promote one religion over another but cannot promote re ligion generally over nonreligion49 because the monument explicitly states religious code that recognizes di vine being and also commands present worship of him and other deity it cannot be discounted as passive acknowledgment of religion nor can the state s refusal to remove it upon objection be explained as simple sire to preserve historic relic50 constitutional neutrality according to the di ssent cannot be achieved in case where pedestrian happening upon the monument needs

1990 the courts ruling in employment division department of human resources of oregon v smith rejected its previous interpretation of the free exercise clause52 prior to 1990 the court required that th strict scrutiny standard be applied to any government actions alleged to interfere with religious practice53 when the court rejected that interpretation in smith it held that the free exercise clause generally did not protect individuals wh broke generally applicable laws while practicing their religion54 therefore under smith free exercise protections became more limited in scope rfra created broader protection for religious exercise by requiring that strict scrutiny be applied when generally applicable law one that applies to all individuals w ithout regard to religion in terferes with religion rfra thus replaced the constitutional rule of smith in other words the statute rather than constitutional interpretati on now provides that the federal government cannot substantially burden individuals exercise of religion unless it uses the least restrictive means to promote compelling interest55 in gonzales v centro espirita beneficente uniao do vegetal the court again as in

violation of rfras protections for free exercise of religion57 the unanimous court except justice alit who did not participate in the case held that the government had not demonstrated compelling interest that rfra requires to justify barring the udvs sacr amental use of hoasca although the government asserted three interests in co mpletely banning hoasca the court did not believe that any of these interests satisfied the strict scrutiny standard that rfra requires for laws that interfered with religious practices one of the interests the government cited was that th nature of drugs that were highly regulated under the csa precluded individual exceptions such as the udv was requesting these drugs according to the government had high potential for abuse had currently acceptable medical use and were unsafe for medical use58 because of these factors the government claimed that complete ban was necessary and that any exceptions would be detrimental to its purposes for re gulating the drugs however the court noted that the csa itself provides for possi ble exemptions and that there has been an exemption made for use of peyote by the native american church for 35 years59 the court explained that because the csa appears to recognize the restrictions itplaces on certain substances are not absolu mere categorization of substances by the csa should not carry the determinativ weight for rfra purposes that the government would ascribe to them 60 thus the court recognized that there may be instances in which need for uniformity precludes the recognition of exceptions to generally applicable laws under rfra but the court did not allow the government to apply broad prohibitions th at affect individuals free exercise of religion without specific compelling interest in the particular case61 2006 2007 term hein v freedom fr om religion foundation the courts most recent churchstate case focused on the issue of taxpayer standing to raise establishment clause claims taxpayers typically do not have standing to sue the government on the grounds that their tax money has been spent in manner that the taxpayer considers improper such claims are c onsidered to be too generalized and more appropriately remedied through the political process rather than by the courts one exception to this rule created by flast v cohen allows taxpayers to raise establishment clause

kennedy considered the background of the ofci and noted the general rule that payment of taxes is insufficient to establish standing in cases against the government the purpose of the ofci was to ensure private and char itable community groups including religious ones the fullest opportunity permitted by law to compete on level playing field so long as they achieve valid public purposes64 the challenge in the case claimed that conferences organized by the ofci promoted religious groups over secular groups alito explained the underlying prin ciples of the courts standing doctrine federal courts are not empowered to seek out and strike down any governmental act that they deem to be repugnant to the constitution and may only decide on the rights of individuals65 the court has consistently held that taxpayer claims regarding federal spending ar too indeterminable remote uncertain and indirect to allow courts to validly consider the merits of the case under standing doctrines66 the flast exception alito noted was created as narrow exception to standing requirements in previous case the court had ruled that flast limited taxpayer standing to challenges directed only at exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause67 according to the plurality in hein if expenditures are not specifically authorized or required by congressional action challenge to such expenditures is not directed at an exercise of congressional power and thus lacks the requisite logical nexus between taxpay er status and the type of legislative enactment attacked68 when general appropriation is made to an executive branch agency the disbursement of those funds by the agency is considered an administrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to agency discretion and thus not eligible for review by the judicial branch69 justice alito noted that in declining to extend flast to encompass discretionary executive branch expenditures the court recognized that flast has been confined to its facts for fourhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34223crs13 70 id at 2568 71 id at 2569 72 id at 257374 scalia clearly preferred the latter opti on finding that flast is wholly irreconcilable with the article iii restrictions on federalcourt jurisdicti on id at 2574 73 id at 2579 74 id at 2581 75 id at 2584 76 id at 2586decades70 alito explained that because almost all executive branch activity is ultimately f unded by some congressional appropriation extending the flast exception to purely executive expenditures would effectively subject every federal action to establishment clause challeng by any taxpayer in federal court71 alito suggested that such decision would esse ntially open the floodgates of litigation and that democratic power woul d be undermined if taxpayer s could assert their political grievances in the courts rather than through the political process justices scalia and thomas concurred in the judgment but wrote separately regarding flast agreeing with the plurality on the need for limits on taxpayer standing justice scalia noted his preference that the court reevaluate the validity of the flast exception altogether scalia be lieved that the court should choose between two options apply flast to all challenges to expenditures alleged to violate constitutional provisions that limit the taxing and spending power or reject flast entirely72 he argued that there is intellectual justification for the distinction that the plurality drew between expenditures that are expressly authorized by congress and those that come from ge neral executive branch appropriations73 scalia noted that he shares the dissents bewild erment as to why the plurality fixates on the amount of additional discretion the ex ecutive branch enjoys beyond the only discretion relevant to the establishment clause issue whether to spend taxpayer funds for purpose that is unconstitutional74 because the exception illogically justifies standing in some but not all executive branch spending cases the concurring justices would have denied standing in this case the dissent in hein souter stevens ginsburg and breyer criticized the distinction made by the plurality in recognizing standing only for expenditures expressly authorized by congress justi ce souter objected that with basis for this distinction in either logic or preced ent the plurality closes the door on these taxpayers because the executive branch and not the legislative branch caused their injury75 the dissent rejected the argument that executive spending should be given lesser level of judicial review than legislative spending noting that if the executive could accomplish through the exercise of discretion exactly what congress cannot do through legislation establishm ent clause protection would melt away76httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34223crs14 77 locke 540 us at 719conclusion this survey of supreme court opinions illustrates the challenges the court faces in religion cases arising under the first amendment in newdow and hein the court upheld standing requireme nts to bar establishment clause claims in mccreary and van orden the court provided clear illustration that context matters in questions of religious displays on gove rnment property deciding two cases challenging ten commandments displays on courthouse prope rty differently the court considered factors such as the length size and placement of the display the degree of controversy the display created and the general purpose for which the display was createdall very fact specific inquiries cutter and gonzales further illustrate the emphasis that the court appears to place on the importance of facts in its churchstate decisions cutter while allowing states to accommodate individuals religious needs without establishing religion also allows states to make determinations that accommodations are inappropriate either for constitutionality or for safety purposes gonzales allowing the challenging church to continue its sacramental use of an illegal substance allows the government to prohibit such use provided the limitation is not broadly sweeping one that ignores the particular aspects of the specific drug and its usage the courts decision in locke was made in what it termed room for play in the joints phrase the court used to refer to the gray area where the establishment clause and free exercise clause occasionally intersect77 in balancing the two clauses the court determined that free exercise may not necessarily be infringed when the state is enforcing its own constitutions strict antiestablishment provision in conclusion in the cases that the c ourt has considered the balance between nonestablishment and free exercise continue s to be debated on casebycase basis the court has decided somewhat similar cases differently with the outcome turning on the details implying that specific context may be the most determinative factor in churchstate jurisprudence
