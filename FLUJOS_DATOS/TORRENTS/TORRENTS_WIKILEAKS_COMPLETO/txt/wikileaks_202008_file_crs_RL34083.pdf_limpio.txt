craig k elwell government and finance division july 10 2007 abstract the euro is seen by some as poised to challenge the dollar in the store of value function of reserve currency the sheer magnitude of dollar assets in the oﬃcial reserves of foreign central banks and the realistic prospect of continued and perhaps disorderly depreciation of the dollar against most currencies place central banks at considerable risk of incurring large capital losses on their dollar asset holding with more than enough dollar reserves to meet liquidity needs prudent asset management would seem to dictate some

currency assets have risen sharply in recent years these official holdings have nearly tripled since 1999 to reach 5 trillion by the end of 2006 nearly 3 trillion has been amassed by developing asia and japan china in particular now has official reserves that exceed 1 trillion in addition the oilexporting countries have increased their official reserves by about 700 billion the dollars status as the dominant international currency has meant that as much 70 of this large accumulation of official reserves are of some form of dollar asset there are significant advantages for the united states in having the dominant reserve currency these advantages include reduced exchange rate risk and lower borrowing costs however these large accumulations of dollar assets in foreign official holdings also means that foreign central banks have become important participants in and influences on us financial markets and the wider us economy four factorsshare of world output and trade macroeconomic stability degree of financial market development and network externalitiescombine to influence the choice of reserve currency the euro has improved its standing in all four areas but the dollar retains significant advantages available data show only modest diversification from dollar assets by foreign central banks from the time of the euros introduction in 1999 through the end of 2006 the dollars share of total official reserves rose through the 1990s reaching peak value of about 72 global reserves in 2001 by 2003 that share fell to about 66 and remained near that level through 2006 the euros share of global official reserves rose from about 18 in 1999 to 25 in 2003 but has remained near this level through 2006 looking to the future the dollars status as the dominant reserve currency may be challenged by the euro because it increasingly offers many of the advantages of the dollar but fewer of the risks the dollars most important advantage is the size quality and stability of dollar asset markets particularly the shortterm government securities market where central banks tend to be most active the high liquidity of these financial markets makes the dollar an excellent medium of exchange further advantage is the power of incumbency conferred by the networkexternalities that accrue to the currency that is dominant together these factors make it unlikely there will be large or abrupt change in the dollars reserve currency status however the euro is seen by some as poised to challenge the dollar in the store of value function of reserve currency the sheer magnitude of dollar assets in the official reserves of foreign central banks and the realistic prospect of continued and perhaps disorderly depreciation of the dollar against most currencies place central banks at considerable risk of incurring large capital losses on their dollar asset holding with more than enough dollar reserves to meet liquidity needs prudent asset management would seem to dictate some

by the end of 2006 these large accumulations of reserves have been concentrated among countries with large global current account surpluses nearly 3 trillion has been amassed by developing asia and japan china in particular now has official reserves that exceed 1 trillion in addition the oilexporting countries have increased their official reserves by about 700 billion 1 the dollars status as the dominant international currency has meant that as much as 70 of this large accumulation of official reserves is held in some form of dollar asset the us treasury reports that through mid2005 34 of the more than 3 trillion outstanding marketable treasury securities was being held in foreign official reserves all foreign holdings official and private amount to 52 of all outstanding treasury securities 2 these large accumulations of dollar assets in foreign official holdings mean that foreign cen tral banks have become important participants in us financial markets as well as in the wider us economy3 for the united states there are significant benefits to being the worlds reserve currency central banks demand for the reserve currency tends not to be as volatile as that of private investors this stabilizes the demand for dollars and reduces the foreign exchange risk faced by us companies in their international transactions exchange rate risk is also reduced because the united states borrows in its own currency so that the appreciation of foreign currencies against the dollar cannot increase debt service cost or raise default risk another major benefit of being the primary international reserve currency is that it enables the united states to borrow abroad at lower cost then it otherwise could this cost advantage occurs because there will be willingness of foreign central banks to pay liquidity premium to hold dollar assets also the dollars status as the worlds reserve currency raises the likelihood of foreigners using us asset markets this added foreign involvement increases the breadth and depth of these markets which then tends to attract even more investors which then continually magnifies the benefits of being the reserve currency since 2003 sharply rising capital inflows from foreign central banks have financed on average about 50 of the us current account deficit increasing the sustainability of the trade deficit by compensating for sizable weakening of private capital inflows 4 it is estimated that these recent 1 international monetary fund global financial stability report world economic and financial surveys april 2007 pp 7476

from 05 to 10 percentage points lower than otherwise5 historically single currency has been the dominant reserve currency in the 19th century sterling played this role succeeded by the dollar in the 20th century as the 21st century has begun to unfold the dollar has remained the dominant international currency but the euro created in 1999 as part of the european monetary union emu has been seen by some economists as potential challenger to the dollars dominant position as an international currency in the 21 st century6 to the degree that the euro displaces the dollar in the official holdings of central banks the benefits to the united states of the dollar as reserve currency will be reduced the viability of the euro as substitute for the dollar will hinge on several factors that determine how well it can perform the necessary roles of reserve currency for central bank g22g145g142g561g20g152g149g142g156g561g152g143g561g138g561g20g142g156g142g155g159g142g561g5g158g155g155g142g151g140g162g561 an international currency is one used by nonresidents to accomplish the three standard roles of any currency be medium of exchange unit of value and store of value however for central banks these three roles serve different needs than those of the private investor the medium of exchange function serves the need for foreign exchange intervention as central banks attempt to counter unwelcome changes in the value of their domestic currency caused by private inflows and outflows of capital the store of value function serves the need for reserve accumulation as self insurance against periodic balance of payments crisis and as public demonstration of commitment to exchange rate stability the unit of account function serves the need of some countries for monetary anchor to bolster domestic monetary policy in combating inflation typically the currency used as the medium of exchange will also serve as the main store of value also because of the large scale of recent reserve holdings some central banks may turn more attention to the currencys ability to also provide the store of value function of concern to private investorssteadiness of asset value and rate of return the already large holdings of dollar assets and the prospect of continued depreciation of the dollars exchange rate are likely to be seen by foreign central banks as major disincentives for using dollars as their principal reserve currency in contrast the appreciation of the euro exchange rate and the substantial increase in the liquidity of the euro caused by the improvement in the breath and depth of euro financial markets since 1999 raises the attractiveness of the euro as reserve currency 5 see mathew higgens and thomas klitgaard reserve accumulation implications for global capital flows federal reserve bank of new york current issues in economics and finance vol 10 10

g5g158g155g155g142g151g140g162g561 economists have identified four factors that will jointly influence how well currency can serve central banks as medium of exchange as store of value and as unit of account first the larger countrys share of world output and trade the more likely it is that other countries will use it as monetary anchor or in external transactions this factor tends to raise the likelihood that other countries will hold liabilities denominated in its currency and therefore tends to also hold more of its assets in the same currency the euro is probably not at any sizable disadvantage relative to the dollar in this category second macroeconomic stability particularly price stability is needed to establish confidence in the currencys value without this confidence currencys ability to play its role as unit of account and as store of value is undermined the dollars status in this category may be eroded by the prospect of longterm exchange rate depreciation third high degree of financial market development offering large size and high liquidity makes it more likely that countrys currency will be used by foreign central banks as the medium of exchange for currency intervention also broad and deep financial sector tends to reinforce overall economic stability in this area the dollar has been singularly attractive but the development of euro area financial markets has advanced steadily since its 1999 introduction fourth network externalities create selfgenerating demand for dominant currency the more often currency is used as medium of exchange the more liquid it becomes and the lower are the costs of transacting in it leading in turn to it becoming even more attractive to new users network externalities create tendency toward having one dominant currency and confer substantial incumbency advantage to the dollar over the euro 7 none of these influences on the choice of reserve currency is likely to change quickly acting to make any shift in the status of the dominant reserve currency slow process with substantial changes most often emerging over decades8

shortterm and longterm government securities and other claims usable to meet balance of payments needs however cofer data do not include the holdings of curr ency by the issuing country also the cofer data only provides national currency specific information for about 70 of total global reserves because the reserves of many emerging economies are missing from the tally despite these limitations the cofer data will most likely reveal basic trends in holdings of the dollar and euro in global official reserves the cofer data show only modest diversification from dollar assets by foreign central banks from the time of the euros introduction in 1999 through the end of 2006 the dollars share of total official reserves was at its lowest point in the early 1990s at about 45 through the 1990s that share rose in large measure because of accumulation of dollar reserves by emerging economies reaching peak value of about 72 global reserves in 2001 by 2003 that share fell to about 66 and has remained near this level through 2006 the euros share of global official reserves rose from about 18 in 1999 to 25 in 2003 but has remained near this level through 2006 again the source of much of the change in both the level of official reserves and their distribution among currencies was central banks in developing countries accounting for 58 of the growth of total foreign exchange holdings in this period and also decreasing their share of dollar holdings from 70 to 60 and increasing their share of euro holdings from 19 to 30 in contrast among industrial economies the dollar share of holdings held steady and the share of euro holdings increased modestly another interesting change in the 19992006 period was fall in the share of yen assets in official reserves down from 6 to 3 and rise in the share of pounds sterling up from 27 to 44 this relatively small increase in the international status of the pound may be insignificant by itself but could very significant for the status of the euro if the united kingdom were to join the emu g7g158g155g152g561g159g156g495g561g6g152g149g149g138g155g561 in the framework of the three functions of reserve currency being medium of exchange

most recent triennial survey of foreign exchange and derivatives markets shows that on april of 2004 the euro entered on oneside of 37 of all foreign exchange transactions the dollars share of transactions on foreign exchange markets fell from 94 in 1998 to 89 in 200411 in asset markets central banks invest in instruments with limited risk making conditions in the countrys government security markets the most relevant for the choice of an intervention currency the attractiveness of the euro has been increased by the formation of the emu creating the worlds second largest government securities market in 2005 the outstanding stock of government securities of the several euro area governments totaled 47 trillion this compares to 42 trillion of outstanding us treasury securities suggesting that more than size may matter the largest government securities market is japan but the holding of yendenominated reserves has declined in recent years despite the greater size and rising attractiveness of the euro areas government securities market the us treasury market has several advantages that continue to enhance its attractiveness to foreign central banks first the shortterm segment of the us treasury market composed of about 950 billion us treasury bills with terms of three months to one year is about twice as large as the euro area counterpart treasury bills are low risk and highly liquid instrument that are well suited to the reserve currency needs of central banks second us treasury securities have single issuer and the euro area has twelve the several issuers of euro assets are not of uniform credit worthiness us treasury securities carry aaa credit rating but some euro area economies government securities have lower credit rating third the us treasury market appears to offer far greater liquidity than the euro area government securities markets one indicator of this is daily turnover in us government securities markets of nearly 500 billion japan is second largest at 150 billion per day turnover is an indicator of how easily market can absorb large transactions without changing the assets price the superior small bidask spreads found in the us government securities market are further evidence of their very high liquidity g3g156g561g138g561g23g151g146g157g561g152g143g561g3g140g140g152g158g151g157g561 in official use this role is largely linked to the selection of an exchange rate as monetary anchor in recent years the euro has increased in importance in fulfilling this role in 2004 the imf reported that out of 150 pegged currencies 40 used the euro as an anchor currency however because of incomplete reporting this type of tally may understate the true degree of attachment gravitational pullof one currency to another an alternative approach is to examine the actual comovements of currencies to determine how closely currencys track the euro and the dollar this currency sensitivity evidence suggests that the euros gravitational importance is rising european countries outside of the emu such as switzerland sweden norway as well as eastern nd central europe move very closely with the euro in latin america as well there is evidence of the increasing gravitational pull of the euro particularly in brazil and chile one other very notable change has been for the traditional dollar 11 bis central bank survey of

from onehalf to two thirds of the euros movement in contrast the currencies of emerging economies in asia generally follow the dollar quite closely thus while the dollar is still the most important currency as monetary anchor the euro has become viable international competitor to the dollar in its role as unit of account for central banks however some caution in judging the degree of convergence is called for because the depreciation of the dollar since 2002 makes it difficult to separate temporary changes from permanent changes have central banks moved away from the dollar as monetary anchor only until the dollar stabilizes again or has the structure of demand for the currency changed permanently g3g156g561g138g561g21g157g152g155g142g561g152g143g561g24g138g149g158g142g561 the critical criterion for currency to be good store of value is the ability to maintain real purchasing power over time that ability will be closely tied to country pursuing stable and sustainable macroeconomic policies although the united states has in recent years consistently maintained vigorous economic growth and relatively low inflation large current account deficits and the prospect of substantial and perhaps disorderly depreciation of the dollars exchange value may erode the dollars ability to serve as an international store of value since early 2002 the dollar has fallen in value by about 30 or about 5 per year that depreciation more or less erases any positive yield on treasury securities held by foreign central banks the bilateral comparison shows even greater depreciation against certain currencies with the dollar down 11 against the euro in 2006 alone the ultrahigh liquidity of us asset markets has perhaps provided sufficient advantage to compensate for the eroding effect of the depreciating dollar on the rate of return on dollar assets but because the large scale of worldwide official holding seems to exceed the amount needed for intervention purposes central banks may begin to focus more on expected rate of return and less on liquidity in managing their holdings nominal rates of return have been generally higher on dollar assets than euro assets however expected depreciation of the dollar relative to the euro likely erases this advantage therefore with the steady growth in the depth and breadth of euro area asset markets providing investment alternatives to the dollar there is likely to be rising incentive for central banks to use greater share of the more stable euro to meet their store of value objectives however diversification away from the dollar by central banks may be constrained by the need to maintain balance between the currency composition of their assets and its countries external liabilities because many countries borrow in dollars assetliability currency balance particularly for emerging economies tends to reduce the prospect for balance sheet mismatches in times of crisis and improves the foreign investors evaluation of the countrys credit worthiness data for emerging market economies for the 20032005 period show the dollars share of external liabilities to be about 66 and its share of reserves assets to be only 59 in contrast the euros share of external liabilities was 24 and share of reserves was 31 therefore by this criterion the dollar is under represented in official reserves and the euro is over represented in addition it is possible to diversify across asset types within particular currency so as to improve likely risk adjusted returns there has been an increase in foreign official holdings of us agency bonds particularly mortgage backed securities issued by fannie mae and freddie

typically conservative investment behavior of most central banks there is likely only limited scope for this type of diversification g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the dollars status as the dominant reserve currency may be challenged by the euro because it increasingly offers many of the advantages of the dollar but fewer of the risks nevertheless the dollar retains significant advantages the most important advantage is the size quality and stability of dollar asset markets particularly the shortterm government securities market where central banks tend to be most active the high liquidity of these financial markets makes the dollar an excellent medium of exchange for foreign central banks further advantage is the power of incumbency conferred by the important network externalities that accrue to the currency that is currently dominant together these factors make it unlikely there will be large or abrupt change in the dollars reserve currency status however the euro does seem poised to challenge the dollar in the store of value function of reserve currency the sheer magnitude of dollar assets in the official reserves of foreign central banks and the prospect of continued sizable and perhaps disorderly depreciation of the dollar against most currencies places central banks at considerable risk of incurring large capital losses on their dollar asset holding with more than enough dollar reserves to meet liquidity needs prudent asset management would seem to dictate some diversification away from the dollar and toward the euro any sizable weakening in the demand for dollar assets by foreign central banks would tend to push down their price and push up us interest rates this can be expected to have dampening effect on interest sensitive activities such as business investment housing and consumer durables on the other hand the selling off of dollar assets would tend to depreciate the dollars exchange rate and provide boost to exchange rate sensitive activities of exporting and import competing industries from the standpoint of the global economy the efficiency advantages of primarily using dollar reserves may be offset by the enhanced stability of more diversified official holdings 12 g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 craig k elwell specialist in macroeconomic policy
