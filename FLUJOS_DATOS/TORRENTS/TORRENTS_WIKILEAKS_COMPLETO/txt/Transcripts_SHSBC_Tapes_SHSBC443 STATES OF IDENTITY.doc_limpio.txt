states of identity lecture given on 8 september 1966 thank you thank you whats the date audience eighth of september 1966 eighth of september ad 16 and what did you say it was she forgets i have hypersonic ot perception now you know well it just shows you it just shows you this has been quite rush getting down here ive put in two research sessions and administration and half dozen other things i even had moment to eat im still eating unfortunately ive more or less knocked off sleepingthat seems to be waste of time i put the body in bed but nothing happened butand here i am ready to give you lecture without any slightest idea of what to talk to you about and its been very bad week on the clearing course we only made one clearnot been done in the history of the universe but we did one anyway theres clearlooking clean very good very good not that the other clears dont look clean well id better talk to you today about states ofi hesitate to say beingness because we go below that statestates of identity i suppose the presence or dim consciousness or wiggleness that passes for life i dont know that youve ever had clarificationhad clarification of these because the truth of the matter is that thethere is boundary apparently when you dont have thetans but have endowment and there are living wiggles which have endowment without any thetan present apparently now i wasnt particularly talking about psychiatrists you know they arent even endowed but anyway now the amoeba and the monocell and the cellular form is apparently an endowed thing ot comes along and says let there be chicken you know thats about where all that fit and he endows this and he leaves sort of puddle of theta to continue to animate it you see does few quick tricks with theyou cant say fingers and you get an endowment and that apparently is the way which you get cells that isnt factual from standpoint of experience or anything like that i dont mean that theres data available here by which weve suddenly animated matter but it more or less is conceptual basis on which bodies are built and somebody mocks it up and somebody else can keep it running but there is something to this old gag of they say they go out and say hello to the flowers you know and they grow better well at very very low state that would not be possible of course person isnt able to reach that fan but they sort of have dim idea that they could do it you see because way way back someplace they probably did so they go out and say hello to the flowers now every once in while you get some gardener who when he says hello to the flowers they really do go boom you see green thetan you know but youll find as one comes down scale that certain abilities tend to be retained and certain fantastic abilities are occasionally exhibited like poltergeist and such things and less person than jung was so troubled with poltergeists that he couldnt explain that it got him into psychoanalysis and then because psychoanalysis couldnt explain why bookcases and so forth went bust in his vicinity you know clocks would split down the middle and bureaus would blow up and other weird things would happen in his immediate vicinity and he knew something was doing it and psychoanalysis couldnt solve this for him so he squirreled and you have jungian analysis and so on he didnt solve it either but he did by the way if i remember rightly go into past lives but he only went into one strata of past lifedruidism here in england and he was great believer in this sort of thing but here is an isolated thetan ability you see is being able to affect matter in his immediate vicinity longer under his control but still manifesting now youll have somebody i suppose who is geewhizzer telepathically hes all gone to pieces and he blubbers soup down his vest but hes telepathic geewhizzer you know when he thinks x why boy they get x you know then you getyou get various abilities then tend to remain intact or not particularly blunted and also you could say that anything that is wrong with thetan is the lower harmonic of what he can do up at the upper scale when that goes wrong his ability in it becomes sort of inverse you know andor it goes out of his control and still happens in his vicinity like jung and puzzles the living daylights out of him but its just little tiny facet of his ability which has been brought down scale with him and this one hasnt been eaten up yet every once in while you see little kid he sits down at the piano and plays brahms well all right thats very easy to invalidate because the kid doesnt know hes doing it so you see these boy wonders and that sort of thing tend to fold up in their very very early life they are playing with the chicago philharmonic and the next thing you know why they couldnt play with the local kindergarten ping pan orchestra see because its not under their control but it is an ability hes had musical ability hes carried it along with him and it hasnt totally faded out and he probably has been very expert and excellent musician in the very near past but this ability isnt gone but you start chopping him up on it or asking this burning suppressive question now how do you do that you know and he starts maybe taking over his automaticity that is unconscious action and he all of sudden goes poof and he doesnt know one end of the piano from the other i have personal experience with this when i had cousin who did just that and was playing his own compositions with the chicago philharmonic when he was nine years old hes gone over the jumps and he studied the hard way and hes now very good jazz musician but he managed to sort of take over the automaticity and come through it somehow very often they just go up in smoke now closer acquaintance knowing this and one of the things when you know data of this particular character you can handle situations like this when they turn up dianas always able to sit down to piano and sound like combination of debussy and mozart and paderewski all wound up in one you know doesnt know what shes playing every once in while she playscomposes one of her own compositions and you sit there and listen to paderewski you know but they were at her to point where they were forcing her to read music well of course the music that they were forcing her to learn how to read was not the music she knew how to read music has changed over period of the past and she was very cross about all this and she refused to learn how to read music she refused to learn anything about music and i finally kidded her along and eased her along and said it wasnt important to learn you see and took the tension off of the thing and she finally did learn how to read music and play some music and she can still sound like paderewski you get the idea so if you know whats happening if youve got some idea of whats happeningnow youve probably yourself had the experience of accomplishing something roughrather my god how did i do that you know suddenly surprise yourself by doing something or other and you sort of caught your left hand out of your pocket you know and hastily put it back but these do not makethat phenomena does not make state of case because it can occur at any point in thein state of beingness down to where there is life at all there is merelyi mean its endowed life thetan see thats liable to occur anyplace so you can find that in an insane asylum and you can find it amongst normals the states of beingness you can find it amongst geniuses and it doesnt necessarily make genius you can find it on the upper scale but when you start into the upper scale its started to come under somebodys control and for little while youre liable not to get it as spectacular youif you were geewhizzer onwith longbow as you go up scale dont be at all surprised if one day you pick up the longbow and you say whats this thing and point the arrow at your chest you know and get all greasefingered with the whole thing we had an expert archer do this over in the united states he was actually i think national or international champion ive forgotten which and they were running him on spotting spots in space and all of suddenthe next time he went out on the archery range all of sudden he was standing there with six arrows watching six arrows go simultaneously and he couldnt do anything about it at all but he came through this they flattened the process and he got back his skill but this can happen this can happen that skill that youre very fond of but dont know how youve got it can suddenly go up in smoke and all you have to doall you have to do if its in the process of getting clear something like that well be patient you will get to point where you can do it but this time it is you that can do it now if we exemptif we exempt then endowed states of wiggle if we exempt that then we get down how far down can thetan go well someplace in the insect or animal kingdom someplace in there below that you have wiggle and above that you have thetans now i every once in while run into horse for instance who is being and you every now and then run into horse who isnt you get it and once in while i suppose youd run into bee who was and bee who wasnt you get the idea theres boundary there now when nothing much is required of the animal or insecthe doesnt have to be very smart do you see but just kind of has to do what he sees other things doing or react in some wayyou can get survival as just piece of automatic machinery its unchanging in its habit pattern and so forth and it actually is piece of automatic machinery that is some kind apparently of shadow of thetan because thetan made it do you see he knows how it ought to work so he made it now where that boundary is is again great interest to us but you occasionally find it in the human race and this is great baffler you get some vegetables around and by golly people worry themselves silly now once in while you get very spectacular change in vegetable because some thetan without home picks it up do you see bodya body can live you see in the absence of thetan that is the test of the thing doesnt do well but it can live but when it has been totally totally totally guided by thetan and then the thetan is longer there it of course is not on any automatic pattern that it will go on and function do you see so the unknown or involuntary ori think its voluntaryactions of the body the muscular actions and organ functions and that sort of thinga thetan in actual fact doesnt have anything to do with those thats built function that is going on and it develops its sort of like you build fire and you make the fire bigger you know and it can grow and it goes certain period of time and it does this and that therefore it is very remarkable to hear the human race adjudicating whether or not something works as to whether or not it does something for the body it frankly has very little to do with the being you see the being can cave body in and to the degree that being has caved body in then the body will not do well see if the being the thetan who has got ahold of this body is also caving the body in then the body wont do well but it will only get as good as you take away his caving it in now its commentary on the human body that the mammal has greater life span that is six times the rate of growthsix times the rate of growth is the usual mammalis the span of its life in other words if it took it twenty years to grow up and it attained full growth why then it would be 120 years old the time it kicked the bucket that is the factor which exists in the animal kingdom and it does not exist in man well it takes manman should go i think to something like 110 or 120 or 130 years old and he doesnt he quite commonly kicks the bucket at 50 of course were living in highly specialized period just now where i think theyve got life expectancy on an overall average up to 59 or something of this sort but and lot of it goes to 70 and so on but thats short now the reason for thatyou see theres good and bad sides to coins and the reason for that is because the human body is pretty uniformly driven by thetan except for the vegetable bits that you see in some institutions and so on now this is athis is remarkable thing that as society becomes more and more aberrated it becomes more sick and then if theif the thetans running the body become aberrated why then the body becomes very sick now quite in addition to that there is thing that you could say disease there are various things that upset the automatic or endowed cell there are various other automatic endowments that somebody has put around that will upset and influence the automatic endowments which have been set up do you follow just as one type of insect is designed to eat another type of insect so that you can have an endowed cell that is designed to eat other endowed cells do you follow so that it shouldnt worry anybody that you cure up thetan and the body does not get well you see now youve got variety of choices here youve got the illnesses that the body suffers from because it is being messed up by thetan whose intention and aberration is influencing his physical body see but thats only part of the picture now that body will get as well as you relieve the aberration of the thetan in those sectors and quarters where the thetan was causing the body to get sick do you understand that all right now therefore you should not approach the subject of healing on the idea that all thats wrong with the body is the beingness or the mind do you see that isnt all thats wrong with body and you can get very very very optimistic about what you can do but after you see few miracles why then you can get optimistic and you begin to believe that you could heal everything from psychosomatic basis theres this entirely different segment there is theyou might say endowed life units which are designedly contrary to the bodys life units and we could call that oh lots of things call it disease they call it germs we could call it this or we could call it that and then there is physicalphysical injury you hit body with battering ram and it doesnt much matter what state of existence the thetan is in the body is going to go splash do you see now if body is badly guided you get it getting smashed often so you can fix up somebody to point where he doesnt have many accidents but to say that he isnt going to have any says he must be therefore living in totally cleared environment and i havent noticed that on this planet do you see now if he were good enough and if he were an ot after the body went splat he could mock up another body in its place or repair it now youve got another factor involved youve got the repairing ability of the being now heres new element which has entered in see this isnt quite the simple picture of all you have to do is run the engram and instantly why the guy will grow two heads you see that wont happen in all cases you getyou get state then where somebody is actively knocking apart body why that body is going to be knocked apart and when you relieve his aberration then the body will come back to battery you seeitll come back to the point that it could come back to by itself if somebody stopped knocking it apart do you see thats how well he can get now wed have to go up scale from that and wed get somebody who could put body back together again so that would be then an entirely different proposition than bodies being bodies so this divides then into three sections of attack upon body which is endowed life attacking the endowed life of the body you know cell versus cell you know and then the aberration of the thetan who is the driver or the runner of the body influencing the body and of course you get then thetan who would be in terrifically good shape able to more or less patch the body back up or affect or directly influence the body youd get those three stages with regard to illness and of course accidentthe more aberrated person is well the more accidents hell get into but to expect zero accident level would be quite impossible so there are certain thingsagain counterdevelopment you know endowed life unitswhich can influence endowed life units and selectively this can be worked out so that you can get something like penicillin which influences disease germ see but you can also get some cillins that dont affect the disease germ but just knock the guy off every once in while they find somebody whos allergic to penicillin well whats happened there is the endowed life form of the body is being attacked not the germ which is attacking it now here is in actual fact an endowed life form such as mold from which penicillin is made attacking an endowed life form which we call germ to prevent it from attacking an endowed life form the cell of the body now thats sphere of healing and then there is physical damage and physical injury and that is repaired by surgery and surgery really isnt able to repair very much very permanently by cutting out endowed life forms that attack the endowed life but were getting into ayou know i mean theyre like tumor something like that they go just so far with these things they can attack nonmalignant forms but once they start whittling on somebody you know they get too enthusiastic you see your guyyour guy with the syringe hes in there and he tells you that that syringe can cure anything see hes on an all basis and the fellow thats going around there sharpening up his knife and whittling why i dont know if they use hones in surgeries now but probably do knives must get pretty dull theyre always trying to be sure lets take little more to be sure and thisthese birdsthese birds theyre going into neurosurgery and they think that if they cut up somebodys brains hell cease to be aberrated you see theyre adrift they do have sphere where they can demonstrate their ability they do have this sphere they can operate on somebody and take bullet out they can operate on somebody they can reset leg they can even cut out nonmalignant tumor something like this and salvage somebody this is reason why they can cure human aberration or disease germs with knife see but theyll tell you they can now dont you fall into the error then of believing all youve got to do is process out beings aberration and you will instantly then have total recovery that doesnt need any surgery and doesnt need any penicillin because youd look just as silly as the neurosurgeon trying to operate on somebodys skull to cure his fear of spiders when in actual factactual fact why hes scared of spiders because hes got an automatic spider mockerupper and it mocks up spiders for him thats all you could run that out dont you see so here are in actual fact various zones of operation and as long as youre not able to endow matter with life then you have to settle for what youve gotwhich is to say the body with which you are livingor do without one both of these by the way are not illogical and not difficult and when im shrugging into jacket and so forth i generally have long sigh over the idea of having to put jacket on this seems to be rather peculiar and so on its much easier to put jacket on an effigy you know something like that and let the valet dust off the effigy and so forth and after while youve got to go someplace and they come by and pick up the effigy properly dressed for the occasion but you see the fact that there are other states of beingness and other things that can occur you get variation of what can be wrong with beings or with bodies and you have to study it outwhat are you looking at and the way to separate it outare you looking at two endowed life forms countering each other or are you looking at pure mechanical injury you know guy broke his leg or are you looking at something the thetan is doing to the body and in the last sphere youre just little bit kingpin youre just little bit better off than the other two theyre needed in quick emergencies but the truth of the matter is the thetan is particularly with service facsimile in place is quite capable of preventing body from recovering so you could operate as an adjunct to the befores and afters of these other two facts in other words the endowed life form curing it and sorting those out and accident and injury you could come in before the fact and fix the fellow up so he wasnt so caved in he was in pretty healthy condition so he really didnt get attacked by the counterendowed form see or you could cs him up so he didnt have accidents you could betteryou could better the percentages on this and you could come along after the fact and take away the traumatic or mental image picture result of having had an accident or an illness and speed up ms healing to the degree that he as thetan was preventing it from happening do you see so you can come before and after this fact and your only mistake is to come in it you can make mistake you see this guy is out there bleeding from the femoral artery and you start running the engram of the accident hes going to run out of blood awful quick and youre not going to be able to get the engram out and get him up to ot before he bleeds to death do you see now the truth of the matter is if there were time involved in the thing yes injured you could probably process him all the way up it would take him year or two or three and you get him processed all the way up to ot where he could mock up another body but youre going to do that anyway so why not put tourniquet on him in the first place you see these considerationsthese considerations stem from the fact that beings do tend to an allness they do tend to an allness they believe thatyoull find somebody hes sold on some kind of cough medicine you know and this medicine will cure anything hes just the greatest cure anythinger man is that you ever heard of you know you give him sponge and say this has magic properties because once it had holy water squeezed out of it and he goes running around and he says hell cure anything with it you think this is ayou think this is joke but it isnt joke actually that was the state of healing on this planet for almost thousand years they had saints knucklebone and that would cure anything from fallen arches to wifelessness to anything under the sun and youd hear themyoud hear them in their places wondering how on earth they could get relichow they could get relic so that they could work enough miracles in the area to make christians out of people and it all depended on getting this relic well the allness is associated with the relic they fully expected that when they got that relic then they would be able to cure everything that happened anywhere in that community and this would set them up on top well of course they could cure anything that could be cured by restimulating the curative abilities of thetan if they existed so if you somehow or other by showing them knucklebone could make them suddenly realize that there was greater power available or something that could snap them back to battery every once in while youd have miracle you can have the same miracles and you get them about at the same frequency because its mental reaction that is causing the miracle its not the intervention of zeus from olympus or something now faith healing has tendency to restore one on one partwould have tendency to restore temporarily or momentarily the ability of the individual to do something with the body in other words youre playing with maybe an ot characteristic do you see and every once in while you get faith healer who comes walking down the road and he says zingobango or something of the sort and he has not lost the ability to endow things with life or change the life endowment in form you see but this is twoedge sword because every once in while when body was endowed by thetan when thetan b comes along and puts some anchor points in it or something like that it gets sicker if you dont believe it take your own body and start stuffing little stars around the eyes in place of the little stars you see there you see little tiny gold balls around the eyes if you look well just throw those out and put your own in and youre going to have yourself ball and just to complete the thing why throw yours away and get the other ones back and itll work all right im not now talking weirdlyi mean thats actually happened you can thetan can do that but anyway there are lot of things that man didnt know about beingness and life as consequence he makes fantastic mistakes and im just trying to ask you not to make the same mistakes there isnt any particular reason why you should feel yourselves bound in any way by the zones and areas of mans healing abilities youll exceed those but where youre thinking along this line why for heavens sake recognize man 5 limitations with regard to it recognize that they are not necessarily yours but that they are mans limitations with regard to this now this means that you have to have some understanding of states of beingness and when you have thetan who is very very very cavedin hes on reverse hes on reverse he isanything which he can do hes not doing but it is being done do you see that and that is modified by the fact that hes lost some of the abilities to have even that happen in other words he is the effect of his own cause totally unknowing totally gone see he wouldnt have clue he has ball of fire hit him in the stomach and he goes out right away and prays to the local tribal god because hes been afflicted well he has to go one awful long way up scale before he actually realizes that he hit himself in the stomach with that ball of fire and actually he has to go so far upjust dont minimize this distance because its the distance from wog to clear its long way so by estimating that reestimate how far down he can go well he can go an awful long way down he can go down to being the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of himself to try to explain it to somebody that he is doing all this himself and expect anything to happen beyond cavein you seehe is just completely beyond his ability to comprehend now when you get body which is animated by thetan as different than body which is simply endowed and somebody says co on and walk now you know hey it walks look it pretty cute joe huh bet you cant make one that good you go into fringe which is way below being oneself or being conscious one is sort of automatically awake you know and automatically existing responsibility for him either being alive awake alert or existing and then just below that it goes into unconsciousness and if you can imagine fellow going unconsciousness from fact that he isnt even clue that he is conscious and recognize theres state below that where he can be unconscious why youre getting down into the very lower dregs and to the upper strata of the human race anywayits the truth now that is what you are working with you are working with somebody who automatically goes unconscious from an automatic consciousness he hasnt clue of what he is he is removed something see he is an identity he is joe jones now he is body he is body you read mans textbooks and it says thinking is done by the brain you know its crazy he thinks hes the body he thinks he is better than endowed life and he is he can be picked up from that point quite remarkably he could be picked up rather rapidly as matter of fact to state of grade 0 and never sneer at that man thats quite distance now his ability to be alerthis ability to be alert at grade 0 is still not up to causative alertness or causative unalertness you see he isnt up to where hes saying now im going to be alert pang you know now im going to be unalert bong see he doesnt do that he finds himself awake today you see and he finds himself groggy today now whats the difference here what common denominator is there to his increase of beingness well he is less the effect of cause as he improves and if he were getting worse he would be more the effect of cause now thats not only his own cause but thats other causes around him now hes lessas he improves he is less the effect of causes and as he deteriorates and goes downhill why he becomes more and more and more the effect of causes and you will see person who is having an awful hard time whos getting down around the im brain you know worries himself silly he hears pin drop in keokuk you see and that pin has dropped in keokuk of course means that he is going to have an immediate assault upon his life because of course he is the effect of anything so therefore he is the effect of anything that occurs anyplace you get newspaper it says there is train wreck in poughkeepsie and the fellows down in south africa or something you see he isnt affected by this train wreck they dont even have the same companies or use the same equipment or anything else and hell sit there and worry about train wrecks you know because he might be the effect of train wrecks in other words hes likely to conceive himself to be the effect of anything that happens well now to safeguard himself he can go down scale from that point so that he doesnt worry anymore about it and sort of go into philosophy that he doesnt exist and isnt worth anything and so therefore it doesnt matter what he is the effect of because he isnt anything anyhow and somehow or another it wont happen maybe now he can go below that into faith see he can get down to point where i have an automatic regulator so i dont have to be alert in any way shape or form i have an automatic regulator of my destiny see and i dont have to be alert in any way shape or form about anything of any kind because something someplace is taking care of and if it werent i would be of course the effect of all these things so thats good thing that i have something someplace taking care of now individuals will mock this up for themselves i wasnt talking about religions particularly theyll mock up these things for themselves theyll mock up the god throgmagog thatll give him all kinds of advice and tell them what to do and all that sort of thing and they dont even know theyre mocking up throgmagog at this point however you have person who is totally irresponsible now when this person goes down scale when he goes down scale why hes got to release further responsibility for anything that happens to him and just sort of go numb and this is horrible place to go to because he now can become the subject of any number of automaticities and when they turn on then he is what we normally call insane see irresponsible but any kind of triggered automaticity might trigger him into almost anything see and the average of the human race is about quarter of an inch above that and thats why you dont have people in sudden overwhelming comprehension of what youre doing when you try to talk to them and youll find out that there are some people that will listen to you and some people wont well it is the state of beingness of the person that determines whether or not he will listen to you now this odd phenomenon occurs an individual asked to look at his mind as causative or even theeven as an effect gets into state of such terror or anxiety rather than to look into himself or recognize himself in any way at all that he instantly goes frenziedly mad just literally that see its hard to explain by keeping it in that frame of reference but supposing we were sitting around in an arena and they let in hungry maneating tiger and you said to joe sitting alongside of you who was never noted for his courageno long political background you knowand you said to joe now joe jump over the railing there and wrassle with him for while or put him back in his cage or something like this but jump over the railing there and have to do with this tiger and he would think you were joking at first but when you start forcing him to jump over the railing and youre going to throw him over the railing you would have rather terrified fighting snarling screaming individual who is liable to say most anything you get that state of mind all right when you tell joe aloysius suppressive to look at his mind youre producing exactly the same effect as telling him to jump over the rail and wrassle with maneating tiger it is so terrifying to him to look at breakfast this morning for fear of what he would find because he knows whats going to happen to him hes going to get his block knocked off see by accident one time he looked inside and hes never been sane since something like that you know and he just goes into yowwwwwww you have reporter youre nottheyre not arguing with you as to whether or not scientology works or doesnt work or is valid or isnt valid and theyre not trying to disprove it theyre not trying to disprove it so that people will think badly of it theres doubt in their mind whatsoever but what you could make them do things and it terrifies them and quite in addition to thisquite in addition to this why youre liable to he knows trigger him off in some way so that he will go mad thats what they talk to you all the time isnt it dangerousisnt it dangerous for people to look at their minds you know isnt it dangerous isnt itit is isnt it we have some psychiatrist that says it is tell it doesnt work and they think theyre proving themselves as public benefactors by discrediting it so people wont look at it and thus have to look at their minds and look at their beingness and look at their track and look at their yesterdays you follow but that completely aside from somebody else becoming more powerful is the thing which spurs that reaction you talk to somebody sometime youve had the experience you say oh well this thing called scientology and actually you can communicate better and so forth all you have to do is confront your life little bit and do something with the mind improve the mind slightly fellow looks at you and he just suddenly goes arghh well isnt that that terrible fellow hubbard and isnt that awful awful isnt it pretty awful i dont see why you do such thing why do you do such things isnt it true that you boil babies and eat them alive and so forth and argharghargharghhh hes terrible risk if you just said look at your mind look at your mind hell go into screaming fit now you see he is below being able to be the effect of anything even an automaticity so that when you bring him up scale the first thing he has to confront that he might possibly be the effect of thing called the mind and right away he goes spin and he actually goes bit insane those people are below the average level and are below the level of insanity if they came up scale theyd go mad you see but theyre walking around all right as long as theyre just in total automaticity as they walk through their daily lives they know they wont be insane and they take some tranquilizers and the doctors and so forth and theyre depending on somebody else and somehow or other theyll go through their lives i didnt go mad today you know now that is the being that tries to give you beating by criticizing you for helping your fellows you cant criticize anybody for trying to help his fellow man trying to help himself anybody who tries it is insane yes thats right theyre insane but thats why theyre insane theyre well below the level to be the effect of anything the good effect or bad effect anything is terrible effect see so they have to be an automatic thing which has an automatic effect actually theyre qingandaing with an endowed cell along about that point but because they can come up scale you in your presence can bring them up scale and when youre clear you will notice the phenomenon around you that every once in while youll be talking to somebody or just sitting and looking at somebody and guys body will start going all twitchy and vrrrrooom and hell start looking like corkscrew and youll ask your friend after the fellow leaves ifs too bad he has saint vitus dance well he never did that before in all his life do you see now youre up to the point where your ability to endow is on automatic now you start going on up toward ot and of course that comes under control but whats interesting here is that there was way up and road out but it normally would never have been pursued because philosophers are more or less thoughtful types and they are noted some of them formessiahs and so on are noted for going and getting themselves killed and martyred for their beliefs and so forth but very few philosophers actually stand up very strongly when the firing squad starts marching down the streets you know not even voltaire did he sort of talked reasonably but when you havewhen you have breakthrough like this its usually doorbedamned sort of breakthrough it isnt made in scholarly fashion it is made more or less as well to hell with it you know here goes nothing you know you have to have guy that will drive car 190 miles an hour if itll go that fast you know on rainy night thea person to follow up the line of scientology would have to be either tremendously reassured in very quiet environment for considerable period of time if he was terribly bad off you see im not now even talking about the insane im talking about more or less whats accepted as normal hed have to be calmed down pretty much and be in pretty good shape and then you could probably get him to confront something you see thats why you have failure going out here and selecting people for pcs you know but the percentage is not high but the percentage does exist and because it isnt high is reason you shouldnt do it see because it isnt high why dont let that make you cease to try youre in actual fact collecting on the planet the upper 10 percent of the upper 10 percent of the planet youre not collecting anything more than that now when youve got that when youve got the upper 10 percent of the upper 10 percent why then theres some possibility that you could insert enough influence on the environment possibility but an understatement horrible understatementwhereby you could calm the environment down so that people would disenturbulate to point where they could more easily confront do you see and there is the secret you never want to treat the insane the insane should have nice quiet courtyard to sit in with still object in it someplace and be fed regularly with nobody worrying them at all for quite period of time youd find out that there is cure for the insane there is cure for it you can however get the guy todown to his level of confront what can he confront he can confront being still in still environment he can confront one solid stable object or something like this in his environment and you can then let him destimulate disenturbulate and he will go sane on you see theres nonot even any reason to work at it reason to work at it at all now to throw him through the engram that makes him insane well he hasnt got an engram that makes him insane he can very often run engrams and that sort of thing but he doesnt have engrams that make him insane do you understand he is insane because his ability to confront the environment in his immediate vicinity is so low that he could never possibly take his mind off of his environment long enough to let his mindtoo dangerous now just as your superscreaming suppressive screams when you tell him to confront his mind the psychotic screams when you tell him to confront the environment now youve had possibly successes with cases that were erroneously pronounced insane some guy was just little bit daffy or he was just little bit tired or he was just screaming slightly more than the average human and you snapped him back to battery and it was all very miraculous reason why processing is any answer to the insane at all very very calm quiet environment with nobody bothering them at all particularly psychiatrists not bothering them where the guy feels totally safe would undoubtedly permit him to destimulate to point where he would then be sane how long hed be sane thats something else how crazy is the environment you move him from there out to how gradual do you move him what gradient do you use in taking him from total stillness to little bit of motion insanity is study in environments not study in the mind now when you get the fellow up there so that he passes for sane now he could confront some tiny little gradient of his mind possibly if your gradient was small enough and then you would get into the field of the mind do you understand now if you look over these fields of beingness you wont get into so many arguments or get your expectancies up or become puzzled about lots of things if you can just get these various factors more or less sorted out theres not then big mystery about it there are certain things which you can do in certain frameworks and certain things which you are equipped to do and certain things which youre not equipped to do for instance youre not equipped to handle the insane right now you dont have still sanitarium see where theyd be totally safe but your main lineyour main line is the improvement of the being who is willing to be improved and by improving the being who is willing to be improved why then of course you will eventually get enough improved beings that further improve that your influence on the society around you is such that then you can handle those problems in the society which must be handled in order to snap the society out of being insane you got it this is the gradient its notits not in actual fact problem in making one ot thats interesting its not problem of making one ot hed have to be an awfully interested ot but all youve got to do is talk to some clears about experience theyve had with wogs to recognize how far out and beyond they arewould be as an ot now if theyre having trouble as clear and they arethereforetherefore they would have just that greater amount of trouble as an ot do you follow all right thered be nothing wrong with you as an ot fixing up the crippled boys leg as he hobbles down the street and he stands on the corner sort of stonyeyed and finds out that he doesnt need his crutches there would be nothing whatsoever wrong with your doing that if you could do it you could do it you see youre into problem endowing life you could probably reendow or you could do something there see youd only go wrong if you tried to explain to him what had happened now possibly he would come up scale to faith right away i notice magazine reporter over in canada has got clear mixed up with saint right right he thinks hes pulling gag but this isbe more and more and more and more and more see you wont be able to stop man from doing this but you can you can sort of put the brakes on it by not asking for it you see it would be possible to throw the whole society into just total frenzy theyre much more apt to go into frenzy of terror than they are to go into frenzy of worship who wants them in such frenzy anyway but if they could be lifted up by an idea of faith or belief why great but that isnt what youre lifting him up by youre lifting him up by the bootstraps of hope hope that maybe someday they could do something about it would be hope that they would come up on first hope that you could do something about it and then hope maybe they could do something about it and then they gradually lead up the line if theyre not in too bad shape to begin with to point where theytheir hope the small hopes materialize and so on you notice some people have very mad hopes they want you to audit them for an hour to ot thats so that they can go out and cut the throats of all their enemies fellow gets solution to all of his enemies by wanting to become ot instantly we all have slight impulse in this direction we read story in newspaper or something like that and we might get longing to see the newspaper building in rubble but that isnt the reason why we have to arrive at where we have to arrive at so thatstates of beingness that man will recognize do however include gods saints miracle men messiahs all kinds of beings and because man can conceive of such beingswhy you have it even in the comic strips little kids can conceive of such beings they have batman and stuff of that character yeah theyve always got superman because man can conceive of this then he tends to attribute to any forward progress the characteristics which he has formerly associated with it our present society theyd probably be the characteristics of superman and in the past society they would have been characteristics of saint in greek society would have been the characteristics of one of the gods do you see we dont much care what mans concept along this line is im just saying man is very capablevery capable of conceiving of such beings as long as theyre exterior and as long as theyre not very real he can conceive them through holy book the koran the pali canons something like this thats great but you actually could shake somebody rigid mohammedan if you said what if as you were reading that book disembodied hand reached out and turned the page and pointed to paragraph you were reading the fact of the matter is he would rather go into horror although he is professing great belief in such being and in such beings and so on his ability to confront them would be very bad indeed so what man can conceive and what man can confront are two different things and similarly what being can conceive he can become and what he can confront being actually are gap theres gap between those two things now on the upper end of the scale as you roll up through the gradation chart and ive talked enough times about the gradation chart and the various grades of release we are running into strata now which requires further definition and that is whats the difference between clear and an ot how come clear can still make an emeter read or how come he can still find out things about himself and so on all this is very interesting well clear is not an allknowing being clear is somebody who has lost the mass energy space and time connected with the thing called mind mest mind that isthat is what clear is see thats terrific see theres nothing wrong with that but there is another state now clear moves up through becoming cause over the matter energy space and time of his mind the more he drills on this why the more interesting life looks to him the bigger he feels and so forth but an operating thetan definition of is being who is knowing and willing cause over life thought matter energy space and time and it doesnt say mind thats the definition of ot willing and knowing cause over life thought matter energy space and time now that of course when you say life that includes other beings but thats why ive been talking to you about endowed cells he can handle life it isnt he can handledoesnt matter whether he can or cant handle another thetan he could be heavy cause over another thetan but that isnt the point he could handle this commodity known as life there is commodity known as life willing and knowing cause over life thought matter energy space and time and that would of course be mind and of course be universe thats pretty large order isnt it so you see theres terrific gap between clear and an ot theres big gap between these two things you want to give clear lose why go along and say why arent you doing all these ot tricks this clear must be in terrible shape because hes he has an awful stomachache well he has an awful stomachache he tried to get out of his head and he put his left thetan foot on his stomach and pushed and hes had stomachache ever since hes learning how to walk and clear now lets drop back down scale again now clear makes nottoo aberrated human being just almost fly into small bits and pieces the guythe guy becomes terrifically the effect of the clear the clear doesnt have to do thing you see he isnt trying to become the effect of anything he just has sufficient zone of beingness that what falls into that zone of beingness is liable to be asised or something like this is liable to go into action this doesnt happen to everybody it happens to minority but it can become prettypretty upsetting you getyou get some interestingyou get some interesting phenomena clear for instance in beatnik club would not be social success at all not unless they thought it was new dance theyd invented an element of fear sometimes crosses people they feelthey feel an influence around them which they dont understand theyre talking to joe and joe looks human and then they all of sudden theres something here which they do not quite understand theyre having to confront something beyond their ken which is somehow or another little bit within their ken but you normally will not find them tracing the source of it at all now it isnt bad for them quite the contrary if they sat around long enough theyd probably run out all the twitches and now you come down scale you come down scale to let us say grade iv release now grade iv release can pour enough balm on the environment and be so measurably calmer than everybody else in the environment and so measurably more effective than anybody else in the environment that he has highly you might say therapeutic or enlivening effect upon his environment you canyou canthey stand out ratherrather remarkably very remarkably but they are still little bit out of reach theyre still little bit out of reach now as you go down the release grades you get closer and closer to an ability to directly immediately understandably influence somebody else without causing mess or without upsetting them or without restimulating them or something of that sort so your bridge tends to stay in as gradient of dissemination now grade 0 release is an awful lot higher than wog theres an intermediate step thats arising these days were getting dianetic releases these days that arent grade theyre intermediate stages of course i said there were other stages of release below that i merely neglected them but this these beings when i first saw them were sufficiently distinct and different from their fellow man that their fellow man almost looked upon them as very very startling beings indeed they looked upon them with considerable awe and that was the book one clear dianetic release how high are we above the dianetic release now see hit it do you see so we havewe have actually been advancing above the most extravagant goal of psychotherapy mental treatment religious increase of beingness and so on weve beenweve been way above this for very long time we could still make today in very short space of time the original goal of betterment which was bodhi and we could make bodhi today and he probably is below dianetic release undoubtedly is below dianetic release now his duration of stability might run anything from two seconds to two minutes to two weeks to two months it might even be year or two do you see you name it now this would be quitequite startling and the ability to produce one of those after great many years of work and contemplation and meditation and concentration and whole bunch of other things was sufficient to civilize threequarters of asia just the ability to do that occasionally very occasionally make bodhi or thetan exterior as we call them unaberratednothing done to make them less aberrated nothing done to this nothing done to that see now that civilized threequarters of asia now thats below dianetic release and youre worried about newspaper story in the daily mail you see now the scientologist has in actual fact risen far out of his own understanding of the wog and rather tends to compare his state of beingness with other scientologists and sort of doesnt pay much attention at all to the wog until all of sudden hes totally surrounded by wogs and ive noticed that makes him usually rather unhappy but you get up to point you can get up to point where it does not make you unhappy at all as you begin to approach clear you would find out that the phenomena of which i was speaking of human beings becoming twitchy and itchy and rraaoundd jumpy and wandering aboutor going dopey or something like this would occur friends i had in rhodesia all of them wogs complained about it they used to complain about it you know they had various ways to describing all this they knew something happened to them in theirin my vicinity only they couldnt quite figure out what it was of course smith the sweat ran off of his palms literally dripping he was so nervous he couldnt sit naahahhaah and he knew what he was doing when he didnt want in rhodesia it was making him uncomfortable i wasnt clear at that time of course im im just giving you an idea see now you go out amongst the wogsyou go out amongst the wogs as grade release youre going to produce certain phenomena now they can still tolerate it and consider it very beneficial and that sort of thing you start moving up toward clear and that vicinity youre above their level of reactive tolerance only they tend really kind of not to spot you very closely as to whats causing this they say i have to concentrate so when youre talking you have so many big thoughts to tell what they sound like i would have been sitting there for half an hour listening to them youve got such terrific command of the situation i dont see why people dont do what you say i havent told anybody to do anything see you run into phenomena of this particular character the use of it one doesnt bother to use it one just bothers to be himself and life becomes easier mainly the main thing that happens life becomes easier but you excite certain upsets and antagonisms which you dont quite understand and so forth well perhaps from what ive told you today it might help you understand these to some degree if your landlady or the bus driver starts goingwhy maybe you realize you should not stare at their back you know now the pity of all of these states of beingness is there is limit on the amount one being can do for another one cannot live anothers life for him without being the other one can provide safe environment one can show way one can blaze trail and demonstrate and hold in place methodology one can provide for the ethical application or administration of methodologies one can give advice one can sit around and pervade the environment with calmness one might even be able to mock up new leg for crippled boy these are all great man in the past considered these things absolutely miraculous so that what im giving you right now is the understatement of the age you see because this this ishis religious textbooks are full of just this this is in all of his tests but that is the limit the rest is up to the guy and unless youve led the individual to increasing his own beingness he in actual fact will never arrive he will never become any thetan you can show him the way you can provide the environment you can make it easy for him you can be yourself expert you can do various things even as i say exude calm you can audit you can get your drills in you can do this and that but basically basically the final net result depends on the individual himself and that is the point which has been missed in all past endeavors in selfbetterment or the improvement of man or civilization that is what it boils down to they have always contained an element that if state became socialistic enough if the priests said enough prayers if there were enough joss burned on the altar some miraculous intervention would take place that would make this sows ear into silk purse the miraculous intervention has to come from the person himself that is the miraculous intervention that will get him out of the mud and the miraculous intervention will actually hand into his hands today with scientology technology immortality goal which has been mans goal for very long time not slight gift happiness power continuation continuity be impossible to say these things in the final analysis being has to be led up to point by fairly unenturbulated environment by various approaches has to be led up to point where he could destimulate enough to somehow or another reach that next rung and to overcome terrors of becoming the effect and therefore himself put his own feet on the road to his own destiny and in the absence of that he wont make it the only thing you can do is to help him somehow or another make those first steps so that he can walk in that direction but there are limits to the amount of help which he can be given and that gives you very forecastvery great forecast on really how many clears there will be or how successful clearing will be how successful the whole thing comes off how many ots will there be clear of course is immortal and knowingly so but howhowhow manyhow all well itll actually be how all to the degree that all of us provide secure environment in which people can destimulate to point where they can find there is way to walk you couldntyou ordinarily think that maybe trying to make family or your house calmer or better or make somebodys life little easier to live maybemaybe its hardly evenwas not worth doing hardly its such tiny amount but it actually just to reverse the whole scale back again that is the final effort that will let the bulk of humanity out its how calm and how decent you can make the environment in which they live thank you
