6105c07 shspec1 emeter talk and demo sop goals running assess for all the goals the pc ever had when all are out and longer give fall on the meter the list is complete when the list is complete the meter longer registers reassess the list until only one goal continues to read now list all the terminals for the goal all the terminals which would represent that goal until the meter goes flat null the list until only one terminal reads falls on the meter sop goals is the entirety of data needed to clear all cases this is unlike the situation earlier when lrh would develop regimen to handle one pcs case then develop the theory which matched it sometimes this was picked up by others and whole school of therapy was based on it for instance the dianetic tech used to handle one individual altman later became gestalt therapy the emeter is tension machine the more tense the individual the more offbeat is the read clearing is taking the tension off the meter at the lowest level of tension theres point in doing anything about anything youve got dead thetan totally incapable of influencing the machine he reads as clear but this kind of case can still be detected because the needle is tense it doesnt react favorably at all the person cannot answer to his satisfaction or yours any questions about help the needle also shows reaction to anything even kick the sensitivity has to be way up to get third of dial drop on can squeeze the guy can be machinemotivated feels he had bad luck doesnt believe anything can be done so he can get help etc hes very obvious cant do case doingness is the common denominator of the prehav scale someone who cant do isnt even on the scale the best case detector is the sensitivity knob not the ta or needle the worst case is where person is super tense but doesnt know it this guy would be long job to sec check rock slam is stronger indication than fall it shows that you are on the chain of the first time the person ever decided to be another valence the theta bop is diagnostic it has to do with leaving and death the thetan moving in and out like yoyo it can be dial wide or small it can be repetitive or even at an extreme one cycle this is not very useful returning will also give you theta bop the rise means the pc isnt confronting we used to be concerned about what stopped the rise which was what was producing it or rather the pcs nonconfront of that thing caused it stage four needle is an indicator of total noeffect case it can be very tiny it always has stick at the top of the rise unlike the theta bop the bottom of it is very relaxed it just means lousy case shape sometimes you see the needle vibrate this means that the pc has an alternating current ridge 45 means crowd if hes stuck there hes afraid of people or stuck with people stuck at 25 means robot machine theres seven on the ta dial that cant be read on the meter as person develops responsibility say hes dead thetan at 20 hell go down to 15 then go out the bottom through 7 to 65 5 4 etc to in range pc can have consistent pattern he can even repeat the same fall in this case change of characteristic is diagnostic when the pc has charged question in his level of reality you get change of pattern the meter that would be used above clear would be an oscilloscope meter an ometer or theta meter which registers flows this is not comfortable to audit with the meter has to be very sensitive someone could be clear and still have bugs because hes still using body the emeter measures the games condition called the physical universe you need something which shades the tiniest things from 200 up we have theoretically transcended mest weapons as someone goes theta clear his tolerance of motion is so great that he wouldnt be hurt by bullet he probably couldnt even be hit by it
