economic hard times increases in the dollar value of household debt have been associated with growing economy changes in consumer debt tend to be leading indicator of consumer spending and thus of

relations hip between debt nd bankruptcy see crs report rs20777 consumer bankruptcy and household debt by mark jickling and heather d negleyrising household debt context and implications introduction the financial condition of households has important implications for number of economic issues of relevance to public policy in the short run there may be concern that rising levels of household bt may mean an increase in the likelihood of slowdown in consumer spending and sluggish economy in the longer run households promote economic growth by sa ving and building wealth if instead households are accumulating debt that may have an effect on the national rate of investment in productive asse ts moreover those households that accumulate debt to finance consumption spending and not investment may find themselves ill prepared for retirement household debt is currently at historica lly high levels both in absolute terms and relative to personal income high levels of debt it is feared constitute risk that sooner rather than later cons umers must cut back their spending one review of the popular press found that most references to consumer debt referre d to its potential for negative effects on economic growth1 some economists say that may be mistaken debt in their view is not necessarily bad thing while interest payments may be burden to those who are in debt they are plus for those who hold the securities this report examines the economics of household debt2 why do households borrow households take on debt for variety of reasons and the effect debt has on the economy depends on the reason for the debt in some cases individuals borrow to acquire assets and in some cases they borrow to consume more than their current income would allow standard economic assump tion regarding household be havior is that people prefer to smooth out their consumption ove r the course of their lifetimes in other words they seek to insulate their standard of living from both shortterm fluctuationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34538crs2 3 taking on mortgage debt does however make households vulnerable to fluctuations in house prices which may affect the rate of wealth accumulationin income as well as the typical rise and fall in income that occurs over the course of their lifetimes one way they do that is to vary their saving rate saving relatively less early and late in life and saving relativ ely more during their peak earning years another way to do that is to borrow borrowing makes it possible to separate the cost of consumption from the consump tion itself households can consume more than they might otherwise and shift the cost to time when their income is higher and it is less of burden to pay not all household debt is used to fina nce consumption spending borrowing to finance the purchase of home is different in that the good is not used up repaying mortgage is way for many to accumulate wealth3 in the case of durable goods such as household furnishings or automobile s borrowing allows consumers to match stream of payments more closel to the service life of the good even households with considerable wea lth may find it advantageous to borrow instead of selling some of their assets some assets are less liquid than others that is they may take considerable amount of time to sell and there are costs associated with selling them that might make it preferable to borrow how much debt household accumulate s depends on both its willingness and ability to borrow money current income and interest rates obvi ously play role in how much debt household is willing to take on but one critical variable is difficult to measure and that is individual expect ations about future income because debt represents an obligation to make future payments future income matters at least as much as present income but there is always some uncertainty regarding an individuals economic prospects and for th at reason many may ta ke on more or less debt than they would if they had perfect foresight expectations about future prospects are also subject to change over time an increase in optimism about the future would be likely to increase the am ount of debt household would be willing to carry and an increase in pessimism would reduce it if households overestimate future inco they may end up holding more debt than they want or than they can afford in recent years some households apparently took on mortgage debt that they otherw ise might not have or that might not otherwise have been made av ailable to them in anticipa tion of continued house price appreciation the ability of households to get credit pends on their income and also on the intended use of the debt those loans that are used to finance the purchase of car or house are secured and so carry less risk to the lender those loans that are used to finance current consumption expenditu res are unsecured pose greater risk to lenders and so may have hi gher

mortgage debt when the economic contraction began in marc h 2001 household debt continued to grow as has also been the case since the late st expansion began in november 2001 this suggests that growth

1986 phased out the deductibility of interest payments on consumer loans that led to boom in home equity lending home equity loans accounted for 134 of total home mortgage debt outstanding in the second quarter of 2002 because of the change measures of consumer debt may underestimate the extent to which households are borro wing to finance current spending in the 1990s the popularity of automob ile leasing increased dramatically between 1992 and 2001 the share of househol ds leasing vehicle rose from 29 to 58 although it fell to 40 in 20047 leasing has number of advantages for one the consumer need only finance porti on of the total value of the car second the leasing company can write off the depreciation on the car and some of that benefit may be passed on to the consumer but much like consumer loan lease agreement obligates the consumer to stream of payments that it is not part of total consumer debt may cause th financial vulnerability of the household sector to be underestimated8 considerable share of credit card debt is paid off before it accrues any interest charges figures from the federal reserve boards survey of consumer finances scf show that in 2004 749

continuedfrom 554 to 557 between 2001 and 2004 that suggests that substantial share of the population uses credit cards more fo r convenience than as source of credit9 study published by the federal reserv board examined the contribution of the convenience use of credit cards to th increase in consumer debt the study estimated that in 1992 convenience use accounted for about 6 of outstanding credit card debt and that by 2001 that proportion had risen to about 11 the study also estimated that if convenience use had not increased between 1992 and 2001 growth in total credit card debt would have been one percentage point per year slower over the period10 in 2003 the four agencies that regulate th financial institutions that issue credit cards announced new guidelines regardin g minimum payments on outstanding credit card balances11 specifically the agencies expected lenders to require minimum payments for each outstanding balance sufficient to amortize the debt over reasonable period of time12 in response many credit card companies began increasing their minimum payment requirements in 200513 this development may have slowed recent growth in credit card debt another recent change may have influe nced the willingness of households to borrow the 109th congress passed bankruptcy reform pl 1098 establishing means test for those filing for bankruptcy the amount of debt relief available to filers above specified income thresholds is now restricted14 alternative debt measures measures of household debt outstanding say little about how much of burden the debt is or how

future income streamshow much income is available to cover its costs figure 2 shows household debt as percentage of disposable aftertax personal income source board of governors of the federal reserve system the ratio of debt to income is not suffi cient to determine wh or if households are carrying too much debt for their own good but changes in the ratio over time may suggest relative degrees of risk faced by households figure 2 suggests that those risks have been rising relatively rapidl since 2000 at the beginning of 2000 total household debt represented r oughly 86 of annual after ta x

serious financial consequences it is still sign of financial vulnerability selling real assets such as land can take time and i nvolves considerable transaction costs selling financial assets takes less time but it may be that they must be sold at an inopportune moment nonethel ess the more assets household has the more likely it is that it will be able or willing to take on additional debt and the less likely it is that it will default on those debts figure 3 shows the ratio of household debt to household assets this measure of assets includes both the market value of financial and tangible assets tangible assets include equity in real estate as well as consumer durable goods mainly automobiles source board of governors of the federal reserve system between 1983 and the mid1990s the

between the mid 1990s and 2000 much of that decline was attributable to the large in crease in stock prices between 1994 and 2000 total household liabilities increased by 577 over the same period total household assets increased by 669 and the ma rket value of equity held directly or indirectly by households increased by 1679 between 2000 and 2002 stock prices fell contributing to an increase in the ratio of debt to assets the stock market has since recovered but debt s continued growing more ra pidly than assets total household debt as percentage of asse ts is now around 20 which is higher than it has been over the past 25 years the willingness and ability of households to borrow is affected by their wealth but the extent to which estimates of wealth at any given time are perceived to be durable may also be an impor tant consideration in othe r words if household wealth rises because of an increase in the stock market whether households are more willing to borrow may depend on the extent to whic h stock market gains are perceived to be permanent and not the result of irrationa l exuberance phrase coined by former federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan in 1996 more recently households apparently took on more mortgage debt than they might have otherwise in anticipation of continuing appreciation in house prices income and wealth affect households w illingness nd ability to take on additional debt but there ar other important considerati ons as well the burden debt places on households finances is termined not just by the amount of the debt but also by the interest rate and the term of the loan in the case of an installment loan or conven tional mortgage the payments are fixed at the time of the loan and unless the loan is refinanced will not change over the term of the loan in the case of revolving credit or credit lin the burden of any borrowing depends on the interest rate at the time perhaps better measure of the burden of debt on households is the ratio of required payments on that debt relative to the income available to make those payments the staff of the board of governors of the federal reserve system publishes estimates of the bur den of debt service payments on households the measures are referred to as the debt service ratio and the financial obligations ratio16 the debt service ratio is measure of the minimum or required debt payments relative to income the financial obligations ratio is measure of total recurring obligations whether it be debt service or auto lease payments rent homeowners insurance and property taxes all relative to income including rent recognizes that just as changes in interest rates and the size of mortgage loans can affect homeowners liquidity changes in rent may affect the ability of renters to take on additional debt figure 4 shows the behavior of these two ratios since 1980httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34538crs9 source board of governors of the federal reserve system these measures of payments relative to income indicate that for brief period following the economic contraction of 19901991 household fina ncial obligations tended to decline relative to income they also show that since then obligations have been rising steadily as was the case with the debttoasset ratios these measures are higher now than they have b een for most of the period shown it also seems clear that most of the variations in total minimum payments relative to income have been due to changes in debt service according to the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo house prices increased by about 50 between 2001 and the first quarter of 2008 over the same period however the ratio of the value of household real estate to mortgage debt fell according to data published by the federal reserve board financial obligations ratios are availabl separately for renters and homeowners these data are shown in figure 5 the ratio for renters is significantly higher than it is for homeowners renters tend to spe nd higher share of their income on both housing and consumer debt payments between the early 1990s and 2001 the ratio for renters rose much more rapidly than the homeowner ratio one reason for that figure 4 debt service and financial obligation ratioshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34538crs10 17 ibid it may be worth noting that renters are typically younger than homeowners data from the 2000 census show that 40 of renter householders were under the age of 35 that figure for homeowners was 13 in 2006 the medi an income of renters was about half that of homeownerswas that renters incomes increased much more slowly than homeowners incomes17 since then the gap between the two groups has narrowed source board of governors of the federal reserve system

ving debt in the 1980s and 1990s was due in part to the increased number of credit cards in circulation the increase in revolving debt is also attributable to the increased use of credit cards as

federal reserve found an additional reason for rise in credit card payments relative to income18 credit scoring has become widespread and allows lenders to charge interest for consumer loans based on

increased the amount of credit they were able to afford the demographics of household debt the significance to the overall econom of given leve l of household debt varies depending on how that debt is dist ributed for example an increase in the total amount of debt might signal an incr ease in the risk of defaults or of prospective cutback in consumer spending that might lead to slowdown in economic growth but if that increase in debt is attributable to increased borrowing by relatively welloff households it might be of less concern than if it were due to increased borrowing by those households w ith fewer resources other things being equal an increase in the indebtedness of households might pose increased risks for the economic outlook but there is one level of indebte dness

invest ment fails to yield enough income or utility to offset its finance costs or that its pri ce falls below the amount borrowed to pay for ithousehold debt as an economic indicator the general concern expressed with rising levels of household debt is that at some point this will lead to reduction in consumer spending and thus initiate or magnify slowdown in the rate of econo mic growth in theory this could happen in several different ways once above gi ven level of debt any change in consumer confidence about the nearterm economic ou tlook may trigger cutback in spending and an unwillingness to take on additional debt it may also be that above certain debt levels households are more sens itive to fluctuations in interest ra tes the debt burden measur discussed above depend on the level of debt the matur ity of those debts the interest cost of the debt and household income change in any one of those variables can affect the related burden of the debt the debt burden also depends on income to the extent that income expectations are realized the debt burde n may not be problem but an unexpected drop in income or in wealth for that ma tter may raise the bt burden above what households intended and motivate them to cut back on either any additional borrowing they may have pl anned or on their spending what for borrowers is burden is income for lenders as long as borrowers are able to meet their debt obligations these pa yments are simply transfer or exchange of income what may matter more than the level of debt is the use to which the borrowed money is put borrowing may fi nance either consum ption or investment spending in the case of consumption the bo rrowing is shift of resources from the future to the present in other words claim on future income finances an increase in current consumption households that borrow to increase consumption spending can enjoy higher standard of living now than they otherwise could but will be worse off in the future if they must reduce their consumption to pay off their debt20 if household makes its debt payments on time then the shift in resources involves only that household it is consu ming more now at the expense of its own future consumption but if that household defaults on its debt then its consumption will have risen at the expens of the lenders future consumption in this case the lender may be inclined to reduce his curre nt consumption to make up for the loss in wealth in cases where household borrows to finance the purchase of durable goods such as household furnishings or an au tomobile payments on the debt usually coincide with the life of the good more or less so that rather than shifting future income to present uses payments are made as the good is consumed eg as the automobile depreciates if the good purch ased still has value after the loan is paidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34538crs15 21 there are two sources for saving data in th united states the department of commerce bureau of economic analysis publishes the na tional income and product accounts and the board of governors of the federal reserve board publishes the flow of funds accounts in the flow of fund accounts measure of savi ng automobile purchases by households are counted as investment and hence are also re flected in household saving in the national income and product accounts only business purchases of automobiles are counted as investment 22 in some cases households may not have accumulated enough equity to cover the costs of foreclosure in cases where households are at risk of foreclosure they may sell the house themselves and pay off the loan in order to avoid the additional costs associated with foreclosure 23 for the most recent saving rate data see crs report rs21480 saving rates in the united states calculation and comparison by brian w cashell 24 in the case of automobile purchases only the flow of funds measure will reflect the continuedoff then to that extent the payments actually represented saving21 if households default on this type of loan then the lender may be able to cover his losses to the extent of the remaining value of the g ood and the transfer of resources is limited in the case of borrowing to finance th purchase of home large component of the debt payments represents saving by paying off mortgage debt households acquire an asset if borro wers default on mortgage debt the lender is protected from loss by the value of the asset and the borrower may even have accumulated some equity in the house thus there is little transfer of wealth either from borrower to lender or lender to borrower as with all loan defaults however there may be significant administrative costs to the extent that the borrower has built up equity in the house there may have been shift in resources from the present to the future22 this is saving saving is defined as income less c onsumption if households borrow heavily to increase consumption spending they may ve negative saving rate in fact for the past several years the average us hous ehold saving rate has been very close to zero meaning that in the aggregate house holds are consuming nearly all of their current income in some respects the saving rate may be more meaningful economic measure than debt23 an important determinant of the long run rate of economic growth is the national rate of saving and investment the more out of current income that is saved the more there is available to invest nd add to the domestic stock of capital larger capital stock makes workers more productive and raises incomes and living standards to some extent growth of debt represents dissaving where saving is shift of current income to future uses accumulation of debt at least some of it represents shift of future income to cu rrent uses but not all household debt has that effect if households increase their borrowing to finance additional c onsumption it will be reflected as decline in the saving rate if instead they reduce their outstanding consumer loans that will be reflected as an increase in the saving rate if households increase borrowing to finance the purchase of home that will also be reflected as an increase in the saving rate24 changes in the saving rate are thushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34538crs16 24 continued increase in saving 25 see c alan garner can measures of the consumer

leading indicator of consumer spending and thus of overall economic growth one reason for this may be that increases in consumer borrowing are an indication of confidence in the economy both on the part of borrowers and lenders26
