initial goals background the us social security system the us oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi programs collectively make up the system referred to as social security the program is social insurance system whereby premiums are paid by workers to obtain coverage and benefits are intended to replace part of the earnings lost to the worker and the family when the worker retires becomes disabled or dies virtually all working men and women in the united states are covered by social security about 96 of the labor force pay payroll taxes4 social security is financed primar ily on payasyougo paygo hereafter basis in which todays workers pay for th benefits of today s retirees the primary revenue source is payroll tax paid by current workers and their employers5 when revenues exceed outgo as they do now surp luses are invested in bonds and credited to the social security trust funds managed by the treasury department financial challenges the social security system faces longterm financing problem under the intermedia assumptions of the social security trustees the system is projected to begin running cash flow deficits in the year 2017 at which point the system must begin redeeming any bonds including interest accumulated in previous years financial projections of the trustees also show that the trust funds will be exhausted in 2041 at which point 75 of scheduled annual benefits would be payabl with income revenue6 primary factor underlying social secur itys longterm financial problem is the programs paygo financing structure in co mbination with the demographics of an aging society specifically the looming retirement of the large baby boom cohort persons born between 1946 and 1964 along w ith rising longevity and low birthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34006crs3 7 paygo system of financing would be sustainable if payroll taxes collected on behalf of current workers exceed benefits paid to current beneficiaries 8 this can be referred to as the age dependency ratio or support ratio see crs report rl32981 age dependency ratios and social security solvency and crs report rl32701 the changing demographic profile of the united states both by laura b shrestha 9 another factor influencing the longterm financia l health of social security is the projected increase in the real value of social security be nefits due in large part to wageindexing rules put into effect in 1979 wages are projected to exceed price growth in the future this results in greater social security benefits for future retirees since initial

to the ratio of workers to beneficiaries which is declining in the united states8 presently there are about three covered workers for every beneficiary and according to the social curity trustees this ratio will eventually fall to less than two to one between 2010 and 2030 the number of individuals age 65 or older is projected to grow by 76 while the number of workers supporting the system is projected to grow by 69 the social security debate the longer it takes to address social securitys financing challenge the greater the changes will need to be there are however fundamentally dive rging views on reform one approach would maintain the current program structure and make re latively modest changes to restore the systems longterm solvency such as increasing the retirement age reducing the cost ofliving adjustments or raising the amount of earnings subject to the payroll tax10 second approach would change the prog rams underlying structure and create partially or fully funded system based on personal sa vings and investments in individual retirement accounts11 the debate and the chilean case as policymakers consider how to address social securitys challenges in the united states other countries experiences with retirement reforms have gained attention12 much of this attention has been directed toward countries that have adopted some sort of individual accounts program as part of their retirement system13 the case of chile the firsthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34006crs4 13 continued 921 14 crs report rs22010 social security transition costs by laura haltzel country to introduce fully funded indi vidual retirement accounts system in 1981 is often cited by bot h proponents and opponents of individual accounts policymakers who advocate introducing individual accounts in the united states have tended to point to chile as successful case adopting chileantype system some argue would put the social security system on path of sustainable solvency beyond the traditional 75year projection pe riod since fully funded system is not sensitive to changes in the number of wo rkers per beneficiary these proponents believe governmentrun paygo systems are uns ustainable in aging societies they argue that fully funded system such as chiles would reduce future demands on the government for financing the growing costs associated with an increasingly elderly population in addition advocates of individual accounts maintain that chileanstyle model would change the way americans save for retirement providing workers with sense of ownership over their retiremen t savings individual retirement accounts proponents maintain would strengthen the link between contribu tions and benefits and thus would provide more incentives for workers to save for retirement moreover american workers may earn significant returns on their contributions under an individual retirement accounts sy stem because their capital would be invested in stocks and bonds by contrast policymakers who advocate more traditional approach to reform have tended to highlight the risks of chileantype system they argue that individual accounts would expose workers to th risk of investment market volatility implementing individual retirement accounts others maintain would also erode the social insurance nature of the us system which is designed to pool risk and protect workers and their families against loss of earnings due to retirement disability or death chileantype model it is pointed out would eliminate the systems progressive benefit formula which replaces higher share of earnings for lower earners than for higher earners under an individual accounts syst em benefits would become strictly function of workers earnings and the returns achieved by their plans investments as result some workers could be worse off for reasons including poor investment decisions or downt urns in financial ma rkets some also argue that individual accounts do not necessar ily provide the annuity features of the current us system furthermore critics may cite problems facing chiles individual retirement accounts system such as coverage gaps and high administrative costs as evidence that implementing indi vidual accounts in the united states would be problematic another concern raised by opponents re lates to the transition costs from switching from paygo to fully funded system that is the cost of paying accrued obligations while funding individual accounts14 adopting chileantype funded sy stem would require todays younger workers to save for their own retirements while continuing to pay taxes to cover current retirees benefits othershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34006crs5 15 crs report rl31498 social security reform economic issues by jane gravelle and marc labonte crs report rl33544 social security reform current issues and legislation by dawn nuschler 16 studies show that democratic and authoritarian regimes have been equally as likely to implement private pension schemes albeit in varying scopes see carmelo mesalago and katharina mueller the politics of pension reform in latin america journal of latin continuedcontend that depending on the funding m echanism an individual retirement accounts system could worsen the us program s financial outlook and exacerbate current budget deficits for example diverting revenues from payroll ta xes into individual accounts such as carveout accounts w ould only reduce the systems longterm financing problem to the extent that the be nefit offset from lower benefits is greater than the diverted revenues15 chile and the united states in comparativ perspective before examining how chiles individua l retirement accounts system works it is important to note some of the ma jor demographic political and economic differences between chile and the united states basic demographics chile has relatively small population compared to the united states roughly 16 million comp ared to 300 million respectively and smaller share of persons 65 or older see table 1 both chile and the united states are projected to face population aging alt hough chile is expected to remain younger than the united states in 2025 18 of americans and 14 of chileans are projected to be age 65 years or older so note that the share of workers aged 20 64 is declining among the us population but rising in chile

privatization reforms and the united states today are very different large budget surplus eg 5 of gross domestic product gdp in 1980 helped the chilean government cover the transition costs to the new

already well established in the united states another difference between the count ries is the condition of the paygo retirement system chiles paygo system was insolvent at the time that their retirement system was overhauled in 1980 the program had ficit equivalent to 27 of gross domestic product and gene ral revenues financed roughly 28 of outgoing payments18 the us social security syst em by contrast currently has surplus 14 of gdp in 200619 and is projected to remain solvent until 2041 moreover in chile factors such as g overnment mismanageme nt high rates of contribution evasion and public distrust am ong other reasons helped set the stage for replacing their paygo system20 by contrast the us social security program is wellmanaged covers almost the entire labor force and enjoys broad public support21 the two countries differ in the size and scope of their economies chile is relatively small developing county recognized for its robust economic performance in the latin

unemployment and family allowances in addition to oldage survivors and disability insurance this crs report focuses on the retirement component of chiles social security system overview of chilean individual retirement accounts background in 1924 chile became the first latin amer ican country to establish national social insurance system with the goal of insuring against elderly poverty disability and death it was staterun payasyougo system with define d benefits primarily financed by payroll contributions from employees and employers while the program grew in size and complexity between 1924 and 1980 its basic structure remained relatively unchanged several major problems associated with chiles paygo retirement system set the stage for pension reforms in 1981 it was highly fragmented with more than three dozen different retirem ent schemes each with diffe rent eligibility requirements and contribution rates23 in 1973 for example the combined employeremployee payroll contributions ranged from 195 to 260 of wages depending on occupational type24 the system was also vulnerable to political manipulation and was widely seen as inequitable whitecollar workers tended to fare better than those on the lower end of the economic spectrum the multitude of plans and contribution rates resulted in another difficulty high administrative inefficiencies and expenses in may 1981 chile replaced its stater paygo system with private fully funded individual retir ement accounts system25 the switch had number of goals including to restore the longterm fina ncial balance of th system to provide efficiency gains in the system to reduce inequities of the old system and cover morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34006crs8 26 for detailed overview of the system s ee the superintendent

acc ount holders requiring top up benefit to provide minimum pe nsion level is projected to increase to more than 30 percent as the system matures costing the government up to 1 of gdp66 it is worthwhile to point out several strategies that helped the chilean government finance the transition costs especially during the early and most expensive years of implementation these included increasing taxes on consumption67 selling large array of stateowned enterprises borrowing from the public and tightening spending these thods helped chile build substantial budget surplus prior to the reform 55 of gdp in 1980 according to the cbo in general the chilean privatization has been quite successful in managing the transition from payasyougo to fully funded privatized retirement system68 efficiency and costs to participants chiles switch to individual retiremen t accounts was also intended to improve the efficiencies of the old system however among the current systems greatest problems are high administrative costs the extent of administrative costs has become focal point of controversy in chile because management fees reduce workers net investment over their workin g lives and hence their final pension from the individual account if administrativ costs are reduced more of workers contributions can be invested in their ias and therefore raise the accumulated capital in their individual accounts studies have shown that the cumulative impact of administrative charges on workers final capital accumulation and pension in chile may be substantial69 over time it has been estimated that administrative fees have consumed quarter 25 of the accumulations of an average chil ean worker who began contributing in 1982 and retired in 200270 administrative charges also reduce

incentive to entice plan members to their afp the system especially in the 1990s experienced high marketing costs and dramatic growth in sales pe rsonnel increased advertis ing and sales representatives also led individual participants to change afps excessively thereby increasing total operating costs72 lack of competition and market transparency may also contribute to high administrative costs from the inception of the program until present there has been concentration of assets in few afps in july 2006 two out of the six total afps controlled roughly 66 of all fund assets hi gh administrative costs and industry concentration may have resulted from governme nt regulation in the afp system eg regulation of fee structure legal barriers to entry such as startup requirements or min imum reserve fund73 furthermore many chilean workers do not to appear to be wellinformed about the fees associated with their indivi dual retirement accounts high level of knowledge about administrative charges so argue may boost competition in the afp system by encouraging more plan members to shop around for the afp with the lowest fee structure recent analysis conducted by two chilean pension experts shows that only 37 of plan members were aware of variable commissions charged by afps and hence unable to compare fees and performance and 52 did not know what percentage of their income went toward contributions into an individual retirement account74 the administrative costs reported in chile would not necessarily be replicated in other countries given the

19902001 office of the chief economist latin america and caribbe an region the world bank background paper for regional study on social security reform 2004 reasons such as interruptions in empl oyment or job seasonality nonemployment and low wages in relation to daily expenses over lifetime these trends reflect growing concern in chile that the current system does not cover the entire labor force and provides inad equate benefits to an important segment of workers according to chilean g overnments study base line projection nearly 40 of workers affiliated with an af p will accumulate enough capital to fund benefit above the minimum level 10 will qualify fo r minimum benefit top up and nearly half will reach retirement with less than th minimum pension and fewer than 20 years of contributions86 several factors help explain why par ticipation in the chilean individual retirement accounts system has not been great er the labor market in chile has high share of selfemployed workers roug hly 27 of the labor force and large informal sector the participation ra for selfemployed workers which is voluntary dropped from 12 to 7 betw een 1986 and 2003 while salaried workers rose from 63 to 7687 chilean men contribute to their accounts almost 40 more months than women who work fewer ears experience interrupted periods of employment due to child rearing and have lower lifetime earnings88 another factor may be the minimum pension guarantee which may create incentives for lower income workers to contribute just long enough to qualify for the minimum pension 20 years and soon thereafte r stop making contributions89 conclusion obtaining knowledge of other countries ex perience with reforms in their social insurance programs has gained importance in recent years as policymakers contemplate how to address social securitys longterm financial challenges it is difficult however to draw general lessons from one countrys experience as there is universal solution to reform social security systems operate differently in different countries each f aces its own unique set of political and socioeconomic conditions and has differe nt set of income support programs for the elderly moreover what is viewed as successful or desirable in one country may not be in another nevertheless in formation of reformed retirement systems around the globe can provide valuable insight to policymakers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34006crs27 90 number of comprehensive studies have gauged the systems performance to date see for example alberto arenas mesa et the chilean pension

individual retirement accounts system is mixed90 individual retirement accounts have contributed to the chilean economy in number of ways and the returns on pension fund inve stments have been greater than expected the system seems to work well for workers with stable jobs who contribute regularly to their accounts over their working lives ho wever the transition to an individual retirement accounts system has proved fiscally expensive for chile concerns remain about low participa tion rates especially among women and lowincome workers including members of the informal sector analysts also agree that administrative costs have been too high in an attempt to address these probl ems and improve the system pension reform bill was sent to the chilean cong ress for consideration in 2007 the bill aims to reduce administrative costs increase be nefits and expand cove rage to supplement the shortfalls in the existing systems safety net this development suggests that the chilean
