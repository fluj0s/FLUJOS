absence of coordi nated ways to set pr iorities and eliminate duplication and the need to use research resources effectively mechanisms have been established since then to set specific rd priorities and to coordinate interagency policy the office of homeland security ohs created by executive order 13228 does not list rd among its majo r responsibilities but rd is topic of one of the interagency

policies the major disadvantage is that these offices and groups do not have budgetary authority over any programs or agencies in order to achieve better coordination at this level the national academies stressed that omb should prepare and i ssue jointly with ostp an annual budget crosscut describing how the present and proposed budgets reflect the st priorities for countering terrorism joint letter w ould be transmitted to congress with the budget proposed the following january110 also omb according to the national academies should improve its definitions and data collection about counterterrorism rd in collaboration with the ostp regarding ombs annual report to congress on combating terrorism it concluded that the definition of research and assurance of its consistent interpretation across the agencies need more work categories like critical infrastructure protection are not distinct from c ounterterrorism so that the funding representation is not unique further refi nement of the budgeting process at all stages together with tighter coordination within the eop will help assure the coherence of agency programs and their conformity with presidential priorities omb must also work with and support ostp in coordinating agency activities and offering budget guidance it r ecommended that ombs annual report to congress on combating terrorism should include description of progress toward achieving the goals of the st agenda for countering terrorism as well as actual budget appropriations in suitable activity categories and by agency111 ostp and nstc have hi story of effective coordi nation in some functional rd program areas especially for interagency programs that have been designated as presidential initiatives or for which congress enacted legislation mandating rd coordination notably globa l climate change and information technology development thus it is possible that nstcs antiterrorism task force working groups could play an effective role in coordinating programs if the president emphasized using them ostp also has we llestablished relati onships with other federal agencies the scientific community academia and the national academies it has nongovernmental advisory body pcast and its own ffrdc to conduct policy analyses however since president bush did not name hi s ostp director as science advisor and the ostp director is not member of several core bodies in the ohs the ostp director may not have authority need ed to convince other agencies to take action relating to counterterrorism rd httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31576crs39 there is little information bout the role played in coordinating homeland security rd by the homeland secur ity councils policy coordinating committee on rd hscs pcc on rd coordination by an ohs group like this offers the advantage of linking rd prio rities directly to intelligen ce about threats and also to the presidents policies to deal with terro rism ostp is member of this pcc linkages between the pcc on rd and th nstcs antiterrorism working groups have not been described these two groups could continue to provide basis for interagency rd coordination even if hom eland security department were created since neither proposed department that is dhs nor dnhs would have the neutral and centralized rd coordina tion authority that extends throughout the government as the pcc on rd does both hr 5005 and s 2452 propose mechanisms for coordinating rd the under secretary for science and t echnology in each bill has responsib ility for coordinating rd for units within the partment however the coordination mechanism proposed in s 2452 the sc ience and technology council and the homeland security science and technology council seem s to have wider authority to coordinate and interact with rd programs and agencies outside of the proposed department in hr 5005 the res ponsibilities of the proposed coordination mechanism the homeland security scie nce and technology coordination council are more limited to coordinating rd within the proposed dhs hr 5005 contains provisions which ppear to maintain the ohs and which link formally ostp and ohs the senate bill s 2452 does not mention ohs and creates instead statutorily authorized office of combating terrorism in the white house which is to work cooperatively with the ostp director and the dnhs secretary and others in deve loping strategies and progra ms ostp has wider role in the coordination strategy prioritysetting and budgetar mechanisms established in s 2452 than in hr 5005 it remains to be determined what span of authority final version of departme nt of homeland security would have to monitor and coordinate counterterrorism rd for programs remaining outside of the department and for which it would have budgetary au thority and what kind of links should there be between homeland security department and existing interagency coordination mechanisms this question may be important because other agencies might perceive the proposed new departments rd prioritysetting and coordination activities being biased by the selfinterest of its mission interagency coordination for

as does nuclear threat assessment program and the environmental measurements laboratory eml however we are concerned that the transfer of certain doe research and development activities may complicate research currently being perform ed to accomplish multiple purposes for example some research programs such as lawrence livermore national laboratorys advanced scientific computing research progra m have broad missions such as ensuring the reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile that are not easily separated into homeland security research and research for other pur poses regarding proliferation detection research these programs have broad missions that are not easily separated into homeland security research and research for other pur poses and the proposed legislation is not clear how these missions would continue to be acco mplished furthermore we are concerned that the legislation does not clearly indicate wh ether only the programmatic management and funding would move or also the scientists ca rrying out the research moving the scientists may not be prudent this is because the research is currently conducted by multi program laboratories that employ scientists skilled in many disciplines who serve many different missions and whose research benefits from their interactions with colleagues within the laboratory perhaps dhs could contract for work to be done
