rule eg those with at least 100 million impact on the economy as result of this order oira became the central clearinghouse for covered agencies substantive rulemaking reviewing between 2000 and 3000 rules per year in 1985 president reagan expanded oiras influence further by issuing eo 12498 which required each covered agency to submit regulatory plan to omb for review each year that covered all of their significant regulatory actions underway or planned8 regulatory reviews under these executive orders were highly controversial with complaints about the lack of transparency of the review process unlimited delays in the completion of the reviews oira serving as conduit for influence by regulated parties and executive branch displacements of congressional delegations of rulemaking authority9 on september 30 1993 president clinton issued eo 12866 which revoked eo 12291 and eo 12498 and established new process for oira review of rules the order limited oiras reviews to actions identified by the rulemaking agency or oira as significant regulatory actions defined as those that were economically significant eg those with at least 100 million impact on the economy or that 1 were inconsistent or interfered with an action taken or planned by another agency 2 materially altered the budgetary impact of entitlements grants user fees or loan programs or 3 raised novel legal or policy issues as result of this change the number of rules that oira reviewed dropped from between 2000 and 3000 per year to between 500 and 700 per year for each significant draft rule the executive order requires the issuing agency to provide to oira the text of the draft rule description of why the rule is needed and general assessment of the rules costs and benefits for draft rules that are economically significant the executive order requires detailed costbenefit analysis including an assessment of the costs and benefits of potentially effective and reasonably feasible alternatives to the planned regulation eo 12866 also differs from its predecessors in other respects for example the order requires that oira generally complete its reviews of proposed and final rules within 90 calendar days it also requires both the rulemaking agencies and oira to disclose certain information about how the regulatory reviews were conducted for exampl agencies are to identify for the public 1 the substantive changes made to rules between the draft submitted to oira for review and the action subsequently announced and 2 changes made at the suggestion or recommendation of oira oira is required to among other thin gs provide agencies with copy of all communications between oira personnel and parties outside the executive branch and to maintain public log of all regulatory actions under review and of all the documents provided to the agencies finally eo 12866 required all agencies including independent regulatory agencies to prepare regulatory plan listing the most important regulatory actions that the agency expects to issue in the next fiscal year agency heads were required to approve this plan personally continued commission and the securities and exchange commission and are created by congress to be more independent of the president than other agencies eg commission members may generally be removed by the president only for cause 8 executive order 12498

important changes made to eo 12866 by eo 13422 fall into five general categories 1 requirement that agencies identify in writing the specific market failure or problem that warrants new regulation 2 requirement that every agency head designate presidential appointee within the agency as regulatory policy office r who can control upcoming rulemaking activity in that agency 3 requirement that agencies provide their best estimates of the cumulative regulatory costs and benefits of rules they expect to publish in the coming year 4 an expansion of oira review to include significant guidance documents and 5 provision permitting agencies to consider whether to use more formal rulemaking procedures in certain cases each of these changes is described more fully in the following sections

that sets the tone for agency rulemaking covered by the order the principles say that to the extent permitted by law and where applicable agencies should among other things assess alternatives to direct regulation design regulations in the most costeffective manner possible and base regulations on the best information available as originally written the first such principle was that each agency shall identify the problem that it intends to address including where applicable the failures of private markets or public institutions that warrant new agency action as well as assess the significance of that problem eo 13422 changes that language somewhat stating the following each agency shall identify in writing the specific market failure such as externalities market power lack of information or other specific problem that it intends to address including where applicable the failures of public institutions that warrant new agency action as well as assess the significance of that problem to enable assessment of whether any new regulation is warranted the new language appears to 1 elevate market failure to greater prominence as rulemaking rationale removing the where applicable caveat and placing it before and on par with the more general statement of problem identification 2 more clearly define what constitutes market failure eg externalities market power lack of information 11 3 require more precise delineation of why the agency is issuing the rule the specific market failure or the specific 10 several press accounts have suggested that eo 13422 did not take effect until july 24 2007 see for example cindy skrzycki fighting for the right to the rules washington post july 17 2007 p d2 however although some of the requirements of related omb good guidance practices bulletin took effect on july 24 2007 omb memorandum m0713 issued april 25 2007 states that the executive order took effect immediately to view copy of this memorandum see httpwwwwhitehousegovombmemorandafy2007m0713pdf 11 according to omb circular a4 an externality occurs when one partys actions impos uncompensated benefits or costs on another party environmental problems are classic case of externality for example the smoke from factory may adversely affect the health of local residents while soi ling the property in nearby neighborhoods it says firms exercise market power when they reduce output below what would be offered in competitive industry in order to obtain higher prices such as when monopoly exists inadequate information can occur when

clear that the purpose of this requirement is to facilitate determination of whether the rule is needed the general principle that covered agency describe the need for new regulation is procedurally established in section 6 of eo 12866 for rules that are significant but not economically significant eg do not have 100 million impact on the economy agencies are required only to provide reasonably detailed description of the need for the regulatory action for economically significant rules however more detailed costbenefit analyses are required omb circular a4 which describes how those studies should be done says agencies should try to explain whether the action is intended to address significant market failure or to meet some other compelling public need such as improving governmental processes or promoting intangible values such as distributional fairness or privacy 12 therefore the market failure language in eo 13422 can arguably be read to apply to all significant rules between 500 and 700 per year what had previously applied only to economically significant rules about 70 per year also although the order requires agencies to make this determination in writing eo 13422 does not indicate where this written determination should appear eg in the federal register notice for the proposed or final rule or additionally whether it should be made available to the public in the rulemaking docket conceivably therefore agencies could satisfy the requirements of the order by preparing written determination of the need for rule without providing it to anyone outside government some commentators have criticized this provision in eo 13422 as an attempt to bypass congress by establishing standards for regulatory initiation that are not consistent with statutory requirements one such commentator public citizen said the requirement diminishes standards congress may have required agencies to use such as the best control technology by elevating new market failure standard that congress never required 13 for example some statutes eg the clean air act require agencies to establish regulations based solely on what is required to protect human health critics of the executive order contend that requiring agencies to identify specific market failure or specific problem constitutes new standard for regulatory initiation supporters of this provision contend however that market failure is not the only basis on which regulatory agencies can justify action and that the executive order did not eliminate the requirement in eo 12866 that directs agencies to issue such regulations as are required by law or are necessary to interpret the law 14 public citizen has also criticized this provision as yet another layer added to the agency analysis that places yet another hurdle for agencies to issue regulations in pursuit of protecting the public similarly gary bass executive director of omb watch said that president bush by requiring agencies to show market failure has created another hurdle for agencies to clear before they can issue rules protecting public health and safety 15 on the other hand supporters of 12 to view copy of this circular see

specific problem being addressed in regulation is not onerous and can help ensure the effectiveness of the resultant rules16 finally although stated in terms of requirement each agency shall this and other principles of regulation in the executive order are preceded by more permissive language stating that agencies should adhere to the principles to the extent permitted by law and where applicable given this language concerns about the usurpation of congressional standards for rulemaking and unnecessary delay may be exaggerated ultimately though the extent to which these changes are significant may be revealed only through how they are implemented by oira and the agencies

as originally written eo 12866 required the head of each covered agency other than independent regulatory agencies to designate regulatory policy officer rpo who reported to the agency head 17 the rpo is required to be involved at each stage of the regulatory process to foster the development of effective innovative and least burdensome regulations and to further the principles set forth in this executive order according to agency officials these rpos were commonly agency general counsels which are usually presidential appointees with senate confirmation or some other presidential appointee within the agencies eo 13422 retained the above general statement of the rpos duties but also required each agency head to designate one of the agencys pres idential appointees to be that officer to do so within 60 days of the date of the executive order ie by march 19 2007 to advise omb of the designation and to annually update omb on the stat us of this designation although the agency head is still permitted within the parameters of white house and omb control to select the individual for this position the requirement that the individual be presidential appointee limits the agency heads discretion compared to the unlimited authority that agency heads enjoyed before this amendment and strengthens the relationship of the agency policy officers with the president because most of the rpos were already presidential appointees it is not clear how this requirement will affect the regulatory process if agencies are permitted to continue with the same officers they have always had then the effect may be minimal on the other hand if agency heads are required to designate new presidential appointees to serve in this capacity then the effect may be more significant the new executive order also appeared to change the rpos reporting relationship as originally issued eo 12866 required the policy officers to report to the agency heads who designated them but eo 13422 eliminated this requirement although it was initially unclear to whom these presidential appointees would report ombs april 2007 guidance on the order states that they should continue to report to the agency heads 18

available at httpjudiciaryhousegovmediapdfsnoe070213pdf 17 although the regulatory planning sections apply more broadly the executive order generally defines an agency as any authority of the united states that is an agency under 44 usc 3502 1 other than those considered to be independent regulatory agencies as defined in 44 usc 3502 10 the order does not define agency head but agency policy officers in cabinet departments have typically been designated by the secretary 18 see omb memorandum m0713 p 11

agency rpo as part of the regulatory planning process the order states that unless specifically authorized by the head of the agency rulemaking shall commence nor be included on the plan without the approval of the agencys regulatory policy office19 this change appears to represent an elevation in the duties and responsibilities of the agency policy officer when compared to the role previously ascribed to that officer ie to be involv ed in the regulatory process to foster the development of sound rules and to further the orders principles unless specifically authorized by the agency head the presidential policy officer must approve the listing of all significant forthcoming regulatory actions in the regulatory plan and approve the initiation of all rulemaking actions previously only the agency head could approve the regulatory plan and there was language in the order prohibiting rulemaking in the absence of the rpos approval as characterized in the new york times the white house will thus have gatekeeper in each agency to analyze the costs and the benefits of new rules and to make sure the agencies carry out the presidents priorities 20 the executive orders use of the word designate suggests that agency heads must select rpos from among current presidential appointees with in the agencies neither the president nor agency heads are authorized to create presidential appointee positions only congress can do so the order is silent as to whether the designated presidential appointee would be subject to senate confirmation senate confirmation of presidential appointees is generally considered way to strengthen congressional influence over agency decision making because among other things nominees often agree during the confirmation process to appear subsequently before relevant congressional committees according to the most recent listing of policy and supporting positions known as the plum book most major regulatory departments and agencies have few and in some cases presidential appointees who are not senate confirmed 21 therefore in most cases agency heads must select presidential appointees who are subject to senate confirmation22 even in agencies with presidential appointees who are not subject to senate confirmation one could argue that it is up to congress to decide whether the position of rpo should be occupied by an appointee who is senate confirmed the supreme court has held that any appointee 19 notably eo 13422 speaks in terms of regulatory policy office as opposed to regulatory policy officer suggesting that agencies may provide staff to assist the policy officers in their duties within the agencies however the acting oira administrator has said that office was typographical error and should have said officer 20 robert pear bush directive increases sway on regulation newspaper editorial writers have offered various opinions regarding this issue for example see david mcnaughton reverse regulation with another nonsense order president bush quashes legitimate ru lemaking by inserting political overseer the atlanta journal constitution february 2 2007 p a10 which cited emory university law professor william buzbee as saying that this provision makes it even more likely that regulatory decisions will be made by someone more sympathetic to political pressure and ideology than to the federal agencys legal duty also see jim wooten vouchers transit alert sen obama the atlanta journalconstitution february 2 2007 p a11 which approved of this provision and said theres nothing radical about applying costbenefit analysis to proposed laws and regulations 21 us congress house committee on government reform united states government policy and supporting positions november 22 2004 for example the department of transportation had 32 positio ns subject to presidential appointment with senate confirmation pas positions in 2004 but none without senate confirmation pa positions the environmental

had six pa positions 22 at february 13 2007 hearing on eo 13422 the acting oira administrator confirmed that most rpos are senateconfirmed presidential appointees for copy of his testimony see

united states is an officer of the united states and must therefore be appointed in the manner prescribed in the constitution23 given the enhanced power and authority of the policy officer to control daytoday rulemaking activities within federal agencies rulemaking shall commence the policy officer could be considered an officer of the united states under the appointments clause of the constitution article ii section 2 clause 2 of the constitution states the following the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors other public ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law but the congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone in the courts of law or in the heads of departments therefore one could argue that it is the role of congress to prescribe in law whether the rpo position should be subject to senate confirmation in fact to take this argument further even if the agency head designated person in senateconfirmed position for this new position one could argue that this person would have to undergo another confirmation process because the scope of the persons responsibilities had been changed significantly one other element of this process is also unclear and may represent change in the scope of presidential influence in rulemaking as noted previously the requirement that each agency head appoint one of the agencys presidential appointees as the rpo does not apply to independent regulatory agencies however eo 12866 requires independent regulatory agencies to develop regulatory plans and the requirement in eo 13422 that the regulatory policy office approve items included in the plan and the commencement of all rulemaking amends that section of eo 12866 therefore this provision could arguably be read to require that independent regulatory agencies have presidential appointees as rpos which would extend the reach of the president and presidential review into agencies that had not previously been subject to such scrutiny and commensurately lessening the agencies relationships with congress which created them in guidance on the implementation of eo 13422 omb said independent regulatory agencies were encouraged but not required to designate rpos to meet the regulatory planning requirements24 g6g142g156g146g144g151g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g20g18g17g156g561 as noted previously agencies were required to designate their rpos under the executive order by march 2007 in july 2007 omb published list of the designated rpos in 29 cabinet departments and agencies25 however because omb did not have list of the rpos before the executive order was published this listing does not indicate how many rpo changes were made through this designation process all but two of the 29 rpos that omb listed were presidential appointees requiring senate confirmation26 many of the designees were general counsels deputy secretaries or assistant secretaries but in some cases the agency heads designated themselves eg at the general services administration and the office of personnel management bureau 23 buckley v valeo 424 us 1 126 1976 24 see omb memorandum m0713 p 11 25 the omb list can be found at httpwwwwhitehousego vombinforegregpolagency_reg_policy_officerspdf 26 the two agencies with rpos who were not in senatec onfirmed positions were at the united states access

backgrounds but some had previously been employed at omb or in regulated industries for example the article said that the rpos at the environmental protection agency epa and the department of agriculture usda both served in highlevel positions at omb while th rpo at the department of transportation dot previously worked with koch industries leading operator of oil pipelines which has been prosecuted for environmental violations27

as part of the abovementioned regulatory planning process agencies have been required to provide summary of each planned significant regulatory action including to the extent possible alternatives to be considered and preliminary estimates of the anticipated costs and benefits eo 13422 adds to this provision the requirement that each agency provide its best estimate of the combined aggregate costs and benefits of all its regulations planned for that calendar year to assist with the identification of priorities at first impression the changes established by this provision appear relatively straightforward simply requiring agencies to tally up the costs and benefits of the individual rules listed in the regulatory plan however upon closer examination some aspects of this provision appear unclear for example the regulatory plans that agencies develop are supposed to be published at the start of each fiscal year in october and are required to reflect the most significant proposed and final rules that they expect to publish in that fiscal year or thereafter therefore the requirement in eo 13422 that agencies develop estimates of aggregate costs and benefits for regulations planned for that calendar year seems inconsistent with the previous focus on fiscal years more substantively some critics of the order have suggested that this provision is intended to elevate the role of costbenefit analysis in the development of regulatory priorities they argue that costbenefit analysis is inherently biased ag ainst regulation particularly with regard to such issues as global warming and longterm exposure to carcinogens so the effect of this provision would be to reduce regulatory activity 28 other critics have said this provision is prelude to the development of regulatory budget in which the costs associated with an agencys rules could be capped and new rules could be issued unless other costs were reduced or eliminated 29 proponents of this provision on the other hand may argue that such aggregate estimates are needed to reveal the cumulative impacts of rulemaking individually regulations on particular industry may not be significant but the aggrega tion of the impact of multiple rules may reveal cumulative effects that are not otherwise apparent also agencies regulatory plans are published as part of the unified agenda of federal regulatory and deregulatory actions and contain information about the most significant regulatory actions that agencies expect to undertake in the coming year30 the listed items include 27 ralph lindeman mix of backgrounds

during that period for forthcoming proposed rules agencies often have not developed cost or benefit estimates because the specifics of the proposed rules have often not been developed even for forthcoming final rules agencies frequently provide only general narrative information about expected costs or benefits also some items that are listed in agencies regulatory plans are never issued as final rules and some significant agency rules never appear in agencies regulatory plans therefore the requirement in the executive order that agencies provide aggregate cost and benefit information may prove difficult to implement in meaningful fashion on the other hand as noted previously agencies are only required to develop rulespecific and aggregate estimates of costs and benefits to the extent possible it is unclear whether the agencies or oira will ultimately determine what is possible

provision in eo 13422 has been the expansion of oira review from agencies draft regulations to also include significant agency guidance documents 31 specifically the new executive order adds the following to eo 12866 each agency shall provide oira at such times and in the manner specified by the administrator of oira with advance notification of any significant guidance documents each agency shall take such steps as are necessary for its regulatory policy officer to ensure the agencys compliance with the requirements of this section upon the request of the administrator for each matter identified as or determined by the administrator to be significant guidance document the issuing agency shall provide to oira the content of the draft guidance document together with brief explanation of the need for the guidance document and how it will meet that need the oira administrator shall notify the agency when additional consultation will be required before the issuance of the significant guidance document eo 13422 defines guidance document as an agency statement of general applicability and future effect other than regulatory action that sets forth policy on statutory regulatory or technical issue or an interpretation of statutory or regulatory issue it says significant guidance document is one that is disseminated to regulated entities or the general public that for purposes of this order may reasonably be anticipated to lead to an annual effect of 100 million or more or adversely affect in material way the economy sector of the economy productivity competition jobs the environment public health or safety or state local or tribal governments or communities continued getdoccgidbname2006_unified_agenda_docidfua061002pdf 31 on the same day that eo 13422 was issued omb also issued final bulletin for agency good guidance practices that mirrored in many respects the provisions in this section of the executive order unlike the order however the bulletin requires agencies to include certain standard elements in their significant guidance documents to list those documents on the agencies websites and to publish notice in the federal register soliciting public

action taken or planned by another agency c materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements grants user fees or loan programs or the rights or obligations of recipients thereof or d raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates the presidents priorities or the principles set forth in this executive order these categories are essentially the same as those used in eo 12866 to define significant rules the only difference being the use of the prefatory phrase may reasonably be anticipated to instead of is likely to result in rule that may the implications of these amendments to the scope of presidential review of agency actions are potentially significant agencies issue thousands of guidance documents each year that are intended to clarify the requirements in related statutes and regulations32 therefore the requirement that agencies provide oira with advance notification of significant guidance documents may represent major expansion of the offices and therefore the presidents influence particularly when coupled with the ability of oira to determine which guidance documents are significant and the ability of oira to conclude that additional consultation will be required before document is issued also the requirement that presidentially appointed rpos ensure compliance with this requirement arguably represents another extension of the presidents authority in regulatory agencies as is the case with other aspects of eo 13422 though several aspects of these provisions are unclear for example although the order refers to guidance documents the definition of the term is not limited to written materials in related omb bulletin on agency guidance that was issued the same day as the executive order amendments omb said that the bulletins definition of guidance document which is the same as in the executive order is not limited only to written guidance materials and should not be so construed omb recognizes that agencies are experimenting with offering guidance in new and innovative formats such as video or audio tapes or interactive webbased software the definition of guidance document encompasses all guidance materials regardless of format 33 therefore wide range of agency communications with the publiceven oral statements by agency officials and staffmay be considered guidance documents as long as they are statements of general applicability and future effect however given the definition provided in the executive order it is unclear what could constitute significant guidance document guidance documents unlike regulations cannot have binding effect on the public 34 therefore it is not clear how guidance can be expected to have the 32 for example the occupational safety and health administration indicated in 2000 that it had issued 3374 guidance documents since march 1996 see us congress house committee on government reform nonbinding legal effect of agency guidance documents 106th cong 2nd

effect of 100 million or more or materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements or grants arguably because guidance document can by itself have such an effect th requirement that agencies provide oira with advance notification of any significant guidance documents could have little or impact on regulatory agencies on the other hand omb has said that there are situations in which it may reasonably be anticipated that guidance document could lead parties to alter their conduct in manner that would have such an economically significant impact 35 ultimately because oira is given the authority to determine which documents are significant the scope and impact of this sections requirements may be as broad as oira determines that it needs to be also unclear is the extent to which certain transparency provisions in eo 12866 will apply to guidance documents that are submitted to oira for review for example will agencies be required to disclose the changes to their significant guidance documents made at the suggestion and recommendation of oira just as they are with regard to rules will oira be required to list publicly the significant guidance documents that are under its review and to disclose its meetings with outside entities regarding those documents because eo 13422 did not change those sections of eo 12866 it is reasonable to presume that the transparency provisions applicable to rules are not applicable to agencies significant guidance documents supporters of the expansion of presidential review to significant guidance documents have said the change will standardize and make more transparent the process by which federal agencies develop issue and use guidance documents 36 critics contend that the potentially broad scope of this provision may result in fewer guidance documents being issued with the policy officer or oira review serving as bureaucratic bottleneck that would slow down agencies ability to give the public information it needs37 another possible effect of this requirement given the number of guidance documents that agencies currently issue is that oira staff may be inundated with such documents to review on top of the hundreds of significant proposed and final rules and the thousands of paperwork clearances they produce each yearat least until it is clear to the agencies what is and is not covered

following sentence in consultation with oira each agency may also consider whether to utilize formal rulemaking procedures under 5 usc 556 and 557 for the resolution of complex determinations virtually all agency regulations are currently issued under informal rulemaking procedures under 5 usc 553 in which agencies publish proposed rules in the federal register for public comment and subsequently publish final rule reflecting any changes made as result of those comments formal rulemaking as the name implies is much more rigorous triallike ontherecord procedure in which interested

has the burden of proof formal rulemaking was criticized in the 1970s and has fallen into disuse since then38 the administrative conference of the united states recommended that congress should not require procedures beyond informal rulemaking and should never require trialtype procedures for resolving questions of policy or fact39 one administrative law scholar has referred to formal rulemaking as discredited procedure that allows regulated entities to slow down the rulemaking process40 the executive order does not indicate and oira has not explained why this provision was added to eo 12866 agencies have always had the ability to employ formal rulemaking when they conclude that it is in the agencies best interest to do so therefore the statement that agencies may also consider whether to utilize formal rulemaking procedures seems to grant discretion where discretion was already allowed on the other hand an agencys consultation with oira may result in greater use of formal rulemaking if oira can convince the agency that it is in their best interest to do so if that occurs agency rulemaking could become even more ossified than it already is 41

that will be brought up today have less to do with their policy implications and more to do with who issued them and said he believed the executive order and the related omb guidance bulletin simply formalize many of the principles established in previous administrations emphasis in original three of the four witnesses at the hearing noted areas of concern about the new executive order sally katzen professor of law oira administrator during the clinton administration and one of the original authors of eo 12866 noted three areas of concern about eo 13422 1 its issuance without any consultation or explanation 2 its issuance on the heels of ombs imposing multiple mandatesrequirements on the agencies when they are developing regulations and 3 its effect of making it more difficult for agencies to do their jobs because regulations are disfavored in this administration45 david c vladeck associate professor of law and director of the institute for public representation at the georgetown university law center said the new order 1 usurps congressional authority by directing agencies to justify regulatory actions on the basis of market failure 2 unwisely expands oiras authority to guidance 3 resurrects the discredited concept of regulatory budget and 4 further politicizes the regulatory process through the new rpo designation process 46 rick melberth director of federal regulatory policy at omb watch recommended that congress 1 explore the legality of the executive order amendments and their implementation 2 oversee the issuance of oira guidance on the market failure principle and 3 look at limiting agencies and oiras spending on the specific elements of the amendments47 the fourth hearing witness however welcomed the issuance of eo 13422 william l kovacs vice president of the us chamber of commerce said the order was far from being radical and merely instructs federal agencies to 1 state the reason for the regulation 2 identify the aggregate cost of the regulation to assist the identification of agency priorities and 3 have an agency rpo ensure that these requirements have been followed he also said the order corrects the abuse of guidance documents by federal agencies seeking to avoid public participation in the rulemaking process and that the order and the omb guidance bulletin are part of long effort by congress and several administrations to improve the transparency and quality of government data and provide effective parameters to guide the regulatory activities of federal agencies 48 45 for copy of ms katzens written

the commercial and administ rative law subcommittee hearing in february 2007 chairman linda t sanchez said she was concerned that the main thrust of this new order appears to shift control of the regulatory process from the agenciesthe entities that have the most substantive knowledge and experienceto the white house on the other hand ranking member chris cannon said the changes were useful refinements to the existing regulatory review process and could be expected to lead to improved governance the first witness was steven d aitken then ac ting administrator of oira who said both the new executive order and the omb guidance bulletin share the goal of improving the way that the federal government does business the bulk of his testimony focused on the guidance provisions there he said that only some agency guidance documents would be subject to interagency review and that many agencies may already be doing what the order requires mr aitken also said that 1 rpos in many federal agencies were already presidential appointees and that by requiring the designation of presidential appointees for this position the president was ensuring that in most cases the initiation of rulemaking would be authorized by individuals in senateconfirmed positions 2 the requirement that agencies aggregate the costs and benefits of their upcoming rules shifts the burden of summ ing up rules from the public to the agencies and 3 the concept of market failure has always been part of eo 12866 is not the only basis on which agencies can justify their regulations and does not affect other statutory provisions that may prompt the issuance of rule 49 one other witness at the hearingpaul noe of cm capitolink llc and former counselor to former oira administrator john grahamindicate d that eo 13422 comprised important and salutary steps toward good governance and did not represent threat to federal rulemaking for example he said the provisions in the order involving rpos only codifies prior practice in both the bush and clinton administrations and he characterized the requirement for aggregate cost and benefit estimates as sensible toting up of already required information 50 two other witnesses at this hearing were less sanguine about the effects of the executive order sally katzen repeated the concerns that she voiced at the earlier hearing and concluded by saying that the message of the executive order is that agencies should not be doing the job that congress has delegated to them 51 another witness peter strauss of columbia law school said that the rpo provisions in the executive order threatens dramatic increase in presidential control over regulatory outcomes to an extent congress has not authorized and in my judgement must authorize he also said that the provisions regarding formal rulemaking threatens redeployment of discredited remarkably expensive rulemaking procedure that delivers substantial controls over the timing and cost of rulemaking into the hands of private parties notably i fear those whose dangerous activities proposed regulations are intended to limit professor strauss noting that the president could veto any freestanding legislation designed to undo the executive order suggested that do not spend rider on an appropriations bill was more likely to be effective in preventing the order from taking effect 52

oversight subcommittee hearing in april 2007 steven d aitken by then former acting administrator of oira testified that many of the requirements in eo 13422 were not new and were sometimes misunderstood for example he said that the order did not require agencies to submit all significant guidance documents to oira for review but only to inform oira of upcoming documents so that there could be an opportunity for review he also said that agency rpos would continue to report to agency heads even though the requirement in eo 12866 had been deleted however chairman miller said that the rpo provisions in the order were especially troubling and that given their new authority rpos could smother regulatory efforts in the crib before an agency can even begin considering regulatory action53 he also asked mr aitken to describe how the executive order was developed but mr aitken declined to do so citing deliberative process privilege within the executive branch other witnesses at the hearing offered differing perspectives on the executive order for example robert w hahn and robert litan of the aeibrookings joint center for regulatory studies generally supported the issuance of eo 13422 although they agreed with critics that the designation of presidentially appointed rpos would politicize the rulemaking process by taking away some discretion from civil servants they characterized that result as good thing that would make the president more accountable for regulatory policies their one complaint about the order was that it did not go far enough excluding independent regulatory agencies from its requirements on the other hand gary bass from omb watch said the executive order threatens public protections by further centralizing executive control over the regulatory process removing agency discretion over legislative implementation codifies regulatory delay and substitutes free market criteria for public values of health safety and environmental protections he urged congress to overturn the order or limit its implementation

the financial services and general government fsgg appropriations act 2008 which funds omb among other agencies representative brad miller and representative linda sanchez offered general provision amendment stating that none of the funds made available by this act may be used to implement executive order 13422 in introducing the amendment mr miller said the executive order claims powers for the president over agency rulemaking that is sic consistent neither with statutes passed by congress nor with the c onstitution he also said that the order lets political appointees overrule the professionals at each agency in secret with accountability to anyone representative jose serrano said he supported the amendment saying that representative miller had raised some very serious issues that need addressing representative ralph regula said he opposed the amendment saying it needed additional study but did not call for recorded vote the amendment was agreed to as section 901 of hr 2829 as passed by the house if this provision were part of the fi nal fsgg appropriations act neither omb nor any other agency funded by the act could use its fy2008 appropriations to implement the order however this provision would not affect agencies that are funded by other appropriations acts in the wake of this action on july 12 2007 the director of omb sent letter to the chairmen and ranking members of the house and senate appropriations committees stating that if the president were presented with bill that contained restriction on the implementation of executive order 13422 the presidents senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill the director urged the rejection of any provis ion that would interfere in any way with the implementation of the executive order because it involves matter that directly affects the operation of omb and involves the presidents authority to manage the executive branch that same day group of 64 trade organizations covering range of industries reportedly organized by the us chamber of commerce sent letter to the chairman and ranking member of the senate committee on appropriations urging them to oppose any language in the fsgg appropriations bill that would bar funding for eo 13422 56 the letter characterized the executive order as good government measure and said the requirements are merely an attempt to instill principles of accountability and transparency into the regulatory process57 as reported by the senate subcommittee on financial services the fsgg appropriations bill contained provision stating that funds in the measure could be used to implement either eo 13422 or the omb bulletin on guidance documents however one of the managers package amendments to the legislation that was adopted when the bill was reported by the full senate appropriations committee on july 12 2007 deleted this provision from the legislation aides to senator richard durbin were quoted as saying that the senator would attempt to reinstate the house language inhibiting the implementation of the executive order when the bill was considered in conference 58 however the fsgg appropriations bill was later folded into the

crises such as ecoli outbreaks on fresh vegetables61 one member of congress was quoted as saying that the order allows the political staff at the white house to dictate decisions on health and safety issues even if the governments own impartial experts disagree this is terrible way to govern but great news for special interests62 although observers have taken very different positions on the desirability of the changes made by eo 13422 several things about the order are not clear first it is unclear why the changes to the existing regulatory review process were made notably although eo 13422 requires agencies to provide written rationales for why they are issuin g regulations such rationale was offered in conjunction with this or any of the other new requirements in the order for example it is unclear what market failure or other specific problem led to the issuance of the requirements that agencies have rpos who are presidential appointees or that agencies submit significant guidance documents to oira for review although the acting oira administrator indicated that the executive orders guidance provisions were intended to reinforce the omb guidance bulletin and improve the quality of agency guidance documents through interagency review he did not describe any recent instances of poor quality guidance that led to this provision in the order also his comments indicating that other parts of the executive order were consistent with existing practices eg provisions regarding market failure and formal rulemaking raise questions regarding why changes to the executive order were believed necessary neither the president nor omb is required to explain why executive orders are issued or why existing oira review processes are changed and sound public policy rationales can be envisioned concerning why the changes were made providing those rationales might have gone long way toward quieting some of the concerns that have been voiced regarding the changes also unclear is the effect of the changes made by eo 13422 on federal rulemaking agencies the rules that emerge from the rulemaking process and on the transparency of that process to the public in some cases that lack of clarity is because of the discretion given to agencies and oira in the review process eg that agencies take certain actions to the extent possible or where applicable in other cases the effects are unclear because the order does not appear to change 59 for more on this legislation see crs report rl34298 consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 brief overview by robert

rulemaking in still other cases the new requirements seem to be based on false presumptions eg that agencies regulatory plans contain estimates of costs and benefits that can be aggregated or seem to have an indefinite scope eg what qualifies as guidance document or significant guidance document ultimately the degree to which eo 13422 changes existing practices will likely depend on how the order is implemented by oira and the agencies will for example oira insist that agencies identify specific market failure before issuing proposed or final rules or will that provision be interpreted more broadly to require simply clear statement of the rules intentions will agency heads continue to have discretion in the appointment of rpos albeit less than before since they must now select from current presidential appointees or will the white house direct the agency heads in those appointments will these policy office rs continue to report to the agency heads as omb says they should or will they now report to the white house or omb will the requirement that agencies provide estimates of aggregate costs and benefits be used as prelude to greater control and the development of regulatory budgets or will such estimates be relatively easy to develop and reveal cumulative effects that have heretofore been hidden will the requirement that oira be notified of forthcom ing significant agency guidance documents prove to be major expansion of presidential influence over regulatory agencies or will significant guidance document as defined in the order be contradiction in terms resulting in virtually such documents being covered by the orders requirements and finally will oira require agencies to enter into more formal rulemaking procedures or will agencies continue to have the discretion to use such procedures only in rare circumstances third it is unclear what impact the changes brought about by eo 13422 will have on the balance of power between the president and congre ss in this area congress has vested interest in the regulations that emerge from the rulemaking process having created each regulatory agency confirmed agency heads and enacted the legislation underpinning each proposed and final rule therefore presidentially initiated changes that may affect these congressional directives eg the requirement that each agency identify specific market failure or problem before issuing rule are naturally of potential interest to congress another area of the executive order that may affect presidentialcongressional balance of power involves the rpos particularly their new authority to control regulatory planning and output unless the agency head objects the fact that the order longer requires them to report to the agency head and the lack of clarity as to whether they must be reconfirmed by the senate because of their new authorities finally ombs statements notwithstanding it is unclear whether the executive order intended to require that independent regulatory agencies have presidential appointees as rpos doing so would extend the reach of the president and presidential review into agencies that had not previously been subject to such scrutiny and commensurately lessening the agencies relationships with congress which created them to be more independent of the president these three areas of uncertainty notwithstanding the issuance of these amendments to eo 12866 are important if for other reason than that the president deemed them necessary the changes made by eo 13422particularly the expansion of oira review to guidance documents and the requirement that rpos be presidential appointees with enhanced powerrepresent clear expansion of presidential authority over rulemaking agencies in that regard the executive order can be viewed as part of broader statement of presidential authority presented throughout the bush administrationfrom declining to provide access to executive branch documents and information to presidential signing statements indi cating that certain statutory provisions will be

executive63 in fact in his february 2007 testimony on the order the acting oira administrator cited the basic need of the president and his white house staff to monitor the consistency of executive agency regulations with administration policy as justification for th extension of oira review to agency guidance documents also in his july 2007 letter conveying the administrations objections to legislation restricting the implementation of the executive order the omb director said he was doing so because the legislation involves the presidents authority to manage the executive branch cornelius m kerwin author of the textbook rulemaking how government agencies write law and make policy 64 was quoted as saying that this dispute between congress and the president over eo 13422 appears to be classic example of an interbranch conflict65 similarly cindy skrzycki the author of the regulators 66 said the bush administration and the democratic controlled congress are fighting over who will have the most influence over writing rules on health and safety issues while the dispute is not as dramatic as the ones over fired prosecutors and wartime surveillance the stakes are
